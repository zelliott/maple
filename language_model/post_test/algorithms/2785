Although research has been addressed at investigating the effect of specific loading regimes on bone response around the zzso a precise quantitative understanding of the local mechanical response close to the implant site is still zzso This study was aimed at zzso zzso finite element zzso models to assess tissue strains after implant placement in a rat zzso Small implants were inserted at the zzso site of 8 rat zzso The limbs were subjected to zzso zzso zzso strain close to the implant was measured by means of strain zzso zzso zzso models were created and zzso For each zzso 4 different models were created corresponding to different representations of the zzso zzso bone and implant were assumed fully zzso zzso a low zzso interface zone was assumed with thickness of 40 zzso zzso 80 zzso zzso and 160 zzso zzso In all cases, measured and zzso strains correlated highly (R zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in A, B, C, and D, zzso The averaged calculated strains were zzso zzso and zzso times higher than the measured strains for A, B, and C, respectively, and lower than the experimental strains for D zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, we demonstrated that zzso zzso analyses provide accurate estimates of zzso bone strains in the rat zzso loading zzso Further investigations of the zzso interface are needed to zzso implant zzso
