zzso and cellular evidence argues that a zzso between two ABC zzso the White protein and the Brown zzso is responsible for pumping zzso into zzso cells of the fruit fly, zzso zzso Previous studies have not detected White or Brown outside zzso cells nor have behavioral effects of zzso zzso been reported, other than those that are visually zzso Nevertheless, we show here that exposure to the volatile general zzso zzso zzso reveals a difference in zzso performance between zzso flies and those that carry a zzso zzso in either the white or brown zzso Specifically, in a test of climbing ability, zzso or zzso flies are much less affected by zzso than are zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity is still observed when visual cues are reduced or zzso arguing that white and brown contribute to neural function outside the zzso This hypothesis is supported by the detection of white message in heads of flies that are genetically altered so as to lack zzso zzso The zzso or zzso zzso also alter the response to a second zzso zzso albeit somewhat zzso Under some conditions, the combination of zzso with another zzso that affects zzso leads to a drastically altered zzso We consider several ways by which diminished transport of zzso could influence neural function and zzso zzso
