zzso the native structure of a protein zzso from its sequence of zzso zzso a problem known as de zzso structure zzso is a long standing challenge in zzso structural zzso zzso in zzso arise due to the high zzso of the protein zzso space and the zzso of the associated energy zzso The issue of multiple zzso is a particularly troublesome hallmark of energy surfaces zzso with current energy zzso In contrast to the true energy surface, these surfaces are zzso and rich in comparably deep zzso populated by non-native zzso For this reason, many zzso seek to be inclusive and obtain a broad view of the low-energy regions through an ensemble of low-energy zzso zzso zzso diversity in this ensemble is key to increasing the likelihood that the native structure has been zzso 

We propose an evolutionary search approach to address the zzso problem in decoy sampling for de zzso structure zzso Two zzso evolutionary search zzso are presented that follow the basic approach of treating zzso as individuals in an evolving zzso zzso zzso and molecular zzso replacement are used to efficiently obtain zzso child zzso from zzso Potential energy is used both to bias parent selection and determine which subset of parents and children will be retained in the evolving zzso The effect on the decoy ensemble of sampling zzso directly is measured by additionally mapping a zzso to its nearest local minimum before considering it for zzso The resulting zzso zzso thus zzso not just a population of zzso but a population of local zzso 

zzso show that both zzso are effective in terms of sampling zzso in proximity of the known native zzso The additional zzso is shown to be key to enhancing sampling capability and obtaining a diverse ensemble of decoy zzso zzso premature convergence to zzso regions in the zzso space, and approaching the native structure with proximity that is comparable to state-of-the-art decoy sampling zzso The results are shown to be robust and valid when using two representative state-of-the-art zzso energy zzso
