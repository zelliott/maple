The problem of image restoration of space zzso blur is common and zzso One of the most useful descriptions of this problem is in its zzso form zzso where O is the object represented as a column zzso I is the blur image represented as a column zzso and H is the zzso zzso that represents the optical zzso When zzso the problem to restore the geometric object from the blurred image and the known system zzso restoration is limited in speed and quality by the system zzso Current optical design methods focus on image quality, therefore if additional image processing is needed the zzso condition is taken zzso zzso In this paper we would like to present a new optical approach which aims to improve the system condition by proper optical zzso In this new method we use zzso Value zzso zzso to define the weak parts of the zzso zzso We design a second optical system based on those weak zzso parts and then we add the second system parallel to the first zzso The original and second systems together work as an improved parallel zzso zzso Following that, we present a method for designing such a zzso zzso for systems with a spread zzso zzso Finally we present a study case in which by using our new method we improve a space zzso image system with an initial condition number of zzso down to a condition number of zzso We use zzso inversion to simulate image zzso zzso show that the new parallel zzso immunity to zzso White zzso Noise zzso is much better then that of the original simple zzso Comparing the original and the parallel zzso systems, the parallel zzso system crosses the zzso zzso limit in zzso value which is more than zzso lower then the zzso value in the case of the original simple zzso The new parallel zzso system performance is also compared to another method based on the zzso zzso
