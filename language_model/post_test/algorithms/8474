In zzso electrical zzso zzso the goodness of fit of the trial images is assessed by the well-established statistical zzso criterion applied to the measured and predicted zzso Further selection from the range of images that fit the data is zzso by imposing an explicit constraint on the form of the image, such as the zzso of the image zzso In particular, the zzso of the image zzso is chosen so that zzso and zzso zzso are treated in the same zzso In this paper we introduce the idea of zzso mesh refinement to the zzso problem so that the local scale of the mesh is always matched to the scale of the image zzso This improves the reconstruction resolution so that the image constraint adopted dominates and is not zzso by the mesh zzso The avoidance of unnecessary mesh elements zzso the speed of reconstruction without degrading the resulting zzso Starting with a mesh scale length of the order of the zzso separation it is shown that, for data obtained at presently achievable zzso ratios of 60 to 80 zzso one or two refinement stages are sufficient to generate high quality zzso
