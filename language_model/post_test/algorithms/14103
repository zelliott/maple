zzso liquids can be modeled at different levels of spatial zzso In zzso zzso models, all zzso atoms can be explicitly zzso In zzso zzso models, particles zzso that represent groups of zzso bound atoms are used as elementary zzso zzso a zzso model should reproduce the zzso and structural properties of the corresponding zzso model after mapping to the zzso zzso In the present work, two such models are zzso zzso the classical zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso model recently proposed by zzso et zzso which maps approximately four zzso atoms to one zzso zzso zzso zzso B 2004, zzso zzso The study is restricted to zzso whose zzso fragments are abundantly found in lipids of biological zzso Additionally, zzso is included, as a template chain of the zzso zzso zzso The two representations of molecules in the liquid phase are compared in terms of average molecular structures, extent of zzso space zzso and zzso zzso An approximate method is used to estimate the zzso contributions to the absolute zzso zzso Good correspondence between the zzso and zzso representations is zzso The loss in zzso zzso due to the reduction in degrees of freedom upon zzso of the model is zzso
