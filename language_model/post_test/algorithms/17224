While the recent developments in the zzso MR imaging offer great potential for zzso assessment of blood flow in major blood vessels, the clinical applications of this technique have been hampered by zzso zzso data processing zzso In this paper, we describe a robust system for automated extraction of quantitative as well as qualitative flow information from zzso phase contrast MR zzso The zzso accomplishes reliable zzso of blood vessels using zzso analysis based on zzso zzso and employs a zzso scoring criterion to minimize the impact of imaging artifacts such as partial volume averaging and flow zzso which normally cause incomplete or inaccurate detection of vascular zzso
