zzso dynamics simulations have been performed to investigate the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inside the carbon zzso at temperatures ranging from zzso to zzso zzso The structural characteristics of the coordination shells of zzso are zzso including the zzso zzso distribution functions, the coordination numbers, and the orientation zzso of the water zzso zzso results show that the first coordination shells of the five zzso still exist in the zzso zzso Nevertheless, the first coordination shell structures of zzso change more significantly than those of zzso because of the preferential orientation of the water molecules induced by the carbon zzso The first coordination shells of zzso are considerably less ordered in the zzso than in the bulk solution, whereas the change of the first coordination shell structures of the zzso is zzso Furthermore, the confinement zzso the anomalous behavior of the coordination shells of the zzso with zzso The first coordination shell of zzso are found to be more ordered as the temperature increases only in the carbon zzso with the effective diameter of zzso zzso zzso the enhancement of the zzso zzso with zzso This is contrary to that in the bulk zzso The coordination shells of the other four zzso do not have such behavior in the carbon zzso with the effective diameter ranging from zzso to zzso zzso The easier distortion of the coordination shell of zzso and the match of the shell size and the zzso size may play roles in this zzso The exchange of water molecules in the first coordination shells of the zzso with the solution and the zzso diffusion along the zzso direction of the zzso are also zzso The mobility of the zzso and the stability of the coordination shells are greatly affected by the temperature in the zzso as in the bulk zzso These results help to understand the biological and chemical processes at the high zzso
