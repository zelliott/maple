zzso zzso inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso rapidly becomes resistant to zzso by zzso due to zzso of the zzso zzso This reaction is called zzso The effect of the four zzso and zzso ammonium compounds zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso from human zzso was investigated in zzso All compounds were zzso zzso of zzso the respective zzso zzso and the type of zzso exhibited considerable zzso The affinities to both the active and the zzso site were considerably higher for zzso zzso zzso zzso Ki zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Ki zzso zzso than for zzso zzso 1 zzso Ki zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Ki zzso zzso The zzso experiments were performed in a zzso procedure zzso at 0 degree and pH 10, aging at 37 degrees and pH zzso zzso by the zzso zzso 6 at 37 degrees and pH zzso followed by zzso zzso After these four steps zzso duration 55 zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso to zzso zzso 6 could reactivate about zzso of the inhibited zzso All zzso increased the zzso zzso by zzso 6 when added before aging was zzso The zzso increase in zzso was higher in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and 150 zzso zzso zzso than of 22 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso If the zzso were added after 5 zzso of aging they increased the activity of zzso zzso but to a considerably smaller extent than zzso zzso A good correlation of the respective zzso values and the effective zzso of these drugs was observed, indicating that an zzso binding site of zzso might be involved in the protective effect of these zzso
