Modular approaches are powerful systems biology strategies to deal with zzso They consist in zzso zzso all that is irrelevant to the problem under study, leaving explicit the portions of zzso Modular (or zzso zzso control analysis is a theoretical and experimental approach to study the sensitivity properties of complex zzso zzso Initially, it was conceived for zzso changes but, recently, it started to be developed for large zzso zzso A central result of this approach is that the systemic properties, represented by control zzso can be expressed as a function of the properties of isolated zzso the elasticity zzso Here we extend the theory for large changes to the case that the elasticity zzso depend on the extent of the zzso The novel theory is used to zzso experimental data related to the control of zzso flux in zzso zzso Our analysis shows that the pattern of control for large changes is zzso and zzso different from the one obtained applying the zzso zzso
