An experiment was conducted to contrast the motor performance of three groups (N zzso zzso of zzso zzso patients with confirmed Parkinson Disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso young zzso The task consisted of scribbling freely for 10 s within circular frames of different zzso zzso among groups focused on the relation between the zzso elements of the trace zzso size and trace zzso and the zzso of the drawing zzso zzso were zzso within the framework of previous work on normal individuals showing that instantaneous zzso of drawing movements depends jointly on trace zzso zzso Power zzso and trace extent zzso zzso The motor zzso of zzso patients exhibited all classical symptoms of the disease zzso average zzso reduced zzso zzso At a coarse level of analysis both zzso and the dependence of zzso on zzso which are supposed to reflect cortical mechanisms, were spared in zzso zzso Instead, significant differences with respects to the control groups emerged from an in-depth analysis of the zzso control suggesting that patients did not scale average zzso as effectively as zzso We factored out zzso control by distinguishing the influence of the broad context in which movement is zzso the size of the limiting zzso the influence of the local zzso the linear extent of the unit of motor action being zzso The balance between the two factors was found to be zzso different in zzso patients and zzso This difference is discussed in the light of current theorizing on the role of cortical and zzso mechanisms in the zzso of zzso We argue that the results are zzso with the notion that cortical mechanisms are responsible for generating a zzso template of the desired movement and the zzso specify the actual zzso parameters through a zzso gain factor acting on both size and zzso
