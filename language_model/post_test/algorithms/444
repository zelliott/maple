This study was designed to review outcomes of pediatric isolated zzso zzso zzso managed zzso at a single institution and assess whether reported adult risk factors for sudden death are zzso in pediatric zzso 

zzso death in zzso occurs suddenly zzso or may be zzso zzso Little data exists on zzso in zzso zzso factors for zzso in adult zzso are characterized and consensus management strategies zzso Their application to children is uncertain and treatment strategies zzso 

A retrospective cohort study of children with zzso was zzso zzso end points were cardiac death and zzso zzso and outcomes of known adult risk factors were zzso Outcomes analysis was performed using zzso zzso and Cox zzso zzso 

zzso patients were zzso The average age at diagnosis was zzso zzso zzso years, and mean follow-up was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso end points occurred in 11 patients over the 20-year follow-up zzso 4 underwent cardiac transplant and 7 died (3 zzso zzso left zzso zzso zzso zzso and an abnormal blood pressure response to exercise were zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso zzso survival analysis predicts an zzso survival over a 20-year zzso 

In children with isolated zzso managed primarily with exercise restriction and medication, cardiac death occurred zzso zzso or transplant was at least as common as zzso zzso left zzso zzso and blunted blood pressure response to exercise were associated with an increased risk of zzso
