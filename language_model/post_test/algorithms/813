This paper addresses the problem of zzso large and complex computer vision code bases that have been developed zzso into efficient real-time zzso avoiding the need for rewriting the software, and the associated zzso Creative linking strategies based on Linux zzso kernel zzso are presented to create a simultaneous realization of real-time and zzso frame rate computer vision systems from a single code zzso In this approach, systemic predictability is achieved by inserting zzso components of a zzso zzso directly into the kernel as a virtual device zzso This effectively zzso a single process space model that is zzso zzso and that has direct access to a powerful set of zzso zzso This overall approach is shown to provide the basis for building a predictable zzso vision system using commercial zzso hardware and a standard zzso Linux operating zzso zzso on a zzso vision system designed for zzso laser retinal surgery show that this method reduces the zzso of observed zzso central processing unit cycle counts by two orders of zzso The conclusion is that when predictable application zzso are used, it is possible to efficiently migrate to a predictable zzso computer vision zzso
