zzso zzso signals zzso by human knee zzso are zzso and zzso in nature; zzso zzso zzso provide powerful means to analyze such zzso The objective of this paper is to construct zzso zzso of zzso signals suitable for feature zzso An zzso zzso was constructed by minimum zzso zzso of the zzso obtained by the matching pursuit decomposition zzso zzso of zzso signals such as energy, energy spread, frequency, and frequency spread were extracted from their zzso zzso The parameters carry information about the combined zzso dynamics of the zzso The mean and standard zzso of the parameters were zzso and each zzso signal was represented by a set of just six zzso zzso pattern zzso experiments based on zzso zzso analysis of the parameters showed an overall zzso screening accuracy of zzso with 90 zzso signals zzso zzso and 39 zzso and a higher accuracy of zzso with a database of 71 signals with 51 zzso and 20 zzso of a specific type of zzso zzso The proposed method of zzso signal analysis is independent of joint angle and clinical information, and shows good potential for zzso diagnosis and monitoring of zzso disorders such as zzso zzso
