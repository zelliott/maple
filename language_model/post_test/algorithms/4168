Gene expression zzso have successfully been used for building zzso signatures, zzso for identifying a short list of important genes that can predict patient zzso Mostly zzso zzso have been considered, and there is little advice available for building multivariable risk prediction models from zzso zzso We specifically consider penalized zzso techniques, such as the lasso and zzso zzso which can simultaneously consider all zzso and provide both, multivariable zzso models for prediction and automated variable zzso However, they might be affected by the typical zzso zzso or extreme values of zzso zzso and therefore could benefit from transformations of the zzso In an zzso part, we highlight preferential selection of zzso with large zzso which is problematic due to the zzso dependency of zzso zzso In a simulation study, we compare different transformations of zzso data for potentially improving detection of important zzso Specifically, we consider zzso the log zzso a zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the prediction performance for real data from patients with kidney cancer and acute zzso leukemia is zzso We show that signature size, identification performance, and prediction performance critically depend on the choice of a suitable zzso zzso transformations perform well in all scenarios and can even outperform complex zzso zzso Generally, the results illustrate that the distribution and potential transformations of zzso data need to be considered as a critical step when building risk prediction models by penalized zzso zzso
