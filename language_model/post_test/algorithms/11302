zzso zzso is the most prevalent cause of bacterial sexually transmitted diseases and the leading cause of preventable zzso zzso Global control of zzso will best be achieved with a zzso a primary target for which is the major outer membrane zzso zzso which comprises zzso of the outer membrane protein mass of this zzso In the absence of experimental structural information on zzso three previously published zzso models presumed zzso barrel zzso Here, we use the latest zzso prediction zzso previous zzso zzso modeling results, and comparative modeling methodology to build a zzso model based on the zzso zzso zzso We find that while a zzso zzso model captures many structural hallmarks of a zzso zzso zzso zzso and is consistent with most of the experimental evidence for zzso zzso zzso zzso cannot be modeled as zzso that span the entire zzso as is consistently observed in published zzso zzso crystal zzso Given the ambiguous results for zzso zzso found in this study, recent publications of membrane zzso structures breaking with the zzso rule for an even number of zzso findings of zzso with zzso zzso zzso and alternate folds dependent upon the zzso of the zzso we suggest that although the zzso zzso structure incorporates zzso zzso zzso it may have novel zzso or dynamic structural changes accounting for the discrepancies zzso
