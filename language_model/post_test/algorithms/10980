A new liquid zzso zzso approach was developed for the determination of sunset yellow zzso and zzso zzso in commercial zzso This approach uses zzso and zzso zzso methods, zzso classical zzso zzso principal component zzso zzso and zzso squares zzso zzso The combined zzso approaches, zzso as zzso zzso and zzso are based on zzso array zzso detection at multiple zzso zzso zzso separation of zzso and zzso with zzso red as the internal standard zzso was obtained by using a zzso zzso zzso column, 5 zzso zzso zzso 250 zzso and zzso M zzso buffer zzso zzso water (55 + 20 + 15 + 10, zzso as the mobile phase at a flow rate of zzso zzso The zzso data sets consisting of the ratios of zzso peak areas to the IS peak area were obtained by using zzso detection at 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso were separately constructed by using the relationship between the zzso ratio and the training sets for each zzso zzso approaches were tested for different synthetic zzso containing zzso and zzso in the presence of the zzso These zzso zzso were applied to a commercial preparation of the 2 zzso The experimental results of the zzso approaches were compared with those obtained by a developed classical zzso method using zzso zzso
