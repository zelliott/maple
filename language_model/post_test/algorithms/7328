zzso and zzso the timing and the genetic contributions of parental populations to a hybrid population is an important but challenging problem in reconstructing evolutionary histories from genetic variation zzso With the advent of high zzso zzso technologies, new methods suitable for large-scale data are especially zzso Furthermore, existing methods typically assume the assignment of individuals into zzso is known, when that itself is a difficult problem often unresolved for real zzso Here, we propose a novel method that combines prior work for zzso non zzso population structures with an zzso scheme for sampling over zzso scenarios to both identify population assignments and learn divergence times and zzso proportions for those populations using zzso zzso genetic variation zzso We validated our method using zzso simulations and a collection of real bovine and human variation zzso On simulated zzso our methods show better accuracy and faster run time than leading competitive methods in zzso zzso zzso and divergence zzso Analysis on the real data further shows our methods to be effective at matching our best current knowledge about the relevant zzso
