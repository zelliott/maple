The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of zzso Carlo zzso calculations and zzso dose definitions in zzso body zzso zzso for lung cancer zzso We used a retrospective patient review and basic virtual phantom to determine dose zzso zzso patients underwent zzso A basic virtual phantom had a gross tumor volume zzso of zzso zzso with equivalent water density of zzso zzso which was surrounded by equivalent lung surrounding the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the planning target volume zzso and zzso of the zzso were evaluated with different zzso sizes zzso to zzso zzso and different lung zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso dose was defined as zzso of the zzso should receive zzso of the dose zzso zzso zzso using pencil beam zzso calculation and zzso using zzso zzso In the patient study, average doses to the zzso of the zzso and zzso of the zzso using the zzso calculation plan were zzso and zzso lower than those by the zzso calculation plan, zzso In the phantom study, decreased doses to the zzso of the zzso and zzso of the zzso using the zzso calculation plan were accompanied with changes zzso size from zzso zzso zzso which was decreased from zzso to zzso for the zzso and from zzso zzso for the zzso Similar results were seen with changes in lung density from zzso to zzso zzso with doses to the zzso of the zzso and zzso of the zzso were decreased from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso The decrease in dose to the zzso with zzso calculation was strongly dependent on lung zzso We suggest that dose definition to the zzso for lung cancer zzso be zzso using zzso zzso Our current clinical protocol for lung zzso is based on a prescribed dose of 44 zzso in 4 zzso to the zzso using zzso zzso
