zzso of biological systems with complex zzso regulatory schemes is an important research topic in system zzso In many models of biological systems, the regulatory functions are of zzso zzso The linear sectors, in which the zzso type functions zzso have been extensively adopted to deal with these zzso type zzso The stability analysis resulting from linear sectors is however often conservative as a wide linear section is required to include a large portion of a zzso type zzso In this paper, we zzso zzso linear sectors, recently adopted in zzso control theory, to investigate zzso of a class of biological systems with sum regulatory zzso We will estimate the domain of attraction of each stable equilibrium and examine the robust stability of each equilibrium in the face of disturbances that are bounded in magnitude or zzso A genetic zzso switch in zzso coli is employed as an example to illustrate the zzso and effectiveness of our analysis zzso
