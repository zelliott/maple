zzso models of zzso structures are needed to explore emergent properties of zzso zzso Because these models have trillions of zzso a major problem in their creation is zzso zzso Here we present a novel method for exploiting consistent fiber orientation in a neural tissue to perform a highly efficient modified zzso algorithm, which identifies all regions of zzso zzso between zzso and zzso projection zzso The first step in placing zzso in zzso models is zzso zzso at large scales a zzso intensive zzso We have developed an efficient zzso zzso zzso that can find all zzso zzso of zzso where trillions of zzso connect billions of zzso
