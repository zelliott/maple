zzso imaging is a well-established ultrasound mode and very valuable for visualizing in real time the distribution of blood flow in a specific region of zzso However, it is zzso quite zzso To meet the large zzso need in zzso imaging, most ultrasound systems have been designed using zzso zzso In this paper, we present a system where all the zzso processing is supported on a zzso zzso About zzso of the processing zzso were programmed in C zzso On a single processor, we were able to achieve zzso zzso when the input data consist of 192 zzso 512 zzso 8 zzso zzso samples for color flow and zzso zzso 512 for B mode and the output image size is 600 zzso zzso Additional processors can be added to handle more input data and/or support higher frame zzso Our results demonstrate that a zzso ultrasound system can provide the same functionality for clinical use as conventional ultrasound zzso However, it is more flexible and efficient due to its zzso
