The imaging evaluation of pulmonary zzso often zzso detected on imaging examinations performed for other clinical reasons, is a frequently encountered clinical zzso With advances in imaging zzso both the detection and characterization of pulmonary zzso continue to evolve and zzso 

This article will review the imaging zzso used to detect and diagnose benign and zzso pulmonary zzso with a focus on zzso zzso zzso which continues to be the mainstay for zzso The authors discuss recent advances in the lung zzso management, and an zzso for the management of indeterminate pulmonary zzso 

There are set of criteria that define a benign zzso the most important of which are the lack of zzso change for 2 years or more, and certain benign imaging criteria, including specific patterns of zzso or the presence of zzso Although some indeterminate pulmonary zzso are immediately zzso generally those approaching 1 zzso or larger in diameter, at which size the diagnostic accuracy of tools such as zzso zzso zzso zzso single zzso zzso CT zzso and biopsy techniques are sufficient to warrant their zzso The majority of indeterminate pulmonary zzso are under 1 zzso for which serial CT examinations through at least 2 years for solid zzso and 3 years for zzso zzso are used to demonstrate either benign zzso behavior or zzso The management of incidental pulmonary zzso involves a multidisciplinary approach in which zzso plays a pivotal zzso Newer imaging and zzso techniques have made this a more accurate technique eliminating ambiguity and unnecessary zzso
