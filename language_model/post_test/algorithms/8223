zzso zzso is used in zzso especially zzso to generate treatment plans which meet different objectives to varying zzso zzso surfaces can be constructed representing the gains and losses of different objectives when switching from one plan to another, and the planner can zzso explore different treatment possibilities without the need for zzso In this work a method for the zzso zzso of zzso therapy is zzso The proposed method is applied slice per slice and uses the geometry of the slice directly to construct several zzso each zzso irradiating the tumor and blocking a number zzso of different zzso at risk present in the zzso The blocked arc dose zzso so obtained are quite zzso in the zzso An algorithm, based on the zzso reconstruction of images from projections, has been developed to compensate for this zzso leading to compensated blocked arcs which deliver more uniform target doses but still block critical zzso Different treatments can be obtained as linear combinations of these zzso each involving different zzso among the objectives zzso The zzso zzso substantially improves the target dose uniformity of blocked arcs at the cost of slightly increasing the dose to the rest of the body, allowing delivery of good uniform dose zzso to the target without significantly irradiating the blocked zzso zzso surfaces are presented for slices containing a target and one or two critical zzso The method is directly zzso using zzso or zzso zzso Implementation for conventional linear zzso will be more difficult because the number of arcs needed to deliver such treatments can be large, an issue to be explored in future zzso
