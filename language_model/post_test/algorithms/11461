In the analysis of cancer studies with zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis provides an effective way of pooling information across multiple zzso zzso The zzso basis of multiple independent zzso which can be characterized by the sets of zzso zzso can be described using the zzso model or zzso zzso Under the zzso model, all zzso share the same set of markers associated with zzso In contrast, under the zzso model, different studies have overlapping but possibly different sets of zzso The zzso model contains the zzso model as a special case and can be much more zzso zzso selection under the zzso model calls for zzso selection to determine whether a zzso is associated with response in any study at all as well as in which studies it is associated with zzso In this study, we consider two zzso zzso zzso zzso approaches for marker selection under the zzso zzso For each approach, we describe its rationale and an effective zzso zzso We conduct simulations to investigate their performance and compare with the existing zzso We also apply the proposed approaches to the analysis of gene expression data on multiple zzso
