Due to the imperfections of the radio frequency zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso images often suffer from a smooth and biologically meaningless bias field, which causes severe troubles for subsequent processing and quantitative zzso To effectively restore the original zzso this paper simultaneously exploits the spatial and zzso features of the corrupted MR images for bias correction via the joint zzso zzso With both zzso and zzso total variation zzso considered, two zzso bias correction zzso have been proposed, namely zzso and zzso These two methods have been applied to simulated images under various noise levels and bias field corruption and also tested on real MR zzso The test results show that the proposed two methods can effectively remove the bias field and also present comparable performance compared to the state-of-the-art zzso
