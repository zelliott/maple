We describe a zzso vehicle that combines the sustained release properties of zzso with the structural advantages of zzso gelatin gels that can be implanted directly or coated onto medical zzso zzso inclusion in gelatin gels does not compromise zzso stability nor does it interfere with the resiliency of gels to zzso zzso However, electron spin resonance analysis of zzso zzso zzso revealed a slight depression zzso zzso degrees zzso of the zzso phase transition relative to zzso in zzso The level of zzso release from gels was determined by zzso zzso zzso size, and the presence of zzso zzso chains in the gel zzso or in the zzso zzso Both neutral and charged zzso displayed relatively high affinities for zzso zzso gels, with only zzso release of initially zzso zzso while zzso in which zzso zzso was included within the membrane were not as well retained zzso zzso zzso The in zzso zzso of zzso from zzso gels immersed in serum was nearly complete after 24 h compared to 38% release of zzso zzso after 6 zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso depended on the accessibility of serum components to gels as partly immersed gels retained approximately 50% of their load of drug after 24 zzso In zzso experiments using a zzso rabbit model of urinary tract infection revealed the absence of viable zzso coli on coated zzso surfaces in seven out of nine cases while all zzso zzso surfaces examined zzso zzso 7) were zzso
