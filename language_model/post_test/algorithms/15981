The zzso of the zzso zzso activity exhibited by three zzso zzso complexes, derived from different zzso zzso by zzso acid zzso has been zzso The zzso mechanism of the zzso reaction proceeds in two steps and for both of these zzso by zzso acid is of competitive zzso The inhibitor binds strongly to the zzso complex in the first step and to the zzso zzso in the second step, preventing in both cases the binding of the zzso zzso zzso studies of zzso acid to the zzso zzso complexes and a series of zzso zzso carried out zzso and by zzso enable us to propose that the inhibitor acts as a bridging zzso between the metal centers in the zzso zzso
