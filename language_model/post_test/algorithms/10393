zzso capabilities of two types of zzso models are zzso zzso models zzso linear combinations of zzso of basis functions zzso by units belonging to a set called zzso and linear ones zzso linear combinations of zzso fixed basis zzso The two models are compared in terms of approximation rates, zzso speeds of decrease of approximation errors for a growing number zzso of basis zzso zzso of upper bounds on approximation rates by zzso models are inspected, to show that for individual functions they do not imply estimates for zzso models that do not hold also for some linear zzso Instead, the possibility of getting faster approximation rates by zzso models is demonstrated for worst-case errors in approximation of suitable sets of zzso For such sets, even geometric upper bounds zzso
