We present here the details of a phase retrieval technique that provides access to zzso zzso that are not currently available using existing zzso zzso The development of zzso optical zzso has facilitated significant insights into electronic processes in physics, chemistry, and zzso The versatility and number of available techniques are, however, significantly limited by the requirement that the detection be zzso Many of these techniques are closely related to the vast range of zzso zzso zzso which revolutionized zzso chemistry more than 30 years zzso We focus here on the specific case of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and discuss the details of an zzso zzso that recovers the relative phase relationships required to perform the zzso transformation and find the unique solution for the zzso zzso A detailed guide is provided that describes the practical zzso of such zzso The effectiveness and accuracy of the phase retrieval process are assessed for simulated one- and zzso zzso It is also compared with zzso experimental data for which the target phase information has been obtained independently by zzso In all the cases, the present zzso yields results that compare well with the solutions obtained by other zzso There are, however, some limitations and potential pitfalls that are identified and zzso We conclude with a discussion of the potential applications and further advances that may be possible by adopting zzso phase retrieval zzso of the type discussed zzso
