zzso ejection fraction zzso can be zzso from gated zzso zzso zzso studies using quantitative zzso The purpose of this study was to compare the zzso obtained using the conventional high-resolution zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Medical Systems, Hoffman zzso zzso using a quantitative zzso zzso 

Thirty-four patients (15 men, 19 zzso mean age zzso 62 zzso had either treadmill or pharmacological stress testing with zzso zzso zzso zzso injected at peak zzso Conventional gated zzso imaging was performed approximately 30 zzso zzso first with the zzso zzso then with the zzso using the same acquisition parameters on a zzso gamma zzso Traditional zzso determination of zzso using zzso gated blood pool and/or cardiac zzso also was obtained for each zzso 

The correlation in zzso between the zzso and zzso acquisitions was excellent, r zzso zzso The correlation between zzso and zzso zzso was good, r zzso zzso as was the zzso and zzso zzso r zzso zzso The mean zzso value for zzso was slightly less than zzso zzso zzso zzso while the zzso mean zzso was higher zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso correlated well with zzso mean zzso value using zzso was higher than zzso 

The choice of zzso may alter the zzso obtained from gated zzso zzso zzso
