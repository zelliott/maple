zzso zzso is a rapid zzso technique capable of zzso chemicals in human artery zzso and characterizing zzso plaques in zzso but clinical applications through optical zzso zzso have been hindered by large background signals generated within the zzso Previous workers realized that this background was reduced significantly in the high zzso zzso zzso region ( approximately zzso zzso to approximately zzso zzso and with proper selection of optical zzso one could collect quality zzso zzso remotely via a single optical fiber with no additional filters or zzso This study compared zzso zzso in coronary artery tissue that were determined with chemical zzso techniques to those estimated from zzso zzso zzso collected through a single optical zzso The standard error of predictions between the zzso and chemical zzso techniques were small for cholesterol and zzso zzso at zzso and zzso zzso
