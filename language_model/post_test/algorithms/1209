The zzso equation relates the pressure exerted on a fluid to its flow zzso and its density, in addition to its flow acceleration and its viscous friction zzso When flow zzso increases at a zzso the local pressure decreases zzso It has been wrongfully assumed that pressure lost zzso to a zzso can never zzso It is, however, the energy content of the fluid, equal to the kinetic plus the potential energy, which can not zzso When flow slows zzso to a narrowing and little energy is lost to friction, pressure does actually zzso zzso recovery has been well demonstrated to exist in a variety of zzso zzso zzso zzso valve zzso such as the zzso Jude valves can produce quite remarkable pressure zzso This causes a great zzso between pressure drop calculations based on continuous wave zzso on the one hand and true pressure drop across the zzso on the zzso zzso on zzso zzso only might wrongfully lead one to conclude that the zzso was zzso Less extreme pressure recovery is possible across a zzso native zzso zzso but interpretation of the flow zzso across the valve might make the difference between recommendations to replace or to retain the zzso When interpreting zzso signals across zzso the phenomenon of pressure recovery should be kept in zzso
