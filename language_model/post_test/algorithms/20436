A general zzso zzso quantitative trait locus zzso mapping method for zzso species is zzso It is suitable for an analysis of complete and incomplete data from experimental designs of zzso families or zzso The amount of zzso of parents and grandparents is zzso as well as the assumption that the zzso zzso in the crossed lines are zzso zzso origin indicators are used, but without forgetting the original zzso or zzso origin zzso The method treats the number of zzso in the analyzed zzso as a random variable and allows some zzso effects from other zzso to be taken into account in a composite zzso mapping zzso A zzso of ordered zzso zzso of the whole family is sampled once in each marker locus during every round of the zzso zzso zzso Carlo zzso used in the zzso zzso As a zzso the method gives the zzso zzso for linkage zzso in the family and therefore it can also be used as a zzso zzso The zzso method is tested and compared with two zzso methods using simulated data sets, considering two different parental crosses and three different levels of available parental zzso The method is implemented as a software package and is freely available under the name zzso at zzso zzso
