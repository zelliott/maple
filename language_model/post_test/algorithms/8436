During labor, ephedrine is widely used to prevent or to treat maternal zzso zzso and restore zzso zzso pressure to avoid zzso fetal zzso However, the effects of ephedrine on zzso blood flow have not been studied during zzso zzso The purpose of the study was to assess the effects of ephedrine on zzso artery zzso and resistance index using the zzso technique during the active phase of zzso 

Ten zzso healthy zzso with uncomplicated zzso at term received intravenous ephedrine during labor to increase mean zzso pressure up to a maximum of zzso above their baseline zzso Peak zzso and zzso zzso flow zzso and resistance zzso were measured in the zzso artery before and immediately after administration of zzso intravenous ephedrine and after ephedrine zzso zzso and fetal middle cerebral zzso resistance zzso and fetal heart rate were also zzso 

After ephedrine administration, mean zzso pressure increased by 17 zzso zzso zzso flow zzso in the zzso artery at peak zzso of zzso contraction was restored to zzso of the value observed in the absence of zzso The zzso zzso was totally zzso and the zzso resistance index was significantly zzso compared with the values in the absence of zzso Between zzso zzso ephedrine induced similar but less marked zzso Fetal zzso parameters were not altered by ephedrine zzso 

zzso administration of intravenous ephedrine reversed the dramatic decrease in zzso zzso blood flow zzso and the increase in resistance index during zzso contraction, without altering fetal zzso zzso This suggests that the increase in zzso zzso pressure during labor could in part restore zzso blood flow to the zzso during zzso zzso
