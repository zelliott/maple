Over the past decade, research in the field of functional electrical stimulation zzso has led to a new generation of zzso zzso devices that offer increasingly selective access to neural zzso zzso of these devices into research and clinical applications, however, has been hampered by the lack of hardware and software platforms capable of taking full advantage of zzso In this paper, we present the first generation of a zzso zzso platform built specifically for zzso neural interface zzso The platform was designed to support a wide range of zzso mapping and zzso control zzso It includes a central control zzso a zzso zzso an array of zzso devices, and a zzso data recording zzso To demonstrate the unique capabilities of this platform, two automated software routines for mapping zzso properties of implanted zzso devices were implemented and zzso The first routine determines stimulation levels that produce zzso muscle activity, and the second generates recruitment zzso (as measured by peak impulse zzso Both routines were tested on zzso Utah zzso zzso zzso zzso implanted in cat zzso nerves using joint zzso or zzso as muscle output zzso Mean time to map zzso stimulus level was zzso s for zzso that evoked responses zzso zzso zzso and zzso s for zzso that did not evoke responses zzso zzso zzso Mean time to locate recruitment curve zzso for an zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso s , and each point in the recruitment curve required zzso zzso These results demonstrate the utility of our zzso platform by showing that it can be used to completely automate a typically zzso and zzso procedure associated with using zzso zzso
