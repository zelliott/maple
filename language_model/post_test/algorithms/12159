In this paper, we present a novel zzso system with high embedding zzso The embedding zzso is based on the zzso projection embedding method with some enhancement to achieve high embedding zzso In particular, our system uses a random zzso of the columns of a zzso zzso as projection zzso and a fixed zzso mask based on the zzso default zzso table for the zzso step zzso As a result, the zzso system achieves zzso (1 bit out of 167 raw image zzso to zzso hiding ratios with a zzso of around zzso in the presence of zzso zzso attacks, while maintaining visual distortion at a zzso
