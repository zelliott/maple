Advances in theory and zzso for electronic structure calculations must be incorporated into program packages to enable them to become routinely used by the broader chemical zzso This work reviews advances made over the past five years or so that constitute the major improvements contained in a new release of the zzso quantum chemistry package, together with illustrative zzso and zzso zzso developments discussed include fast methods for density functional theory calculations, linear zzso evaluation of zzso zzso chemical shifts and electric properties, fast auxiliary basis function methods for correlated energies and zzso zzso coupled cluster methods for ground and excited states, zzso zzso embedding methods and techniques for exploring potential energy zzso
