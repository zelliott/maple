The distance between a pair of spike trains, zzso the differences between them, can be measured using various zzso Here we introduce a new class of spike train zzso inspired by the zzso distance, and compare them with existing zzso Some of our new metrics (the zzso and the zzso have characteristics that are zzso different from those of classical metrics like the van Rossum distance or the Victor and zzso zzso The zzso and the zzso are particularly suitable for measuring distances between spike trains where information is zzso in zzso but the number and the timing of spikes inside a burst do not carry zzso The zzso does not depend on any parameters and can be zzso using a fast zzso whose time depends zzso on the number of spikes in the two spike zzso We also introduce localized versions of the new zzso which could have the biologically relevant interpretation of measuring the differences between spike trains as they are perceived at a particular moment in time by a zzso receiving these spike zzso
