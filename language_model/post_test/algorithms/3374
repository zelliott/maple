An image acquisition and processing system has been developed for quantitative zzso of zzso or zzso in stained zzso Three different light zzso are used in the system to exploit the best characteristics of these sensors for different biological zzso A digital zzso in the form of a linear array zzso device zzso acquires data with high spatial and zzso zzso A color zzso camera is employed when spectral information is required for the zzso of cellular zzso An zzso zzso device zzso camera provides for very low light intensity zzso primarily for zzso zzso Properties of these zzso such as contrast transfer function, zzso and zzso zzso have been zzso Two dedicated image processing units were incorporated into the zzso The front-end processor, based on a digital signal processor, provides functions such as object zzso raw image zzso zzso artifact zzso and zzso The second image zzso is associated with the frame memory and includes a zzso processor, a dedicated zzso logic unit for image processing functions, and a graphics module for zzso overlay zzso An interactive program was developed to acquire cell images and to experiment with a range of zzso zzso feature zzso and other image processing zzso The results of any image operation are displayed on the video zzso Once a desired processing sequence is determined, the sequence may be stored to become part of a command library and can be executed thereafter as a single zzso
