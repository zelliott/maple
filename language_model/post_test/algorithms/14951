This paper presents a novel method to detect zzso clusters in protein three-dimensional structures using a graph spectral zzso zzso zzso interactions are represented by a labeled graph in which the zzso of the graph represent the zzso atoms and the edges represent the distance between the zzso zzso The distance information and the zzso connectivity of the zzso are represented in the form of a zzso called the zzso zzso The constructed zzso is zzso and zzso information is obtained from the zzso components associated with the second lowest zzso and cluster centers are obtained from the zzso components associated with the top zzso The method uses global information for zzso and a single zzso zzso is required to detect clusters of zzso The approach has been adopted here to detect a variety of zzso clusters and identify the zzso which makes the largest number of interactions among the zzso forming the cluster zzso zzso zzso such clusters and cluster centers are important from a protein structure and folding point of zzso The crucial zzso which are important in the folding zzso as determined by zzso values (which is a measure of the effect of a zzso on the stability of the transition state of zzso as obtained from protein engineering methods, can be identified from the zzso components corresponding to the top zzso Expanded clusters are detected near the active and binding site of the zzso supporting the nucleation zzso hypothesis for zzso The method is also shown to detect zzso in protein structures and zzso zzso clusters in zzso similar zzso
