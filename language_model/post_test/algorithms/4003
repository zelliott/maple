zzso from a zzso cancer study, we propose a class of frailty zzso risks survival models to account for the dependence between disease progression time, survival time, and treatment zzso Properties of the proposed models are examined and an efficient Gibbs sampling zzso using the collapsed Gibbs technique is zzso A zzso procedure for assessing the treatment effect is also zzso The zzso information criterion zzso with an appropriate zzso function and zzso of the zzso likelihood zzso are constructed for model zzso A simulation study is conducted to examine the empirical performance of zzso and zzso and as well as the zzso zzso The proposed method is further applied to analyze data from a zzso cancer zzso
