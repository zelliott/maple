To determine the efficacy of a quality control strategy in cervical zzso in the detection of high-grade zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients were selected who underwent a Pap zzso and cervical zzso biopsy between April 2008 and December 2009, with evidence of a high-grade zzso zzso zzso in one or both zzso The statistical parameters of the zzso test were calculated before and after systematic meetings for review of the zzso test results (6 zzso in which the following was done: zzso diagnostic zzso zzso zzso with the latter as gold zzso and evaluation of the therapeutic status of each zzso 

Once these controls were applied, it was noted that sensitivity and positive likelihood ratio of the test for high-grade zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso respectively, while specificity remained at zzso Reduction in interference of zzso results associated with errors in the zzso phase of the zzso productive process gave an estimate of failures in collection of the specimens zzso zzso 

In addition to improving the performance of the zzso diagnosis of the high-grade zzso zzso zzso the proposed quality control strategy allows a reflection on the causes of incorrect or conflicting zzso
