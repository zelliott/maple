The present study aimed to investigate new pore induction as a zzso mechanism in human zzso membrane zzso with low to moderate zzso electric zzso The extent of pore induction and the effective pore sizes of these induced pores were to be assessed using a low frequency zzso zzso low to moderate zzso zzso 0 to zzso zzso zzso alternating current zzso zzso zzso method zzso zzso This zzso approach was to allow for inducing and sustaining a state of pore induction in zzso while permitting no significant transport enhancement via zzso thus, transport enhancement entirely due to new pore induction zzso passive zzso was to be assessed without any contributions from zzso Good zzso between the increase in zzso zzso and its electrical zzso was found with the zzso transport data obtained during zzso zzso zzso using zzso as the model zzso Typically, at zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso increases (and zzso zzso ranged from around 3- to zzso These results appear to be the first direct evidence that new pore induction in zzso is a significant flux enhancing mechanism under moderate zzso zzso The zzso of pore induction in zzso under low frequency moderate zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso direct current zzso and continuous zzso were also zzso The zzso of pore induction from zzso zzso and zzso zzso were generally of the same order of magnitude but somewhat less than that observed during continuous zzso zzso at the same applied zzso and zzso suggesting less extent of pore induction with reversing polarity or when a brief delay is provided between zzso to allow for membrane zzso The average effective pore sizes calculated for the induced pores from the experimental data with zzso and zzso as probe zzso and the hindered transport theory were 12 zzso 2 A, which are of the same order of magnitude as those of zzso pores determined from conventional passive diffusion zzso
