We developed a weighted composite score of the zzso verbal zzso test zzso that can more easily and widely screen Alzheimer's disease zzso than the zzso status examination zzso We administered the zzso using animal category and zzso to 423 zzso mild probable zzso patients and their zzso and zzso cognitively normal zzso To enhance the diagnostic accuracy for zzso of the zzso we obtained a weighted composite score from zzso scores of the zzso using a zzso zzso model: zzso zzso zzso gender zzso age zzso education level - zzso first-half score - zzso switching score zzso zzso score zzso zzso zzso The area under the receiver operating curve zzso for zzso of this composite score zzso was zzso zzso zzso - zzso and was larger than that of the zzso zzso and zzso total score of the zzso zzso In 100 zzso zzso the composite score consistently showed better diagnostic zzso sensitivity and specificity for zzso than the total zzso Although zzso for zzso of the zzso composite score was slightly smaller than that of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso composite score may be a good alternative to the zzso for screening zzso since it is much zzso cheaper, and more easily zzso over phone or zzso than the zzso
