This article introduces a new and general framework for zzso the experiment design for diffusion zzso of samples with unknown zzso An illustration then uses the framework to study the feasibility of measuring direct features of zzso zzso in zzso The study investigates the accuracy and precision with which we can estimate potentially important new zzso such as zzso density and radius in white zzso zzso experiments use a simple model of white matter based on zzso zzso hindered and restricted model of zzso The zzso finds acquisition protocols achievable on modern human and animal systems that consist of 120 zzso with fixed maximum zzso zzso zzso zzso in brain tissue are typically in the range zzso zzso zzso suggest that estimates of zzso in the range zzso zzso have highest precision and that a maximum zzso strength of zzso T zzso is sufficient to distinguish zzso of 5, 10, and 20 zzso Smaller zzso are more difficult to distinguish from one another but are identifiable as zzso A maximum zzso strength of zzso T zzso zzso zzso of 1 and 2 zzso The simulations also suggest that zzso zzso and zzso parameters in the normal range for white matter are zzso The zzso zzso has applications well beyond the current work to zzso the protocol for fitting any model of the diffusion zzso
