The contribution of various zzso components to zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that was isolated from local zzso zzso with a high capability to accumulate heavy metal zzso was zzso The cell superficial layer had a negative effect on zzso zzso of the bacterial zzso zzso zzso capacity of the separated cell envelopes was fivefold more than that of the intact cells, zzso to the liberation of more and more binding sites during the separation zzso Some main components in the cell zzso such as the zzso zzso layer, outer zzso and inner zzso provide the capability for zzso zzso The content of the components in the cell envelope is in the order inner membrane zzso outer membrane zzso zzso layer, and their zzso zzso capacity was in the order zzso layer zzso outer membrane zzso inner zzso The total contribution of the separated zzso layer material to zzso zzso by the cell envelope was no more than zzso and the outer membrane and inner membrane contributed about zzso and zzso zzso The relatively high zzso content in the outer membrane may be the major reason for the higher zzso capacity of the outer membrane to zzso and, zzso such a high zzso zzso capacity of zzso zzso zzso cell zzso
