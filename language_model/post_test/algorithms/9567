The aim of this work was to study the zzso capability of new zzso zzso zzso zzso mixed zzso and zzso derivatives with a series of structurally related steroids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a number of zzso calcium channel zzso zzso zzso zzso that traditionally interact poorly with other zzso zzso The effect of the total degree of substitution zzso and of the length of the zzso side chain on binding capacity of these new modified CDs was evaluated as was their ability to induce red blood cell zzso An attempt was made to correlate zzso to surface zzso zzso zzso between the zzso and selected molecules were determined by zzso studies, and only in few cases by zzso zzso zzso percentage was determined using zzso rabbit blood and zzso human blood with zzso zzso The surface activity was measured with a zzso A significant improvement in the binding capacity between various zzso and the new zzso was observed when compared to the zzso The length of the zzso chain and total degree of zzso affected the binding with the relationship being zzso For most compounds, an intermediate degree of substitution appeared to be zzso The zzso studies showed that some of the derivatives may induce zzso and this correlated with higher surface activity for some but not all of the zzso
