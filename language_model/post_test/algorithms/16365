In this paper, we present a large database of over 50,000 zzso videos collected from zzso We develop a compact representation called zzso zzso that achieves high video zzso rates while retaining the overall visual appearance of the video as it varies over zzso We show that frame sampling using affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso the best zzso between zzso and video zzso We use this large collection of zzso videos in conjunction with simple data mining techniques to perform related video zzso as well as zzso of images and video zzso The zzso results achieved by tiny videos are compared with the tiny images framework zzso for a variety of recognition zzso The tiny images data set consists of 80 million images collected from the zzso These are the largest labeled research data sets of videos and images available to zzso We show that tiny videos are better suited for zzso scenery and sports activities, while tiny images perform better at recognizing zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that combining the tiny images and tiny videos data sets improves zzso precision in a wider range of zzso
