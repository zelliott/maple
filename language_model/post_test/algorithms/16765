In this paper, a fully automatic blind retrospective zzso correction method based mainly on a zzso of a zzso criterion is zzso The proposed method assumes that the acquired image has distorted from a zzso and an additive zzso component and thus can be adequately described by the linear image formation zzso The zzso of the zzso image is based on zzso zzso of the zzso and the additive zzso component and the zzso application of the inverse image formation zzso First of all, an initial zzso of the zzso image is performed by the zzso of the zzso function of an appropriate image zzso zzso the zzso and the additive zzso components are estimated, based on assumptions about their frequency content and then, they median zzso Finally, an zzso of a zzso image is obtained using the above zzso for the components and the application of the inverse image formation zzso zzso and quantitative experiments were conducted in a variety of image zzso including artificial and real images of finger, retinal images, transmission electron zzso zzso images, arm, palm and hand vein images and zzso X-ray zzso In all cases of distorted images, the proposed method had successfully removed the majority of the zzso effects and had not distorted the zzso images satisfying the main goal of retrospective zzso zzso The signal to noise ratio zzso or zzso the zzso of the zzso of variations is used as a quantitative measure of the zzso of intensity variations within the objects of the same class after zzso zzso In our experiments, for the purpose of evaluation the signal to noise ratio is calculated for two different classes zzso and zzso
