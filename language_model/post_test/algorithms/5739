There is no easy and reliable method to measure zzso although it is a common and important symptom after a brain zzso 

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a new method to measure zzso that can be easily used in clinical zzso 

A zzso model was created to estimate the components of the force resisting passive hand extension, namely zzso inertia zzso zzso elasticity zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso neural components zzso The model was validated in chronic stroke patients with varying degree of hand zzso zzso zzso was recorded to measure the muscle activity induced by the passive zzso 

The model was validated in 3 ways: zzso NC was reduced after an zzso nerve block, zzso NC correlated with the integrated zzso across subjects and in the same subject during the zzso nerve block, and zzso NC was zzso zzso In addition, the total resisting force and NC correlated with the modified zzso zzso According to the model, the neural and zzso components varied between zzso In most of the patients, but not in all, the NC zzso 

The results suggest that the model allows valid measurement of zzso in the upper zzso of chronic stroke patients and that it can be used to separate the neural component induced by the stretch zzso from resistance caused by altered muscle zzso
