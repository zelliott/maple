Most of source separation methods focus on stationary sources, so zzso statistics is necessary for successful zzso unless sources are temporally zzso For zzso sources, however, it was shown zzso Networks 8 zzso zzso that source separation could be achieved by zzso zzso In this paper, we consider the cost function proposed by zzso et zzso zzso Networks 8 zzso zzso and derive natural zzso learning zzso for both fully connected zzso network and zzso zzso Since our zzso employ the natural zzso method, they possess the zzso property and find a zzso descent direction unlike the zzso zzso Networks 8 zzso zzso We also show that our zzso are always locally stable, regardless of probability zzso of zzso zzso
