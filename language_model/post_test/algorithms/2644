Perfect compressed sensing zzso recovery can be achieved when a certain basis space is found to sparsely represent the original zzso However, due to the diversity of the signals, there does not exist a universal predetermined basis space that can sparsely represent all kinds of signals, which results in an unsatisfying zzso To improve the accuracy of recovered zzso this paper proposes an zzso basis zzso reconstruction zzso by minimizing the rank of an accumulated zzso zzso whose zzso approximate the optimal basis sparsely representing the original zzso The accumulated zzso is constructed to efficiently exploit the zzso statistical property of the zzso zzso Based on the theory of zzso zzso zzso reconstructs the original signal from its random projections under the observation that the constructed accumulated zzso is of low rank for most natural signals such as periodic signals and those coming from an zzso stationary zzso Experimental results show that the proposed zzso efficiently improves the reconstruction quality compared with the existing zzso
