To address challenging flexible zzso problems, a number of zzso zzso zzso large collections of candidate zzso To remove the zzso from such zzso a central problem in this context is to report a selection of zzso maximizing some geometric diversity zzso We make three contributions to this zzso First, we resort to geometric zzso so as to report selections maximizing the molecular volume or molecular surface area zzso of the zzso zzso strategies are developed, together with approximation zzso Second, to assess the efficacy of our zzso we investigate two zzso ensembles corresponding to a flexible loop of four protein zzso By focusing on the zzso of the selection, we show that our strategy matches the zzso of standard selection methods, but resorting to a number of zzso between one and two orders of magnitude zzso This observation is zzso explained using the zzso numbers of the union of balls of the zzso Finally, we replace the zzso selection problem in the context of zzso flexible zzso On the aforementioned systems, we show that using the zzso selected by our strategy can improve the result of the zzso zzso
