To study whether zzso the acquisition time for selective zzso artery zzso is feasible without image quality deterioration by adopting two-dimensional zzso parallel imaging zzso and short zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso 

zzso healthy volunteers were zzso zzso true zzso zzso imaging with a time spatial labeling inversion pulse was conducted using zzso or zzso and fat suppression by chemical shift selective zzso or STIR zzso Three groups of different scan conditions were assigned and zzso group A zzso factor 2 and zzso group B zzso factor zzso and zzso and group C zzso factor zzso and zzso The zzso contrast was zzso and the quality of artery zzso and overall image quality were zzso 

The mean scan time was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in groups A, B, and C, respectively, and was significantly shorter in groups B and C than in group A zzso The zzso contrast was significantly better in group C than in groups A and B zzso The scores for artery zzso and overall image quality were worse in group B than in groups A and zzso The differences were statistically significant zzso regarding the zzso branches of segments 4 and zzso Between group A and group C, which had similar scores, there were no statistically significant zzso 

Shortening the acquisition time for selective zzso artery zzso was feasible without deterioration of the image quality by the combination of zzso and STIR zzso It will facilitate using zzso zzso in clinical zzso
