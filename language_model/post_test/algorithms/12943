We have zzso zzso and characterized zzso zzso arrayed zzso grating zzso with zzso output for operation in the visible light wavelength zzso The zzso zzso was realized based on the zzso zzso rib zzso The device was designed for 1 zzso channel spacing with the wavelength ranging from zzso to zzso zzso The measured zzso loss is zzso zzso at the peak transmission spectrum and the adjacent zzso is less than zzso zzso The zzso device occupies an area of zzso zzso 15 zzso zzso zzso has the potential for integration with zzso in a monolithic zzso zzso device for visible light zzso zzso
