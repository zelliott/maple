In zzso chemistry, vast quantities of compounds are generated, and there is a need for zzso tools to efficiently build chemical compound zzso Several software tools for drawing and editing compound structures are available, but they lack options for automatic generation of chemical zzso We have implemented zzso an zzso zzso software tool that zzso the process of preparing custom-made zzso chemical zzso zzso automatically generates three-dimensional chemical libraries by zzso a chemical template and the functional groups of zzso The zzso user interface of zzso is zzso and a complete tutorial is zzso Several file formats are accepted by zzso and it is possible to filter the generated compounds according to different zzso zzso The compounds can be subject to force field zzso and the resulting three-dimensional structures recorded on commonly used file zzso zzso may be a valuable tool for investigators interested in using in zzso virtual screening tools, such as quantitative zzso relationship zzso or molecular zzso in order to prioritize compounds for further chemical zzso To demonstrate the usefulness of zzso we describe an example based on a zzso zzso zzso is available free of charge from our zzso at zzso zzso
