This study compared two test methods used to evaluate the zzso strength of zzso dental zzso The two test methods evaluated were the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Materials used in this investigation were from the same manufacturer zzso zzso and included zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso modified zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strength was determined with the use of both test methods after 1 week of conditioning in water at 37 degrees zzso Data were analyzed with the use of an zzso test and an zzso zzso test at significance level zzso Mean zzso strength zzso zzso 7) ranged from zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso test methods, zzso In both test methods, zzso was significantly stronger than all other zzso zzso In the zzso zzso test, zzso strength of zzso was significantly higher than zzso zzso and zzso and zzso was significantly stronger than zzso and zzso The zzso test method arrived at the same conclusions except that there was no significant difference between zzso and zzso zzso correlation revealed a significantly zzso zzso zzso positive and good correlation zzso zzso zzso in zzso strength between the two test zzso Although the zzso test has the advantage of utilizing small zzso the low zzso of this test method does not support the proposition that it is a more reliable test method when compared to the zzso zzso zzso zzso
