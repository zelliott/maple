This paper introduces a novel sparse zzso zzso zzso for embedded feature selection in zzso zzso Our proposed algorithm, called the relevance sample feature machine zzso is able to simultaneously choose the relevance samples and also the relevance features for zzso or zzso zzso We propose a zzso model in feature and sample zzso zzso a zzso approach and using zzso zzso the learned model by zzso is sparse in both sample and feature zzso The proposed zzso is an extension of the standard zzso algorithm, which only zzso for zzso in the sample zzso Experimental comparisons on synthetic as well as benchmark data sets show that zzso is successful in both feature selection zzso the irrelevant zzso and accurate zzso The main advantages of our proposed zzso are: less system complexity, better zzso and avoiding zzso and less zzso cost during the testing zzso
