We introduce a method for identifying the zzso zzso zzso in laboratory experiments based on the zzso solution of a pulse injection of a zzso zzso in a soil column zzso zzso packed with a homogeneous porous zzso This method takes into account the effect of boundary conditions such as no flux on the column zzso and it does not need a zzso knowledge of the zzso zzso zzso zzso applications of the method show that it is stable and robust and that the results are reasonably in accordance with those found using the classical maximum likelihood zzso
