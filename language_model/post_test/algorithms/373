Analysis of zzso variation for relevant genes and monitoring zzso segment transmission during selection are important approaches in plant breeding and zzso To minimize the number of required molecular markers for this purpose is crucial due to cost and time zzso To date, software for identification of the minimum number of required markers has been zzso for human zzso and is only partly matching the needs of plant scientists and zzso In addition, different software packages with insufficient zzso need to be combined to extract this information from available zzso sequence data, resulting in an zzso zzso process of data zzso 

zzso a computer program combining the detection of a minimum set of single zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso necessary for zzso differentiation with the subsequent zzso differentiation in plant populations has been zzso Its efficiency in finding minimum sets of zzso is comparable to other available program zzso 

A computer program detecting the minimum number of zzso for zzso discrimination and subsequent zzso differentiation has been developed, and its performance compared to other relevant zzso The main advantages of zzso especially for plant scientists, is the integration of procedures from sequence analysis to zzso selection within a single program, including both zzso and zzso zzso
