We present a zzso analysis of a normal form for traveling waves in one-dimensional excitable zzso The normal form that has been recently proposed on zzso grounds is given in the form of a differential delay zzso The normal form exhibits a zzso zzso zzso that may coalesce with a zzso zzso in a zzso point, and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We study here the zzso zzso for the propagation of a single pulse in a ring by means of a center zzso reduction, and for a wave train by means of a zzso analysis leading to a real zzso equation as the corresponding zzso zzso Both the center zzso reduction and the zzso analysis show that the zzso zzso is always zzso independent of the zzso This may have links to cardiac zzso which have so far been believed to be stable zzso emanating from a zzso zzso We discuss the implications for cardiac zzso and revisit the instability in some excitable media where the zzso had been believed to be zzso In particular, we show that our condition for the onset of the zzso zzso zzso with the well known zzso condition for cardiac zzso
