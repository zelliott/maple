An zzso system for active noise reduction in an acoustic duct is zzso The system is based on a modification of a least mean square zzso zzso called zzso with zzso error path zzso The system was assembled and examined on a laboratory test stand in the Laboratory of Active Noise Reduction zzso of the Central Institute for zzso Protection zzso zzso The structure of the test stand, the block structure of the active noise reduction system, the basic assumption concerning the applied zzso algorithm, and examples of measured effectiveness of the system for various kinds of noise are zzso
