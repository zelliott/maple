A selection experiment with a selection and a control line maintained for eight generations was set up to study efficacy of selection for a short zzso from weaning to zzso after weaning the first litter and to estimate genetic variation in the Dutch zzso zzso zzso were recorded without zzso zzso intervals up to 234 d were zzso A mating scheme with 10 mating groups was used to avoid zzso Distribution of intervals from weaning to zzso was described by a mixture of a normal and an exponential zzso Between lines, both underlying zzso were similar, but the contribution to the total distribution was zzso From generation 4 zzso intervals were significantly shorter in the selection line than in the control zzso zzso within lines, generations, and mating groups varied to a large zzso Response per unit selection differential was calculated for original data and three sets of transformed data, both with and without correction for unequal zzso zzso zzso responses were more precise and zzso when data were zzso and when corrected for unequal zzso zzso The assumed best estimate of the realized zzso was zzso The zzso in the foundation population was estimated at zzso zzso zzso using an animal model including all genetic relationships in the zzso It was concluded that genetic selection decreases the average zzso from weaning to zzso by reducing the number of zzso with a record in the exponential part of the zzso
