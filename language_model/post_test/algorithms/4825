zzso plot is one of the important techniques used for visually representing the heart rate zzso It is valuable due to its ability to display zzso aspects of the data zzso However, the problem lies in capturing zzso information of the plot zzso The standard zzso used in zzso the zzso plot zzso zzso measure the gross zzso of the time series zzso zzso of advanced methods for capturing zzso properties pose a significant zzso In this paper, we propose a novel zzso zzso zzso Measure zzso to zzso the zzso aspect of the zzso zzso In contrast to zzso and zzso the zzso incorporates zzso variation of the zzso 

First, we have derived expressions for zzso Then the sensitivity of zzso has been shown by measuring all zzso before and after zzso of the zzso For each case study, zzso zzso plots were constructed for three groups of subjects zzso zzso Heart Failure zzso and those with zzso zzso Rhythm zzso and the new measure zzso was zzso along with zzso and zzso zzso analysis distribution was used to define the level of significance of mean and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso for different groups of zzso 

zzso is defined based on the zzso at different lags of the time series, hence giving an in depth measurement of the correlation structure of the zzso zzso A surrogate analysis was performed, and the sensitivity of the proposed zzso was found to be higher as compared to the standard zzso Two case studies were conducted for recognizing zzso and zzso heart failure zzso subjects from those with zzso using the zzso database and demonstrated the usefulness of the proposed zzso in biomedical zzso zzso was found to be a more significant zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso and zzso in discriminating zzso from zzso zzso In case of assessing zzso subjects also against zzso zzso was again found to be the most significant zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso can be used as an additional zzso plot zzso to detect zzso
