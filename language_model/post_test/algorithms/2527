In the zzso trio design, unrelated children affected with a disease are zzso along with their zzso Information may also be collected on environmental factors in the zzso The design permits zzso and testing of genetic effects and zzso zzso Recently, it has been demonstrated that when zzso are measured at a zzso test zzso population zzso can create zzso zzso That is, the environmental factor can appear to modify the disease risk associated with zzso at the test locus without zzso the disease risk of zzso at the zzso zzso One zzso approach that is robust to zzso interaction requires the environmental factor to also be available on an unaffected sibling of the affected zzso We explore the source of zzso interaction and suggest an alternate approach that zzso its effects using zzso zzso Our approach is based on adjusting the risk model using ancestry zzso markers or random markers measured on the affected child and does not require data on unaffected zzso We apply an approach to generating zzso data, implemented in a zzso R package soon to be released on the Comprehensive R zzso Network zzso
