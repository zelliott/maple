A new approach for zzso system identification and control based on modular neural networks zzso is proposed in this zzso The zzso complexity of neural identification can be greatly reduced if the whole system is zzso into several zzso This is obtained using a zzso zzso Each local zzso model is associated with a zzso zzso These are also implemented by neural zzso The switching between the neural controllers is done by a zzso zzso also implemented by neural networks, that tracks the different operating zzso The proposed multiple zzso and control strategy has been successfully tested on simulated laboratory scale zzso zzso
