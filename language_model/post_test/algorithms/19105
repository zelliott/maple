In the present study, the interaction of two structurally related zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso has been zzso The binding of zzso to zzso has been characterized by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso and simultaneous binding of the well-known inhibitor zzso zzso in the presence of zzso clearly rule out the possibility of zzso binding at the zzso site of the zzso The spectral overlap between the zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso offers the opportunity to explore the binding site of zzso using zzso resonance energy transfer zzso zzso studies between zzso and zzso indicate that zzso is bound to zzso with its transition zzso nearly perpendicular to that of zzso Competitive binding of zzso with another fluorescent probe zzso zzso zzso having a zzso binding site, indicates that zzso and TNS bind at the same zzso site of the zzso zzso The difference in the interactions of two zzso structurally similar zzso with the same zzso may find its application in the design of specific zzso mimics or zzso of the zzso
