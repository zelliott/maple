The safe use of zzso pacing zzso to terminate rapid zzso zzso zzso zzso length zzso zzso is predicated on the ability of zzso zzso zzso zzso to distinguish rapid VT from zzso zzso zzso We set out to compare the time to device charging following the induction of zzso of various zzso multizone detection zzso for rapid zzso zzso 

Data on the time to device charging following the induction of zzso at the time to device zzso were collected on 62 consecutive patients in a zzso prospective cohort zzso zzso programming for the Boston zzso zzso and zzso Jude Medical devices was based on prior clinically validated zzso zzso subjects were studied zzso Scientific zzso 16, zzso zzso 27, zzso Jude Medical zzso zzso and 124 tests for zzso detection were performed zzso Scientific zzso 32, zzso zzso 54, zzso Jude Medical zzso zzso Mean time to charging was significantly prolonged in the Boston Scientific group as was the percentage of tests where charge initiation occurred zzso seconds from zzso zzso zzso and zzso seconds and zzso zzso and zzso for the Boston zzso zzso and zzso Jude Medical groups, respectively, P zzso zzso zzso was the first therapy administered in zzso of tests in the Boston Scientific zzso 

The Boston Scientific multizone zzso discrimination zzso results in a prolonged time to zzso zzso and consequently, prolonged time to appropriate initiation of device zzso Further studies are needed to determine whether prolonged detection times lead to clinically significant zzso
