To zzso dose distribution for zzso zzso for prostate cancer, we have developed a new zzso named zzso Model zzso In this study, we compared the zzso with geometric zzso zzso 

The zzso was used to zzso the dose distribution by finding the best dwell time zzso zzso requires zzso inside the clinical target volume zzso and critical zzso These zzso generate attraction or zzso based on specific dose zzso After calculations were performed repeatedly until the attraction and zzso forces reached zzso the optimal dwell time distribution was zzso We compared the zzso with GO for 10 patients using zzso zzso 

The zzso ranged from 23 to 48 zzso and the zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso for GO and zzso zzso This indicates that the dose zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso were higher for zzso than for zzso The zzso zzso was zzso and zzso for GO and zzso zzso 

The zzso proved to be superior to GO in minimizing the dose to normal structures and in improving dose zzso for the target while reducing the dose to normal zzso
