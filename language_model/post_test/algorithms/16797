Parkinson disease zzso is an age-related deterioration of certain nerve systems, which affects movement, balance, and muscle control of zzso zzso is one of the common diseases which affect zzso of people older than zzso A new zzso scheme based on support zzso machine zzso selected features to train rotation forest zzso ensemble zzso is presented for improving diagnosis of zzso The zzso contains records of voice zzso from 31 people, 23 with zzso and each record in the zzso is defined with 22 zzso The diagnosis model first makes use of a linear zzso to select ten most relevant features from zzso As a second step of the zzso model, six different zzso are trained with the subset of zzso zzso at the third step, the zzso of zzso are improved by the zzso of zzso ensemble zzso zzso The results of the experiments are evaluated using three zzso zzso accuracy zzso Kappa zzso zzso and Area under the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Performance measures of two base zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated an apparent increase in zzso diagnosis accuracy compared to similar studies in zzso After all, application of zzso ensemble zzso scheme improved zzso diagnosis in 5 of 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained about zzso accuracy in zzso ensemble of zzso (a zzso zzso zzso algorithm, which is a quite high performance for Parkinson disease zzso
