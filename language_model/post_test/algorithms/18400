In our studies with spontaneously zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso rats, we observed zzso zzso rats with cardiac zzso determined by a greater left zzso zzso mass zzso weight zzso ratio zzso than that of zzso zzso zzso Thus we compared the following parameters in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso as index of total surface area of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso area of cardiac zzso zzso collagen volume zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was intermediate between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso rats zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A positive correlation between blood pressure and zzso was found in zzso whereas no such relationship was observed in zzso or zzso zzso Cell zzso and zzso area were not significantly different in zzso and zzso zzso these values were significantly higher than those of zzso zzso The cell length was smaller but the zzso was similar in zzso compared with zzso zzso muscles isolated from the zzso of zzso and zzso were stiffer than those from zzso zzso zzso a greater level of zzso zzso was detected in zzso and zzso compared with zzso zzso These findings demonstrate blood zzso cardiac zzso in zzso zzso zzso
