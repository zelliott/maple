The prevention of zzso events is of paramount importance in the daily management of zzso zzso The use of short-term prediction zzso of the subcutaneous zzso zzso concentration may contribute significantly toward this zzso The literature suggests that, although the recent zzso profile is a prominent predictor of zzso the overall patient's context greatly impacts its accurate zzso The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of a support zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso method on zzso zzso 

We extend our zzso model to predict separately the nocturnal events during sleep and the zzso zzso zzso ones over zzso and zzso horizons using information on recent zzso profile, meals, insulin zzso and physical activities for a zzso threshold of zzso We also introduce zzso additional variables accounting for zzso nocturnal zzso due to zzso zzso exercise, and zzso zzso predictions are compared with those from two other machine learning zzso 

The method is assessed on a zzso of 15 patients with type 1 diabetes under zzso zzso zzso zzso events are predicted with zzso sensitivity for both horizons and with time lags of zzso and zzso zzso As concerns the zzso events, when physical activities are not considered, the sensitivity is zzso and zzso for a zzso and zzso horizon, respectively, with both time lags being less than zzso However, when such information is introduced, the zzso sensitivity decreases by zzso and zzso zzso Both nocturnal and zzso predictions show a high zzso zzso 

zzso suggest that zzso prediction using zzso can be accurate and performs better in most zzso and nocturnal cases compared with other zzso It is advised that the problem of zzso prediction should be handled differently for nocturnal and zzso periods as regards input variables and interpretation of zzso
