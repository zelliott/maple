Word matches are often used in sequence comparison methods, either as a measure of sequence similarity or in the first search steps of zzso such as zzso or zzso The zzso statistic is the number of matches of words of k letters between two zzso Recent advances have been made in the characterization of this statistic and in the approximation of its zzso Here, these results are extended to the case of approximate word zzso We zzso the exact value of the zzso of the zzso statistic for the case of a uniform letter distribution, and introduce a method to provide accurate approximations of the zzso in the remaining zzso This enables the distribution of zzso to be zzso for typical situations arising in biological zzso We apply these results to the identification of zzso zzso and show that this method detects such sequences with a high zzso The ability to approximate the distribution of zzso for both exact and approximate word matches will enable the use of this statistic in a more precise manner for sequence comparison, database searches, and identification of zzso factor binding zzso
