Current guidelines for the prevention of cardiovascular disease emphasize the importance of assessing global cardiovascular risk, but there is evidence that risk is often assessed zzso 

To compare general zzso global cardiovascular risk in French primary care patients with estimates based on established zzso systems, and to identify factors accounting for any mismatch between the zzso 

Data on patients, aged 50 years or older, seen during two zzso periods were provided by 619 general zzso Physicians rated each patient's cardiovascular risk as low, moderate or high, according to their zzso in addition, risk was assessed using the zzso and zzso coronary risk evaluation zzso zzso zzso 

A total of zzso patients aged greater or equal to 50 years were zzso Of zzso patients with no previous history of cardiovascular disease, zzso were considered by their physicians to be at low risk of cardiovascular disease and zzso to be at high zzso In that population, zzso of patients rated as high risk according to the zzso system and zzso rated as high risk according to SCORE system were incorrectly assessed by their zzso similar results were observed in patient zzso based on whether or not patients had received treatment for zzso zzso zzso analysis showed poor agreement between physician risk assessment and both the zzso and SCORE zzso zzso 

This study zzso the mismatch between zzso cardiovascular risk and the risk assessed using scoring systems, especially for high-risk zzso
