The purpose of this study was to demonstrate a simple and fast method for solving the zzso Bloch zzso First, the zzso Bloch equations were reduced to a homogeneous linear differential zzso and then a simple equation was derived to solve it using a zzso zzso The zzso of this method was investigated by comparing with the zzso solutions in the case of constant zzso zzso There was a good agreement between them, indicating the zzso of this zzso As a further example, this method was applied to the zzso Bloch equations in the zzso exchange model for chemical exchange zzso transfer zzso or zzso zzso transfer zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and the zzso and asymmetry zzso were calculated from their zzso They were also calculated using the zzso zzso zzso method for zzso There was also a good agreement between them, and this method was much faster than the zzso zzso In conclusion, this method will be useful for analyzing the complex zzso or zzso contrast mechanism and/or investigating the optimal conditions for zzso or zzso zzso
