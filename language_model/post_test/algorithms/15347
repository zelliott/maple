The objective of this study was to establish a novel prediction system of drug zzso in humans by utilizing human zzso zzso Based on the transport index zzso a newly defined zzso calculated by taking account of the change in drug zzso because of zzso on the zzso side and the amounts accumulated in the tissue and transported to the zzso side, the zzso of drugs in rank order as well as the fraction of dose absorbed zzso in humans were zzso Human zzso zzso taken from zzso colitis or Crohn's disease patients were mounted in a zzso chamber and transport studies were performed to evaluate the zzso of drugs, including zzso a very low permeable marker, zzso a low permeable marker, and zzso a high permeable zzso Although apparent zzso zzso calculated by the conventional equation did not reflect human zzso values for zzso zzso and zzso zzso values were well correlated with zzso values, which are described by 100 zzso zzso - e zzso f zzso zzso - zzso zzso Based on this zzso zzso values in humans for other test drugs were predicted zzso indicating that our new system utilizing human zzso zzso would be valuable for predicting oral drug zzso in zzso
