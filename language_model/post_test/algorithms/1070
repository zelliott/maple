To evaluate the agreement between cardiac output zzso zzso obtained by a new dye dilution technique using pulse dye zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the direct zzso method zzso 

Prospective clinical study in a university hospital, cardiac surgery intensive care zzso 

zzso cardiac surgery patients after admission to the intensive care unit (six were excluded due to a low pulse signal quality using the zzso zzso 

Mean CO was zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso There was a good correlation between zzso and TD ( zzso and between zzso and F ( zzso zzso and precision between zzso and TD were zzso zzso and zzso zzso between zzso and zzso In general, zzso determined lower CO values than TD and zzso Especially in patients with CO below 5 zzso zzso underestimated CO in comparison to TD and F zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso between zzso and TD showed good agreement for the normal to high CO zzso However, agreement was poor in patients with low zzso In the latter patient group zzso showed relevant zzso of CO compared to TD and zzso Due to these limitations zzso cannot entirely replace the pulmonary artery zzso for CO zzso
