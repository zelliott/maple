Short chain fatty acids zzso zzso zzso and zzso are important energy sources for zzso and are assumed to play a key role in gut zzso Local effects of zzso have been investigated, but less is known about whole body metabolism of these zzso The aim of the present study was to zzso the role of the gut and liver in zzso exchange of zzso in humans in zzso 

Twenty-two patients undergoing major upper abdominal surgery were zzso Blood was sampled from a zzso artery, the portal and a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso blood flow was measured using zzso Duplex zzso zzso were measured on a liquid zzso system combined with mass zzso 

zzso were released by the gut, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the liver was significant for zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively and zzso gut zzso Liver zzso of zzso was not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso release was significant for zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso release of zzso was not significantly different from zero zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and previous zzso zzso did not affect gut release of zzso 

This is the first in zzso study on the role of the gut and liver in zzso exchange in humans in zzso It is shown that zzso zzso release by the gut is zzso by zzso zzso
