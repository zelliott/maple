zzso events processes are ubiquitous across a great range of important health, zzso and public policy applications, but models for these processes have serious zzso Alternative zzso often produce different zzso concerning treatment effects due to bias and zzso We recommend a robust strategy for the zzso of effects in medical treatments, social conditions, individual zzso and public policy programs in repeated events survival models under three common conditions: zzso across individuals, dependence across the number of events, and both zzso and event zzso We compare several models for zzso zzso event data that exhibit both zzso and event zzso The conditional frailty model best accounts for the various conditions of zzso and event dependence by using a frailty term, stratification, and gap time zzso of the risk zzso We examine the performance of zzso event models that are commonly used in applied work using zzso Carlo simulations, and apply the findings to data on chronic zzso disease and zzso zzso
