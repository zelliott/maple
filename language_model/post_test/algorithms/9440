zzso zzso is a costly complication occurring in zzso to zzso of patients after coronary artery bypass zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment should be directed toward and limited to selected high-risk zzso zzso zzso risk factors, we sought to develop an zzso to predict the relative risk of developing zzso zzso zzso in patients undergoing zzso 

Data were extracted from our Society of zzso Surgeons Database on zzso patients undergoing zzso between January 1995 and July zzso We used zzso risk factors to develop a zzso zzso equation zzso for the development of zzso zzso zzso A total of zzso patients had complete data and were used to construct the final zzso The model was used to compare the predicted probability of zzso zzso with the known outcome in the patients divided into zzso by zzso zzso procedures were used to determine the confidence limits of the beta zzso 

A zzso model was developed with 14 significant zzso Those showing the greatest zzso influence included the patient age, the need for prolonged ventilation (24 hours or zzso the use of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The model showed acceptable zzso between observed and predicted zzso a receiver operating characteristic curve area of zzso and zzso probability of zzso When applied to the patient population, the calculated risk in those who did not develop zzso was zzso zzso zzso and for those with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A validated zzso risk zzso for developing zzso zzso zzso can reliably zzso patients undergoing zzso into high-risk and low-risk zzso This may be used preoperatively to appropriately target high-risk patients for aggressive zzso zzso
