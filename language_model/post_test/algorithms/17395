zzso the usefulness of acoustic and zzso measures for detecting effects of zzso zzso treatment on vocal function of individuals with idiopathic Parkinson's zzso 

Compare recordings of zzso sustained at a target comfortable zzso level obtained before and after L-dopa treatment from 15 individuals with idiopathic Parkinson's disease showing signs of zzso 

A simultaneous zzso zzso and zzso recording technique was employed to record zzso zzso by subjects before and after L-dopa zzso zzso were developed to derive from the recorded signal measures of fundamental frequency, zzso zzso rate, speed zzso zzso of zzso opening to closing time time), and zzso and long-term zzso zzso A series of paired Student zzso tests or signed rank tests were performed to compare the zzso and zzso groups on these zzso 

zzso of speed quotient, acoustic zzso zzso zzso zzso and the extent of zzso derived from acoustic intensity contours were found to significantly decrease after zzso Sound pressure level tended to increase after zzso The acoustic jitter zzso frequency zzso and the extent of zzso derived from zzso signals did not significantly differentiate between zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso measures of acoustic and zzso signals are useful in monitoring the zzso response of Parkinson's disease, reflecting decrease of zzso rigidity and zzso and long-term acoustic zzso fluctuation after L-dopa zzso
