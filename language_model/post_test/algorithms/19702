In present, the most basically used parameters for speaker identification are linear zzso coding zzso zzso Mel frequency zzso zzso zzso First in this paper only zzso was used as the zzso and then zzso zzso was combined with zzso as zzso The zzso recognition rate of 50 speakers increased from zzso to zzso and the zzso recognition rate of 50 speakers increased from zzso to zzso This test shows that zzso complexity, as a new zzso can be applied to speaker zzso
