zzso zzso or new tumors may develop after zzso of local zzso in the brain, and additional zzso treatments are often needed for previously treated zzso It is critical to re-establish the dose zzso delivered during the previous treatment in the current patient zzso so that the previous dose zzso can be accurately taken into consideration in the design of the current treatment zzso The difficulty in zzso the previous treatment dose zzso in the current patient geometry arises from the fact that the patient position at the time of zzso is different from that at the previous treatment zzso zzso re-entry of the previous zzso zzso zzso and couch and zzso angles into the new treatment plan would result in incorrect beam zzso relative to the new patient zzso and therefore incorrect display of the previous dose zzso on the current patient zzso To address this issue, a method has been developed so that the previous dose zzso can be accurately zzso in the framework of the current brain zzso The method involves 3 zzso zzso zzso transformation of beams from machine coordinate system to patient coordinate system in the previous zzso zzso transformation of beams from patient coordinate system in the previous treatment to patient coordinate system in the current zzso and zzso transformation of beams from patient coordinate system in the current treatment to machine coordinate zzso The transformation zzso used in the second transformation are determined by registration using a mutual zzso zzso with which the old and new zzso zzso zzso scan sets are registered automatically without human zzso A series of transformation zzso are derived to calculate the zzso zzso the zzso couch, and zzso angles of the beams for the previous treatment in the current patient zzso and the previous dose zzso are zzso on the current CT zzso The method has been proven to be successful and zzso
