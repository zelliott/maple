The process of pattern retrieval in a zzso model in which a random zzso component is added to the otherwise zzso synaptic zzso is studied by computer zzso The introduction of the zzso component is found to increase the fraction of random zzso that zzso to the memory zzso However, the size of the basin of attraction of a memory state does not show any significant change when asymmetry is introduced in the synaptic zzso We show that this is due to the fact that the zzso fixed points, which are zzso by the introduction of zzso have very small zzso of zzso The convergence time to zzso zzso zzso increases faster than that for the memory states as the asymmetry zzso is zzso The possibility of convergence to zzso fixed points is greatly reduced if a suitable upper limit is set for the convergence zzso This prescription works better if the synaptic zzso has an zzso zzso
