Image zzso in nuclear medicine is a common problem that can lead to artifacts in reconstructed zzso We evaluate a modified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acquisition and reconstruction method for truncated zzso which is guided by zzso zzso The method nearly eliminates zzso zzso and is ideal for cardiac zzso We demonstrate its application on phantom and clinical cardiac zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scans were acquired on 14 patients, and on an zzso cardiac chest zzso The original 34 zzso 34 zzso zzso zzso projections were truncated to simulate a small 16 zzso 16 zzso zzso zzso Data were reconstructed in three ways: zzso zzso and standard reconstruction zzso which was our gold zzso zzso truncated and standard reconstruction zzso and zzso truncated and a modified reconstruction zzso zzso and zzso were both compared with zzso by comparing relative count ratios in the heart, looking at the change in zzso zzso size, and comparing zzso correlation zzso 

Compared with zzso the use of zzso for small zzso clinical imaging incurred an average count ratio error greater than zzso and decreased the calculated zzso size by zzso For zzso the average count ratio error was only zzso and the zzso size was only decreased by zzso compared with zzso When we plotted zzso against zzso a correlation zzso of zzso was zzso and when we plotted zzso against zzso a correlation zzso of zzso was zzso Comparing zzso with zzso in the phantom study produced an average count ratio error greater than zzso zzso produced an error of zzso compared with zzso 

zzso zzso due to small zzso cameras in cardiac zzso can lead to significant zzso zzso guided by zzso CT reconstruction shows promise in reducing these zzso
