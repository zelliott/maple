zzso zzso are subject to sustained and irregular synaptic activity which causes important fluctuations of the membrane potential zzso We review here different methods to characterize this activity and its impact on spike zzso The zzso fluctuating zzso model of synaptic activity provides the starting point of a variety of methods for the analysis of zzso zzso zzso In this model, the synaptic zzso and zzso zzso are described by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The matching of zzso recorded zzso zzso to an zzso theoretical expression derived from the model allows the extraction of parameters characterizing the synaptic zzso zzso This analysis can be zzso by the matching of experimental zzso power spectral zzso zzso to a theoretical template, even though the unexpected zzso properties of experimental zzso limit the precision of this latter zzso Building on this zzso characterization of synaptic activity, we also propose methods to zzso and zzso evaluate zzso averages of synaptic zzso preceding zzso This analysis points to an essential role for synaptic zzso zzso in determining spike zzso The presented methods are evaluated using controlled zzso injection in cortical zzso in zzso with the zzso zzso We review their applications to the analysis of in zzso zzso recordings in cat association cortex, which suggest a zzso role for zzso in determining both zzso and zzso dynamics of cortical zzso embedded in active zzso
