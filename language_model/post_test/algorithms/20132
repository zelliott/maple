The aim of this study was to compare simultaneous stimulation of multiple zzso to zzso stimulation in a retinal zzso 

A platinum zzso array was implanted into the zzso space in six normally sighted zzso zzso zzso activity from the primary visual zzso in response to retinal stimulation was zzso zzso zzso yield of responses, dynamic zzso and the spread of retinal zzso were measured for three modes of zzso single zzso zzso zzso horizontal zzso and column zzso vertical zzso 

zzso of the best zzso and columns was found to elicit activity with higher yield and lower charge thresholds per zzso compared to the best single zzso Dynamic ranges between the three modes were zzso As expected, peak zzso measured for columns and zzso were lower than those measured for single zzso zzso of retinal zzso determined by the increase in threshold with distance in the zzso from the best site, was found to be similar between zzso and zzso stimulation but dependent on zzso 

The lower zzso higher yield, equivalent dynamic zzso and equivalent spread of retinal zzso observed from simultaneous stimulation of multiple zzso may be due to current and/or neural zzso within the zzso Such stimulation techniques could be useful for the presentation of lines and edges of objects using a zzso retinal zzso with low zzso zzso Furthermore, the results suggest that more complex visual processing strategies in addition to sequential stimulation of individual zzso should be considered for retinal zzso
