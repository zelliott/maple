We present an zzso time stepping scheme based on the zzso method of Barth and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1633 zzso to zzso integrate the zzso equation with a zzso zzso This approach allows us to use (on zzso a time step for the strong zzso force integration corresponding to half the period of the fastest bond zzso without compromising the slow degrees of freedom in the zzso We show with simple examples how the dynamic step size zzso integration operators, and discuss some of the limitations of such zzso The method introduced uses a slightly more accurate inner zzso than zzso to accommodate the larger zzso The zzso time step approach reproduces zzso features of the bovine pancreatic zzso inhibitor zzso test system zzso to the one used in the original introduction of zzso compared to zzso zzso but with energies that are shifted with respect to both zzso and traditional zzso versions of zzso Although the introduction of longer steps has the effect of systematically heating the bonded components of the potential, the zzso fluctuations of the slow degrees of freedom are reproduced zzso The purpose of this paper is to display a mechanism by which the resonance traditionally associated with using time steps corresponding to half the period of zzso in molecular dynamics can be zzso This has theoretical utility in terms of designing zzso integration zzso key point is that by factoring a zzso so that time steps are not constant one can recover stability with an overall zzso time step at a resonance zzso There are, of course, limitations to this approach associated with the complicated, zzso nature of the zzso zzso potential zzso it is not as straightforward as the linear test problem we use to motivate the zzso While the basic notion remains in the full zzso problem, it is easier to see the effects when zzso is considered to be zzso is, we do not view our method as a zzso of zzso zzso we associate the zzso with the environment, for example, a water bath (with gamma approximately 90 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 24, zzso zzso All zzso approaches to MD are stabilized by large physical zzso but here, we are really using it only to show that the resonance frequency can be zzso Another simplifying assumption used in this paper is zzso hydrogen (we take the hydrogen mass to be 10 zzso view here is that we are interested primarily in the zzso degrees of freedom, and this approach has effects similar to bond freezing and united atom treatments of zzso So from the point of view of zzso applications, the method described here is best suited to studies in which water is not explicit (so that zzso in the problem can really be viewed as environmental zzso and the interest is in slow dynamics where the effects of hydrogen are zzso There are a number of parameters in the zzso method and the one derived here, and we cannot in a short paper address all adjustments, so our primary goal as a first pass is to show that stability can be recovered for a set of zzso forced (and hence zzso bond zzso and compare stability to zzso zzso
