Energy discriminating zzso counting zzso detectors can be subject to a wide range of flux rates if applied in clinical zzso Even when the incident rate is a small fraction of the zzso maximum periodic rate No, pulse pileup leads to count rate losses and spectral zzso Although the deterministic effects can be corrected, the zzso effect of pileup on image noise is not well understood and may limit the performance of zzso counting zzso zzso the authors devise a method to determine the detector count statistics and imaging zzso 

The detector count statistics are derived zzso for an idealized pileup model with delta zzso of a zzso zzso These statistics are then used to zzso the performance zzso zzso zzso for both single material and material decomposition contrast detection tasks via the zzso lower bound zzso as a function of the detector input count zzso With more realistic zzso and bipolar pulse pileup models of a zzso zzso the imaging task performance is determined by zzso Carlo simulations and also zzso by a zzso method based solely on the mean detected output zzso zzso counting performance at different count rates is compared with ideal energy integration, which is unaffected by count zzso 

The authors found that an ideal zzso counting detector with perfect energy resolution zzso energy integration for our contrast detection tasks, but when the input count rate exceeds zzso zzso many of these benefits zzso The benefit with zzso contrast falls rapidly with increased count rate while water contrast is not as sensitive to count zzso The performance with a delta pulse model is overoptimistic when compared to the more realistic bipolar pulse zzso The zzso approximation predicts imaging performance very close to the prediction from zzso Carlo zzso The zzso image with maximum zzso ratio from dual energy imaging with ideal zzso counting is only slightly better than with dual zzso energy integration, and with a bipolar pulse model, energy integration zzso zzso counting for this particular metric because of the count rate zzso However, the material resolving capability of zzso counting can be superior to energy integration with dual zzso even in the presence of pileup because of the energy information available to zzso zzso 

A zzso efficient zzso approximation of the count statistics that is based on the mean output spectrum can accurately predict imaging zzso This enables zzso counting system designers to directly relate the effect of pileup to its impact on imaging statistics and how to best take advantage of the benefits of energy discriminating zzso counting zzso such as material separation with spectral zzso
