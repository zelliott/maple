The current study zzso artificial intelligence methods to identify prostate zzso patients at low risk for zzso zzso zzso If patients can be assigned accurately to a low risk group, unnecessary zzso zzso zzso can be avoided, thereby reducing morbidity and zzso 

A zzso technology for simple zzso analysis was trained and validated using patient data from a large database zzso zzso to derive low risk zzso values for zzso sum and prostate specific zzso zzso zzso An zzso analysis was used to derive a low risk zzso value for clinical zzso zzso These zzso values then were applied to 2 zzso smaller databases zzso and 330 patients, zzso from separate zzso 

The zzso protocol derived zzso values of zzso or zzso 6 for zzso sum and zzso or zzso zzso zzso for zzso The zzso analysis yielded a clinical zzso stage low risk zzso value of zzso or zzso zzso When these zzso values were applied to the larger database, zzso of patients were classified as being at low risk for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When the same zzso values were applied to the smaller databases, between 11 and zzso of patients were classified as low risk with a zzso rate of between zzso and zzso 

The results of the current study indicate that a population of prostate zzso patients at low risk for zzso zzso zzso can be identified accurately using a simple decision zzso that considers zzso zzso zzso sum, and clinical zzso zzso The risk of zzso zzso zzso in these patients is zzso or zzso zzso therefore, pelvic zzso zzso dissection may be avoided zzso The implications of these findings in surgical and zzso treatment are zzso
