Previous studies in patients with sustained zzso zzso zzso have demonstrated the efficacy of surgical and zzso zzso procedures based on zzso mapping during zzso Since extensive zzso or zzso mapping may be zzso due to time constraints or patient zzso we sought to define characteristics of the zzso zzso zzso during VT that could suggest a particular zzso region of origin and thus facilitate mapping zzso zzso mapping was performed during 182 zzso in 108 patients with prior zzso zzso of either the anterior or inferior zzso zzso sites of origin zzso from which greater than or equal to 40 zzso of zzso electrical activity was consistently zzso were identified with use of zzso zzso zzso or zzso (85 zzso zzso mapping (both methods used in 57 zzso zzso zzso obtained during these zzso were characterized by four features: location of zzso bundle branch block type zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso R wave progression zzso A specific combination of these four features was associated with a particular zzso region containing the mapped site of origin in 87 zzso zzso of zzso An association zzso than or equal to zzso positive zzso zzso was more likely to be found in the presence of left, as opposed to right, bundle branch block type patterns zzso zzso vs zzso zzso p less than zzso and in the presence of VT related to inferior, as opposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso p less than zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
