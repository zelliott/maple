To understand how genetic architecture translates between zzso levels, we mapped the genetic architecture of growth and defense within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso line zzso We measured plant growth using traditional size zzso and zzso growth zzso This population contains genetic variation in both the nuclear and zzso zzso allowing us to separate their zzso The zzso zzso regulated a significant zzso in growth but not defense, which was due to zzso zzso Furthermore, growth zzso to an zzso model of genetic architecture, while defense metabolism was more of a zzso zzso We found a lack of zzso between quantitative trait zzso zzso regulating defense and those regulating zzso Given the published evidence proving the link between zzso and growth, this is likely a false negative result caused by the limited population zzso This size limitation creates an inability to test the entire potential genetic landscape possible between these two zzso We uncovered a significant effect of zzso on growth once we accounted for zzso differences in growth zzso zzso other growth zzso can mask the effects of defense upon zzso zzso direct links across zzso zzso is fraught with zzso we identify issues complicating this zzso
