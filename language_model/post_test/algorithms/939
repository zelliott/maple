In the context of dynamic zzso Carlo simulations on a model protein confined to a zzso zzso the interplay of protein size and zzso structure, and the requirements for an zzso transition to a unique native state, are zzso Small model proteins having a primary sequence consisting of a central bend neutral region flanked by two tails having an alternating zzso pattern of zzso are seen to undergo a continuous transition to a zzso collapsed zzso On increasing the length of the tails, the zzso structural motif is found to be in equilibrium with a zzso zzso Further increase of the tail length results in the shift of the structural equilibrium to the zzso zzso The random zzso to zzso transition is of an zzso character, but while the central turn is always the desired native zzso the location of the turns involving the two external strands is zzso That is, zzso having the external stands that are two zzso out of register are also observed in the transition zzso Introduction into the primary sequence of two additional regions that are at the very least neutral toward turn formation produces an zzso transition to the unique, native, zzso zzso Various factors that can augment the stability of the native zzso are zzso Overall, these folding simulations strongly indicate that the general rules of zzso protein folding are rather zzso one requires a general pattern of zzso zzso that allow the protein to have a zzso interior and exterior and the presence of regions in the zzso acid sequence that at the very least are locally indifferent to turn zzso Since no zzso interactions between zzso and zzso zzso are required to produce a unique zzso zzso these simulations strongly suggest that site specificity is involved in structural zzso
