zzso inflammation is known to affect drug disposition in the zzso This study sought to relate and zzso changes in zzso zzso of zzso with changes in zzso architecture and physiology in zzso zzso zzso electron zzso was used to assess zzso changes in zzso and zzso of zzso rat zzso The disposition of zzso was assessed in the zzso rat liver using the multiple indicator dilution zzso zzso extraction and mean transit time were determined from zzso profiles using a zzso zzso zzso parameters were derived from a zzso zzso based organ zzso zzso zzso relationships were then explored between the changes in zzso drug disposition and zzso zzso activity and iron zzso zzso treatment induced the appearance of zzso zzso and zzso shaped zzso in rat zzso zzso from zzso rats had zzso to zzso significantly higher zzso zzso zzso and iron tissue zzso but lower zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso were significantly impaired in zzso rats and could be correlated with altered iron store and zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso systemic inflammation alters zzso zzso and zzso and consequently influences zzso disposition of zzso
