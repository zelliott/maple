An improved zzso sequence magnetic resonance zzso imaging technique was developed to simultaneously acquire a zzso MR zzso zzso and a blood zzso zzso MR zzso zzso in a single MR acquisition at 3 zzso zzso and zzso require conflicting scan conditions zzso zzso zzso profile, flip angle, and spatial zzso zzso for their optimal image zzso This conflict was not well zzso or zzso in previous methods reported for simultaneous acquisition of zzso and zzso In our zzso sequence method, an zzso zzso zzso scheme was used to zzso the scan zzso requirements for zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso vascular contrast was enhanced by zzso separating the zzso center regions acquired for the zzso and zzso and by adjusting and applying scan parameters compatible between the zzso and zzso As a preliminary result, we were able to acquire a simultaneous zzso zzso and zzso with image quality comparable to that of the conventional zzso zzso and zzso that were acquired separately at two different zzso Furthermore, integrated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and multiple overlapping zzso acquisition techniques, our zzso zzso and zzso provided seamless vascular continuity over a large coverage volume of the brain zzso
