zzso pathways are complex systems of chemical reactions taking place in every living cell to degrade zzso and zzso molecules needed for zzso Modeling the zzso of these networks with respect to the dysfunction of one or several reactions is important to understand the basic principles of biological network organization, and to identify new drug zzso While several approaches have been proposed for that purpose, they are zzso too intensive to analyze large networks, and do not properly handle zzso zzso 

We propose a new zzso flux balance impact zzso model the zzso of large zzso networks with respect to gene zzso We formulate the zzso of the impact of one or several reaction blocking as linear programs, and propose efficient strategies to solve zzso We show that the proposed method better predicts the zzso impact of single gene deletions on zzso coli than existing zzso
