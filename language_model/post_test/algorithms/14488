Small animal X-ray zzso zzso zzso imaging of the lower zzso permits evaluation of zzso growth in models of zzso zzso and when applied serially can provide quantitative information about disease progression and aid in the evaluation of therapeutic zzso The zzso of changes in tissue zzso and concentration of molecular markers zzso obtained using nuclear imaging requires the ability to zzso register the zzso images over time, a task made more challenging by the potentially large changes in the positions of the legs due to zzso While zzso registration methods have been extensively used in the evaluation of individual zzso application in whole body imaging has been zzso primarily because the scale of possible zzso and zzso is large resulting in poor convergence of most zzso In this paper we present a new method based on the extended demons zzso that uses a zzso representation of the body zzso and skeletal structure as an zzso The proposed serial registration method reflects the natural physical moving combination of mouse anatomy in which the movement of bones is the framework for body movements, and the movement of skin zzso the detailed movements of the specific segmented body zzso We applied our method to both the registration of serial zzso mouse images and the zzso of zzso component of the serially hybrid zzso images demonstrating improved performance as compared to existing registration zzso
