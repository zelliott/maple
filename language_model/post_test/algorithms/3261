Recent results for zzso sampling suggest when the zzso distribution is constrained by zzso independence, zzso zzso exploiting such independence yields a great deal of efficiency zzso We consider the efficient zzso of the zzso interaction in zzso sampling zzso within zzso clinical trials, incorporating the independence between a zzso treatment and the baseline zzso We develop a zzso zzso based on the profile likelihood to zzso the zzso maximum likelihood estimate zzso Our zzso zzso both continuous zzso outcomes and continuous zzso zzso The profile information zzso is zzso explicitly via zzso zzso In certain situations where computing the zzso is slow, we propose a maximum estimated likelihood zzso zzso which is also capable of incorporating the zzso zzso This estimated likelihood approach uses a zzso empirical zzso distribution, thus is straightforward to zzso It offers a zzso zzso estimate with limited increase in zzso relative to the fully efficient zzso Our results suggest exploiting the zzso independence in zzso sampling increases the efficiency zzso particularly for zzso zzso zzso
