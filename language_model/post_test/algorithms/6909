zzso zzso reduction of carbon zzso of forests under elevated zzso ozone zzso requires robust zzso zzso models, scaled up to whole tree and stand zzso As ozone effects depend on zzso the ability to predict these effects on forest carbon cycling via competitive response between zzso will also be zzso This study tests a zzso model that predicts the relative effects of ozone on the zzso rate and growth of an zzso zzso zzso as a first step in simulating the competitive response of zzso to atmospheric and climate zzso The resulting composite model simulated the relative above ground growth response of zzso zzso clone 259 exposed to square wave variation in ozone zzso This included a greater effect on stem diameter than on stem zzso earlier leaf zzso and reduced stem and leaf dry matter production at the end of the growing zzso Further development of the model to reduce zzso uncertainty is zzso
