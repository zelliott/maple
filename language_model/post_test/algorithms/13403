zzso and consistent zzso of infant brain MR images plays an important role in zzso patterns of early brain development, especially in zzso zzso However, due to rapid maturation and zzso of brain zzso in the first year of life, the intensity contrast of gray and white matter zzso dramatic zzso In fact, the contrast inverse around zzso months of age, when the white and gray matter zzso are zzso and hence exhibit the lowest contrast, posing significant challenges for zzso zzso In this paper, we propose a zzso guided level set method to segment serial infant brain MR images acquired from 2 weeks up to zzso years of age, including the zzso zzso At each zzso the proposed method makes optimal use of zzso zzso and the zzso images for complimentary tissue distribution information to address the difficulty caused by the low zzso Moreover, zzso consistent term, which zzso the distance across the serial images within a biologically reasonable range, is employed to obtain temporally consistent zzso zzso Application of our method on 28 zzso infant subjects, each with 5 zzso scans, shows that the automated zzso from the proposed method match the manual zzso with much higher zzso zzso than other zzso zzso based methods and the zzso but zzso based zzso The software of the proposed method is publicly available in zzso zzso
