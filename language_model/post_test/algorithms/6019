We developed an zzso that zzso between on and off states in patients with Parkinson's disease during daily life zzso zzso patients were monitored continuously in a zzso situation for approximately 3 hours while they carried out normal zzso zzso zzso and comments of patients during the experiment were used to determine the on and off periods by a trained zzso zzso of the patients was measured using zzso zzso which were placed at six different positions on the zzso zzso related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso peak zzso above 4 zzso were used to distinguish between on and off zzso The zzso detection was evaluated using sensitivity and zzso The performance for each patient was defined as the average of the sensitivity and zzso The best performance to zzso on and off states was obtained by analysis of movements in the frequency domain with a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso We conclude that our zzso can distinguish between on and off states with a sensitivity and specificity near zzso This method, together with our previously published method to detect zzso zzso can automatically assess the motor state of Parkinson's disease patients and can operate successfully in zzso ambulatory zzso
