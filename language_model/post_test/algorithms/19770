The current form of the diabetes population risk tool zzso includes a zzso category of ethnicity in zzso with publicly data zzso Given the importance of ethnicity in influencing diabetes risk and its significance in a zzso population, it is prudent to determine its influence on a zzso risk prediction zzso 

To apply and compare the zzso with a modified version that includes detailed ethnic information in Canada's largest and most ethnically diverse zzso 

Two additional diabetes prediction models were zzso a model that contained zzso specific to the following ethnic zzso Black, Asian, south Asian, and First zzso and a reference model which did not include a term for zzso In addition to discrimination and zzso 10-year diabetes zzso was zzso The zzso were developed in Ontario using the zzso National zzso Health zzso zzso and validated in the zzso Canadian community health survey zzso 

All zzso zzso were associated with higher risk for developing diabetes with south Asians having the highest zzso Discrimination was similar zzso and sufficient zzso was maintained for all models except the detailed ethnicity models for zzso zzso produced the lowest overall ratio between observed and predicted diabetes zzso zzso identified more high risk cases than the other zzso in zzso whereas in females both zzso and the full ethnicity model identified more high risk zzso zzso zzso and full ethnicity zzso were very similar in terms of zzso accuracy and population zzso 

Although from the individual risk perspective, incorporating information on ethnicity is important, when predicting new cases of diabetes at the population level and accounting for other risk factors, detailed ethnic information did not improve the discrimination and accuracy of the model or identify significantly more diabetes cases in the zzso
