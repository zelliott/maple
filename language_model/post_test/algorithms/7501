Given the observed abnormal motion dynamics of patients with heart conditions, zzso cardiac motion in both normal and pathological cases can provide useful insights for therapy zzso In order to be able to zzso the motion over multiple subjects in a robust manner, it is desirable to represent the motion by a low number of zzso We propose a reduced order cardiac motion model, reduced in space through a zzso model, and reduced in time by statistical model order zzso The method is applied to a zzso of synthetic cases with known ground truth to validate the accuracy of the left zzso motion zzso and to validate a zzso zzso motion zzso zzso statistics are zzso on a set of 15 healthy volunteers to obtain separate spatial and zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that the reduced model can efficiently detect abnormal motion patterns and even allowed to zzso reveal abnormal unnoticed motion within the control zzso
