Conventional zzso zzso are unable to replace normal leg function due to the lack of zzso zzso zzso zzso offer the possibility to implement such zzso zzso For a particular locomotion mode, control zzso can generate appropriate zzso profiles as a function of selected sensory zzso and stored information on normal zzso However, it is essential in such systems that the locomotor modes can be determined accurately from the zzso of the control zzso zzso of the intent to change from one mode to another is also a necessity because the control system has to account for such zzso The possibility of using zzso signals from hip muscles and muscle zzso of the zzso for this purpose is zzso The modes tested are level walking, ramp ascent and ramp descent with slopes of 6 degrees and 9 zzso zzso activity zzso for three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are presented for the different zzso The results are obtained from two reference groups of 12 normal individuals and from a prosthetic zzso The results show the possibility of discriminating between zzso A discussion is made of the zzso of the results obtained by a finite state approach and the difficulties relating to the use of zzso signals for control zzso
