Copy number variations zzso as described in the healthy population are zzso to contribute significantly to genetic zzso Recent studies have described zzso using zzso cell lines or by application of specifically developed zzso to interrogate previously described zzso However, the full extent of zzso remains zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we have undertaken a comprehensive investigation of zzso 18 for zzso discovery and zzso of distribution and association with zzso zzso We identified 399 zzso of which loss represents zzso zzso are less than zzso zzso in size and zzso are zzso zzso deletions account for the majority of copy number changes with gene zzso Furthermore, one-third of zzso do not have putative zzso within repetitive zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso either by repetitive elements or zzso account for the majority of zzso in the healthy zzso zzso instability involving the formation of a non-B structure is demonstrated in one zzso
