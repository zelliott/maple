Most face recognition scenarios assume that frontal faces or mug shots are available for enrollment to the database, faces of other poses are collected in the probe zzso Given a face from the probe set, one needs to determine whether a match in the database zzso This is under the assumption that in forensic applications, most suspects have their mug shots available in the database, and face recognition aims at recognizing the suspects when their faces of various poses are captured by a surveillance zzso This paper considers a different zzso given a face with multiple poses available, which may or may not include a mug shot, develop a method to recognize the face with poses different from those zzso That is, given two zzso sets of poses of a face, one for enrollment and the other for recognition, this paper reports a method best for handling such zzso The proposed method includes feature extraction and zzso For feature zzso we first cluster the poses of each zzso face in the enrollment set into a few pose classes and then decompose the appearance of the face in each pose class using Embedded Hidden zzso Model, which allows us to define a set of zzso and zzso zzso facial components for each zzso For zzso an zzso weighting scheme is used to fuse the component zzso with zzso component zzso The proposed method is proven to outperform other approaches, including a zzso zzso with local facial features cropped zzso in an extensive performance evaluation zzso
