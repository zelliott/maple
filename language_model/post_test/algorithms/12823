Lung zzso cell zzso zzso occur at higher rates following zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso are understood to be critical drivers in several zzso zzso We have assembled a rare panel of lung zzso from a population with chronic zzso exposure, including zzso zzso from patients with no smoking zzso 

zzso lung zzso were zzso by zzso zzso array comparative zzso zzso Twenty-two were derived from zzso patients from Northern Chile (10 never smokers and 12 zzso Thirty additional cases were obtained for comparison from North American smokers without zzso zzso Twenty-two blood samples from healthy individuals from Northern Chile were examined to identify zzso DNA zzso variations zzso that could be excluded from zzso 

We identified multiple zzso associated with zzso zzso These zzso were not attributable to either smoking status or zzso DNA losses at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso represented the most zzso zzso An zzso gain at zzso contains genes previously identified as zzso zzso 

Our results provide a comprehensive approach to molecular characteristics of the zzso lung cancer zzso and the zzso lung zzso zzso The distinct and zzso zzso zzso suggest that this group of zzso may be considered as a separate disease zzso
