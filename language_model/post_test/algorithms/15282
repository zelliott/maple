Response regulator proteins within zzso signal zzso systems are activated by zzso and can catalyze their own zzso zzso using small zzso zzso To date, comprehensive kinetic characterization of response regulator zzso is limited to zzso which follows a simple model of zzso binding followed by zzso We characterized zzso of the response regulator zzso known to zzso upon zzso In contrast to zzso zzso time traces exhibited an initial lag phase and gave apparent zzso order rate zzso that increased with protein zzso Furthermore, plots of the apparent zzso rate constant versus zzso concentration were zzso as were zzso binding zzso for the zzso group analog zzso zzso mathematical modeling of the kinetic data necessitated inclusion of the formation of a zzso zzso (one zzso and one zzso zzso with an enhanced rate of zzso Specifically, zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were similar, but the rate constant for zzso zzso was zzso higher than for the zzso In a test of the model, disruption of the known zzso zzso interface by zzso led to markedly slower and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso from the sensor zzso zzso was enhanced by zzso zzso zzso zzso allows many response regulators to bind to tandem zzso sites and regulate zzso Our data challenge the notion that response regulator zzso primarily form between two zzso zzso and raise the possibility that response regulator zzso containing one zzso group may participate in gene zzso
