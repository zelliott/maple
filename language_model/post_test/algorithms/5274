Most electronic structure methods express the zzso as an expansion of zzso basis functions that are chosen to be either zzso zzso or zzso state zzso Although the expansion zzso of a single zzso may be readily zzso from zzso state function zzso for small zzso expansions, traditional zzso are zzso for systems with a large number of electrons and spatial zzso In this work, we describe an efficient zzso for the evaluation of a single zzso expansion zzso for zzso expanded as a linear combination of zzso contracted zzso Each zzso contracted function has significant zzso character and depends on a relatively small number of zzso parameters called arc zzso Because the zzso contracted function approach expresses the zzso state function zzso as products of arc factors, a zzso expansion zzso may be zzso zzso more efficiently than with traditional zzso interaction zzso Although the cost of computing zzso zzso scales zzso with the number of spatial zzso for traditional methods, the zzso presented here exploits two levels of zzso and scales zzso with system zzso zzso as demonstrated through applications to systems with hundreds of electrons and zzso it may readily be applied to very large zzso
