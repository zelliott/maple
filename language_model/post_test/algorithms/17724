Minor zzso peptides zzso derived from zzso segments of zzso proteins are thought to be targets for zzso and zzso reactions after zzso stem cell zzso A great majority of zzso peptides is generated by fragmentation of proteins in the course of zzso zzso An zzso was recently developed to predict zzso sites during zzso zzso We tested the accuracy of the zzso to predict zzso using 18 zzso acid zzso sequences of minor zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso genes representing single zzso zzso or by zzso zzso The zzso correctly predicted the zzso of 11 of 13 zzso confirmed zzso 1) zzso prediction of zzso and zzso zzso for zzso 2) zzso prediction of zzso and zzso while anticipating zzso zzso sites, zzso for zzso 3) zzso prediction of zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso and 4) zzso prediction of zzso and zzso extensions while anticipating zzso zzso sites, zzso for zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso counterparts of four zzso zzso showed that AA zzso either led to the zzso of an zzso zzso site zzso in zzso or abolished the correct zzso zzso in zzso The zzso processing zzso provides reliable data on the generation of zzso and forecasts their presence or zzso Combined with zzso class I zzso zzso it can be a useful tool for the prediction of generation and presentation of new zzso zzso derived from minor zzso zzso
