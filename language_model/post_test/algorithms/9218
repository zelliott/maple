Feature tracking is an zzso for zzso tissue motion and blood flow using zzso zzso It was proposed as a zzso simpler alternative to other techniques such as zzso and zzso cross zzso The advantage of feature tracking is that it selectively extracts easily identifiable parts of the zzso signal zzso the local zzso reducing the amount of information being zzso Studies on feature tracking to date have used zzso zzso targets to simulate blood zzso Also, feature tracking has not been compared with accepted commercial zzso This study directly compares feature tracking performance with the complex zzso method, which is the most common color flow zzso zzso were performed with both a rotating string phantom and a commercial flow phantom surrounded by zzso material, using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso under more realistic zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso ratios zzso (15 zzso to 3 zzso than previous zzso zzso The feature tracking approach is shown to produce mean estimates comparable to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and zzso zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso feature zzso for zzso ranging from 10 to 100 zzso The zzso of zzso estimates is shown to compare favorably to the complex zzso approach using the same number of ensemble flow samples (19 to zzso lower standard zzso for zzso zzso 36 to zzso lower standard zzso for zzso zzso However, linear zzso of the feature locations does not produce an appreciable improvement in zzso zzso zzso of the need for further research, particularly in the areas of feature detection and feature correspondence, is zzso
