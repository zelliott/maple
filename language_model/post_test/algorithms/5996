Spin diffusion between zzso groups in zzso is studied both theoretically and zzso It is shown to be dominated by mutual spin flip-flops of zzso belonging to zzso zzso zzso Also zzso zzso may contribute significantly if present in the zzso The zzso ground state of zzso consists of 16 zzso When their populations are used to describe spin zzso eight population combinations are shown to be important, two of them corresponding to the zzso and zzso zzso magnetic zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso transitions zzso these combinations so that a further reduction to two sets of four combinations is possible, with no zzso between the zzso zzso differential equations are derived to describe the time dependence of the combinations in each zzso They are solved zzso and compared with experimental results on a single crystal of aspirin with zzso zzso groups at the carbon zzso The zzso zzso induction signal was observed as a function of time after the preparation either at the carbon resonance (a zzso zzso or at the zzso resonance zzso zzso Usually carbon zzso were zzso first and then three of the mentioned population combinations were obtained from the individual spectral zzso Some results on the time dependence of zzso were also obtained directly from the zzso of the zzso induction zzso zzso predictions are found to describe zzso the overall time dependence of these three combinations and especially their variation with different initial conditions, which are discussed in zzso Also the partial transfer of the magnetic zzso energy between zzso and zzso is nicely zzso zzso for discrepancies are zzso
