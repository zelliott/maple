Visual zzso of zzso zzso activity is time consuming and requires a high level of zzso zzso This is especially true for overnight recordings of patient suffering from zzso zzso with continuous spike and waves during zzso sleep zzso as they can show tens of thousands of zzso Automatic spike detection would be attractive for this condition, but available zzso have zzso limitations related to variation in spike zzso both between patients and within a single zzso We propose a fully automated method of zzso spike detection that adapts to zzso and zzso variation in spike zzso The zzso works in five zzso zzso zzso are detected using parameters suitable for highly sensitive zzso zzso zzso spikes are separated into zzso zzso The number of clusters is automatically zzso zzso zzso are used as templates for more specific spike zzso therefore adapting to the types of spike zzso zzso zzso spikes are zzso The zzso was evaluated on zzso samples from 20 children suffering from zzso with zzso When compared to the manual scoring of 3 zzso experts (3 zzso the zzso demonstrated similar performance since sensitivity and selectivity were zzso higher and zzso lower, zzso The zzso showed little difference compared to the manual scoring of another expert for the zzso index evaluation in 17 additional records (the mean absolute difference was zzso This zzso is therefore efficient for the count of zzso spikes and determination of a zzso zzso
