This paper extends the zzso survival model by allowing the existence of cured fraction in the zzso Random effects induced by the zzso zzso structure are specified in the linear zzso in both hazard function and cured probability zzso zzso the generalized linear mixed model zzso approach to formulate the problem, zzso zzso is achieved by maximizing a best linear unbiased prediction zzso type zzso at the initial step of zzso and is then extended to obtain residual maximum likelihood zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The proposed zzso mixture cure model is applied to analyze the zzso child survival study data with zzso zzso and zzso chronic zzso disease zzso data on zzso infections as zzso A simulation study is carried out to evaluate the performance of the zzso zzso and assess the accuracy of the standard error zzso
