Selective zzso of bound zzso zzso the MR visible zzso and the zzso signal of total zzso zzso in rat brain in zzso The low contrast to noise ratio achieved during the limited experiment time makes it difficult to zzso the zzso It is shown that by combining data from zzso and zzso zzso experiments, zzso is possible using the standard zzso transfer zzso The model parameters obtained are the zzso relaxation time of the bound spin fraction B, zzso zzso 31 zzso 8 zzso the exchange rate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the concentration ratio of bound zzso taking part in the exchange to free zzso zzso f zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The phenomenon can be explained by either an zzso exchange of free and bound zzso molecules or by zzso interaction with bound zzso showing not necessarily the same chemical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
