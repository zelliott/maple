High zzso expression profiling and zzso technologies provide the means to study the genetic zzso of population variation in gene expression zzso In this paper we present a general statistical framework for the simultaneous analysis of gene expression data and zzso zzso data measured for the same zzso The framework consists of methods to associate transcripts with zzso affecting their zzso zzso to detect zzso of transcripts that share significantly many associations with a subset of zzso and methods to zzso the identified zzso We apply our framework to zzso data collected from 49 breast cancer zzso Our results demonstrate an overabundance of zzso associations in this data, and pinpoint zzso that are potential master regulators of zzso We also identify several statistically significant zzso with common putative regulators that fall into zzso functional zzso
