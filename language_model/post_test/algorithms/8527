The purpose of the present study is to examine the selectivity of various zzso towards the rat organic zzso transporting zzso 1 zzso gene symbol zzso and 2 zzso zzso 

The zzso effects of 20 compounds on the zzso transport of zzso zzso and on the zzso transport of zzso were examined in zzso zzso 

Among the compounds examined in this study, zzso zzso drugs, zzso and zzso zzso inhibited zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibited zzso at low zzso On the other hand, zzso acid, zzso and zzso showed no zzso effects on either zzso up to a concentration of 1,000 zzso The Ki values of zzso and zzso were estimated to be 19 and 13 times lower for zzso compared with zzso whereas the values for zzso zzso and zzso were 13, 20, and zzso times lower for zzso compared with zzso 

At low zzso some of the tested zzso exert selective zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso zzso These selective zzso may be used at appropriate zzso to estimate the maximum contribution of zzso or zzso to the total zzso zzso into rat zzso
