Concern has been expressed about the ability of simple zzso to predict skin zzso and hence skin zzso For a series of zzso zzso a number of software packages have been used to predict zzso water partition zzso zzso in conjunction with molecular weight, have then been used to calculate skin zzso zzso These compare zzso with experimental zzso Some of the software packages also predict zzso zzso which can be subsequently used to calculate maximum skin zzso The predicted and measured zzso have been compared together with the maximum zzso The results show that software can be used to predict zzso water partition zzso and zzso zzso (more accurately if the melting point of the compound is known) and hence to obtain very reasonable estimates of skin zzso zzso These are useful in predicting which analogue has the most appropriate properties for zzso zzso in the case of the zzso zzso it is the zzso compound that is zzso
