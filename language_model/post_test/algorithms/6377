Recording rolling zzso zzso from zzso microscopic video imagery is a critical task in inflammation research and drug zzso Since manual tracking is excessively time zzso an automated method is zzso This paper illustrates an active zzso based automated tracking method, where we propose a novel external force to guide the active zzso that takes the zzso flow direction into zzso The construction of the proposed force field, referred to as motion zzso zzso flow zzso is accomplished by minimizing an energy functional involving the motion direction, and the image zzso zzso The tracking experiments demonstrate that zzso can be used to track both zzso and zzso zzso thus extending the capture range of previously designed cell tracking zzso
