The purpose of this study was to investigate a new software program for semiautomatic measurement of the volume and mass of zzso zzso zzso in a chest phantom and to investigate the influence of CT zzso reconstruction zzso tube zzso and tube zzso 

We used an zzso chest phantom with eight artificial zzso with two different CT zzso and four different zzso CT scans were obtained with four models of CT scanner at 120 zzso and 25 zzso with a soft and a sharp reconstruction zzso On the zzso zzso the tube zzso time product and tube zzso settings were zzso zzso were measured with software that automatically segmented the zzso Absolute percentage error zzso was calculated for volume, mass, and zzso zzso signed zzso zzso zzso and zzso tests were used for zzso 

Volume and mass did not differ significantly from the true zzso When zzso were expressed as zzso the error range was zzso for volume and zzso for mass, which was significantly different from no zzso We did not find significant differences in zzso between CT scanners with filters for lower tube current for volume or lower tube zzso for zzso 

zzso zzso and mass and volume zzso of zzso with the zzso software had promising results in this zzso
