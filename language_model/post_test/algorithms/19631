Correction for multiple comparisons in zzso data is an important area of zzso Recently, zzso methods have gained popularity and have been reported to achieve better sensitivity compared to spatial domain zzso However, these techniques produce smoothed statistical maps which are difficult to zzso The generated maps have to be zzso again in the spatial domain to delineate active from inactive zzso The selection of a proper threshold satisfying the required error rate control is not zzso In this paper, a framework is proposed for zzso zzso maps in which a rejection region is zzso and the achieved false discovery rate zzso is zzso This approach provides a meaningful strategy to choose thresholds for zzso statistical zzso maps zzso Two zzso zzso zzso were used to assess the achieved error rate control when zzso zzso filtered zzso at various rejection zzso Their performance was evaluated using both simulated and resting zzso zzso The proposed framework was also applied on in zzso zzso
