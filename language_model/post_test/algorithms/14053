In recent years, there have been various efforts to overcome the limitations of standard zzso approaches for the analysis of gene expression data by grouping genes and samples zzso The underlying concept, which is often referred to as zzso allows to identify sets of genes sharing compatible expression patterns across zzso of samples, and its usefulness has been demonstrated for different organisms and zzso Several zzso methods have been proposed in the zzso however, it is not clear how the different techniques compare with each other with respect to the biological relevance of the clusters as well as with other characteristics such as zzso and sensitivity to zzso zzso no guidelines concerning the choice of the zzso method are currently zzso 

First, this paper provides a methodology for comparing and zzso zzso methods that includes a simple zzso reference zzso Although this model captures the essential features of most zzso approaches, it is still simple enough to exactly determine all optimal zzso to this end, we propose a fast zzso zzso zzso Second, we evaluate the performance of five salient zzso zzso together with the reference model and a zzso zzso method on various synthetic and real zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso The comparison reveals that zzso zzso in general has advantages over a conventional zzso zzso approach, zzso there are considerable performance differences between the tested methods and zzso already the simple reference model delivers relevant patterns within all considered zzso
