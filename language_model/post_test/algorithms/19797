zzso data potentially can provide decision support information, but zzso was not exclusively designed to be a zzso zzso Natural language processing applications that zzso zzso citations hold promise for zzso decision support zzso The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of a text zzso application called zzso zzso enhanced with a novel dynamic zzso method, in identifying decision support zzso 

We downloaded zzso citations addressing the prevention and drug treatment of four disease zzso We then processed the citations with zzso zzso enhanced with the dynamic zzso zzso We also processed the citations with a conventional zzso method, as well as with a baseline zzso We evaluated the results using zzso reference standards built from recommendations in a commercial decision support product, zzso 

For the drug treatment data, zzso zzso enhanced with dynamic zzso achieved average recall and precision scores of zzso and zzso while conventional zzso produced zzso average recall and zzso average precision, and the baseline method yielded average recall and precision values of zzso and zzso For the prevention data, zzso zzso enhanced with dynamic zzso achieved average recall and precision scores of zzso and zzso The baseline technique resulted in recall and precision scores of zzso and zzso No conventional zzso zzso method accommodating zzso for prevention zzso 

zzso zzso with dynamic zzso outperformed conventional zzso in terms of recall, and outperformed the baseline method in both recall and zzso This new approach to text zzso demonstrates potential in identifying decision support data for multiple zzso
