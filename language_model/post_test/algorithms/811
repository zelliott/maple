A zzso algorithm, termed exclusion region and position refinement zzso is presented for improving the accuracy and zzso of zzso the locations where vascular structures branch and cross over, in the context of human retinal zzso The goal is two zzso First, accurate zzso of branching and crossover points zzso in zzso structure is important to several areas of biology and zzso Second, these points are valuable as landmarks for image zzso so improved accuracy and zzso in zzso their locations and signatures leads to more reliable image registration for applications such as change detection and zzso The zzso zzso is shown to reduce the median location error from zzso zzso down to zzso zzso while improving the median spread (a measure of zzso from zzso zzso down to zzso zzso Errors in zzso vessel zzso were similarly reduced from zzso degrees down to zzso zzso
