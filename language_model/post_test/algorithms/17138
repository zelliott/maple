DNA synthesis with various zzso zzso and zzso in the presence of complementary templates was zzso The lengthening of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by a unit resulted in an increase of the primer affinity and a zzso rate of zzso The zzso of the affinity enhancement of zzso due to formation of one hydrogen bond between primer and template was found to be zzso The dependence of the primer affinity and zzso rate on zzso structure in solution was analyzed and the objective laws of the changes of the zzso and zzso values were zzso
