zzso research and drug development increasingly involve the extraction of quantitative data from digital microscope images, such as those obtained using zzso zzso Here, we describe a novel approach for both managing and analyzing such zzso The Open zzso Environment zzso is a sophisticated zzso scientific image management database that coordinates the organization, storage, and analysis of the large volumes of image data typically generated by modern imaging zzso We describe zzso a powerful zzso package integrated in zzso that will be of use to those who wish to identify and measure objects within microscope images or zzso zzso The zzso used in zzso is in fact only one of many possible zzso zzso zzso zzso and the underlying data model used by zzso to capture and store its results can also be used to store results from other zzso zzso In this report, we illustrate how image zzso can be achieved in zzso using one such zzso of a zzso algorithm, and how this output subsequently can be displayed zzso or processed zzso using a zzso
