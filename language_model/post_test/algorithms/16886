zzso the weight of evidence in forensic zzso is often done in terms of a likelihood ratio, zzso The zzso evaluates the probability of the observed evidence under competing zzso Most often, probabilities used in the zzso only consider the evidence from the zzso variation identified using zzso genetic zzso However, modern typing techniques supply additional quantitative data, which contain very important information about the observed zzso This is particularly true for cases of DNA zzso where more than one individual has contributed to the observed biological zzso This article presents a method for including the quantitative information of short tandem repeat zzso DNA zzso in the zzso Also, an efficient zzso method for finding the best matching combination of DNA mixture profiles is derived and implemented in an zzso tool for two- and zzso DNA zzso Finally, we demonstrate for zzso zzso how this best matching pair of profiles can be used in zzso the likelihood ratio using importance zzso The reason for using importance sampling for zzso the likelihood ratio is the often vast number of combinations of profiles needed for the evaluation of the weight of zzso Online tool is available at zzso
