The effect of zzso zzso in producing the zzso characteristics of voice is investigated by comparing the zzso of the zzso composite model and the zzso zzso The zzso model assumes the zzso zzso to be zzso zzso and zzso In this model, when the zzso factor is decreased from zzso to zzso only zzso and zzso modes are zzso However, with the same zzso four zzso modes zzso zzso zzso zzso are found in the zzso composite model using the zzso equations to describe the complex zzso in the zzso Moreover, the zzso of the zzso is modulated by a zzso zzso zzso The zzso detection method reveals that this zzso zzso is not random, but rather it is deterministic zzso This result agrees with the phenomenon often seen in voice, in which the voice signal is strongly periodic but modulated by a zzso chaotic zzso The only difference between the zzso model and the composite model is in their descriptions of zzso zzso zzso the complex aerodynamic characteristics of zzso zzso could be important in generating the zzso dynamic behavior of voice production, including zzso and a zzso chaotic component obscured by strong zzso
