The traditional approach to the identification of peptides in complex biological samples zzso involves the use of tandem mass zzso to generate a unique fragmentation pattern in order to accurately assign its identity to a particular zzso In this article we describe the theoretical basis for a new paradigm for the identification of peptides and zzso This methodology employs the use of accurate mass and zzso zzso point zzso as identification criteria, and represents a change in focus from current tandem mass zzso zzso A mathematical derivation of the false positive rate associated with accurate mass and zzso zzso is presented to demonstrate the utility of the zzso The equations for calculation of the experimental false positive rate allow for the determination of the zzso of the zzso The false positive rate issue examined in detail here is not restricted to accurate zzso approaches, but also has application to the tandem mass zzso community as zzso The theoretical zzso of zzso coli and zzso zzso are used to evaluate the efficacy of this zzso The power of the technique is demonstrated by analyzing a series of peptides with the same zzso masses but with differing zzso zzso Finally, the speed of zzso when combined with the experimental zzso analysis has the potential to rapidly accelerate the protein identification zzso
