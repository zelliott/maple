Image zzso is fundamental to the efficient and cost-effective use of digital medical imaging technology and zzso zzso transform techniques currently provide the most promising approach to high-quality image zzso which is essential for diagnostic medical zzso A novel approach to image zzso based on the zzso decomposition has been developed which zzso the shape or zzso of zzso transform zzso in the zzso domain to isolate and retain significant zzso corresponding to image structure and zzso The remaining zzso are further compressed using a combination of zzso and Huffman zzso The technique has been implemented and applied to full 16 bit medical image data for a range of zzso zzso zzso peak zzso ratio performance of the zzso technique was zzso zzso indicate that good reconstructed image quality can be achieved at zzso ratios of up to zzso for the image types zzso This technique represents an effective approach to the zzso of diagnostic medical images and is worthy of further, more zzso evaluation of diagnostic quality and accuracy in a clinical zzso
