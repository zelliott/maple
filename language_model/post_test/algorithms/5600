zzso zzso zzso can zzso large zzso zzso at resolutions often below zzso and recently as good as zzso zzso These density maps provide important insights into the biological functioning of molecular zzso such as viruses or the zzso in particular if zzso crystal structures or models of individual components of the assembly can be placed into the density zzso The present work introduces a novel zzso termed zzso that accurately fits zzso structural models into medium resolution density zzso In an initial step, a zzso zzso zzso provides a short list of likely zzso In a follow up zzso zzso refinement step, the initial zzso are zzso by their cross correlation zzso The resolution of density maps for a reliable fit was determined to be 10 zzso or better using tests with simulated density zzso The zzso was applied to fitting of zzso proteins into an experimental zzso density map of human zzso at a resolution of zzso and zzso zzso and fitting of the zzso protein at zzso zzso In the process, the zzso of the zzso density map was zzso zzso The zzso zzso offers an alternative to the established zzso space fitting zzso zzso is free for academic use and available from a web server or as downloadable zzso file at zzso
