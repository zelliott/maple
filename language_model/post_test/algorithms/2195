A computer program has been developed for the zzso analysis of zzso conditions within the human zzso In this study, a zzso model, which consists of internal zzso is adapted for the segment of the human zzso For the present concentric zzso model we developed a new zzso solution method using a linear combination of the modified zzso zzso By using the present computer program the internal tissue temperatures, heat zzso and blood temperatures of the zzso zzso and foot segments are zzso This paper describes a new zzso solving heat transfer equation in the human body and the example of calculated results of the combination of zzso zzso and foot zzso The calculated results show the local characteristics of each segment in the human zzso
