We examined whether zzso of zzso zzso zzso enhances this zzso capacity to evaluate the risk for total and cardiovascular mortality and sudden cardiac death zzso 

The Finnish zzso Study zzso enrolled consecutive patients zzso zzso zzso zzso men and 777 zzso with a clinically indicated exercise test with bicycle zzso zzso zzso zzso moving average zzso was analyzed from zzso zzso and the results were grouped in increments of 10 zzso zzso ratios zzso for total and cardiovascular mortality and zzso were estimated for zzso routine exercise, and zzso zzso Cox zzso analysis was zzso During follow-up of zzso zzso zzso months zzso zzso standard zzso zzso 126 patients zzso 62 were cardiovascular deaths, and 33 of these deaths were zzso During zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso predicted the risk for total and cardiovascular mortality zzso zzso zzso at 60 zzso P zzso zzso for zzso During exercise, zzso of total and cardiovascular mortality were significant when zzso measured zzso zzso with 90 zzso zzso yielding maximum zzso for total and cardiovascular death of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso During zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated risk for total and cardiovascular zzso with maximum zzso of zzso at 70 zzso zzso zzso zzso for cardiovascular zzso zzso was strongly predicted by zzso levels zzso zzso during exercise, with maximum zzso of zzso at 60 zzso zzso zzso zzso but was not predicted during zzso or zzso 

zzso of zzso enhances its capacity for determination of the risk for total and cardiovascular mortality and zzso in low-risk zzso Its zzso power is superior during exercise compared to zzso or zzso
