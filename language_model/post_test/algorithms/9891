Most of clinical ultrasound imaging systems use a zzso sound speed, mostly zzso zzso in zzso and zzso while actual sound speed varies depending on tissue composition and zzso Sound speed zzso particularly in zzso lead to resolution degradation and sensitivity loss in ultrasound zzso In this paper, we propose a sound speed zzso method in which an optimal sound speed, the speed that makes the echo signal delays at the zzso elements be best matched to the theoretical delays, is estimated by maximizing the zzso echo signal zzso with respect to the sound speed and the zzso displacement from the central axis of the ultrasound zzso Since the sound speed can be estimated from the echo signals on several scan lines, the proposed method does not require excessive zzso Experimental imaging studies of zzso and zzso tissue with a 6 zzso zzso linear probe and a 3 zzso zzso convex probe have shown that spatial resolution, particularly in the lateral direction, can be improved by the proposed zzso
