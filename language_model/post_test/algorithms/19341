Medical images in nuclear medicine are commonly represented in three dimensions as a stack of two-dimensional images that are reconstructed from zzso zzso Although natural and straightforward, this may not be an optimal visual representation for performing various diagnostic zzso A method for three-dimensional zzso zzso reconstruction is developed using a point cloud image zzso A point cloud is a set of points zzso in space, where each zzso of the point cloud is characterized by its position and zzso The density of the zzso determines the local resolution allowing for the modeling of different parts of the image with different zzso The reconstructed volume, which in general could be of any resolution, size, shape, and zzso is represented by a set of zzso zzso defined by the zzso The intensity at any point within the volume is defined by zzso zzso inside a zzso from the values at the four zzso that define the zzso This approach creates a continuous zzso linear intensity over the reconstruction zzso The reconstruction provides a distinct zzso zzso which is designed to accurately and efficiently represent the 3-D zzso The method is zzso to the acquisition of any zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso and the reconstruction procedure can also model the physics of the image detection zzso An efficient method for evaluating the system projection zzso is zzso The system zzso is used in an zzso zzso to reconstruct both the intensity and location of the distribution of points in the point zzso Examples of the reconstruction of projection data generated by computer simulations and projection data zzso acquired using a zzso cardiac torso phantom are zzso This work creates a framework for zzso zzso representation of images in nuclear zzso
