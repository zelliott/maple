zzso may undergo multiple zzso changes required for their zzso One strategy used to estimate zzso positions in unknown structural zzso involves zzso resonance energy transfer zzso distance zzso However, interpretation of zzso distances is difficult when applied to three-dimensional structural zzso especially in zzso zzso We developed a positioning method using inverse zzso to map target sites within a zzso protein in all defined states, with simultaneous functional zzso The procedure accounts for probe diffusion to accurately determine the three-dimensional position and confidence region of zzso zzso donors attached to a target site (one per zzso relative to a single fluorescent zzso placed in a zzso zzso As first application, the method is used to determine the position of a functional zzso zzso channel's zzso zzso Our results verify the crystal structure relaxed zzso and report on the resting and active zzso for which crystal structures are not zzso
