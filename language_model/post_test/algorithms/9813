zzso zzso a complex interplay of diverse zzso is fundamental for the development, function and survival of zzso zzso diffusion and active transport zzso alternate in living cells, with active zzso arising from molecular motors, such as zzso or zzso pulling zzso along zzso A better understanding of zzso mechanisms involved in zzso interactions and in diffusion zzso which enable efficient active transport over long distances in motor zzso requires a better link between theoretical models and zzso zzso zzso we establish one-dimensional zzso zzso transport zzso suitable for comparing experimental findings with recent theoretical zzso model predictions, by guiding zzso outgrowth of zzso zzso cells along zzso chemical surface structures with a strip zzso of 2 zzso zzso by means of zzso zzso patterning zzso zzso zzso of the zzso transport of quantum dots zzso in straight zzso which exhibit almost parallel zzso is obtained by our recently developed zzso based on a zzso zzso displacement zzso zzso Such a thorough dissection of experimental data will be useful for validation and clarification of current theoretical transport zzso
