This paper is concerned with finding the best partial differential zzso zzso process, out of a set of possible zzso We focus on either finding the proper weight of the zzso term in the energy zzso zzso or on determining the optimal stopping time of a zzso diffusion zzso A necessary condition for achieving zzso zzso is zzso based on the zzso of the noise and the residual zzso We provide two practical alternatives for zzso this condition by observing that the filtering of the image and the noise can be zzso by a decoupling technique, with respect to the weight or time zzso Our automatic zzso zzso quite accurate results on a variety of synthetic and natural images, including zzso smooth and zzso zzso We assume that the statistics of the noise were previously zzso No a zzso knowledge regarding the characteristics of the clean image is zzso A theoretical analysis is carried out, where several zzso performance bounds are established for the optimal strategy and for a widely used method, wherein the zzso of the residual part equals the zzso of the zzso
