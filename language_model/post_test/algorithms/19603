zzso zzso systems are presented as a zzso delivery system designed for zzso sustained drug zzso The outer layer that fills the void spaces between the zzso was formulated to release the drug in a very short time zzso zzso while the zzso provided a prolonged zzso Different composition zzso or zzso and number (10 or zzso of zzso were used to obtain different drug release zzso The in zzso performance of these systems showed the desired zzso zzso the drug contained in the fast releasing phase zzso zzso the zzso dissolved within the first 2 zzso whereas the drug contained in the zzso was released at different rates, depending up on zzso Based on the release kinetic parameters zzso it can be concluded that zzso containing zzso were particularly suitable approaching to zzso zzso release over zzso time zzso
