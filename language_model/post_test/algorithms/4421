The zzso score is a zzso though approximate metric for zzso evaluating zzso clone zzso in DNA fingerprint zzso It is known to systematically zzso match probabilities by various orders of zzso depending upon zzso zzso Although the exact probability distribution is also available for the comparison problem, it is rather difficult to zzso and cannot be used directly in most zzso A methodology providing both improved accuracy and zzso economy is zzso 

We propose a straightforward zzso correction zzso which takes the zzso score as a provisional value and applies a zzso equation to obtain an improved zzso zzso comparisons indicate dramatically increased accuracy over the range of parameters typical of traditional zzso fingerprint zzso zzso with zzso the method into zzso ranges characteristic of newer zzso zzso projects are also zzso 

Although only marginally more expensive to zzso than the raw zzso score, the correction provides a vastly improved zzso description of hypothesized clone zzso This will clearly be important in overlap assessment and perhaps for other tasks as well, for example in using the ranking of overlap probabilities to assist in clone zzso
