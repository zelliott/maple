To zzso verify a theoretical model describing the MR signal zzso under zzso conditions in a zzso containing a vascular network, and to estimate the stability of the model for zzso zzso 

zzso zzso reflecting the properties of the theoretical model, zzso statistically distributed and randomly oriented zzso in a homogeneous medium were constructed by randomly coiled zzso fibers immersed in a zzso zzso The resemblance between measured and theoretical signal zzso was investigated by calculation of root mean squared error zzso zzso zzso zzso data were evaluated using the zzso zzso model to estimate the stability of the model and the influence of input zzso 

The theoretical model describing the MR signal zzso under zzso conditions was zzso verified in phantom zzso In simulations, it was found that, by zzso the effect of diffusion when predicting the MR zzso course expected in an in zzso measurement of the tissue zzso errors of zzso would be introduced into the zzso zzso The simulations indicate unpredictable results for simultaneous evaluation of blood zzso level and blood volume zzso 

zzso the effects of diffusion in quantitative zzso zzso could give rise to substantial errors in the zzso zzso
