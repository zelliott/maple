We studied the zzso network proposed by zzso et zzso zzso which maps zzso letter zzso to zzso word zzso probing the hidden layer to determine the nature of the zzso Hidden patterns for words were densely distributed, and zzso zzso on single letter patterns produced evidence that the network had formed zzso letter representations during zzso The possible confound with zzso zzso representations was ruled out, and linear zzso showed that any word pattern was well zzso by a linear combination of its constituent letter zzso zzso this code using overlapping holographic representations zzso zzso uncovered a surprisingly acute and useful correspondence with the network, stemming from a broken symmetry in the connection weight zzso and related to the zzso zzso zzso & Papert, zzso These results also explain how the network can reproduce relative and zzso zzso effects found in zzso
