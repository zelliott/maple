A new technique termed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been developed with the aim to overcome some of the limitations of current zzso optical imaging zzso zzso is based on zzso zzso zzso zzso with the major difference that there is a translation of the sample in the vertical direction during the image acquisition process, requiring a new approach to image zzso zzso to zzso zzso makes possible to obtain zzso images of intact long samples without imposing limits on the sample zzso This has been tested using zzso to image long zzso tissue samples such as spinal cords and large zzso Moreover, zzso images of the colon of zzso mice, a model for zzso zzso zzso allowed the identification of the structural zzso Finally, the geometry of the zzso device zzso the addition of a Selective zzso zzso zzso zzso arm, providing the possibility of delivering high resolution images of selected areas together with complete zzso zzso
