When a rat moves, grid cells in its zzso zzso become active in multiple regions of the external world that form a zzso zzso As the animal zzso one such zzso zzso spikes tend to occur at successively earlier zzso zzso of the local field zzso This phenomenon is called phase zzso Here, we show that spike zzso provide zzso more spatial information than spike counts and that they improve position estimates from single zzso down to a few zzso To understand what limits the resolution and how variable spike zzso are across different field zzso we analyze spike trains run by zzso We find that the multiple firing fields of a grid cell operate as independent elements for zzso physical zzso In addition, phase zzso is significantly stronger than the zzso data zzso Despite the inherent zzso of zzso zzso phase zzso is therefore a robust phenomenon at the zzso level, making a zzso code for spatial navigation zzso
