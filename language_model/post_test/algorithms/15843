A major limitation in zzso inverse problems is inadequate zzso speed, which frequently zzso the application of engineering ideas and principles in medical science more than in the physical and engineering zzso Medical problems are zzso taxing because a minimum description of the system often involves 5 dimensions (3 space, 1 energy, 1 time), with the range of each space coordinate requiring up to 512 zzso The zzso tasks for this problem can be simply expressed by posing the problem as one in which the zzso system response function is zzso zzso and the noise is additive and zzso Under these zzso a number of reconstruction methods have been implemented with generally satisfactory results for general medical imaging zzso However, if the system response function of the zzso is assumed more realistically to be zzso zzso and the noise to be zzso the zzso problem becomes much more zzso Some of the zzso being studied to compensate for zzso resolution and statistical fluctuations in the data acquisition process, when expressed in zzso form, are not practical for clinical applications because the number of zzso necessary exceeds the capabilities of zzso computer systems currently zzso Reconstruction methods based on natural zzso specifically zzso natural zzso preserve zzso in the data acquisition zzso Fast zzso of zzso natural zzso zzso can achieve orders of magnitude zzso relative to general zzso Thus, specialized thought in zzso development can lead to more significant increases in performance than can be achieved through hardware improvements zzso
