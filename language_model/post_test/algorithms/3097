To understand the dynamic behavior of cellular systems, mathematical modeling is often necessary and comprises three steps: zzso experimental measurement of participating zzso zzso assignment of rate laws to each reaction, and zzso zzso zzso with respect to the zzso In each of these steps the zzso is confronted with a plethora of alternative approaches, zzso zzso the selection of zzso rate laws in step two as specific equations are often unknown, or the choice of an zzso procedure with its specific settings in step zzso This overall process with its numerous choices and the mutual influence between them makes it hard to single out the best modeling approach for a given zzso 

We investigate the modeling process using multiple kinetic equations together with various zzso zzso methods for a zzso example network, the zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso For this purpose, we derive seven dynamic models based on generalized mass action, zzso and convenience zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso In addition, we introduce two modeling approaches for feedback zzso to the mass action zzso The parameters of each model are estimated using eight zzso zzso To determine the most promising modeling approaches together with the best zzso zzso we carry out a zzso zzso zzso zzso comparison of the zzso on all models and zzso zzso tuning of the best zzso zzso and zzso To analyze the space of the best parameters found for each model, we apply zzso zzso and correlation zzso 

A mixed model based on the convenience rate law and the zzso zzso in which all reactions are assumed to be zzso is the most suitable deterministic modeling approach followed by a zzso generalized mass action zzso zzso A zzso model is zzso to take zzso effects into zzso To estimate the model zzso three zzso are particularly zzso For first attempts the zzso Tribes zzso yields valuable zzso zzso swarm zzso and differential evolution provide significantly better results with appropriate zzso
