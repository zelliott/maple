In open field zzso zzso adults exhibit a preference for arena boundaries over internal walls and open zzso zzso we investigate the nature of this preference using zzso modeling of locomotion to determine whether local arena features and constraints on movement alone are sufficient to drive zzso preferences within open field zzso of different shapes and with different internal zzso Our model has two zzso directional persistence and local wall zzso In regions far away from walls, the trajectory is entirely characterized by a directional persistence zzso zzso for each movement defined by the step size, zzso and the turn angle, zzso In close proximity to walls, motion is zzso from zzso and a local attractive force which depends on the distance between the fly and points on the zzso The directional persistence probability was obtained zzso from zzso of wild type zzso in a circular open field arena and the wall force was zzso to minimize the difference between the zzso zzso from the model and zzso in the same circular zzso The zzso model for fly movement was challenged by comparing the zzso preferences from the zzso model to wild type zzso in a variety of open field zzso In most zzso there was a strong zzso between the zzso model and zzso In more complex zzso the model exhibits similar trends, but some significant differences were zzso These differences suggest that there are emergent features within these complex zzso that have significance for the fly, such as potential zzso zzso the zzso model is an important step in defining how zzso interact with their zzso
