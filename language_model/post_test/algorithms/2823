The landscape of biological and biomedical research is being changed rapidly with the invention of zzso which enables simultaneous view on the zzso levels of a huge number of genes across different experimental conditions or time zzso Using zzso data sets, zzso zzso have been actively zzso in order to identify groups of zzso zzso This article poses the problem of fuzzy zzso in zzso data as a zzso zzso problem which simultaneously zzso two internal fuzzy cluster zzso zzso to yield a set of zzso zzso zzso Each of these zzso solutions possesses some amount of information regarding the zzso structure of the input zzso zzso by this fact, a novel fuzzy majority voting approach is proposed to combine the zzso information from all the solutions in the zzso zzso zzso This approach first identifies the genes which are assigned to some particular cluster with high membership degree by most of the zzso zzso Using this set of genes as the training set, the remaining genes are classified by a supervised learning zzso In this work, we have used a Support zzso zzso zzso zzso for this zzso 

The performance of the proposed zzso technique has been demonstrated on five publicly available benchmark zzso data sets, zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso Human zzso zzso and zzso Central zzso zzso Comparative studies of the use of different zzso kernels and several widely used zzso zzso techniques are zzso Moreover, statistical significance tests have been carried out to establish the statistical superiority of the proposed zzso zzso Finally, biological significance tests have been carried out using a web based gene zzso tool to show that the proposed method is able to produce biologically relevant clusters of zzso zzso 

The proposed zzso method has been shown to perform better than other well-known zzso zzso in finding clusters of zzso genes zzso The clusters of genes produced by the proposed technique are also found to be biologically zzso zzso consist of genes which belong to the same functional zzso This indicates that the proposed zzso method can be used efficiently to identify zzso genes in zzso gene expression zzso zzso The zzso and zzso data sets, the zzso code and other related materials are available at zzso
