In the zzso zzso patients, the zzso mechanism of inner ear involvement is still zzso We investigated the status of the zzso in patients with zzso zzso by evaluating the signal intensity of cochlear fluid on zzso and zzso enhanced thin section three-dimensional zzso inversion recovery zzso 

zzso patients were zzso zzso zzso images were obtained in 18 patients, and 20 patients had the records of their zzso zzso zzso of interest of both zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso zzso were determined on zzso images by referring to zzso heavily zzso images on a zzso The signal intensity ratio between C and M on the zzso images zzso zzso was then zzso In addition, correlation between the CM ratio and the hearing level was also zzso 

The CM ratio of the affected side was significantly higher than that of the unaffected side zzso zzso zzso In the affected side, zzso signal zzso was observed zzso zzso zzso In 13 patients zzso zzso who underwent both zzso injection and the zzso zzso the zzso CM ratio correlated with hearing level zzso zzso zzso 

The results of the present study suggest that zzso of cochlear fluid composition and increased zzso of the zzso barrier exist in the affected side in patients with zzso zzso Furthermore, although weak, positive correlation between zzso cochlear signal intensity on zzso and hearing level warrants further study to clarify the relationship between zzso findings and prognosis of hearing preservation zzso
