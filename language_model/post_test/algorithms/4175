In this study, we assessed the quality of digital zzso images acquired with a grid and without a grid for different zzso zzso A digital zzso system was used for acquisition of images of the zzso Model zzso zzso Accreditation zzso The images were obtained in the presence of the grid and then with the grid removed from the zzso The energy of the zzso was varied between 26 and 32 zzso The images were evaluated by five senior zzso technologists with extensive experience in zzso zzso analysis was carried out with the zzso zzso test with the level of significance set at zzso The comparison between images obtained with a grid and without a grid indicated that, for the visibility of zzso the zzso images at 28 zzso were significantly zzso better than the images acquired with a zzso At all other zzso values, the images were not statistically different regarding the visibility of zzso For the visibility of zzso and masses, the images did not show any significant differences at any of the zzso values of the zzso Imaging with zzso higher than 30 requires a grid to improve the visibility of zzso zzso and zzso For the visibility of masses at 32 zzso no statistically significant differences between the grid and zzso images were zzso
