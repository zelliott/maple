In this paper, we study the global exponential stability of a zzso scale competitive neural network model with zzso functions, which models a literally inhibited neural network with zzso zzso zzso The network has two types of state zzso one zzso to the fast neural activity and another to the slow zzso modification of connection zzso Based on the zzso analysis techniques, we prove the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium for the system and establish some new theoretical conditions ensuring global exponential stability of the unique equilibrium of the neural zzso zzso simulations are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the derived conditions in characterizing stability regions of the neural zzso
