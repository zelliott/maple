zzso protein databases reveal the response of cells to experimental zzso such as exposure to growth factors or zzso with a transforming zzso The nature of the response depends on the type of cell and its internal state at the time of the zzso By constructing a protein database to study a given cell line, we can better understand the differentiated state of the cell, the growth regulatory mechanisms it zzso the particular mechanisms it uses to cope with its environment, and the ways these mechanisms may have been compromised through zzso or zzso The zzso database is a quantitative database designed to study growth control and transformation in a zzso family of normal and transformed rat cell zzso The database, which has been described and analyzed elsewhere zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1989, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1989, zzso zzso is further explored here using cluster zzso This method reveals the most common protein expression profiles for each series of two-dimensional gels without requiring any prior hypothesis or queries on the part of the zzso This study zzso for each experiment, large and small clusters of protein expression profiles, most of which have readily apparent biological zzso For example, large clusters of proteins induced or zzso during growth to zzso have been revealed, and several clusters of zzso proteins reveal differential effects of transformation by zzso and zzso zzso This analysis extends our earlier quantitative explorations of the zzso protein database and helps to show how such a database can be used to provide context and guidance for molecular studies of regulation in a given cell zzso
