zzso is a flexible web tool that zzso the effect of single or multiple zzso modifications zzso on protein zzso point zzso and molecular weight and displays the calculated patterns as two-dimensional zzso gel zzso zzso of proteins control many biological regulatory and signaling mechanisms and zzso gel zzso is able to resolve many zzso zzso such as those due to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso These modifications cause changes in the zzso of the protein by adding, removing or changing zzso zzso zzso differ widely in zzso capacity and zzso and therefore the same zzso may give rise to quite different patterns of zzso shifts in different zzso It is impossible by visual inspection of a pattern of spots on a gel to determine which modifications are most likely to be zzso The patterns of zzso shifts for different proteins can be calculated and are often quite zzso The theoretical gel images produced by zzso can be compared to the experimental zzso gel results to zzso probable zzso and focus efforts on more detailed study of modified zzso zzso has been implemented as zzso script in zzso available on a zzso server at zzso
