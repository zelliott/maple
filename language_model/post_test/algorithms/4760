This study zzso the dose prediction errors zzso in dynamic zzso dose calculations resulting from zzso use of an intensity zzso to estimate the zzso zzso zzso modulated zzso zzso zzso instead of an explicit zzso particle zzso and zzso handling of tissue zzso zzso by zzso zzso and pencil beam zzso dose calculation zzso zzso Carlo zzso zzso doses are used as reference zzso zzso zzso dynamic zzso zzso treatment plans are zzso zzso are evaluated via comparing the dose received by zzso of the zzso zzso D zzso the zzso D zzso the zzso D zzso the zzso and the zzso D zzso the zzso D zzso the zzso mean dose zzso zzso and generalized equivalent uniform doses zzso for the above zzso For the zzso intensity grids, zzso is within zzso zzso for all targets and critical zzso The SC zzso zzso is within zzso zzso for zzso of the zzso zzso and within zzso zzso for all of the tallied zzso The zzso zzso zzso is within zzso zzso for zzso of the tallied zzso zzso zzso tests indicate that zzso zzso requires a zzso zzso zzso to state zzso with the zzso standard, while the intervals are zzso zzso for SC zzso and zzso Overall, these results indicate that SC and zzso zzso dose calculations which use zzso intensity zzso for zzso prediction do not introduce significant dose errors compared with full zzso Carlo dose zzso however, zzso zzso may result in clinically significant dose zzso
