Chemical zzso such as adverse effects and zzso have a major impact on today's drug discovery zzso In zzso prediction of chemical liabilities is an important approach which can reduce costs and animal testing by zzso or replacing in zzso and in zzso liability zzso There is a lack of zzso zzso decision support systems for chemical liability assessment which run quickly and have easily zzso zzso Here we present a method which zzso similarity searches, structural zzso and zzso models which all are available from the zzso zzso zzso has been placed on interpretation of results, and zzso which are important for predictions are highlighted in the original chemical zzso This allows for zzso changing chemical structures with instant visual feedback and can be used for hypothesis testing of single chemical structures as well as compound zzso The system has a clear separation between methods and data, and the zzso architecture enables straightforward extension via addition of more zzso (such as new data sets and zzso zzso We demonstrate our method on three important safety end zzso zzso zzso and zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso zzso and the decision support zzso are free, open source, and available from zzso zzso
