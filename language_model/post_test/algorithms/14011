Three zzso and six zzso zzso derivatives were investigated by means of negative zzso mass zzso zzso Available electron transmission zzso zzso data were used for the treatment of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso show that these families of compounds exhibit similar zzso in the process of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso wave dominates in the lowest zzso state zzso In the series of zzso zzso and zzso the energy difference zzso between the vertical attachment energy zzso in zzso zzso and the maximum of the zzso formation in zzso electron attachment zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso with the zzso value for the given zzso The slopes of these zzso are different for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso It is zzso that, in the derivatives zzso in the zzso there is a shallow minimum in the repulsive zzso potential curve, which makes possible temporary zzso of the zzso This delay is long enough for the zzso process and formation of the zzso zzso This effect is not detected in zzso zzso
