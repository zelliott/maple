It is desirable to obtain the maximum assist without zzso in zzso assist devices zzso However, high driving power of a zzso may cause severe zzso zzso that can induce zzso zzso and pump zzso In this report, an appropriate zzso driving level that zzso the assist effect without severe zzso zzso was zzso The target driving level was set at the boundary between low driving power without zzso and high driving power with frequent zzso In the boundary range, intermittent mild zzso may zzso Driving power was regulated by the zzso zzso The zzso boundary control method was evaluated in a female goat implanted with an zzso pump zzso assist device zzso The zzso was driven in a zzso mode with heartbeat synchronization zzso zzso driving power was adjusted using a zzso boundary control method developed for this zzso We confirmed that driving power could be maintained in the boundary zzso zzso of zzso were evaluated using the zzso zzso We defined this ratio as the number of zzso zzso divided by the number of zzso The zzso ratio decreased by zzso when the zzso boundary control method was zzso
