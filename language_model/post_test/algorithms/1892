zzso cancer is characterized by a variety of molecular zzso zzso zzso repair zzso is a DNA repair system that eliminates mismatched base pairs and it plays an important role in the maintaining of zzso zzso The aim of the study was to assess the role of several zzso genes in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in samples collected by zzso zzso 

The prospective study included 44 consecutive patients with pancreatic cancer zzso and chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed in all the zzso Gene analysis was performed by zzso the zzso and by determining the expression of DNA repair genes zzso zzso zzso using a standard zzso 

Total zzso was successfully isolated from all the zzso pancreatic zzso We analyzed zzso zzso to assess the significance of determining the expression of analyzed genes in zzso samples, obtaining a zzso value of zzso zzso for zzso and sensitivity and specificity of zzso and zzso zzso For zzso and zzso sensitivity and specificity were only satisfactory zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso zzso 

The quality and amount of cellular sampling using pancreatic zzso allow the extraction of sufficient quantities of zzso to perform zzso zzso The use of zzso genes for the differentiation between zzso chronic zzso and pancreatic cancer using a minimally invasive sampling technique could be a promising zzso
