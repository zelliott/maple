In this paper, we investigate the indirect zzso regulation problem of unknown zzso in the control zzso zzso The proposed approach consists of choosing an appropriate system approximation model and a proper control law, which will regulate the system under the certainty zzso zzso The main difference from other relevant works of the literature lies in the proposal of a potent approximation model that is zzso with respect to the zzso zzso To deploy the zzso model, the components of the zzso plant are initially zzso by zzso zzso Then, using appropriately defined fuzzy rule indicator functions, the initial zzso fuzzy system is translated to a zzso zzso model, where the indicator functions are replaced by High Order zzso Networks zzso trained by sampled system zzso The fuzzy output partitions of the initial fuzzy components are also estimated based on sampled zzso This way, the parameters to be estimated are the weights of the zzso and the centers of the output zzso both arranged in zzso of appropriate dimensions and leading to a zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on the zzso zzso model and the design of appropriate control law we use a zzso stability analysis to obtain zzso adaptation laws and to regulate the states of the zzso The weight updating laws guarantee that both the identification error and the system states reach zero zzso fast, while keeping all signals in the closed loop zzso Moreover, introducing a method of zzso zzso zzso the updating laws are modified so that the existence of the control signal is always zzso The main characteristic of the proposed approach is that the a zzso experts information required by the identification scheme is extremely low, limited to the knowledge of the signs of the centers of the fuzzy output zzso zzso the proposed scheme is not vulnerable to initial design zzso zzso on selected examples of well-known benchmarks illustrate the potency of the zzso
