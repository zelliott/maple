Last years' mapping of diverse zzso has generated huge amounts of biological data which are currently dispersed through many zzso zzso of the information available in the various databases is required to unveil possible associations relating already known zzso Biological data are often imprecise and zzso zzso set theory is specially suitable to model imprecise data while association rules are very appropriate to integrate zzso zzso 

In this work we propose a novel fuzzy methodology based on a fuzzy association rule mining method for biological knowledge zzso We apply this methodology over a zzso zzso zzso containing zzso information regarding structural and functional zzso zzso A number of association rules have been found, many of them agreeing with previous research in the zzso In addition, a comparison between crisp and fuzzy results proves the fuzzy associations to be more reliable than crisp zzso 

An zzso approach as the one carried out in this work can unveil significant knowledge which is currently hidden and dispersed through the existing biological zzso It is shown that fuzzy association rules can model this knowledge in an intuitive way by using linguistic labels and few zzso zzso
