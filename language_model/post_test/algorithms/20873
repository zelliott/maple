Knowing of the spatial extent of neural zzso around zzso stimulating zzso is necessary to ensure that only the desired zzso are activated or to determine which zzso are responsible for an observed zzso Various approaches have been used to estimate the zzso relationship and thereby the spatial extent of zzso resulting from zzso zzso However, these approaches all require underlying assumptions and zzso and since the actual extent of zzso cannot be directly measured, the impact of zzso from these assumptions cannot be zzso We implemented a computer-based model of zzso of a population of nerve fibers and used the model to evaluate a range of approaches proposed for measuring the spatial extent of neural zzso The estimates with each method were compared with zzso of the true spatial extent of zzso that were accessible in the simulations to zzso the accuracy of the estimates and to determine the dependence of accuracy on measurement parameters zzso distance, stimulation zzso zzso A newly proposed method, based on the zzso interaction technique, provided the most accurate and most robust estimates of the spatial extent of neural zzso
