The main theme of this paper is to present robust fuzzy controllers for a class of discrete fuzzy zzso zzso First, the parallel distributed compensation method is zzso to design a fuzzy zzso which ensures the robust zzso stability of the zzso system and guarantees an zzso zzso constraint on zzso zzso for all admissible zzso Second, based on the zzso complement and some variable zzso the stability conditions of the overall fuzzy control system are formulated by linear zzso zzso Finally, the zzso and zzso of the proposed schemes are demonstrated by a zzso simulation and the Van de zzso zzso
