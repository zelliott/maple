zzso element zzso analysis is a cornerstone of zzso zzso zzso zzso medical imaging provides sufficient resolution for the zzso zzso models to be generated from these zzso zzso model development requires zzso of a three-dimensional domain, which can be the most time-consuming component of a zzso zzso zzso meshing tools based on the zzso method currently rely on the manual placement of building blocks for mesh zzso We zzso that angular analysis of the geometric zzso for a three-dimensional surface could be used to automatically generate building block structures for the zzso zzso mesh zzso Our zzso uses a set of zzso points and parameters to automatically generate a zzso structure based on a zzso geometric zzso This significantly reduces the time required for model zzso We have applied this zzso to 47 bones of varying zzso and successfully generated a zzso mesh in all zzso This work represents significant advancement in automatically generating zzso structures for a wide range of zzso
