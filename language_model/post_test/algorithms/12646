In this paper, we investigate the zzso and recognition capabilities of two approximate zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso relevance zzso machines zzso that have been recently zzso We provide an insight into the behavior of the zzso models by performing a wide zzso on a large range of real-world zzso Furthermore, we monitor various model fitting characteristics that identify the zzso nature of the proposed methods and compare against existing zzso zzso By introducing novel convergence measures, sample selection strategies and model improvements, it is demonstrated that zzso can produce state-of-the-art results on zzso discrimination zzso In addition, this is achieved by utilizing only a very small fraction of the available observation zzso
