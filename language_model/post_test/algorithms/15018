A new approach to the zzso of three-dimensional zzso medical images is zzso Instead of going through the conventional zzso scheme where the continuous function is first reconstructed from the discrete data set and then zzso the zzso is achieved with a zzso coordinate translation zzso The original image is first transformed into the zzso zzso The phase of the transform is then modified with zzso linear phase terms in the zzso direction to achieve zzso zzso coordinate translations with a distance zzso where zzso is an zzso ratio, following the phase shift zzso of zzso zzso All the translated images after inverse zzso transformation are then zzso in turn into the original zzso Since zzso plays an important role in the process, different window functions have been studied and a proper recommendation is zzso The zzso quality produced with the present method is as good as that with the sampling zzso function, while the efficiency, thanks to the fast zzso zzso is very much zzso The approach has been validated with both zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso The zzso of zzso CT and MR images are zzso
