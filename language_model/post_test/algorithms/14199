zzso zzso was prepared by the zzso method and analyzed by X-ray zzso zzso zzso zzso infrared zzso zzso scattering and X-ray zzso zzso The results showed that the structure is very similar to that of zzso zzso with space group zzso zzso and cell parameters a zzso zzso A and c zzso zzso zzso A zzso refinement of the structure was performed using zzso as the starting model and fixing the geometry of the zzso zzso as a rigid zzso zzso zzso zzso embedded cluster models are developed to analyze electronic structures, zzso and zzso of zzso zzso of zzso with the OH channel zzso is examined in detail, as an important structural zzso A periodic band structure approach was used to obtain a further estimate of relaxed atomic zzso
