We previously proposed that the zzso zzso zzso play a crucial role in action zzso zzso analysis and simulation of a zzso model of the intrinsic zzso demonstrated that its output was consistent with this zzso Here we build on that model by embedding it into a wider circuit containing the motor zzso loop and zzso zzso nucleus zzso zzso of this extended model showed that the additions gave five main results which are desirable in a zzso zzso First, low zzso actions zzso those with low zzso could be zzso Second, the range of zzso values over which actions could be switched between was zzso Third, the contrast between the selected and zzso actions was enhanced via improved differentiation of zzso from the zzso Fourth, transient increases in the zzso of a zzso action were prevented from interrupting the ongoing action, unless the transient was of sufficient zzso Finally, the selection of the ongoing action persisted when a new closely matched zzso action became zzso The first result was facilitated by the zzso zzso the rest were dependent on the presence of the zzso Thus, we conclude that the results are consistent with these structures having clearly defined functions in action zzso
