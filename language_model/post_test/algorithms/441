The well-known zzso zzso is a slight modification of the zzso zzso and provides the zzso zzso without a bias in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as an extension of zzso which now includes a bias, is zzso An zzso convergence is zzso where zzso is the number of learning zzso The zzso effort per step increases only zzso with the number of zzso In its zzso with zzso selected training patterns have to be zzso A drawback of zzso and zzso is that this set of patterns does not consist of support zzso zzso zzso as an extension of zzso overcomes this drawback by selectively forgetting all zzso zzso after a finite number of training zzso It is shown how this zzso procedure that is still very similar to the zzso zzso can be extended to zzso with soft margins and be used for training least squares support zzso machines zzso On zzso the zzso zzso achieves the same performance as standard zzso zzso
