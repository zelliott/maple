Field zzso gate zzso zzso have previously been shown as zzso platforms for zzso zzso zzso have traditionally been time-consuming and zzso requiring the neural zzso to work outside of their expert zzso This paper demonstrates a new approach to the development of neural models using an zzso zzso This design tool enables model zzso zzso zzso adjustment of model population size or zzso of an zzso zzso within hours and zzso changes zzso The approach is validated on a zzso zzso complex population model consisting of zzso style zzso and fully interconnected zzso A total of 1880 parameters are zzso user zzso on a zzso zzso The resulting implemented model performs at a theoretical zzso zzso real-time utilizing zzso of logic elements within a zzso zzso zzso zzso
