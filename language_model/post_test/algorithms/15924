zzso ground reaction forces exceeding body weight occur during the zzso phase of zzso The standard methods of zzso dynamics used to solve the impact problem do not accommodate well the zzso collision due to the persistent contact at the front foot and presence of contact at the back zzso These methods can cause a zzso energy gain on the order of the total kinetic energy of the system at zzso Additionally, these standard techniques do not zzso the contact force, but the impulse over the zzso We present an zzso impact zzso based on the penalty method to solve for the ground reaction forces during zzso The rigid body assumptions are relaxed and the bodies are allowed to penetrate one another to a small zzso Associated with the deformation is a potential, from which the contact forces are zzso The empirical zzso used in the standard approaches is replaced by two parameters to characterize the zzso and the zzso of the zzso We solve two simple zzso models to illustrate the shortcomings of a standard approach and the suitability of the proposed method for use with zzso
