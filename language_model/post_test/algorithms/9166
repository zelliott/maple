A common question within the context of de zzso motif discovery is whether a newly discovered, putative motif resembles any previously discovered motif in an existing zzso To answer this question, we define a statistical measure of zzso zzso and we describe an algorithm, called zzso for searching a database of motifs with a given query zzso Experimental simulations demonstrate the accuracy of zzso E values and its effectiveness in finding similar zzso
