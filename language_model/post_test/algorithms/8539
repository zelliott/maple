Animal studies have implicated zzso as toxic to the central nervous system and its major zzso zzso as a zzso zzso a reliable estimate of the zzso capacity for zzso in humans is of zzso However, the available models describing zzso zzso in humans lack rigorous statistical validation and also ignore the population zzso in zzso The population zzso may be estimated by the use of population zzso Furthermore, the statistical validation of zzso models may be improved by use of zzso zzso These two approaches may be combined and recently have been gaining interest in the zzso zzso A zzso zzso based zzso zzso model for zzso was zzso The model was zzso to extensive human zzso data from three previous studies in which 24 volunteers were exposed to zzso zzso of zzso at rest and various levels of zzso Model fitting was performed in a zzso framework using zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso The uncertainty around the partition zzso and zzso parameters for zzso was zzso The zzso capacity for zzso in humans was estimated to be zzso zzso zzso with a zzso standard zzso of zzso The estimated zzso is zzso higher than previously estimated, whereas the population standard zzso is estimated for the first zzso
