In recent years a variety of quantitative zzso techniques have been developed, allowing characterization of changes in protein abundance in a variety of organisms under various biological zzso Because it allows excellent control for error at all steps in sample preparation and analysis, full zzso labeling using zzso has emerged as an important strategy for quantitative zzso having been applied in a variety of organisms from zzso to zzso and even zzso However, challenges associated with complete replacement of zzso with zzso can make its application in many complex zzso systems zzso on a routine zzso zzso a concept proposed by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso Katz, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Hale, zzso zzso zzso Gomez, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso modification of isotope ratio zzso an integrated strategy for expression zzso zzso 65, zzso we investigate an alternative strategy for quantitative zzso that relies upon the subtle changes in zzso envelope shape that result from partial zzso labeling to compare relative zzso of labeled and zzso peptides in complex zzso We present a novel zzso for the automated quantitative analysis of partial incorporation samples via zzso We then compare the performance of partial zzso labeling with traditional full zzso labeling for zzso of controlled zzso of labeled and zzso zzso zzso Finally we evaluate the performance of each technique for comparison of zzso versus zzso zzso with respect to zzso and numbers of zzso and protein identifications under more realistic experimental zzso zzso full zzso labeling and partial zzso labeling prove to be comparable with respect to dynamic range, zzso and zzso although partial zzso labeling consistently allows zzso of a higher percentage of zzso observations across the dynamic zzso This difference is especially pronounced at extreme zzso Ultimately both full zzso labeling and partial zzso labeling prove to be well suited for quantitative zzso zzso
