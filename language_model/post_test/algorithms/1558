The zzso speller is a recently developed zzso visual zzso interface zzso paradigm utilizing the overt attention zzso effects on zzso visual evoked zzso zzso In this study, a novel zzso is proposed and applied in an online zzso zzso The proposed zzso zzso the spatial information of the speller zzso to provide a more precise description of the zzso response patterns, which is defined as the zzso zzso More importantly, only control state data are used in the zzso to train a zzso that nonetheless can detect the zzso state zzso Compared to an zzso with similar structure but not using the spatial profile information, the proposed zzso shows significantly higher performance for the recognition of the zzso state while achieving a comparable performance for zzso different control zzso zzso and online zzso results show that the proposed zzso speller is a promising step toward a practical, online zzso zzso system for daily zzso
