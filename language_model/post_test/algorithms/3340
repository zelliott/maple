A versatile method is presented for generating synthetic hormonal time series, containing zzso at known locations, to be used to zzso evaluate both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso statistical error rates of computerized zzso zzso zzso data are generated by assuming hormone zzso to occur as a succession of instantaneous release zzso distributed as zzso events, separated by zzso zzso The zzso are zzso to simulate zzso of consecutive events and clearance of the zzso zzso generated zzso corresponding in magnitude to typical experimental measurement error, are then added to the zzso zzso The choice of different values for simulation parameters zzso frequency and zzso of zzso allows one to emulate some typical zzso patterns of hormone zzso for zzso hormone, growth hormone, and zzso or other zzso Various zzso can be extracted from a simulated time series to study the effect of sampling frequency on the detection of zzso We show that in sampled series the zzso zzso of zzso is less than the true nominal zzso zzso for evaluating zzso zzso and expressing the results are zzso zzso of zzso zzso were analyzed with the program zzso We show that minimizing zzso error rates only might lead to excessively high zzso zzso A proper choice of sampling frequency and program probability levels can be made to provide acceptable zzso and zzso error rates for various patterns of hormone zzso
