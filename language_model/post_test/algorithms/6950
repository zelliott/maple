We introduce a zzso correlation in founder zzso for use in zzso zzso The method evaluates the correlation between zzso similarity and zzso similarity at each candidate zzso When applied to zzso Analysis Workshop 12 simulated data for disease status, age at zzso and quantitative traits zzso we found highly significant signals near four simulated disease zzso in zzso scans using zzso marker data and highly significant gene effects in three casual genes using sequence zzso
