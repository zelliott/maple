zzso zzso zzso affect the retention of zzso basic zzso in zzso zzso This influence is attributed to the disruption of the zzso zzso zzso in the mobile phase, also known as zzso zzso With an increase of zzso concentration zzso retention increases with zzso decrease in the tailing zzso Different zzso zzso at zzso zzso affect zzso basic zzso retention and peak symmetry to varying zzso The effect of the zzso of four different zzso mobile phase zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso peak zzso and efficiency on a zzso zzso column has been zzso The zzso used in this study included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The following trend in increase of basic zzso retention factor and decrease of tailing factor was zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso With the increase of the zzso concentration greater zzso loading could be achieved and consequently an increase in the apparent efficiency was observed until the maximum plate number for the column was zzso At the highest concentration of zzso the peak efficiency for most of the basic compounds studied was similar to that of the neutral zzso In contrast, the neutral zzso such as zzso showed no significant changes in zzso efficiency or loading capacity as zzso concentration was zzso
