We demonstrate two techniques to improve the quality of reconstructed optical projection zzso zzso images using the zzso transfer function zzso as a function of zzso zzso determined from zzso zzso zzso The first employs a zzso zzso filter based on the zzso frequency zzso as an additional filter during zzso reconstruction that restricts the high frequency information to the region around the focal plane and progressively decreases the spatial frequency bandwidth with zzso This helps to suppress zzso artifacts in zzso data acquired at reduced angular zzso thereby zzso faster zzso zzso This method is shown to reduce the average background by approximately zzso for an zzso of zzso and by approximately 38% for an zzso of zzso compared to standard filtered zzso As a biological zzso a zzso transgenic zzso zzso (3 days zzso was zzso to demonstrate the improved imaging speed (a quarter of the acquisition zzso The second method uses the zzso to produce an appropriate zzso filter that can be used to correct for the spatial frequency zzso applied by the imaging zzso
