To assess the influence of different table feeds zzso on vascular enhancement and image quality in patients with an abdominal zzso aneurysm zzso undergoing zzso zzso zzso zzso of the lower zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients zzso with an AAA zzso who underwent zzso zzso between January 2004 and August 2011 were included in this retrospective institutional review zzso zzso zzso zzso was conducted using 16- and zzso zzso The range of zzso was zzso and was zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Image quality was rated independently by two zzso and vessel enhancement was zzso 

Image quality was diagnostic at all zzso pelvic and almost all thigh zzso Below the knee, the number of diagnostic levels was highest for zzso and decreased to zzso zzso enhancement between the zzso and zzso trunk was not different in all zzso groups, zzso At the calf and foot strongest zzso enhancement was noted for zzso and zzso and decreased to zzso zzso 

zzso indicate that the highest image quality of zzso zzso in patients with an AAA may be obtained using table feeds measuring zzso 

zzso zzso has become a key investigation for peripheral vascular zzso zzso zzso zzso is more complex in patients with an abdominal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is feasible with a short zzso of intravenous contrast zzso zzso A constant zzso table feed provides the highest likelihood of diagnostic zzso
