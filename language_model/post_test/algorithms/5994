This communication presents the results of zzso nuclear magnetic resonance imaging zzso of a water saturated porous volcanic rock using a fast single point imaging technique zzso Imaging porous materials with zzso distributed mineral products, and air zzso using conventional imaging methods, which introduce zzso by increasing the time between the zzso and zzso zzso often results in high zzso signal losses and zzso zzso zzso images acquired of a water saturated porous rock using zzso with an effective echo time of zzso zzso zzso zzso time of zzso zzso exhibit significantly decreased zzso zzso compared to analogous images obtained with an zzso time of zzso zzso
