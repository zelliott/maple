Seasonal influenza outbreaks are a serious burden for public health worldwide and cause morbidity to millions of people each zzso In the temperate zone influenza is predominantly seasonal, with zzso occurring every winter, but the severity of the outbreaks vary substantially between zzso In this study we used a highly detailed database, which gave us both zzso and spatial information of influenza dynamics in Israel in the years zzso We use a zzso zzso epidemic zzso model to find estimates and credible confidence intervals of key zzso zzso 

Despite the biological complexity of the disease we found that a simple zzso model can be fitted successfully to the seasonal influenza zzso This was true at both the national levels and at the scale of single zzso effective zzso number zzso varies between the different years both nationally and among Israeli zzso However, we did not find differences in zzso between different Israeli cities within a zzso zzso was positively correlated to the strength of the spatial synchronization in zzso For those years in which the disease was more zzso then outbreaks in different cities tended to occur with smaller time zzso Our spatial analysis demonstrates that both the timing and the strength of the outbreak within a year are highly synchronized between the Israeli zzso We extend the spatial analysis to demonstrate the existence of high zzso between Israeli and French influenza zzso 

The data analysis combined with mathematical modeling provided a better understanding of the zzso and synchronization dynamics of influenza in Israel and between Israel and zzso Altogether, we show that despite major differences in demography and weather conditions zzso influenza zzso are tightly synchronized in both their timing and zzso while they may vary greatly between zzso The predominance of a similar main strain of zzso combined with population mixing serve to enhance local and global influenza synchronization within an influenza zzso
