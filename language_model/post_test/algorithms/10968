To estimate the uncertainty for quantitative analysis results of zzso zzso acid and zzso I in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso method was employed to determine the amounts of zzso zzso acid and zzso I in zzso zzso zzso zzso the uncertainty sources arising from the procedure of analysis, the standard uncertainty and combined uncertainty and expanded uncertainty were calculated according to the data of zzso 

This method met the requirements of modern pharmaceutical analysis, and the expand uncertainties for the zzso method of the three components are zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso measurement uncertainty to the evaluation of quantitative analysis results of active components in zzso zzso zzso is an improvement to the actual error evaluation zzso
