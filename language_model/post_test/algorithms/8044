zzso of patients with multiple sclerosis zzso characteristically have zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although conventional MR imaging can disclose chronic zzso zzso it cannot stage the degree of their zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso a recently introduced MR imaging technique, allows selective zzso of white matter zzso gray matter zzso and zzso on the basis of zzso values of classes of zzso We investigated the ability of zzso to separate zzso with longer zzso values, which likely represent zzso containing higher levels of destruction and zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso who had already undergone MR imaging twice (24 months apart) on a zzso zzso underwent a zzso MR imaging zzso Images acquired at zzso included sequences of zzso and zzso zzso SE, zzso zzso SE, and zzso transfer zzso zzso obtained at zzso included zzso and zzso zzso SE, zzso SE, zzso inversion recovery prepared fast zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso on the zzso was defined as a zzso if seen as a zzso zzso zzso with a corresponding zzso zzso for at least 24 zzso zzso were separated into 2 groups: those visible as zzso on zzso zzso zzso and those not appearing on the zzso zzso zzso 

Mean zzso ratios of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were lower zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso than those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso had more advanced tissue zzso thus, zzso is a potentially valuable method for qualitative and objective zzso
