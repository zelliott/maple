In this article, a novel zzso medical image fusion zzso method based on zzso zzso transform zzso and zzso neural network zzso is zzso The proposed zzso scheme exploits the advantages of both the zzso and the zzso to obtain better fusion zzso The source medical images are first zzso by zzso The zzso zzso zzso are fused using the zzso zzso zzso For fusing the zzso zzso zzso a zzso model is zzso zzso spatial frequency in zzso domain is input to motivate the zzso and zzso in zzso domain with large firing times are selected as zzso of the fused zzso Finally, inverse zzso zzso is applied to get the fused zzso zzso as well as objective analysis of the results and comparisons with state-of-the-art zzso techniques show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in fusing zzso medical zzso
