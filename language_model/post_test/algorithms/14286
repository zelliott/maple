A new method has been developed for reduced zzso zzso imaging with simultaneous blood zzso This method combines suppression of signals from the outer volume and zzso blood by using a zzso quadruple zzso zzso zzso pulse sequence consisting of two zzso pulse pairs separated by appropriate zzso Within each pair, inversion zzso are successively applied to the zzso slice and the slab zzso to the imaging plane with the thickness equal to the zzso size in the zzso zzso Each double inversion results in the zzso of the zzso in the central part of the zzso while the outer areas of the zzso and zzso blood remain zzso The zzso module was implemented for zzso and zzso acquisition with a fast zzso zzso zzso Based on a theoretical model of the zzso the timing parameters of the sequence corresponding to the zzso suppression efficiency can be found by minimizing the variation of the zzso signal over the entire range of zzso that occur in zzso The method was tested for zzso imaging of the zzso and carotid zzso and the results demonstrated its ability to eliminate motion and flow artifacts, reduce scan time, and improve spatial zzso
