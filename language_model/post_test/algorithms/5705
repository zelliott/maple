The World Health Organization has endorsed the zzso zzso zzso for investigation of patients suspected of having tuberculosis zzso However, its utility for routine zzso screening and detection of zzso resistance among zzso patients with advanced zzso enrolling in zzso therapy zzso services is zzso 

zzso adult zzso patients with no current zzso diagnosis enrolling in an ART clinic in a South African township were recruited regardless of zzso They were clinically zzso and invited to provide two zzso samples at a single zzso The accuracy of the zzso zzso zzso for diagnosing zzso and drug resistance was assessed in comparison with other tests, including zzso zzso zzso and automated liquid culture zzso zzso and drug zzso zzso Of 515 patients zzso zzso patients zzso zzso cell count, zzso zzso zzso range, zzso produced at least one zzso sample, yielding complete sets of results from zzso zzso zzso tuberculosis was cultured from 81 patients zzso zzso zzso The overall sensitivity of the zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso All zzso zzso disease was detected by zzso zzso from a single sample zzso zzso whereas the sensitivity for zzso zzso zzso was zzso from one zzso sample and zzso from two zzso zzso correctly identified zzso resistance in all four cases of zzso zzso but incorrectly identified resistance in three other patients whose disease was confirmed to be drug sensitive by gene sequencing zzso zzso positive zzso value, zzso 

In this population of individuals at high risk of zzso intensive screening using the zzso zzso zzso increased case detection by zzso compared with zzso zzso strongly supporting replacement of zzso for this zzso However, despite the ability of the zzso to rapidly detect zzso disease, the specificity for drug-resistant zzso was zzso
