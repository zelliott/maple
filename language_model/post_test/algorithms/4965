The field of nuclear zzso is limited by image quality and length of zzso The use of zzso resolution recovery zzso in conjunction with zzso reconstruction holds promise to improve image quality and reduce acquisition zzso This study compared the zzso zzso employing zzso resolution recovery and zzso reconstruction to filtered zzso zzso using both full-time zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso correction including scatter correction in conjunction with the zzso zzso was also zzso 

We studied zzso consecutive patients zzso with cardiac zzso and 55 with low likelihood for zzso from three nuclear zzso laboratories who had previously undergone clinically indicated zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Acquisition followed zzso guidelines zzso projections, zzso zzso zzso of the full-time data sets included zzso and zzso zzso A total of 32 projection data sets were created by stripping the full-time data sets and processing with zzso zzso zzso correction was applied to both full-time and zzso zzso images zzso and zzso zzso A consensus interpretation of three blinded readers was performed for image quality, zzso zzso and diagnostic zzso as well as severity and zzso of zzso and functional zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso processing resulted in a significant improvement in image quality in comparison with zzso Stress and rest zzso image quality zzso or zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso certainty and diagnostic accuracy were similar with zzso zzso and zzso Left zzso functional data were not different despite a slight reduction in zzso gated image zzso Application of zzso correction resulted in similar image quality and improved zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and specificity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for all zzso 

zzso processing, which incorporates zzso resolution recovery, improves image quality without sacrificing zzso certainty or diagnostic zzso Application of simultaneously acquired zzso zzso which includes scatter zzso to full-time and zzso images processed with this method, improves specificity and zzso while maintaining high image zzso
