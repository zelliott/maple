zzso tumor targeting involves the continuous realignment of the radiation beam with the zzso zzso tumor targeting offers several advantages such as improved accuracy of tumor treatment and reduced dose to surrounding zzso Current limitations to this technique include mechanical motion zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate an alternative treatment scenario using a moving average zzso The algorithm, using a suitable averaging period, accounts for variations in the average tumor position, but respiratory induced target position variations about this average are ignored during delivery and can be treated as a random error during zzso In order to test the method a comparison between five different treatment techniques was zzso zzso moving average algorithm, zzso real-time motion zzso zzso zzso motion gating (at both inhale and zzso zzso moving average gating (at both inhale and zzso and zzso zzso beam zzso Two data sets were used for the purpose of this analysis: zzso external zzso traces using different coaching techniques included 331 zzso motion traces from 24 zzso patients acquired using three different breathing types zzso breathing zzso audio coaching zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor motion included implanted zzso motion data for over 160 treatment zzso for 46 zzso and abdominal cancer patients obtained from the zzso zzso The metrics used for comparison were the group systematic error zzso the standard zzso zzso of the systematic error zzso and the root mean square of the random error zzso zzso were calculated using the formula by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso The zzso calculations for implanted zzso motion traces (all values in zzso show that M and zzso are negligible for moving average algorithm, moving average zzso and real-time tracking zzso M and zzso zzso 0 zzso compared to zzso beam zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso or gated beam delivery zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at both exhale and zzso respectively, and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at both exhale and zzso zzso Moving average zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has a slightly lower random error than zzso beam delivery zzso zzso zzso zzso though zzso moving average zzso and real-time tracking have much lower random error values for implanted zzso zzso Similar trends were also observed for the results using the external respiratory motion zzso Moving average zzso delivery significantly reduces M and zzso compared with zzso beam zzso The moving average zzso removes the zzso part of the zzso motion which is also achieved by zzso and thus the addition of the moving average zzso shows little improvement with zzso Overall, a moving average zzso shows margin reduction compared with gating and zzso beam delivery, and may have some mechanical advantages over real-time tracking when the beam is aligned with the target and patient compliance advantages over real-time tracking when the target is aligned to the zzso
