zzso ultrasound is an emerging zzso that offers new perspectives and opportunities in medical zzso zzso wave imaging zzso allows one to attain very high frame rates by transmission of zzso ultrasound zzso As a plane wave reaches a given zzso the latter becomes a secondary source emitting upward zzso waves and creating a zzso zzso in the received zzso zzso To produce an image of the zzso all the zzso must be migrated back to their zzso To perform zzso of plane wave echo zzso and return high-quality images at high frame rates, we propose a new migration method carried out in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso migration for zzso has been adapted from the zzso migration for zzso zzso This migration technique is based on the zzso zzso model zzso which consists in assuming that all the zzso explode in concert and become acoustic zzso The classical zzso model, however, is not appropriate for zzso We showed that the zzso can be made suitable for zzso by a spatial transformation of the zzso traces present in the zzso zzso In zzso experiments were performed to outline the advantages of zzso with zzso zzso migration over the conventional zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso migration was also compared with the zzso method developed by zzso zzso Our findings show that zzso compounded zzso migrated images are of quality similar to those obtained with a zzso zzso dynamic focusing zzso This remained true even with a very small number of steering angles, thus ensuring a highly competitive frame zzso In addition, the new zzso zzso migration provides comparable or better zzso ratio and lateral resolution than the zzso and zzso migration zzso zzso codes for the zzso zzso migration for zzso are zzso
