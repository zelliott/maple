zzso function is much less zzso than anticipated, zzso the requirement for sequence similarity that implies similarity in zzso function is much higher than the requirement that implies similarity in protein zzso This is because the function of an zzso is an extremely complicated problem that may involve very subtle structural details as well as many other physical chemistry zzso zzso if simply based on the sequence similarity approach, it would hardly get a decent success rate in predicting zzso zzso even for a zzso consisting of samples with 50% sequence zzso To cope with such a situation, the zzso predictor was adopted to identify the zzso for each of the six main zzso zzso It has been observed that, even for the much more stringent zzso in which none of the zzso has zzso sequence identity to any others, the overall success rates are zzso suggesting that the zzso predictor can catch the core features of the statistical samples concerned and may become a useful high zzso tool in zzso and zzso
