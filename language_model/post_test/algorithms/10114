zzso examination of the lung surface may reveal multiple ultrasound lung zzso zzso originating from zzso zzso zzso These images were demonstrated to be useful for zzso assessment of zzso pulmonary zzso Similarly, the correlation between zzso zzso zzso zzso and pulmonary zzso wedge pressure zzso was demonstrated in heart failure zzso zzso The aims of this analysis were to assess the agreement between zzso zzso decrease and the presence of zzso as well as to compare the performance of the zzso zzso and the zzso assessment in predicting zzso zzso 

We studied 23 zzso patients implanted with a zzso capable of zzso zzso measurement and alerting for fluid zzso zzso At regular follow-up and at visits for zzso zzso or device alert, clinical status was zzso chest ultrasound was performed, and zzso was zzso estimated with zzso zzso During 23 zzso 11 months of zzso 45 paired assessments of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The number of zzso resulted significantly correlated to the paired zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and to the zzso fluid index zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso During zzso 12 episodes of zzso zzso were reported in 12 zzso The zzso alert detected clinical zzso deterioration with zzso sensitivity and zzso positive zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso showed zzso sensitivity and zzso positive zzso zzso 

These data demonstrate the correlation between zzso zzso and the number of zzso at chest zzso and a good agreement between the zzso warning for fluid index and the detection of multiple zzso
