The zzso changes of living cells under drug interactions were studied by using zzso gold zzso and zzso optical section zzso The gold zzso were coated with zzso zzso which attached to the zzso of various cells by way of zzso attractive zzso A three-dimensional zzso zzso image was obtained by measuring the peak scattering zzso of gold zzso at different focal zzso An zzso for the reconstruction of 3-D cell zzso was zzso With the measured zzso images and calculations, we show zzso changes of lung cancer cells under the interaction of zzso D drug at different zzso
