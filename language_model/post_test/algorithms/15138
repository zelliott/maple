One of the important benefits of using zzso zzso zzso zzso is its capability to generate high-quality two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso and three-dimensional zzso images from zzso and zzso zzso CT zzso However, to the best of our knowledge, no results have been published on the potential diagnostic role of zzso and 3-D zzso zzso images in detecting pulmonary vein zzso a condition in which zzso has recently assumed a role as the initial zzso imaging zzso of zzso 

The purpose of this study was to compare diagnostic accuracy and interpretation time of zzso zzso and 3-D zzso images for detection of zzso pulmonary vein zzso in children, and to assess the potential added diagnostic value of zzso and 3-D zzso zzso 

We used our hospital information system to identify all consecutive children zzso 18 years of zzso with zzso pulmonary vein zzso who had both a zzso zzso zzso study and a zzso conventional zzso within 2 months from June 2005 to February zzso Two experienced pediatric zzso independently reviewed each zzso study for the presence of zzso pulmonary vein zzso defined zzso of zzso narrowing on zzso zzso and 3-D zzso zzso Final diagnosis was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso accuracy was compared using the zzso zzso level of diagnosis zzso zzso zzso perceived added diagnostic value zzso zzso zzso and interpretation time of zzso or 3-D zzso images were compared using paired zzso zzso agreement was measured using the zzso zzso zzso 

The final study population consisted of 28 children (15 boys and 13 zzso mean age: zzso zzso zzso accuracy based on 116 individual pulmonary veins for detection of zzso pulmonary vein zzso was zzso zzso of zzso for zzso zzso images, zzso (90 of 116 zzso for zzso zzso images, and zzso zzso of 116 zzso for 3-D zzso images with significantly higher accuracy with 3-D zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels for detection of zzso pulmonary vein zzso were significantly higher with 3-D zzso images zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso images zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso images zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, 3-D zzso images zzso added diagnostic value: zzso were found to provide added diagnostic value for detecting zzso pulmonary vein zzso zzso zzso zzso however, zzso zzso images did not provide added value zzso zzso zzso zzso time was significantly longer and zzso agreement was higher when using 3-D zzso images than using zzso zzso images or zzso zzso images for diagnosing zzso pulmonary vein zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Use of 3-D zzso images in the diagnosis of zzso pulmonary vein zzso in children significantly increases zzso confidence level, added diagnostic value and zzso zzso Thus, the routine use of this technique should be encouraged despite its increased interpretation zzso
