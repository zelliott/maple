With the development of zzso more and more protein sequence information has become zzso Meanwhile, the number of known zzso interactions zzso is still very zzso In this article, we propose a new method for predicting interacting protein pairs using a zzso method based on a new feature zzso We trained our model using data on zzso zzso pairs from the zzso zzso zzso core zzso Using six species of zzso database, our model demonstrates an average prediction accuracy of zzso The result showed that our method is superior to other methods in both computing time and prediction zzso
