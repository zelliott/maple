To increase the accuracy of carbon zzso beam scanning therapy, we have developed a zzso user zzso zzso zzso zzso software system for use in routine clinical practice at our zzso The zzso software is used in particular scenarios in the new treatment facility to achieve the same level of geometrical accuracy at the treatment as at the imaging zzso zzso calculation is implemented simply as the zzso of CT image zzso values along the X-ray projection zzso Since we implemented graphics processing zzso computation, the zzso images are calculated with a speed sufficient for the particular clinical practice zzso Since high spatial resolution flat panel detector zzso images should be registered to the reference zzso images in patient setup process in any scenarios, the zzso images also needs higher spatial resolution close to that of zzso zzso To overcome the limitation of the CT spatial resolution imposed by the CT zzso size, we applied image processing to improve the calculated zzso spatial zzso The zzso software introduced here enabled patient positioning with sufficient accuracy for the zzso of zzso beam scanning therapy at our zzso
