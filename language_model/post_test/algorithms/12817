zzso display vast diversity, and each one has its own set of zzso cell components and zzso zzso To assess their huge zzso zzso potential in different zzso we need high zzso tools, such as functional zzso that allow the simultaneous analysis of thousands of zzso However, most classical functional zzso use specific zzso that monitor only known zzso and so fail to cover the full microbial gene diversity present in complex zzso We have thus developed an algorithm, implemented in the zzso program zzso Design, to design efficient zzso zzso 

First we have validated our approach by studying eight zzso involved in the degradation of zzso aromatic zzso from the model strain zzso zzso zzso zzso using a designed zzso of zzso zzso As expected, zzso zzso identified the targeted set of genes induced during zzso zzso experiments with various zzso We have then confirmed the identity of these new genes by sequencing, and zzso the quantitative discrimination of our zzso by quantitative real-time zzso Finally, we have assessed zzso capacities of microbial communities in soil contaminated with aromatic zzso zzso show that our probe design zzso and zzso zzso can be used to study a complex environment zzso 

We successfully use our zzso to detect gene expression zzso zzso involved in zzso aromatic hydrocarbon degradation for the model zzso In addition, DNA zzso experiments performed on soil zzso by organic pollutants without prior sequence assumptions demonstrate high specificity and sensitivity for gene zzso zzso Design is thus a powerful, efficient tool that can be used to design zzso zzso and monitor zzso pathways in complex zzso and it may also be used to study any group of zzso The zzso Design software is freely available from the authors and can be downloaded and modified under general public zzso
