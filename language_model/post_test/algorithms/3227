To compare a vastly zzso zzso projection zzso free zzso zzso sequence and routine magnetic resonance zzso imaging for evaluating the cartilage, ligaments, zzso and zzso structures of the knee in symptomatic zzso 

All subjects signed written informed consent prior to participation in this zzso zzso institutional review zzso zzso zzso was added to the routine zzso MR imaging performed on 95 symptomatic patients zzso men, 43 zzso average age, zzso zzso who subsequently underwent zzso knee zzso All MR examinations were independently reviewed twice by two musculoskeletal zzso to detect cartilage zzso anterior and zzso cruciate ligament tears, zzso tears, and bone zzso zzso zzso first by using routine MR and second by using zzso By using zzso as the reference standard, the sensitivity and specificity of both MR protocols were zzso The zzso test was used to compare sensitivity and specificity zzso 

zzso had significantly higher specificity zzso zzso zzso for helping detect cartilage zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for routine zzso while routine MR had significantly higher sensitivity zzso zzso zzso and accuracy zzso zzso zzso for helping detect lateral zzso tears zzso sensitivity and zzso accuracy for zzso and zzso specificity and zzso accuracy for routine zzso There was no significant difference zzso zzso zzso to zzso between zzso and routine MR in the remaining sensitivity and specificity zzso zzso helped detect zzso of bone zzso zzso zzso identified at routine zzso 

zzso can provide important clinical information regarding the cartilage, ligaments, zzso and zzso structures of the knee, but is less sensitive than conventional MR imaging at helping detect lateral zzso tears and bone zzso zzso zzso
