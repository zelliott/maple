The faithful recovery of the base sequence in automatic zzso Acid zzso sequencing fundamentally depends on the underlying statistics of the DNA zzso time zzso Current DNA sequencing zzso are zzso in nature and modest in their use of statistical zzso In this paper, a formal statistical model of the DNA time series is presented and then used to construct the optimal zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso that is derived in this paper features Kalman prediction of peak locations, peak zzso zzso zzso zzso comparison and multiple hypothesis processing using the zzso Properties of the zzso are examined using both simulated and real zzso Model parameters of critical importance and their impact on different types of error mechanisms, such as insertions and zzso are pointed zzso The statistical model of the DNA zzso and the structure of the zzso zzso provides a basis for future investigation and refinement of DNA sequencing zzso
