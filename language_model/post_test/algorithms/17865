Respiratory variations in zzso pulse pressure zzso are accurate zzso of fluid responsiveness in mechanically zzso zzso However, they cannot be continuously zzso In our study, we assessed the clinical utility of a novel zzso for automatic zzso of zzso zzso 

We studied 25 patients referred for coronary artery bypass zzso zzso was continuously displayed using a method based on automatic detection zzso kernel zzso and zzso zzso All patients were under general zzso mechanical zzso and were also monitored with a pulmonary artery zzso zzso and zzso were recorded simultaneously at eight steps during surgery including before and after zzso volume expansion zzso zzso zzso zzso to volume expansion were defined as patients whose cardiac index increased by more than zzso after volume zzso 

zzso between zzso and zzso over the 200 pairs of collected data was zzso zzso zzso zzso bias zzso zzso zzso patients were zzso to volume zzso A threshold zzso value of zzso allowed discrimination of zzso to volume expansion with a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso A threshold zzso value of zzso allowed discrimination of zzso to volume expansion with a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso 

zzso is strongly correlated to zzso is an accurate predictor of fluid zzso and allows continuous monitoring of zzso This novel zzso has potential clinical zzso
