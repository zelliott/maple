zzso sequencing is a versatile approach for rapidly gathering protein coding zzso They provide direct access to an zzso gene repertoire bypassing the still zzso procedure of gene prediction from zzso zzso zzso zzso are often the only source for biological sequence data from zzso outside mainstream zzso The widespread use of zzso in evolutionary studies and particularly in molecular zzso studies is still hindered by the lack of efficient and reliable approaches for automated zzso predictions in zzso zzso methods either depend on a known species tree or cannot cope with zzso in zzso zzso 

We present a novel approach zzso to mine zzso data for the presence of zzso to a curated set of zzso zzso combines a profile Hidden zzso Model search and a subsequent zzso search to extend existing zzso cluster with sequences from further zzso We show that the zzso results are consistent with those obtained with existing zzso prediction methods that require completely zzso zzso A case study on the zzso of 35 zzso zzso illustrates that zzso is well suited to compile zzso data sets for zzso studies from zzso and protein sequence zzso 

zzso extends in a standardized manner a zzso set of zzso with zzso from further zzso In the same fashion zzso can be applied to protein sequence data, and thus provides a comprehensive approach to compile zzso cluster from any protein coding zzso The resulting zzso predictions serve as the data basis for a variety of evolutionary zzso Here, we have demonstrated the application of zzso in a molecular zzso zzso However, we envision that studies tracing the evolutionary fate of individual genes or functional complexes of genes will greatly benefit from zzso zzso predictions as zzso
