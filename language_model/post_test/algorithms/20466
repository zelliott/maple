A variety of zzso of exponential zzso transform has been derived based on the circular harmonic transform in zzso space by several research zzso However, these zzso cannot be directly applied to deal with the reconstruction for zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso in single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we derived a zzso inversion of the exponential zzso transform by employing the circular harmonic transform directly in the projection space and the image space instead of the zzso zzso Thus, a unified reconstruction framework is established for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared to many existing zzso the presented one greatly zzso the difficulty of image reconstruction due to the complicated zzso geometry and significantly reduces the zzso burden of the special functions, such as zzso or zzso zzso By the well-established zzso transform zzso our zzso is very efficient, as demonstrated by several zzso zzso
