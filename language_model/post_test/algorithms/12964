In this work we report on the observation of surface zzso properties of periodic zzso of gold zzso zzso zzso by electron beam zzso It is shown that the localized surface zzso zzso of such gold ring zzso occur in the infrared spectral region and are strongly influenced by the zzso geometry and their relative zzso Based on zzso simulations of the optical extinction zzso and of the electric zzso intensity zzso the zzso are assigned to surface zzso states arising from the strong zzso electromagnetic zzso We show that the zzso zzso zzso allows for generating infrared surface zzso zzso associated with strongly localized electromagnetic energy, thus providing zzso zzso zzso for sensing and surface enhanced zzso zzso zzso
