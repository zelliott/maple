This paper introduces a number of modifications to the learning zzso of the zzso fuzzy neural network zzso to improve zzso zzso It is shown that the modified zzso favorably compares to other evolving fuzzy systems in terms of accuracy and structural zzso An analysis of the zzso effectiveness when applied in an electroencephalogram zzso zzso interface zzso involving the zzso zzso framework is also zzso where a sensitivity analysis zzso of the zzso zzso was performed using zzso data recorded from three subjects during zzso zzso zzso The aim of this one-time zzso was to eliminate the need to choose zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso and thus apply the zzso in the zzso framework as a zzso zzso framework for zzso zzso The results indicate that a general set of zzso parameters chosen via the zzso provide the best results when tested in a zzso zzso zzso with this general set of zzso parameters and its zzso structure, in conjunction with zzso feature extraction and linear zzso zzso a fully zzso zzso that lends itself well to autonomous adaptation is zzso
