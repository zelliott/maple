zzso travelling waves are striking manifestations of zzso and zzso zzso However, few systems are well enough documented both to detect repeated waves and to explain their interaction with zzso variations in population structure and zzso Here, we demonstrate zzso epidemic travelling waves in an exhaustive zzso data set for zzso in England and zzso We use zzso phase analysis, which allows for zzso zzso complication in interpreting zzso patterns in these and many other ecological time zzso In the zzso era, conspicuous zzso waves of infection moved regionally from large cities to small zzso the introduction of zzso vaccination restricted but did not eliminate this zzso zzso A zzso zzso model suggests a zzso explanation for the zzso via zzso zzso from large zzso cities to smaller zzso zzso Thus, the spatial hierarchy of host population structure is a prerequisite for these infection zzso
