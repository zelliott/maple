Clinical pathways leave zzso described as event sequences with regard to a mixture of various zzso treatment zzso zzso similarities between patient traces can zzso be exploited further as a basis for providing insights into the zzso and zzso existing techniques of clinical zzso analysis zzso which mainly focus on looking at zzso data seen from an external zzso Most existing methods measure similarities between patient traces via computing the relative distance between their event zzso However, clinical zzso as typical zzso zzso always take place in an zzso fashion, zzso clinical events occur arbitrarily without a particular zzso Bringing order in the chaos of clinical pathways may decline the accuracy of similarity measure between patient zzso and may distort the efficiency of further analysis zzso In this paper, we present a behavioral topic analysis approach to measure similarities between patient zzso More specifically, a zzso zzso model, zzso zzso zzso allocation zzso is employed to discover zzso treatment behaviors of patient traces for clinical pathways such that similarities of zzso patient traces can be measured based on their underlying behavioral topical zzso The presented method provides a basis for further applications in zzso In particular, three possible applications are introduced in this paper, zzso patient trace zzso zzso and anomaly zzso The proposed approach and the presented applications are evaluated via a real-world zzso of several specific clinical pathways collected from a Chinese zzso
