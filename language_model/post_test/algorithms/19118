zzso of a simplified zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso and a conventional zzso technique regarding dose zzso target coverage, feasibility and, for the first time, zzso reliability in patients with large breasts treated zzso for breast cancer on a low-energy zzso 

CT zzso of ten patients with relatively large breast volumes treated for breast cancer were zzso For each patient, four treatment plans were zzso low-energy conventional zzso zzso conventional zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso and zzso were created with the aid of a three-dimensional dose zzso zzso accuracy of each technique was evaluated in an zzso zzso zzso 

The mean of planning target volumes receiving zzso zzso or zzso zzso of the prescribed total dose was reduced from zzso to zzso to zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso plans, zzso Phantom dose zzso agreed well with the calculated dose within the breast zzso 

zzso zzso using two zzso incident beam directions, as well as a zzso technique with inverse zzso provide a better alternative to the standard wedged zzso beams for patients with large breasts treated on low-energy zzso while maintaining the efficiency of the zzso and delivery zzso
