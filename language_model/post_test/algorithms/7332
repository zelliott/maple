zzso cut sets are a valuable tool for analyzing zzso networks and for identifying optimal gene intervention strategies by eliminating unwanted zzso functions and keeping desired zzso zzso cut sets rely on the concept of elementary flux zzso which are sets of zzso zzso pathways under zzso zzso However, the zzso of minimal cut sets is zzso as even zzso zzso networks with just 100 reactions easily have several hundred million elementary flux zzso We developed a minimal cut set tool that zzso the well-known zzso zzso and zzso a novel approach to significantly reduce the program run time by using zzso bit pattern zzso By using the introduced tree approach, the size of zzso models that can be analyzed and zzso by minimal cut sets is pushed to new and considerably higher zzso
