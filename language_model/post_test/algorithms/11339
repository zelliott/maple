Multiple comparison procedures that control a zzso error rate or false discovery rate provide an achieved error rate as the adjusted zzso or zzso for each hypothesis zzso However, since achieved error rates are not understood as probabilities that the zzso hypotheses are true, empirical zzso methods have been employed to estimate such zzso zzso called local false discovery rates zzso to emphasize that their zzso are unknown and of the frequency zzso The main approaches to zzso zzso relying either on fully zzso models to maximize likelihood or on the presence of enough hypotheses for zzso density zzso lack the simplicity and zzso of adjusted zzso To begin filling the zzso this paper introduces simple methods of zzso zzso with proven zzso conservatism without assuming the zzso distribution is in a zzso zzso zzso indicate that they remain conservative even for very small numbers of zzso One of the proposed procedures enables interpreting the original zzso control rule in terms of zzso zzso thereby zzso practical use of the zzso The most conservative of the new procedures is applied to measured abundance levels of 20 zzso
