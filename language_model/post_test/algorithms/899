A strategy is described for the rapid alignment of many long zzso acid or protein sequences on a zzso The program described can handle up to 100 sequences of 1200 zzso zzso The approach is based on progressively aligning sequences according to the branching order in an initial zzso zzso The results obtained using the package appear to be as sensitive as those from any other available zzso
