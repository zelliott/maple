zzso patients undergoing repair of zzso cardiac abnormalities have a significant risk of an adverse zzso zzso Therefore this retrospective cohort study examined the potential benefit of interventions based on zzso zzso monitoring in decreasing both zzso zzso zzso and length of hospital stay as a cost zzso 

With informed parental consent approved by the institutional review board, zzso zzso zzso zzso measurement of middle cerebral artery blood flow zzso and zzso zzso cerebral zzso were monitored in 250 zzso An zzso zzso was used to detect and correct specific deficiencies in cerebral zzso or zzso or to increase cerebral tolerance to zzso or zzso 

zzso changes in brain zzso or metabolism were observed in 176 of 250 zzso zzso zzso that altered patient management was initially deemed appropriate in 130 of 176 zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso seizure, movement, vision or speech zzso occurred in five of 74 zzso patients without noteworthy change, seven of 130 zzso patients with intervention, and 12 of 46 zzso patients without intervention zzso zzso zzso zzso median length of stay was 6 days in the zzso and intervention groups but 9 days in the zzso zzso In addition, the percentage of patients in the zzso group discharged from the hospital within 1 week zzso was significantly less than that in either the intervention zzso p zzso zzso or zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso On the basis of an estimated hospital zzso complication cost of zzso per day, zzso analysis justified a hospital expenditure for zzso monitoring of zzso per zzso 

zzso based on zzso monitoring appear to decrease the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and reduce the length of zzso zzso as the zzso cost for zzso monitoring is more than four times the actual average charge, both patients and hospital may profit from this zzso Because this study was not a truly zzso clinical trial, unintentional statistical bias may have occurred and caution is urged in interpreting the magnitude of apparent intergroup outcome zzso
