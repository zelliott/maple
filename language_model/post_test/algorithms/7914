A technique is presented to allow a breathing pattern to be obtained from any zzso CT, zzso or other series of sequential chest zzso image zzso The technique requires no extra signals to be recorded and does not need specific external or internal zzso structures to be visible in the field of zzso The breathing pattern is instead acquired from zzso the variation in zzso values between projection zzso For zzso image sets, slowly varying changes, due to an angular zzso zzso must be corrected before the breathing trace analysis can zzso All the results of the new technique were checked visually and were in good zzso If the studied image set could be zzso using the existing zzso zzso technique, then the results it provided were also used for zzso In cases that allowed comparison by both techniques, the results were in zzso The new technique was also shown to provide a usable signal when applied to cardiac zzso
