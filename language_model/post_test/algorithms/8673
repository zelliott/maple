The commonly used setup of an automatic zzso was analyzed as a control system, modeling the measuring device and the patient in a simple but effective zzso zzso limits in response time, zzso zzso zzso and accuracy were defined in order to approach the zzso zzso We developed a new control zzso and defined the gain zzso which can lead the system within these zzso Computer simulations with model parameters from literature zzso and from experimental data zzso zzso are zzso zzso in zzso trials are also zzso
