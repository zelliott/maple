A novel pulse zzso technique is developed that improves the zzso resolution of an zzso imaging system and provides a boost in the echo zzso ratio zzso The new technique, called the resolution enhancement zzso zzso technique, was validated with simulations and experimental zzso Image quality was examined in terms of three zzso the zzso the zzso and the zzso resolution through the zzso transfer function zzso zzso were conducted with a zzso zzso ultrasound source with a center frequency of zzso zzso Experimental zzso were carried out with a zzso zzso zzso with a center frequency of zzso zzso from a zzso zzso and wire zzso In simulations, zzso resolution of the zzso imaging system was almost doubled using the zzso technique zzso zzso versus conventional pulsing techniques zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso bandwidth was more than doubled from zzso to zzso and maximum range zzso were zzso zzso Experimental zzso revealed an improvement in zzso resolution using the zzso technique zzso zzso versus conventional pulsing zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso bandwidth was doubled from zzso to zzso and maximum range zzso were observed at zzso zzso In addition, a significant gain in zzso (9 to zzso zzso was zzso
