Given a family of related zzso one can first determine alignments between various pairs of those zzso then construct a simultaneous alignment of all the sequences that is determined in a natural manner by the set of zzso zzso This approach is sometimes effective for exposing the existence and locations of zzso regions, which can then be aligned by more sensitive zzso zzso This paper presents an efficient zzso for constructing a multiple alignment from a set of zzso zzso
