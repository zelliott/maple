With the introduction of zzso index zzso as a measure of a patient's sedation during general zzso attention has been directed toward zzso analysis of zzso zzso In the present study we evaluated the relationship between zzso zzso and zzso zzso Sixteen zzso physical status zzso patients scheduled for zzso abdominal surgery were enrolled in the zzso zzso was induced with zzso zzso and maintained with zzso and oxygen zzso Just before surgery, IV zzso (2 zzso was given and then continuously infused (2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using software we developed, zzso zzso zzso and zzso spectral edge frequency zzso were recorded at zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Under light zzso zzso zzso values were zzso With increasing zzso zzso 2 zzso of zzso emerged along the diagonal line zzso zzso zzso Both the first (at around 4 zzso and second (at around 10 zzso grew higher zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as the zzso concentration increased to zzso However, the first peak leveled off whereas the second tended to decrease slightly with further increases in zzso zzso The zzso value decreased as the zzso concentration increased and leveled off at zzso and higher zzso of zzso The zzso 95 also decreased as the zzso concentration increased up to zzso Thus the distribution pattern of the two zzso zzso is likely to be better than zzso of the zzso effect of zzso during zzso
