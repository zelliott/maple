Recent studies in zzso zzso and brain machine zzso have shown the utility of recording zzso zzso zzso with greater spatial zzso Many of these studies zzso zzso connected to specialized amplifiers that are zzso for such zzso We recently measured the zzso of several commercial zzso and demonstrated that they will distort zzso signals if connected to clinical zzso amplifiers commonly used in most zzso In this study we demonstrate the clinical implications of this effect and identify some of the potential difficulties in using zzso 

Human zzso data were digitally filtered to simulate the signal recorded by a hybrid grid zzso zzso and eight zzso connected to a standard zzso zzso The filtered zzso data were read by three trained zzso and high frequency zzso zzso were detected with a well-known zzso The filtering method was verified zzso by recording an injected zzso signal in a saline bath with the same physical acquisition system used to generate the zzso Several zzso underwent scanning electron zzso zzso 

zzso recordings were zzso compared to the source zzso zzso but zzso attenuated low zzso The attenuated signals were difficult to zzso all three clinicians changed their clinical scoring of slowing and zzso when presented with the same data recorded on different sized zzso The zzso detection zzso was zzso with zzso zzso many more zzso than when the same data were recorded with zzso In addition, during experimental recordings the zzso produced much greater noise as well as large baseline zzso creating sharply contoured zzso and superimposed zzso zzso zzso of these zzso demonstrated marked zzso in exposed zzso surface area, lead fractures, and sharp zzso 

zzso should not be used with low zzso zzso zzso amplifiers due to severe signal zzso and zzso that changes clinical zzso The current method of preparing zzso can leave sharp edges and zzso amounts of exposed zzso Even when recorded with higher zzso zzso zzso data are highly prone to artifacts that are difficult to zzso Great care must be taken when analyzing zzso from high zzso zzso
