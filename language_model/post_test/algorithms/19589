We sought to assess the influence of emergency department zzso structure and care processes on adherence to practice guidelines for the treatment of patients with zzso zzso acute coronary zzso 

We surveyed emergency physicians and nurses from zzso hospitals participating in the zzso Quality Improvement Initiative and used multivariable modeling to correlate zzso characteristics with guidelines zzso 

zzso that were significantly associated with improved guidelines adherence included collaboration between emergency physicians and hospital administration, northeast region, adequate nursing support, use of zzso zzso physicians, an independent zzso (not a division of another clinical zzso and use of a care zzso for acute coronary zzso 

Quality improvement strategies that have the full support of hospital administration, focus on increasing collaboration between emergency physicians and other health care providers, and specified zzso management zzso may be the most successful methods for improving the care and outcomes of patients with zzso zzso acute coronary zzso
