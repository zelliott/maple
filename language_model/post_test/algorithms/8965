zzso human motion analysis is an important tool in clinical research and in many practical zzso Missing marker information caused by zzso or a marker falling off is a common problem zzso data zzso The current paper proposes a zzso new gap filling zzso and presents results from a zzso zzso The underlying idea of the proposed zzso was that a multitude of internal and external constraints govern human motion and lead to a highly zzso movement pattern in which all motion variables are zzso in a specific zzso Two principal component analyses were used to determine how the coordinates of a marker with gaps correlated with the coordinates of the other, zzso zzso Missing marker data could then be reconstructed through a series of coordinate zzso The proposed zzso was tested by reconstructing artificially created gaps in a zzso walking trial and in an zzso zzso balance zzso The measurement zzso dependence on the marker position, the length of the zzso and other parameters were zzso Even if only 2 steps of walking or zzso s of zzso sway zzso of the whole marker zzso were provided as input in the current study, the reconstructed marker trajectory differed on average no more than 11 zzso from the originally measured zzso The reconstructed result improved further, on average, to distances below 5 zzso if the marker trajectory was available more than 50% of the zzso The results of this zzso analysis supported the assumption that missing marker information can be reconstructed from the zzso between marker zzso provided that sufficient data with complete marker information is zzso zzso missing information cannot be avoided entirely in many situations in human motion zzso For some of these situations, the proposed reconstruction method may provide a better solution than what is currently zzso
