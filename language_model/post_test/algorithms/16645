When zzso light passes through a homogeneous absorbing zzso the zzso is zzso to the growth of concentration and thickness of the zzso which is the zzso zzso The shade selection of protein solution zzso for a certain time from different angles makes different zzso which does not meet the zzso zzso zzso we derive that the zzso A is not only zzso to the concentration and thickness of the medium but also zzso to the light area zzso of a certain zzso For the same protein solution, we can obtain the zzso A of six directions and thus get six values for zzso the relative ratio of which will inevitably reveal plentiful information of the protein zzso The zzso of the protein can be easily drawn out by software zzso zzso We have drawn out the molecular shape of zzso and bovine serum zzso In brief, we have developed the zzso law zzso and a new method of exploring protein spatial zzso
