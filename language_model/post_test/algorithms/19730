Due to a delayed zzso zzso zzso echo sequences zzso allow for an enhanced zzso at short repetition zzso While they are in use with and without zzso zzso zzso solutions are only known for the zzso The signal formation in the former could only be assessed in zzso form, so zzso In this article an exact zzso solution is presented for zzso zzso sequences with zzso phase zzso Besides providing a better zzso performance, it should be useful for systematic sequence zzso The relation to recent zzso solutions is zzso
