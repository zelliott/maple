A simple zzso network model of the zzso zzso is zzso From a control perspective, the analysis suggests a dynamic scheduled control mechanisms by which the zzso may perform regulation of the blood zzso The main objectives of this work are to investigate the zzso and dynamic response characteristics of the single zzso and the network, to analyze the zzso dynamic scheduled control function of the model, and to apply the zzso to zzso process control zzso The dynamic scheduling activity of the network is exploited in two control zzso Control structure I is drawn directly from the present model of the zzso zzso An application of this structure for level control in a zzso tank is zzso Control structure II employs an explicit set point to determine the feedback zzso The performance of this control structure is illustrated on a zzso continuous stirred tank reactor with van de zzso zzso The two case studies validate the dynamic scheduled control approach for zzso process control zzso
