zzso optical traps are widely used where long working zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or standing light waves are zzso We demonstrate that optical zzso can automatically provide a zzso replica of a wide range of incident light fields in an optical zzso zzso The resulting zzso traps are zzso and adapt zzso to changes of the input light zzso It is shown that not only single zzso traps can be implemented by zzso but also structured light fields can be zzso This step towards more complex traps enables advanced state-of-the-art applications where multiple traps or other elaborated zzso scenarios are zzso The resulting traps cannot only be used zzso but they can be rearranged in real-time and allow for interactive dynamic zzso
