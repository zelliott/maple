Plasma insulin zzso from mice, rats, dogs, and humans indicate that insulin levels are zzso reflecting zzso insulin zzso from individual zzso An unanswered question, however, is how the activity of a population of zzso is coordinated to yield coherent zzso in plasma zzso Here, using mathematical zzso we investigate the feasibility of a potential zzso synchronization zzso zzso zzso This hypothesis is based on well-established experimental evidence demonstrating zzso zzso zzso zzso and recent in zzso evidence that a brief application of a zzso zzso can zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate using mathematical modeling that periodic zzso of zzso released from zzso zzso is indeed able to coordinate the activity of a population of simulated zzso even if only a fraction of these are zzso The role of zzso zzso is also zzso The results suggest that the existence of zzso input to the zzso may serve as a regulator of zzso insulin zzso in zzso
