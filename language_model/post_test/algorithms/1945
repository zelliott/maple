The characterization of zzso formation in zzso zzso zzso is of increased interest for identifying genes which account for zzso and coronary artery diseases zzso In particular, we are interested in large-scale studies on zzso which result in large amount of data, and require automatic zzso In this work, we present an zzso solution for the zzso extraction of parameters zzso the zzso development of zzso zzso Our system is based on the joint zzso of zzso and zzso regions over zzso This task is made difficult by the low contrast and the high dynamic conditions observed in zzso zzso microscopic zzso Our key idea is to perform this zzso by distinguishing the different motion patterns in image time series rather than by solving standard image zzso tasks in each image zzso Thus, we are able to compensate for the poor imaging zzso We model motion patterns by energies based on the idea of dynamic zzso and zzso the model by two prior energies on the shape of the zzso region and on the zzso relationship between the zzso and the zzso We demonstrate the performance of our zzso zzso by qualitative and quantitative experiments on synthetic examples as well as on real in zzso microscopic zzso
