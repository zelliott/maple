Display lag in simulation environments with zzso displays causes a loss of immersion that degrades the value of zzso reality training zzso zzso use zzso tracking to compensate for display lag, preparing display updates based on the anticipated head zzso This paper proposes a new method for predicting head orientation using a delta zzso zzso extended Kalman filter zzso and compares the performance to a zzso zzso The proposed framework operates on the change in zzso between consecutive data frames (the zzso which avoids the heavy zzso burden of the zzso motion zzso Head zzso is estimated from the zzso by an zzso and then used to predict future head zzso We have tested the new framework with captured head motion data and compared it with the zzso expensive zzso zzso Experimental results indicate that the proposed zzso method provides the accuracy of the zzso method without the heavy zzso zzso
