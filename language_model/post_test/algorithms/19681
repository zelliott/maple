This paper outlines an zzso relaxation approach based on the analog zzso neural network zzso for solving the image change detection problem between two zzso A difference image is obtained by zzso zzso by zzso both zzso The network zzso is built so that each zzso in the difference image is a zzso in the zzso Each zzso is characterized by its state, which determines if a zzso has zzso An energy function is zzso so that the network zzso to stable zzso The analog zzso model allows each zzso to take on analog state zzso Unlike most widely used approaches, where zzso labels zzso are assigned to each zzso the analog property provides the strength of the zzso The main contribution of this paper is reflected in the zzso of the analog zzso neural network to derive an automatic image change detection zzso When a zzso is being zzso some existing image change detection procedures consider only zzso relations on its zzso The main drawback of such approaches is the labeling of this zzso as changed or unchanged according to the information supplied by its neighbors, where its own information is zzso The zzso model overcomes this drawback and for each zzso allows a zzso between the influence of its neighborhood and its own zzso This is mapped under the energy function to be zzso The performance of the proposed method is illustrated by comparative analysis against some existing image change detection zzso
