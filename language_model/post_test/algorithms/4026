The development of molecular signatures for the prediction of zzso outcomes is a zzso challenging task in zzso and zzso Although there are numerous approaches for the derivation of marker combinations and their zzso the underlying methodology often suffers from the problem that different zzso criteria are mixed during the feature selection, zzso and evaluation zzso This might result in marker combinations that are zzso regarding the evaluation criterion of zzso To address this issue, we propose a unified framework to derive and evaluate zzso zzso Our approach is based on the zzso index for zzso data, which is a zzso measure to zzso the zzso power of a prediction zzso Specifically, we propose a zzso boosting zzso that results in linear zzso combinations that are optimal with respect to a smoothed version of the zzso zzso We investigate the performance of our zzso in a large-scale simulation study and in two molecular data sets for the prediction of survival in breast cancer zzso Our zzso results show that the new approach is not only zzso sound but can also lead to a higher zzso power than traditional approaches for the derivation of gene zzso
