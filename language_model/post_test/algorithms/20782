The application of phase imaging to zzso index profiling of an optical fiber slice is zzso It is shown that the zzso index profile of zzso zzso and zzso optical fibers can be obtained from quantitative phase image of thin zzso optical fiber zzso Although this method requires careful and time consuming sample preparation, one advantage of this technique is that it can be applied to a wide range of optical zzso In this paper results for both zzso and zzso fibers are presented and good agreement with the zzso zzso zzso technique zzso
