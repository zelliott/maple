Data at zzso K for zzso zzso solutions containing either zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso or zzso are zzso The mean zzso activity zzso of zzso were determined from zzso of the responses of a sodium and a zzso zzso zzso The activity zzso of the precursors or the antibiotics were calculated from the values of the mean zzso activity zzso using the exact cross differential relation between zzso The correlation of zzso data using the activity zzso measured in this work shows the same puzzling results previously observed in systems containing zzso zzso
