There is increasing interest in using robotic devices to assist in movement training following zzso injuries such as stroke and spinal zzso zzso This paper reviews control strategies for robotic therapy zzso Several categories of strategies have been proposed, including, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The greatest amount of work has been done on developing zzso strategies, and thus the majority of this review summarizes techniques for implementing zzso strategies, including zzso zzso and zzso based zzso as well as zzso controllers that modify control parameters based on ongoing participant zzso Clinical evidence regarding the relative effectiveness of different types of robotic therapy controllers is zzso but there is initial evidence that some control strategies are more effective than zzso It is also now apparent there may be mechanisms by which some robotic control approaches might actually decrease the recovery possible with comparable, zzso forms of zzso In future research, there is a need for head-to-head comparison of control zzso in randomized, controlled clinical trials, and for improved models of human motor recovery to provide a more rational framework for designing robotic therapy control zzso
