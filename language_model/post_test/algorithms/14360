This paper presents an original zzso image registration approach, which tends to improve the registration by establishing a zzso image zzso In order to gather more information about the image transformation it measures the image similarity in both registration zzso The presented solution is based on the interaction between the images involved in the registration zzso Images interact through forces, which according to Newton's zzso law form a zzso zzso These forces may transform both of the images, although in our zzso one of the images remains zzso The experiments performed to demonstrate the advantages of the zzso registration approach involve the registration of simple objects, the recovery of synthetic zzso and the zzso registration of real images of the zzso The results show that the zzso approach improves both the registration consistency and the registration zzso
