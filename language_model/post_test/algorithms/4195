zzso and zzso interactions govern a substantial portion of the variation in complex traits and zzso In convention, a set of either unrelated or family samples are used in detection of such zzso even when both kinds of data are available, the unrelated and the family samples are analyzed zzso potentially leading to loss in statistical zzso In this report, to detect zzso interactions we propose a generalized zzso zzso reduction method that zzso analyses of nuclear families and unrelated subjects within the same statistical zzso We used principal components as genetic background controls against population stratification, and when sibling data are included, zzso control were used to correct for potential zzso association at the tested zzso Through comprehensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method can remarkably increase power by pooling unrelated and zzso samples together as compared with individual analysis strategies and the zzso combining p value method while it retains a controlled type I error rate in the presence of population zzso In application to a real zzso we detected one significant zzso interaction among zzso zzso zzso and zzso associated with nicotine dependence in the Study of zzso zzso and Environment sample, suggesting the biological role of these genes in nicotine dependence zzso
