A GE zzso zzso zzso has been recently installed on a zzso 43 and is used with 6, 18 and 25 zzso zzso zzso In the integrated GE zzso the lower pair of jaws in the X direction is replaced by 32 pairs of computer controlled opposed zzso zzso The influence of each set of leaves on the output ratio is smaller than the influence of the jaws it replaces zzso instead of zzso For irregular fields it is necessary to evaluate the influence on the output ratio of each independent zzso It is assumed that each leaf and each jaw have an independent influence on the output zzso According to this assumption leaf correction functions are derived from zzso as a function of their X zzso A zzso correction (less than zzso has to be applied for the jaw zzso The output ratio in a zzso for a given irregular field can be calculated by the product of the 64 leaf and two jaw correction zzso The zzso is applied to zzso square and zzso fields, zzso and irregular zzso For all fields checked, the calculated and the measured output ratios agree within zzso zzso the simple formula suggested by zzso and zzso for square field sizes equivalent to zzso fields can be used with a good accuracy with an A value of zzso for the three energies zzso The proposed zzso to calculate the output ratio in a zzso is restricted to fields including the zzso axis with a minimum distance of 2 zzso between any leaf and the zzso zzso
