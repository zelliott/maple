Although zzso has been shown clinically to increase skin doses for some patients, it has also been shown that intensity modulated delivery does not, of itself, increase skin zzso The reason for this apparent difference is that inverse planning can result in solutions that give high zzso to zzso beam segments near the skin surface, in an attempt to counter the zzso zzso In cases where the clinical target volume zzso stops short of the skin surface, but the planning target volume zzso does not, there is no clinical reason to treat the zzso The zzso margin exists purely to ensure that fields are large enough to allow for geometrical zzso With an objective function based on the doses to the zzso it is possible for a plan that gives excess zzso to the skin to have a lower objective function, and hence to be preferred in an zzso We describe a technique of plan zzso based on analysis of a plan by zzso several plans in which the zzso has been offset by a distance equal to the zzso zzso We demonstrate that changes to a plan that reduce a zzso objective can give a worse dose distribution to the zzso when systematic and random zzso errors are accounted for, and increase skin zzso Several possible strategies for avoiding this problem are discussed, including the use of the skin as an organ at risk, modification of the zzso to avoid the skin, and the use of zzso zzso applied in planning but not in zzso The latter gave the best zzso The possibility of using the evaluation method itself, as the basis of an objective function for zzso is zzso
