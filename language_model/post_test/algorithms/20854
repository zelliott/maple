In this work controlled phase shift gates are implemented on a zzso system, by using zzso geometric zzso A general procedure is given, for implementing controlled phase shift gates in an zzso level zzso The utility of such controlled phase shift gates, is demonstrated here by implementing zzso zzso zzso on a zzso zzso nucleus oriented in a liquid crystal zzso
