zzso is defined as an zzso rhythmic muscle contraction that generally occurs in people who have sustained zzso involving descending motor pathways in the zzso and is usually accompanied by other signs of zzso zzso such as zzso This paper zzso that zzso arises when two conditions occur zzso 1) the zzso zzso contains long delay times zzso zzso of zzso limb muscles, exacerbated when these muscles display slow zzso zzso and 2) the zzso of the zzso is zzso This paper tested this dual hypothesis by developing a computer model representing the ankle zzso zzso This model included the ankle muscles, zzso and zzso zzso and a zzso spinal link between zzso zzso and zzso zzso show that as the zzso current threshold was reduced zzso increased zzso of spinal zzso normal zzso responses became unstable and zzso developed similar to those observed in zzso zzso In zzso when we choose zzso delay times typical for zzso leg muscles in man, system stability is poor, and zzso occur readily with increasing zzso zzso As simulated zzso delays are reduced, zzso behavior is also reduced, and usually zzso zzso zzso as simulated zzso delays are increased, zzso increase in zzso and do not zzso Finally, these two phenomena zzso so that increasing zzso zzso will induce zzso zzso for intermediate loop zzso These findings support the hypothesis that unstable zzso behavior, such as the zzso observed in zzso will occur when the zzso zzso increases in a zzso zzso containing long zzso This change in zzso is zzso by a reduction in zzso firing zzso rather than by an increase in feedback zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that sustained zzso occur readily through self zzso which reduces the need to propose that a zzso zzso must be involved in generating zzso
