A molecular origin of the striking rate increase observed in a reaction on water is studied zzso A key aspect of the zzso rate phenomenon is the chemistry between water and zzso that occurs at an zzso phase zzso In particular, the structure of water at the zzso interface of an oil zzso in which approximately one in every four zzso water molecules has a free zzso OH group that zzso into the organic phase, plays a key role in catalyzing reactions via the formation of hydrogen zzso zzso is expected when these zzso form stronger hydrogen bonds with the transition state than with the zzso In experiments more than a 5 orders of magnitude enhancement in rate constant was found in a chosen zzso The structural arrangement at the zzso interface is in contrast to the structure of water molecules around a small zzso zzso in homogeneous solution, where the water molecules are zzso zzso The latter implies that a breaking of an existing zzso network in homogeneous solution is needed in order to permit a zzso effect of hydrogen bonds, but not for the zzso zzso zzso the reaction in homogeneous zzso solution is zzso slower than the surface reaction, as observed zzso The proposed mechanism of rate acceleration is discussed in light of other zzso reactions that showed smaller zzso in zzso To interpret the results in different media, a method is given for comparing the rate zzso of different rate zzso zzso neat and zzso all of which have different units, by introducing models that reduce them to the same zzso The observed zzso kinetic isotope effect is discussed briefly, and some experiments are suggested that can test the present interpretation and increase our understanding of the zzso zzso
