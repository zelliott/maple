An uncertainty budget was constructed for the measurement of ethanol in blood by zzso gas zzso The uncertainty budget, covering the zzso range of ethanol zzso up to zzso zzso included zzso uncertainty zzso zzso uncertainty zzso and effects caused by zzso variation in blood water zzso The zzso combined standard uncertainty was estimated from duplicate zzso of real samples and included contributions from zzso recovery, variation between zzso injection, zzso of zzso signals, and statistical uncertainty of the zzso zzso The zzso uncertainty was estimated in a zzso based on information about the zzso and about the preparation of the zzso zzso Two uncertainty components depended on the zzso variation in blood water zzso First, it caused uncertainty on the density of the blood, and second, it had an effect on the gas phase concentration of ethanol when doing the zzso zzso These effects as well as their zzso were included in the uncertainty zzso For fresh blood samples, the zzso uncertainty was the dominating uncertainty zzso accounting for approximately zzso of the zzso For blood samples collected 100 h zzso the zzso variation in blood water content was the largest uncertainty zzso It was demonstrated that zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso from the results was sufficient to keep the risk of committing a type 1 error below zzso in ethanol zzso ranging up to 2 zzso for fresh blood zzso This risk was higher for zzso blood samples because of the higher uncertainty of zzso but still less than approximately zzso
