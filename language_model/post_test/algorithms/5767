zzso the energy consumption of water distribution networks has never had more zzso The greatest energy savings can be obtained by carefully scheduling the operations of zzso zzso can be defined either zzso in terms of other elements of the network such as tank zzso or zzso by specifying the time during which each pump is zzso The traditional representation of explicit schedules is a string of zzso values with each bit representing pump zzso status during a particular time zzso In this paper, we formally define and analyze two new explicit representations based on zzso zzso where the maximum number of pump switches is established beforehand and the schedule may contain fewer than the maximum number of zzso In these zzso a pump schedule is divided into a series of zzso with each zzso representing the number of hours for which a pump is zzso This reduces the number of potential schedules compared to the zzso zzso and allows the zzso to operate on the feasible region of the search zzso We propose evolutionary operators for these two new zzso The new representations and their corresponding operations are compared with the two zzso representations in pump zzso zzso zzso representation and zzso zzso A detailed statistical analysis of the results indicates which parameters have the greatest effect on the performance of evolutionary zzso The empirical results show that an evolutionary zzso using the proposed representations is an improvement over the results obtained by a recent state of the art hybrid genetic zzso for pump scheduling using zzso zzso
