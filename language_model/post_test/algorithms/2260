The present work introduces a running discrete zzso transform zzso for zzso analysis zzso of zzso short-term zzso The zzso zzso adapts a window function, which has adjustable zzso zzso A generalized weighting filter was proposed, which maps the zzso signal into the zzso zzso As an example the weighting filters were deduced for zzso gamma and zzso window zzso Application of the zzso zzso to the analysis of biomedical signals is zzso
