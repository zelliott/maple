zzso of contact maps may be seen as a strategic step towards the solution of fundamental open problems in structural zzso In this paper we focus on coarse zzso maps that describe the spatial neighborhood relation between secondary structure elements zzso zzso and zzso of a zzso We introduce a new machine learning approach for scoring candidate contact zzso The method combines a specialized zzso zzso zzso architecture and a zzso graph search zzso The network is trained using candidate zzso generated during zzso We show how the process of selecting and generating training examples is important for tuning the precision of the zzso
