Biological pathways are important for understanding biological zzso Thus, finding important pathways that zzso biological problems helps researchers to focus on the most relevant sets of zzso Pathways resemble networks with complicated structures, but most of the existing zzso enrichment tools ignore zzso information embedded within zzso which limits their zzso 

A systematic and zzso zzso enrichment method in which zzso are weighted by network zzso was zzso We demonstrate how choice of zzso structure and zzso zzso as well as the presence of key zzso affects zzso zzso We emphasize two improvements of our method over current zzso First, allowing for the diversity of zzso characters and the difficulty of covering gene importance from all aspects, we set zzso as an optional zzso in the zzso Second, zzso rather than genes form the basic unit of zzso such that one zzso can be composed of several genes and one gene may reside in different zzso By comparing our methodology to the original enrichment method using both simulation data and real-world data, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method in finding new pathways from biological zzso 

Our method can benefit the systematic analysis of biological pathways and help to extract more meaningful information from gene expression zzso The zzso has been implemented as an R package zzso and also a zzso version of zzso is zzso
