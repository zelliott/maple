Various problems with the current state-of-the-art techniques for gated zzso have prevented this new treatment zzso from being widely implemented in clinical zzso These problems are caused mainly by applying various external respiratory zzso There might be large uncertainties in zzso the tumor position from external respiratory zzso While tracking implanted zzso markers has sufficient zzso this procedure may not be widely accepted due to the risk of zzso Previously, we have developed a technique to generate gating signals from zzso images without implanted zzso markers using template matching methods zzso et al 2005 zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso zzso et al zzso zzso zzso zzso 52 zzso In this note, our main contribution is to provide a totally different new view of the gating problem by recasting it as a zzso zzso Then, we solve this zzso problem by a well-studied powerful zzso method called a support zzso machine zzso Note that the goal of an automated gating tool is to decide when to turn the beam ON or zzso We treat ON and OFF as the two classes in our zzso zzso We create our labeled training data during the patient setup session by utilizing the reference gating zzso manually determined by a radiation zzso We then zzso these labeled training images and build our zzso prediction zzso During treatment delivery, zzso images are continuously acquired, zzso and sent as an input to the zzso Finally, our zzso model will output the predicted labels as gating zzso We test the proposed technique on five sequences of zzso images from five lung cancer patients against the reference gating signal as ground zzso We compare the performance of the zzso to our previous template matching method zzso et al zzso zzso zzso zzso 52 zzso We find that the zzso is slightly more accurate on average zzso than the template matching method, when delivering the target zzso And the average duty cycle is zzso zzso Given the very limited patient zzso we cannot conclude that the zzso is more accurate and efficient than the template matching zzso However, our preliminary results show that the zzso is a potentially precise and efficient zzso for generating gating signals for zzso This work demonstrates that the gating problem can be considered as a zzso problem and solved zzso
