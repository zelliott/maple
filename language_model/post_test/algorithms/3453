We present an empirical model of the electroencephalogram zzso signal based on the construction of a zzso limit cycle zzso using Ito zzso This zzso where the noise influences actually interact with the zzso is substantially different from the usual definition of measurement zzso Analysis of model data is compared with actual zzso data using both traditional methods and modern techniques from zzso time series zzso The model demonstrates visually displayed patterns and statistics that are similar to actual zzso zzso In addition, the zzso mechanisms underlying the dynamics of the model do not manifest themselves in zzso time series analysis, zzso the situation with real, zzso zzso zzso This modeling exercise suggests that the zzso is zzso described by zzso limit cycle zzso
