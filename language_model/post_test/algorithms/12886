We show that long-range surface zzso zzso are supported in a physically zzso thin film structure, consisting of a low zzso index medium on a metal zzso supported by a high zzso index zzso layer zzso over air, as a suspended zzso For design purposes, an zzso zzso is derived in zzso yielding a zzso equation that ensures symmetry of the zzso fields of the zzso within the metal slab by constraining its thicknesses and that of the zzso zzso from the zzso are in quantitative agreement with transfer zzso calculations for a candidate slab zzso consisting of an zzso zzso zzso figures of merit are compared for the zzso and zzso structures, and it is found that the zzso structure actually improves performance, despite higher zzso The finite difference method is also used to zzso metal stripes providing zzso confinement on the structure, and additional constraints for zzso zzso guiding zzso are zzso These results are promising for sensors that operate with an zzso solution that would otherwise require a low zzso zzso zzso for the zzso
