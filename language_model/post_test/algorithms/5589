zzso arthritis is the only secondary cause of osteoporosis that is considered independent of bone density in the zzso zzso Although input for zzso arthritis in zzso is a zzso zzso zzso one would expect that more severe or active disease would be associated with a greater risk for zzso We reviewed the literature to determine if specific disease parameters or medication use could be used to better characterize fracture risk in individuals with zzso zzso Although many studies document a correlation between various parameters of disease activity or severity and decreased bone density, fewer have associated these variables with fracture zzso We reviewed these studies in detail and concluded that disability measures such as zzso zzso Assessment zzso and functional class do correlate with clinical fractures but not zzso zzso zzso One large study found a strong correlation with duration of disease and fracture risk but additional studies are needed to confirm zzso There was little evidence to correlate other measures of disease such as zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso analogue zzso acute phase zzso use of zzso medications and increased fracture zzso We concluded that zzso calculations may underestimate fracture probability in patients with impaired functional status from zzso arthritis but that this could not be zzso at this zzso At this time, other disease measures cannot be used for fracture zzso However only a few, mostly small studies addressed other disease parameters and further research is zzso Additional questions for future research are zzso
