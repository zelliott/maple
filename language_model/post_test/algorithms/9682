As the needs for various kinds of body surface information are zzso we developed an zzso integrated system that can zzso acquire high-resolution three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso images of the body zzso The proposed system zzso one zzso camera and one color camera with a zzso structured light zzso zzso To eliminate the emotion zzso of the inspector caused by the intensive light projection directly into the eye from the LCD zzso we have developed a gray zzso strategy based on the optimum fringe projection zzso A zzso zzso has been employed to perform the zzso of different types of zzso Then, we have zzso the structured light zzso by the LCD zzso which is based on the zzso idea and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the precise zzso surface can fuse with zzso zzso and color zzso To enhance medical applications, the zzso zzso in the temperature or color image representing the surface area of clinical interest can be located in the corresponding position in the other images through coordinate system zzso System evaluation demonstrated a mapping error between zzso and visual images of three zzso or zzso zzso show that this work is significantly useful in certain disease zzso
