zzso of zzso zzso were found to zzso rapidly in a submerged culture, which caused the decrease in dispersed zzso and the problem of diffusion zzso The effect of different agitation schemes on the growth of zzso was investigated in a zzso zzso At the constant speed of 100 or 300 zzso rapid zzso caused the biomass concentration to drop to zero in 30 zzso which was even worse than achieved under zzso zzso zzso agitation maintained a higher zzso zzso concentration for 48 h and enhanced the biomass concentration to zzso zzso at 120 zzso The operation with a zzso connection disrupted effectively zzso zzso thus increasing the specific growth rate, biomass concentration and maximum productivity to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso h at 88 zzso zzso Moreover, zzso equations and genetic zzso zzso were used for the simulation of biomass growth and zzso of all kinetic zzso The operating strategy developed in this study could be used for the production of highly zzso zzso which could also achieve a high zzso culture in a stirred tank zzso
