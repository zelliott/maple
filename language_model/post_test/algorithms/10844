The availability of zzso location analyses based on zzso zzso zzso data gives a new insight for in zzso analysis of zzso zzso 

We propose a novel zzso discovery framework for precisely identifying zzso regulatory motifs from both positive and negative samples zzso of upstream sequences of both bound and zzso genes by a zzso factor zzso based on the zzso location zzso In this zzso our goal is to find such zzso motifs that best explain the location data in the sense that the motifs precisely discriminate the positive samples from the negative zzso First, in order to discover an initial set of zzso zzso between positive and negative samples, we apply a decision tree learning method which produces a zzso zzso We extract several clusters consisting of similar zzso from the internal zzso of the learned zzso Second, we start with initial zzso constructed from each cluster for representing putative motifs and zzso refine the zzso to improve the discrimination zzso Our zzso experimental results on zzso show that our method successfully identifies the consensus sequences for known zzso in the literature and further presents significant performances for discriminating between positive and negative samples in all the zzso while most other motif detecting methods show very poor performances on the problem of zzso Our learned zzso also improve false negative predictions of zzso zzso
