To present a new method that can simultaneously and efficiently measure zzso and B1 zzso maps using reference region variable flip angle zzso zzso 

Assuming zzso relaxation time in a reference region such as fat is well zzso and the reference region sufficiently covers smoothly varying B1 zzso field zzso B1 zzso maps can be measured from zzso images, conventionally used for zzso zzso zzso images from zzso Dixon acquisitions were used to zzso B1 zzso zzso and the B1 zzso maps were compared with ones using the zzso method zzso in 22 breast zzso patients at zzso Additionally, high spatial resolution zzso images were acquired to show zzso zzso with and without the zzso B1 zzso correction in six zzso 

zzso is able to generate reliable B1 zzso zzso similar to those using the conventional zzso This simultaneous zzso and B1 zzso mapping can also be used to reduce zzso zzso zzso where zzso maps have more uniform zzso tissue zzso and better depiction of zzso zzso of breast zzso 

A new method that can measure both zzso and B1 zzso maps based on Dixon zzso images is zzso offering improved zzso zzso with no scan time zzso
