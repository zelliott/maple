Principal component analysis zzso has been very successful in image zzso Recent research on zzso methods has mainly concentrated on two issues, zzso 1) feature extraction and 2) zzso This paper proposes to deal with these two issues simultaneously by using zzso zzso zzso supplemented with an assembled zzso distance zzso zzso For feature zzso zzso is proposed, which can be used for image feature extraction by reducing the zzso in both column and row zzso For zzso an zzso metric is presented to calculate the distance between two feature zzso and then the nearest neighbor and nearest feature line zzso are used for image zzso The results of the experiments show the efficiency of zzso with zzso metric in image zzso
