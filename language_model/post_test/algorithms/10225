To assess the impact of simulating zzso changes in health-care practice patterns when zzso zzso models to zzso zzso 

A zzso model of cervical cancer was zzso to recent zzso US data on the prevalence of cervical zzso cervical cancer zzso and related zzso The impact of failing to account for zzso changes in screening practices was assessed by comparing results from 1) a conventional zzso that incorrectly assumed that all women had been exposed to current screening practices in the past and 2) an historically accurate zzso that reflected the fact that US women 65 years of age and older had not received currently available screening practices at younger zzso 

The zzso set derived from conventional zzso produced a cervical cancer zzso rate of zzso per 100,000 among women aged 65 years and older, which is equal to the target end zzso However, when this zzso set was used in the model to simulate the effects of historically correct zzso cervical zzso and related mortality in the 65 years and older age group were overestimated by zzso and zzso zzso Finally, when the zzso set was correctly zzso by assuming historical changes in screening in the zzso process, excellent zzso to both zzso and mortality was zzso 

zzso zzso models to zzso data without accounting for zzso changes in clinical practice may result in a zzso set that is not as zzso as it appears and may lead to bias in evaluating the effectiveness of zzso
