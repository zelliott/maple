This study, through a typical aerospace systems architecture, suggests an engineering design of a human cancer cell zzso in which a digital optimal control zzso is assigned to repair the DNA damage level and/or to trigger its zzso Here, the conceived machinery is proposed taking into account the state of the art in cancer zzso However, it could be further zzso The most recent studies on cancer zzso give a zzso role to the zzso protein zzso and its zzso the zzso zzso Experimental and theoretical approaches are in agreement in zzso a zzso response of the zzso when zzso integrity is zzso Once DNA damage is present, the mutual influence of zzso and its zzso the zzso zzso is closed in a feedback zzso In this work, starting from these current results, a novel molecular mechanism is proposed, based on a digital optimal control law, zzso zzso and zzso proteins activities can be represented by appropriate zzso and governed by the optimal control law of digital zzso This procedure zzso a real-time sequence evaluation of protein zzso and an unexpected and relevant acceleration in the DNA repairing when suitable digital control zzso is zzso Those effects suggest interesting perspectives for future scientific zzso First of all, the proposed digital circuitry, receiving the zzso signal from a damaged cell, is able to repair the current level of zzso zzso Moreover, the cell fate is newly conceived and bound by the modified pulsing mechanism of zzso
