A strong generic zzso between zzso zzso and zzso of a zzso zzso chain is demonstrated through zzso zzso calculations and the underlying mechanisms revealed by using an extended Hubbard zzso We show that significant chain zzso and twisting of zzso and zzso result from zzso imbalances among zzso zzso and the zzso instability at zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso effects create sufficient strains to provide an intrinsic zzso zzso mechanism in optical zzso zzso
