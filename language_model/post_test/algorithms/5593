Given the significant impact the use of zzso can have on fracture risk independent of bone density, their use has been incorporated as one of the clinical risk factors for calculating the 10-year fracture risk in the World Health Organization's zzso zzso Assessment zzso zzso Like the other clinical risk factors, the use of zzso is included as a zzso variable with use of steroids defined as past or present exposure of 3 months or more of use of a daily dose of 5 zzso or more of zzso or zzso The purpose of this report is to give clinicians guidance on adjustments which should be made to the 10-year risk based on the dose, duration of use and mode of delivery of zzso zzso A subcommittee of the International Society for Clinical zzso and International zzso Foundation joint zzso Development Conference presented its findings to an expert panel and the following recommendations were zzso 1) There is a dose relationship between zzso use of greater than 3 months and fracture zzso The average dose exposure captured within zzso is likely to be a prednisone dose of zzso zzso or its zzso zzso probability is zzso when prednisone dose is greater than zzso zzso and is zzso when the prednisone dose is less than zzso zzso 2) zzso intermittent use of higher doses of zzso increases fracture zzso Because of the zzso in dose and dosing schedule, zzso of this risk is not zzso 3) High dose zzso zzso may be a risk factor for zzso zzso may underestimate fracture probability in users of high dose zzso zzso 4) zzso zzso replacement in individuals with adrenal zzso has not been found to increase fracture zzso In such patients, use of zzso should not be included in zzso zzso
