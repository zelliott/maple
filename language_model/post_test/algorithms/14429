Pfizer Global zzso Library zzso of zzso readily zzso molecules offers a tremendous opportunity for lead zzso and scaffold hopping in drug discovery zzso However, mining into a chemical space of this size presents a challenge for the zzso design zzso due to the fact that standard molecular similarity searches against a collection of explicit molecules cannot be zzso since no chemical information system could create and manage more than zzso explicit zzso Nevertheless, by accepting a tolerable level of false zzso in search results, we were able to bypass the need for full zzso zzso and enabled the efficient similarity search and retrieval into this huge chemical space for practical usage by medicinal zzso In this report, two search methods zzso and zzso are zzso The first method uses zzso reaction knowledge to zzso the incoming search query zzso into a set of zzso and then uses zzso similarities into actual available starting materials to focus on a much smaller zzso of the full virtual library compound zzso This zzso is then explicitly zzso and searched via a standard similarity method using the original query zzso The second method uses a fuzzy mapping onto candidate reactions and does not require exact zzso of the incoming query zzso Instead zzso Products (or capped zzso are mapped into the query zzso and the zzso zzso similarity scores are used to prioritize the corresponding reactions and zzso zzso All sets of zzso Products are inherently zzso to specific reactions and specific starting zzso This again allows focusing on a much smaller zzso for explicit zzso and subsequent standard zzso similarity zzso A set of validation studies were zzso The results have shown that the level of false zzso for the zzso method is acceptable when the query zzso can be recognized for exact zzso and the fuzzy reaction mapping method based on zzso Products has an even better performance in terms of lower zzso rate because it is not limited by the requirement that the query zzso needs to be recognized by any zzso zzso Both search methods have been implemented and zzso through a powerful zzso molecular design tool (see zzso zzso for zzso The chapter will end with a comparison of published search methods against large virtual chemical zzso
