A software suite, zzso zzso of zzso sites for zzso zzso has been developed for the analysis of atomic zzso in protein structures, using a geometric hashing zzso zzso and Thornton, zzso zzso zzso is used to explore the zzso Data Bank zzso to locate proteins with a specific zzso arrangement of zzso groups to identify active sites that might be redesigned to catalyze new zzso As a zzso test, zzso was used to identify zzso that have the same zzso group arrangement present in zzso zzso zzso zzso Among the zzso scaffolds identified by the zzso search for zzso with the same zzso group arrangement as zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso II zzso both of which have been redesigned to become effective zzso zzso demonstrated by zzso Next, we used zzso to search for naturally existing active sites in the zzso with zzso groups similar to those present in the designed zzso elimination zzso zzso From over 2000 geometric matches to the zzso active site, zzso identified 23 matches that corresponded to zzso from known active zzso The best of these matches, with a zzso zzso zzso atom zzso to zzso was then redesigned to be compatible with the zzso elimination using zzso We also used zzso to search for potential zzso zzso using a zzso predicted to provide a greater rate acceleration than the active site of zzso and used zzso to create a design based on the proteins zzso
