zzso genes of human zzso cells were identified by new simple zzso methods and DNA zzso analysis utilizing in zzso cultures of normal zzso human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A survey of zzso human zzso was performed using zzso DNA zzso zzso were rank ordered by zzso zzso zzso and stringent selection criteria that have general zzso for analyzing a minimum of three zzso zzso Signature zzso genes zzso in one cell zzso and zzso zzso genes zzso in one cell zzso were determined for the three major skin cell zzso Many of the signature genes are known zzso for these cell zzso In addition, 17 signature genes were identified as zzso and 22 zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso was used to verify nine signature zzso zzso A total of 158 zzso of normal human skin cells were identified, many of which may be valuable in diagnostic applications and as molecular targets for drug discovery and therapeutic zzso
