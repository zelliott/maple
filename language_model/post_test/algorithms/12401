Although microscopic diagnosis has been playing the decisive role in cancer zzso there have been cases in which it does not satisfy the clinical zzso zzso diagnosis of zzso and benign zzso zzso is one such case, and supplementary diagnosis such as that by gene expression profile is zzso 

With four zzso tissue types, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and normal zzso we performed gene expression profiling with zzso competitive zzso a zzso zzso zzso For differential diagnosis, we applied a novel zzso zzso introducing zzso zzso zzso zzso were constructed using various combinations of zzso zzso The learning set included 119 samples, and the zzso were evaluated by strict zzso cross zzso Trials included classical combinations, zzso zzso zzso but the predictor using more combination exhibited the better prediction zzso This characteristic was consistent with other gene expression data zzso The performance of the selected predictor was then tested with an independent set consisting of 49 zzso The resulting test prediction accuracy was zzso 

zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso is feasible by gene expression zzso and the current level is promising towards the automatic diagnostic tool to complement the present medical zzso A zzso predictor with an exhaustive combination of zzso zzso could achieve a higher prediction accuracy than those with classical combinations and other zzso such as zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the predictor offer more detailed information for each sample, which enables zzso of each sample in zzso zzso zzso These new concepts should help to improve the zzso zzso including that of cancer zzso
