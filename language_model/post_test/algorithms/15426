Clear cell zzso cell zzso zzso represents the most invasive and common adult kidney zzso zzso evidence suggests that zzso zzso are important regulators of gene zzso But their function in zzso in this zzso type remains zzso With the development of high zzso technologies such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression has been widely observed in zzso zzso and zzso analysis of multiple zzso expression zzso may reveal potential mechanisms by which zzso contribute to zzso zzso 

We collected 5 public zzso expression zzso in zzso versus zzso normal zzso zzso from zzso database and published zzso We analyzed these data sets with an integrated zzso framework to identify expression zzso The framework incorporates a novel statistic method for abnormal gene expression detection and an in-house developed predictor to assess the regulatory activity of zzso We then mapped target genes of zzso to different databases, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso for functional enrichment zzso 

Using this framework we identified a consistent panel of zzso zzso zzso shared by five independent zzso that can distinguish normal kidney zzso from zzso After comparison with 3 zzso based zzso profiling studies, we found that our data correlated well with the results of next generation zzso We also discovered 14 novel molecular pathways that are likely to play a role in the zzso of zzso 

The zzso framework described in this paper greatly improves the zzso consistency of zzso expression zzso Consensus expression profile should be identified at zzso or network level to address the zzso of zzso The zzso signature and novel pathways identified zzso could provide potential zzso for zzso that await further zzso
