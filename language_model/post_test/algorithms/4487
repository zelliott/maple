zzso zzso channels zzso by zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes play important zzso roles and serve as therapeutic targets for neurological and cardiovascular zzso Currently there is no selective zzso zzso To screen for such a blocker, we developed three stable cell lines expressing human zzso zzso zzso or zzso channels and then examined their usefulness in high zzso zzso All three cell lines displayed an increase in zzso zzso in response to changes in zzso zzso as detected with zzso zzso using a zzso imaging plate reader zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The zzso ratio was zzso zzso of zzso with a mouse leak zzso channel, which by virtue of being open at rest zzso the cell zzso blocked the fluorescent zzso zzso of zzso to these cells induced a zzso signal that was similar to that observed in the cell line expressing zzso zzso These results confirm that the detection of zzso zzso increase in cells expressing zzso alone results from zzso entry through channels that are open at the resting membrane potential of each cell line zzso window zzso Testing known drugs on zzso channels showed that block could be reliably detected using the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso clamp recordings using the zzso zzso system zzso zzso These results support the use of the zzso window current zzso for primary drug screening and high zzso patch recordings for secondary screening of novel zzso zzso
