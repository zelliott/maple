zzso zzso zzso provides unique directional diffusion information that can be used to estimate the patterns of white matter connectivity in the human zzso In this study, the behavior of an zzso for white matter zzso is zzso The algorithm, called zzso uses the entire diffusion zzso to deflect the estimated fiber zzso zzso and imaging experiments on in zzso human brains were performed to investigate the behavior of the zzso zzso The simulations show that the zzso term is less sensitive than the major zzso to image zzso In the human brain imaging experiments, estimated tracts were generated in corpus zzso zzso zzso internal zzso zzso zzso superior zzso zzso inferior zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This approach is promising for mapping the organizational patterns of white matter in the human brain as well as mapping the relationship between major fiber zzso and the location and extent of brain zzso
