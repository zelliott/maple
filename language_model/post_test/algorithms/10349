Walking speed is a fundamental zzso of human motion and is increasingly considered as an important indicator of zzso health zzso 

To evaluate the relationship of gait zzso and demographic and physical characteristics in healthy men and zzso 

zzso of a zzso zzso of male and female blood donors taking part in the Cambridge zzso zzso Collection of demographic data, measurement of physical characteristics zzso weight and blood zzso and assessment of zzso zzso activity parameters using zzso and a novel zzso to measure walking zzso Participants were a median zzso zzso age of 49 zzso years; zzso zzso and had a median zzso zzso of 26 zzso 

Walking zzso 

In this study, the hypothesis that walking speed declines with age was generated using an initial zzso zzso This was subsequently validated in a separate zzso zzso that showed a decrease of walking speed of zzso zzso per zzso This is equivalent to a difference of zzso minutes, when walking a distance of 1 zzso aged 20 compared to 60 zzso zzso between walking speed and other participant characteristics zzso zzso zzso and blood zzso were zzso zzso was zzso correlated with the number of walking and running steps and longest zzso zzso 

This is the first study using zzso which shows an association between walking speed and age in zzso healthy zzso Absolute values of gait speed are comparable to published normal ranges in clinical zzso This study highlights the potential use of mobile zzso to assess gait parameters which may be indicative of future health outcomes in healthy zzso
