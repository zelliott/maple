zzso zzso PET uses very fast detectors to improve zzso of events along coincidence zzso This information is then zzso to improve the zzso zzso This work evaluates the effect of zzso upon an zzso performance for detecting and zzso focal warm zzso in noisy PET zzso 

An advanced zzso zzso phantom was scanned 12 times over 3 days on a zzso zzso zzso scanner zzso Medical zzso The phantom was devised to mimic zzso zzso zzso PET imaging, and a number of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were distributed throughout the zzso The data were reconstructed with the baseline zzso zzso zzso algorithm, with the baseline zzso plus point spread function model zzso baseline plus zzso and with both zzso The zzso performance of each reconstruction was compared and ranked using zzso receiver operating characteristics zzso analysis with both human and zzso zzso The phantom results were then zzso compared to 2 illustrative patient scans reconstructed with zzso and with zzso 

zzso of zzso information provides a significant improvement in the area under the zzso curve compared to the baseline zzso without zzso data zzso zzso zzso providing a degree of improvement similar to that obtained with the zzso zzso Use of both zzso together provided a cumulative benefit in zzso performance, significantly outperforming either zzso or zzso alone zzso zzso zzso zzso patient images reflected the same image characteristics that gave rise to improved performance in the phantom zzso 

zzso PET provides a significant improvement in observer performance for detecting focal warm zzso in a noisy zzso These improvements in image quality can be expected to improve performance for the clinical tasks of detecting zzso and staging zzso Further study in a large clinical population is warranted to assess the benefit of zzso for various patient sizes and count levels, and to demonstrate effective performance in the clinical zzso
