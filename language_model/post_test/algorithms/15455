The binding of zzso factors zzso to their specific motifs in zzso regulatory regions is commonly studied in zzso However, in order to zzso the mechanisms of zzso regulation, it is essential to determine which zzso bind DNA zzso as zzso and to zzso the precise nature of these zzso So far, only a small number of such zzso complexes are zzso Here, we present an zzso for predicting zzso zzso zzso on DNA on a large scale, using zzso I hypersensitivity data from 78 human cell zzso We represented the universe of possible zzso complexes by their corresponding motif complexes, and analyzed their occurrence at zzso zzso I hypersensitive zzso Based on zzso billion tests for motif complex enrichment, we predicted zzso highly significant zzso zzso zzso the vast majority of which are zzso Our predictions included zzso zzso of the known zzso complexes and showed significant overlap with an experimental database of zzso zzso They were also independently supported by evolutionary zzso as well as quantitative variation in zzso I zzso zzso zzso the known and predicted zzso zzso were almost always highly compact and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso in close proximity to their partners, which results in strict constraints on the structure of the zzso zzso Overall, our results indicate that zzso openness profiles are highly zzso of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, cooperative zzso zzso seems to be a widespread phenomenon, with multiple zzso complexes predicted in most cell zzso
