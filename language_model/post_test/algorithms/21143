A coherent zzso microscope is proposed as a means to fully characterize the elastic scattering properties of a zzso as a function of zzso Using a high zzso zzso zzso two-dimensional zzso and a simple zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso is estimated from a single zzso zzso A method for zzso efficient data processing is zzso and zzso simulations show that this zzso is robust to noise and uncertainty in the focal plane zzso The proposed method is a zzso of techniques that provide an estimate of a limited set of scattering zzso such as a single orientation angle for zzso zzso The measurement of the zzso zzso the need for a zzso assumptions about the zzso
