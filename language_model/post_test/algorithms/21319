A rational approach to the design of centrally acting agents is zzso based initially upon a comparison of the zzso properties of three typical zzso zzso zzso zzso which do not readily cross the zzso barrier with those of the three zzso drugs zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A good correlation was found between the zzso of the equilibrium zzso concentration ratios in the rat and the partition zzso delta log zzso defined as log P zzso P zzso which suggests that brain penetration might be improved by reducing overall zzso zzso This model has been employed as a guide in the design of novel zzso zzso zzso by the systematic structural modification of representatives of different structural types of zzso zzso Although marked increases in brain penetration amongst zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (10) were zzso no compound was found with an acceptable combination of zzso zzso activity zzso zzso in the guinea pig atrium greater than zzso and brain penetration zzso zzso concentration ratio greater than zzso zzso structural modification of zzso zzso led to several zzso novel compounds which readily cross the zzso zzso One of these, zzso zzso zzso zzso whose zzso zzso is zzso and zzso zzso ratio is zzso has been identified for use in studying zzso zzso zzso mechanisms in zzso zzso of delta log P values with the zzso of the zzso ratios for 20 structurally diverse compounds for which data became available confirms a highly significant correlation and supports the general zzso of this zzso
