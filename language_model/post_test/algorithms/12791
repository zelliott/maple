Rapid zzso of experimental data on zzso complexes drives the paradigm shift in protein zzso from zzso template free approaches to template based zzso zzso zzso zzso based on sequence similarity between target and template complexes can account for up to zzso of known zzso zzso When highly zzso templates for the target complex are not available, but the structure of the target zzso is known, zzso by local structural alignment may provide an adequate zzso Such an zzso was developed based on the structural comparison of zzso to zzso zzso A library of the zzso was generated from zzso zzso complexes in zzso The partial structure alignment zzso was validated on the zzso benchmark zzso The optimal performance of the partial zzso structure alignment was achieved with the interface zzso defined by 12 zzso distance across the zzso Overall, the partial structure alignment yielded more accurate models than the full structure zzso Most templates identified by the partial structure alignment had low sequence identity to the target, which makes them hard to detect by zzso zzso The results indicate that the structure alignment techniques provide a much needed addition to the zzso arsenal, with the combined structure alignment and template free zzso success rate significantly zzso that of the free zzso zzso
