Genes act in concert via specific networks to drive various biological zzso including progression of diseases such as zzso Under different zzso different zzso of the gene members of a network participate in a biological zzso Single gene analyses are less effective in identifying such core gene members zzso within a gene zzso as compared to gene zzso zzso zzso it is useful to identify a zzso zzso by focusing on the zzso that zzso to different zzso Here we present a novel zzso to automatically discover the important zzso of closely interacting molecules to differentiate between two zzso zzso using gene expression zzso We name it zzso zzso zzso zzso It is a zzso zzso and thus unlikely to have local zzso zzso zzso works for any interaction network regardless of the network zzso One added benefit of zzso is that it can also be used as a highly accurate zzso platform which can produce a set of zzso zzso
