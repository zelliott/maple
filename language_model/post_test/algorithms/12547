Spike train distance measures serve two purposes: to measure zzso firing zzso and to provide a metric with which spike trains can be zzso We introduce a novel spike train distance based on the zzso complexity that does not require the choice of arbitrary analysis zzso is easy to zzso and zzso zzso We determine firing reliability in zzso by calculating the zzso of the mean distance of spike trains obtained from multiple presentations of an identical stimulus from a zzso zzso Using both the zzso zzso and a distance zzso on zzso zzso the pattern and timing reliability of zzso firing is determined for spike data obtained along the visual information processing zzso of zzso monkey zzso simple and complex cells of zzso and area zzso In combination with the sequential zzso zzso algorithm, we show that the zzso groups together spike trains with similar but not necessarily synchronized firing zzso For both applications, we show how the zzso gives additional zzso as it adds a new perspective on the problem of firing reliability determination and allows zzso zzso in cases, where other distance measures zzso
