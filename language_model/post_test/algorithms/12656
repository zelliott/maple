Studies reported in the literature indicate that the increase in the breast density is one of the strongest indicators of developing breast zzso In this paper, we present an approach to automatically evaluate the density of a breast by zzso its internal zzso in either fatty or dense zzso Our approach is based on a statistical analysis of each zzso zzso for zzso both tissue zzso zzso we provide connected density clusters taking the spatial information of the breast into zzso With the aim of showing the zzso of our approach, the experiments are performed using two different zzso the well-known zzso Image Analysis Society zzso database and a new zzso digital database of zzso from which we have zzso provided by zzso zzso and qualitative results show that our approach is able to correctly detect dense zzso zzso the tissue type zzso
