Nerve zzso studies continue to be an important tool in the evaluation of peripheral nerve disorders but have come under increased scrutiny because of heightened cost control in health care service zzso In selected clinical settings, automated nerve zzso studies may be a useful clinical tool replacing conventional testing, but existing instruments are limited and have not generally been accepted into clinical zzso Further zzso in nerve zzso automation may be possible by incorporating expert system approaches into nerve zzso measurement and control zzso Using fuzzy logic techniques to duplicate the reasoning strategies of experienced zzso zzso a software controller was developed to automatically perform sensory nerve zzso zzso The fuzzy logic system successfully performed zzso of 97 sensory studies in a mixed group of normal and patient zzso zzso nerve action potential zzso and zzso measures obtained with automated testing were the same as determined by zzso zzso were related to design limitations of the zzso noise, and zzso The high negative zzso value and sensitivity of fuzzy logic based testing suggest that its utility is in minimizing the need for unnecessary conventional zzso studies in patients with normal nerve zzso zzso logic appears to be a useful approach to nerve zzso automation that can model expert reasoning and zzso
