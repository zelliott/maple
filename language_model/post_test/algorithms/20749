Using a path integral technique, we show exactly that for a zzso zzso in constant extension ensemble, no matter how long the zzso and how large the external force, the effects of short-range correlations in the zzso spontaneous zzso and zzso can be incorporated into a model with zzso mean spontaneous zzso and zzso as well as a zzso persistence zzso Moreover, for a long zzso with large mean persistence zzso the zzso persistence lengths can be replaced by their zzso However, for a short zzso or for a zzso with small persistence zzso zzso in persistence lengths tends to make physical zzso very sensitive to details and therefore less zzso
