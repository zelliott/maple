Recently, we introduced a sensor for the detection of local contrast gloss (or zzso of zzso This is a new development step in contrast gloss zzso since contrast gloss has been measured previously from a zzso zzso zzso yet there do not exist statistical parameters for the zzso of the contrast gloss as there exist zzso zzso for the zzso of the surface zzso In this study, we define novel statistical parameters for the diffuse component and contrast gloss obtained by the sensor for the detection of local contrast zzso As an example, we zzso these statistical parameters and measured zzso zzso zzso and contrast gloss maps in the characterization of zzso
