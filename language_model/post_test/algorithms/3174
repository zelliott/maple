zzso is a US national system that uses data from health information systems for automated disease zzso We studied 4 zzso zzso modifications designed to improve sensitivity for detecting artificially added zzso To test these modified zzso we used reports of daily syndrome visits from 308 Department of Defense zzso facilities and 340 hospital emergency departments zzso At a constant alert rate of zzso sensitivity was improved for both zzso by using a minimum standard zzso zzso of zzso a zzso day baseline duration for calculating mean and zzso and an adjustment for total clinic visits as a surrogate zzso zzso baseline days into weekdays versus weekends to account for zzso effects increased sensitivity for the zzso data but not for the zzso zzso These enhanced methods may increase sensitivity without increasing the alert rate and may improve the ability to detect outbreaks by using automated surveillance system zzso
