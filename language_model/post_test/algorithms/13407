Although zzso zzso zzso are widely used to study zzso zzso and cognitive zzso it remains unknown whether they are zzso signals superimposed upon the ongoing electroencephalogram zzso or result from zzso of the zzso Previous attempts to discriminate between these hypotheses have been unsuccessful but here a new test is presented based on the prediction that zzso generated by zzso will be associated with zzso changes in frequency whereas zzso will zzso Using empirical mode decomposition zzso which allows measurement of zzso changes in the zzso without zzso frequency bands, evidence was found for transient frequency slowing in recognition memory zzso but not in simulated data derived from the evoked zzso Furthermore, the timing of zzso was frequency dependent with the earliest alignment occurring at high zzso Based on these findings, the zzso model was developed, which proposes that both evoked and induced power changes derive from zzso zzso of the ongoing zzso zzso data derived from the zzso model provided a close match with empirical data and the model was able to account for zzso the shape and timing of zzso at different scalp sites, zzso the zzso zzso in alpha and synchronization in zzso and zzso changes in the power density spectrum from the zzso baseline to the zzso zzso The zzso Model, therefore, provides not only a unifying account of zzso changes in the zzso but also a possible mechanism for zzso information zzso
