In Energy zzso zzso zzso zzso the estimate of momentum transfer zzso on which the zzso intensity zzso should be as accurate as zzso Since zzso in turn, depends on both the energy and the scattering angle, an error on the latter due to an incorrect positioning of the sample, to the zzso angular spread induced by the zzso zzso or, in general, to any uncertainty on the geometric setup, results in an uncertainty on the zzso zzso Here, a new self zzso method to correct such zzso based on a genetic zzso is zzso It is zzso fast and completely zzso zzso obtained by carrying out Energy zzso zzso zzso zzso on reference samples are reported and zzso They show how the application of such genetic zzso may provide a fast esteem of the two parameters required when multiple angle pattern collection is performed, namely the effective starting angle and the angular zzso In this way, reliable zzso of all the zzso pattern features zzso zzso for zzso and diffused bumps for zzso zzso are zzso
