We present a model of human zzso texture zzso This model consists of three zzso zzso zzso of the image with a bank of zzso linear filters followed by zzso zzso to give a set of responses modeling zzso of zzso simple cells, zzso zzso localized in space, within and among the zzso profiles that results in the suppression of weak responses when there are strong responses at the same or nearby locations, and zzso zzso detection by using wide zzso zzso Our model can predict the zzso of texture boundaries in any arbitrary zzso zzso A computer zzso of this model has been tested on many of the classic stimuli from zzso zzso zzso predictions of the degree of zzso of different texture pairs match well with experimental zzso of zzso in human zzso
