This paper proposes an agricultural environment monitoring server system for monitoring information concerning an outdoors agricultural production environment utilizing Wireless Sensor Network zzso zzso The proposed agricultural environment monitoring server system collects environmental and soil information on the outdoors through zzso environmental and soil sensors, collects image information through zzso and collects location information using zzso zzso This collected information is converted into a database through the agricultural environment monitoring server consisting of a sensor manager, which manages information collected from the zzso sensors, an image information manager, which manages image information collected from zzso and a zzso manager, which processes location information of the agricultural environment monitoring server system, and provides it to zzso In addition, a solar zzso power supply is implemented for the server system so that it could be used in agricultural environments with insufficient power zzso This agricultural environment monitoring server system could even monitor the environmental information on the outdoors zzso and it could be expected that the use of such a system could contribute to increasing crop yields and improving quality in the agricultural field by supporting the decision making of crop producers through analysis of the collected zzso
