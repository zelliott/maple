This paper proposes an zzso gain fuzzy sliding mode control zzso scheme for the synchronization of two zzso chaotic zzso in the presence of model uncertainties and external zzso In the zzso zzso the hitting controller that drives the system to the sliding surface is constructed by a set of fuzzy zzso In the proposed method, the gain of the reaching controller is zzso adjusted to provide zzso against bounded uncertainties and external zzso The zzso scheme can provide zzso in the absence of any knowledge about the bounds of uncertainties and external zzso We show that the zzso gain scheme used in zzso improves the performance in comparison with the same control methodology that uses a fixed zzso zzso analysis of the zzso scheme based on zzso stability theory is zzso zzso simulation on the application of the proposed method for the synchronization of two chaotic zzso is provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the zzso
