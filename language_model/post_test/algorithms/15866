zzso learning zzso models and zzso maps zzso are two classes of zzso models that have both been proposed to explain the zzso formation of cortical zzso Both models differ significantly in the way lateral cortical interactions are treated, leading to different predictions for the formation of receptive zzso The linear zzso models predict that receptive field profiles are determined by the average values and the spatial correlations of the second order of the zzso activity patterns, whereas zzso models map stimulus zzso Here, we investigate a class of models which are characterized by a variable degree of lateral competition and which have the zzso and zzso models as limit zzso We show that there exists a critical value for zzso competition below which the model exhibits zzso properties and above which feature mapping sets zzso The class of models is then analyzed with respect to the formation of zzso maps between two layers of zzso For zzso input stimuli we find that localized receptive fields and zzso maps emerge above the critical value for zzso competition, and we calculate this value as a function of the size of the input stimuli and the range of the lateral interaction zzso Additionally, we show that the learning rule can be derived via the zzso of a global cost function in a framework of zzso output zzso which represent a set of input stimuli by a sparse zzso
