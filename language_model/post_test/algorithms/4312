To evaluate the performance of zzso versus zzso zzso spin echo imaging in the zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso images were acquired in 25 patients as part of a clinically indicated breast magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso tissue signal ratio was measured in 16 identified zzso zzso of zzso zzso was assessed through a blinded review by three zzso zzso demonstrating the potential diagnostic contribution of zzso versus zzso zzso imaging in the breast were noted through zzso review by a fourth zzso 

The zzso tissue signal ratio was well correlated between zzso and zzso zzso images zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was significantly better with zzso zzso imaging for all observers based on a zzso test zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating the potential diagnostic contribution of zzso zzso imaging included improved depiction of signal intensity and improved alignment between zzso and zzso zzso 

In this pilot study, zzso zzso imaging provided comparable contrast and improved depiction of zzso zzso in the breast in comparison to zzso zzso zzso Based on these results further investigation to determine the diagnostic impact of zzso zzso imaging in breast zzso is zzso
