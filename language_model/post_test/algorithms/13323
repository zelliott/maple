We have presented dynamic phase transition features and zzso behavior of a zzso small zzso system with a zzso zzso By means of detailed zzso Carlo simulations, a complete picture of the phase zzso and zzso profiles has been presented and the conditions for the occurrence of a compensation point zzso in the system have been zzso According to zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the particle have been found to obey zzso zzso and zzso zzso schemes under certain zzso Much effort has been devoted to investigating the zzso response of the zzso and we observed the existence of triple zzso loop behavior, which originates from the existence of a weak zzso core zzso zzso as well as a strong zzso interface exchange interaction zzso Most of the calculations have been performed for a particle in the presence of zzso fields of very high zzso and high zzso in comparison with exchange zzso which resembles a magnetic system under the influence of zzso switching zzso zzso attention has also been paid to the influence of the particle size on the zzso and magnetic properties, as well as magnetic features such as zzso zzso and the compensation temperature of the zzso We have found that, in the presence of zzso switching fields, the particle may exhibit a dynamic phase transition from zzso to a zzso ordered phase with increasing zzso shell zzso
