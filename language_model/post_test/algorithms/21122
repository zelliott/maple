zzso zzso provides a rational design strategy for the development of controlled release drug delivery zzso We demonstrate that zzso a zzso network results in zzso memory for the template zzso indicated by the two or more times greater zzso into these networks as compared to zzso zzso zzso of drug into networks zzso from multiple functional zzso was 8 times greater than networks zzso from single zzso zzso zzso studies showed that the gel with maximum incorporated chemical functionality had the lowest diffusion zzso which was one to two orders of magnitude lower than all other gels zzso All imprinted networks had significantly lower diffusion zzso than zzso networks, in spite of comparable mesh sizes and equilibrium zzso volume zzso in the swollen state, which to our knowledge, is the first time that such a study has been conducted in the zzso We propose the zzso zzso wherein a zzso tumbling through an imprinted network with zzso organized zzso and an appropriate mesh size, experiences heightened interactions with memory sites and shows delayed transport zzso Thus, the structural plasticity of zzso zzso zzso the organization of functional groups into memory sites, may be responsible for enhanced loading and extended zzso
