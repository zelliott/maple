In electron zzso of biological zzso zzso markers are normally used to achieve accurate alignment of the input zzso We address the problem of alignment of projections from objects that are freely supported and do not permit the use of zzso To this end we present a new alignment zzso for zzso tilt geometry based on the principle of zzso common zzso An zzso scheme has been developed to overcome the zzso of the zzso zzso This zzso was used to align a data set that was not amenable to alignment with zzso zzso
