Animal zzso factors drive complex spatial and zzso patterns of gene expression during development by binding to a wide array of zzso zzso While the in zzso DNA binding landscape and in zzso DNA binding affinities of many such proteins have been zzso our understanding of the forces that determine where, when, and the extent to which these zzso factors bind DNA in cells remains zzso In this chapter, we describe zzso zzso models that predict the zzso DNA binding landscape of zzso factors in zzso and evaluate the contribution of zzso zzso such as zzso interactions and zzso accessibility, on DNA zzso We show that predictions based only on DNA sequence and in zzso DNA affinity data achieve a mild correlation zzso with experimental zzso of in zzso DNA zzso However, by incorporating direct zzso of DNA accessibility in zzso it is possible to obtain much higher accuracy zzso for various zzso factors across known target zzso Thus, a combination of experimental DNA accessibility data and zzso modeling of zzso factor DNA binding may be sufficient to predict the binding landscape of any animal zzso factor with reasonable zzso
