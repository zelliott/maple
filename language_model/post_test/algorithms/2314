The fundamental objectives of zzso joint zzso include the determination of its zzso and of its zzso as a function of given control parameters like knee zzso or applied muscle zzso On the one hand, zzso tracking provides quantitative information about the zzso stability under given loading conditions, whereas zzso force analyses can typically indicate pathological stress zzso associated for instance with abnormal zzso The determination of this information becomes especially relevant when facing the problem of evaluating surgical procedures in terms of standard zzso zzso knee zzso Classical examples of such procedures include total knee replacement zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Following this perspective, the current study was oriented toward an accurate and reliable determination of the human zzso zzso during passive knee zzso To this end, a comprehensive three-dimensional computer model, based on the finite element method, was developed for analyzing zzso zzso Unlike previously published studies on zzso zzso this model simultaneously zzso the zzso zzso associated zzso and zzso forces, zzso contact pressures and stresses occurring in the joint during its zzso The components zzso the joint zzso bone, cartilage, zzso were modeled using objective forms of zzso elastic materials zzso A unilateral contact law allowing for large slip between the zzso and the zzso was implemented using an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for two knee specimens were close to equivalent experimental ones zzso zzso below zzso degrees for the zzso and below zzso zzso for the zzso and provided validation of the model on a zzso by zzso zzso The ratio between the zzso pulling force and the zzso zzso force was less than unity throughout the considered knee zzso range zzso zzso with a minimum near 90 degrees of zzso for both zzso The contact patterns evolved from the zzso part of the zzso zzso surface to the zzso pole during progressive zzso The lateral facet bore more pressure than the zzso one, with corresponding higher stresses zzso in the lateral compartment of the zzso The forces acting on the zzso were part of the problem zzso thus leading to more realistic zzso for the stress analysis, which was especially important when considering the wide range of variations of the contact pressure acting on the zzso during knee zzso
