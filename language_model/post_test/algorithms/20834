More cases of zzso zzso have been reported in recent years, and these patients are more prone to secondary zzso However, the frequency of secondary zzso in zzso zzso still has not been defined clearly in the zzso 

The current study population was comprised of 69 patients with zzso zzso and 16 healthy zzso zzso examination was done to identify zzso cell types and to categorize zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were collected for direct zzso examination, culture, zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso zzso detection using a zzso zzso sandwich zzso zzso and blood samples were collected for zzso zzso by double zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and dot zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value, and negative zzso value were analyzed for various zzso zzso Twenty-five patients had follow-up data available for an analysis of clinical and diagnostic zzso 

The cohort included patients with zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso small cell zzso zzso zzso zzso large cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso type zzso zzso 1), and patients were zzso with zzso invasive pulmonary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso probable zzso zzso zzso 17), possible zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Most patients were in the group ages 45 years to zzso years, and there was a preponderance of men zzso zzso from 20 of 69 patients zzso revealed the growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected in 26 of 69 patients zzso each by DID and zzso whereas zzso were detected in 28 of 69 patients zzso by zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso from 25 of 69 patients zzso whereas zzso DNA was detected in 32 of 69 patients zzso by zzso The sensitivity of zzso and zzso tests zzso zzso and zzso was zzso for zzso zzso whereas the sensitivity of zzso was comparatively higher than that of zzso tests for probable zzso possible zzso and zzso 

The current study indicated that there frequently is an association between zzso zzso and secondary zzso and zzso zzso and probable zzso are common clinical problems in patients with zzso cell lung zzso
