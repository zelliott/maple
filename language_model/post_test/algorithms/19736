To investigate whether human zzso zzso zzso gene has protective action on zzso cultured in zzso and to explore whether zzso of zzso gene to donor zzso could enhance zzso zzso survival and suppress local zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso isolated rat zzso were isolated from the zzso rats and were divided into 3 groups in zzso study as zzso enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso group, zzso zzso with zzso zzso containing zzso gene using zzso of infection zzso zzso 2, 5, 10, and 20 to determine the zzso zzso zzso group, zzso zzso with zzso zzso containing human zzso gene using zzso zzso 20; and control group, mock zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to detect zzso cells after induction by zzso human tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso zzso for 48 zzso zzso recipients were randomly divided into the following groups: zzso group zzso zzso zzso receiving zzso zzso with zzso zzso control group zzso zzso zzso receiving mock zzso zzso and zzso buffer solution (PBS) group zzso zzso zzso receiving only zzso zzso zzso About 1200 rat zzso zzso were transplanted into each recipient rendered by zzso using the portal vein as transplant zzso zzso survival, zzso and the state of zzso zzso were zzso 

After treatment with zzso and zzso the zzso ratio of zzso cells was zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso significantly lower than zzso zzso zzso in the control group zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso 20; P zzso zzso Maintenance of zzso was prolonged in the zzso group, indicated by results that zzso survival time was zzso zzso zzso days significantly longer than that of zzso zzso which was zzso zzso zzso days zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso degree in zzso zzso treated with zzso gene was lower than that in the control zzso 

zzso gene zzso in rat zzso by zzso zzso can protect cultured zzso against zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene has zzso effects on zzso zzso which could prolong zzso zzso survival in zzso transplantation model, and diminish the degree of zzso zzso in zzso zzso These findings suggest a potential therapeutic application for zzso gene in improving zzso zzso in human zzso zzso
