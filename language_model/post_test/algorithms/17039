For the zzso zzso activity recorded during zzso a feature extraction scheme has been zzso It recognizes the time, zzso and zzso of local zzso for each zzso zzso The method is based on the zzso approximation for modeling zzso as a sum of zzso shaped zzso with different time delays and zzso zzso conditions on the pulse properties are set and an optimal solution is zzso The method is completely automated and can be zzso for characterization and zzso zzso
