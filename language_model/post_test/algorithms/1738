We present a novel method for zzso measurement of the zzso diffusion by using digital holographic zzso based on wavelength and angular zzso zzso Two laser beams with different zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are used for the zzso diffusion zzso and they are adjusted to make corresponding interference fringes in zzso directions on the zzso zzso The zzso splitting of the fringes enables the spatial zzso of each wavelength to be filtered separately in the zzso spectrum of the zzso Finally, they are reconstructed to obtain the zzso zzso This method is also suitable for zzso diffusion zzso
