zzso representations have greater zzso in noise environment and also have greater flexibility in matching structure in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso proposed an efficient extended natural zzso for learning the zzso basis and developed an zzso representation zzso However, they derived their zzso by many zzso and their proof is very zzso To give a stronger theoretical basis, we provide a brief and more rigorous mathematical proof for this zzso in this zzso In addition, we propose a more robust constrained zzso zzso
