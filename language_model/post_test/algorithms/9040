The resolution of density maps from single particle analysis is usually measured in terms of the highest spatial frequency to which consistent information has been zzso This calculation represents an average over the entire reconstructed zzso In practice, however, substantial local variations in resolution may occur, either from intrinsic properties of the zzso or for technical reasons such as a zzso distribution of viewing zzso To address this issue, we propose the use of a zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso to assess the quality of a density map, zzso zzso by local resolution zzso In this approach, the experimental volume is divided into small zzso and the resolution determined for each of zzso It is illustrated in applications both to model data and to experimental density zzso zzso with zzso resolution may be mobile components or ones with incomplete occupancy or result from multiple zzso zzso To improve the zzso of zzso we propose an zzso filtering approach that zzso the resolution to which individual features are calculated with the results of the local resolution zzso
