In this paper we study and analyze the behavior of different zzso spaces for the zzso and building of zzso zzso zzso spaces based on fingerprint zzso structural similarity using maximum common zzso zzso and all maximum common zzso zzso approaches are compared against zzso spaces based on structural fragments and zzso fragments zzso built using different molecular zzso zzso for extraction of zzso zzso and zzso are described and support zzso machine is used for the zzso of a zzso corresponding with 74 compounds of zzso zzso zzso zzso are tested in order to build zzso models for the prediction of the zzso activity of the zzso zzso based on the consideration of graph connectivity and distances are the most appropriate for building zzso zzso Moreover, models based on approximate similarity improve the statistical of the equations thanks to combining structural zzso zzso fragments and zzso approaches for the creation of more robust and finer prediction zzso
