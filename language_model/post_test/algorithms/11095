It has been zzso that physical activity is a risk factor for developing zzso lateral sclerosis zzso zzso by observations that professional soccer players and Gulf War veterans are at increased zzso In a population based study, we determined the relation between physical activity and risk of sporadic zzso using an objective approach for assessing physical zzso 

636 sporadic ALS patients and zzso controls, both population based, completed a zzso questionnaire on lifetime history of zzso sports and zzso To zzso compare the energy cost of a lifetime history of occupational and leisure time physical activities and to reduce recall bias, zzso equivalent scores were assigned to each activity based on the zzso of Physical zzso 

ALS patients had significantly higher levels of leisure time physical activity compared with controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso No significant difference was found between patients and controls in the level of vigorous physical activities, including zzso and zzso or in occupational zzso zzso measures of physical activity in zzso did not show a zzso zzso 

An increased risk of ALS with higher levels of leisure time physical activity was found in the present zzso The lack of association with occupational physical activity and the absence of a zzso relationship strengthen the hypothesis that not increased physical activity per zzso but rather a genetic profile or lifestyle promoting physical fitness increases ALS zzso
