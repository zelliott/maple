Contemporary zzso modeling techniques allow applications of modeling methods to vast biological zzso However, they tend to fail to provide accurate structures for zzso local regions in sequence even when the overall structure can be modeled zzso We call these regions unreliable local regions zzso zzso modeling of zzso is of enormous value because they are frequently involved in functional zzso In this article, we introduce a new method for modeling zzso in zzso models by employing a sophisticated loop modeling zzso Combined with our previous study on protein zzso the method is zzso to refinement of both loop and zzso zzso A large-scale test carried out in a blind fashion in zzso (the 9th Critical Assessment of techniques for protein structure zzso shows that zzso structures are improved over initial zzso models by refinement in more than zzso of the successfully detected zzso It is also notable that successful modeling of several long zzso over 12 zzso is zzso Overall, the current results show that a careful application of loop and zzso modeling can be a promising tool for model refinement in zzso zzso
