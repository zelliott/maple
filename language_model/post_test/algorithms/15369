When the zzso method due to zzso is used to balance treatment groups across zzso factors, a problem arises at the time of zzso the zzso Since zzso is essentially a deterministic method, any statistical test based on the assumption of complete zzso should not be used in the zzso Previous articles have shown that analysis of zzso zzso produces valid zzso 

In this article, these results are extended to trials with more than one zzso factor and more than two zzso An alternative design to zzso which makes use of optimum design theory is also considered, with two choices of biased zzso zzso is used to study the effect on the power and the coverage probabilities of the usual tests and confidence intervals when these different allocation methods are zzso The results are then illustrated using data from an actual clinical zzso 

zzso shows that when zzso is used, it is sometimes more powerful with these designs than with zzso and produces slightly conservative confidence intervals for the treatment mean zzso The increase in power and zzso is more pronounced when there are more zzso zzso The possibility of zzso interactions is also zzso 

zzso are only given when treatment responses are normally zzso 

Under the simulated situations considered, when a zzso design is used, the use of zzso yields a test which preserves the nominal significance level as compared to the zzso of analysis of zzso
