This research effort aims in the application of soft computing techniques toward water resources zzso More specifically, the target is the development of reliable soft computing models capable of zzso the water supply for the case of zzso mountainous zzso in zzso Initially, zzso Support zzso Machines zzso and fuzzy weighted zzso models have been developed that accept five input zzso At the same time, reliable artificial neural networks have been developed to perform the same zzso The zzso cross validation approach has been employed in order to eliminate bad local behaviors and to produce a more representative training data zzso Thus, the fuzzy weighted Support zzso zzso zzso combined with the fuzzy partition has been employed in an effort to enhance the quality of the zzso Several rational and reliable models have been produced that can enhance the efficiency of water policy zzso
