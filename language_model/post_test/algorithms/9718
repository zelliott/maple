The goal of the study presented in this paper is to develop an embedded biomedical system capable of delivering maximum performance on demand, while maintaining the optimal energy efficiency whenever zzso Several hardware and software solutions are presented allowing the system to intelligently change the power supply zzso and frequency in zzso The resulting system allows use of more energy-efficient zzso operates most of the time in its most zzso mode, and provides means to quickly change the operation mode while maintaining reliable zzso While all of these techniques extend battery life, the main benefit is on-demand availability of zzso performance using a system that is not zzso zzso applications, perhaps more than any other application, require battery operation, favor zzso battery zzso and can benefit from increased performance under certain conditions zzso when anomaly is zzso that makes them ideal candidates for this zzso In addition, if the system is a part of a body area network, it needs to be light, zzso and adaptable enough to satisfy changing requirements of the other zzso in the zzso
