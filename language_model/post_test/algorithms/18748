The statistical methods applied to the analysis of zzso data do not account for uncertainty in the sequence zzso Indeed, the alignment is treated as an zzso and all of the subsequent zzso depend on the alignment being zzso This may not have been too problematic for many zzso studies, in which the gene is carefully chosen for, among other things, ease of zzso However, in a comparative zzso study, the same statistical methods are applied repeatedly on thousands of zzso many of which will be difficult to zzso Using zzso data from seven zzso species, we show that uncertainty in the alignment can lead to several problems, including different alignment methods resulting in different zzso
