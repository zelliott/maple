This paper investigates new methods for measuring forces and tactile sense as a contribution towards relaying the sense of touch to the zzso The approach used is to determine a distribution of contact force using a small number of sensory zzso to detect the zzso of a surface of known zzso Software zzso have been produced to interpret the zzso force from sensory data, and have achieved a bandwidth of 30 zzso and an accuracy of 2 per zzso The sensor construction is of sufficiently low cost to produce a zzso unit and uses materials that are compatible with the invasive working zzso
