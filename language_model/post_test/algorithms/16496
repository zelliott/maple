zzso dysfunction zzso is a marker of increased cardiovascular zzso risk and may indicate the need for aggressive evaluation for cardiovascular disease zzso In younger men with zzso the zzso risk assessment has inadequate zzso There is a need to develop a more sensitive zzso protocol for this zzso We sought to develop an zzso for the evaluation and management of the zzso zzso A search of literature published from 1998 to 2009 was zzso Search terms included the zzso zzso zzso and zzso dysfunction combined with coronary artery disease zzso zzso syndrome, or cardiac zzso zzso revealed 107 zzso These studies were evaluated with use of levels of evidence for the Centers of zzso zzso On the basis of these studies, recommendations for the evaluation and management of the patient with zzso were zzso zzso nontraditional markers and procedures may identify zzso patients at risk for subsequent CVS events earlier or more easily than traditional risk zzso Clear practice guidelines for risk zzso are being developed, and data are sufficient to propose an zzso for these zzso The presence of zzso should prompt assessment of cardiac risk and aggressive risk factor zzso Available risk assessment factors should initially be used to zzso each zzso zzso patients younger than 60 years of age and with no clinical zzso are at risk of zzso events zzso and should undergo further risk zzso Additional tests of zzso damage and zzso may aid in refinement of risk for future cardiac zzso Patients with zzso can be classified into zzso zzso and high-risk zzso A proposed zzso can be used to direct the assessment of zzso risk in patients with zzso
