zzso imaging, especially zzso zzso imaging, has been extensively applied in in zzso zzso biological zzso zzso zzso zzso has the potential to provide more accurate imaging information due to its zzso reconstruction compared with its zzso zzso 

In this work, we introduce a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strategy to validate the BLT zzso X-ray zzso zzso zzso zzso resolved zzso imaging, and surgical zzso were performed on a tumor zzso mouse model expressing a zzso reporter zzso 

With different zzso resolved measured data, the BLT reconstructions were acquired based on the zzso simplified zzso zzso zzso approximation and the diffusion approximation zzso The corresponding zzso images were obtained for validation of zzso source zzso 

Our results show the strength of PET imaging compared with other validation methods for BLT and improved source zzso accuracy based on the zzso approximation compared with the diffusion zzso
