To evaluate zzso photographic image analysis combining automated detection of red zzso bright zzso and image quality as a means of identifying zzso diabetic zzso in a screening population of diabetic zzso 

This was a retrospective zzso study of 106 patients from a diabetic zzso screening clinic referred for zzso treatment in the period from January 1996 to May 2002 on the basis of zzso zzso zzso color transparency zzso zzso One zzso zzso photograph and one centered zzso of the zzso disk from each of a zzso two eyes was selected for zzso and analyzed using a previously tested computerized zzso detection zzso in combination with a new zzso for detection of bright zzso and image zzso The zzso was zzso on an independent set of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso detection identified 104 of 106 patients requiring zzso treatment, whereas zzso detection identified only 91 of the 106 zzso Two patients who were not identified by either zzso detection zzso were automatically detected as having poor image quality in one or both zzso In the study sample, the risk of missing zzso zzso patients from being detected was zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The combination of automated detection of red zzso and poor image quality identified all zzso diabetic zzso patients in the study zzso No additional information was contributed by the automated zzso zzso
