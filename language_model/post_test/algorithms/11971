The response of zzso zzso zzso sensors implanted in zzso to zzso blood zzso zzso is zzso Models describe both zzso and zzso zzso sensors in zzso homogeneous medium simulating some mass transfer properties of zzso zzso ratios and delays are reported as a function of frequency for the zzso zzso and the effects on continuous blood zzso monitoring are illustrated using data from the zzso Certain zzso sensor designs may produce common signals for different zzso zzso a characteristic not found in zzso zzso The dynamic response depends on the frequency of zzso zzso and is sensitive to sensor type, zzso activity, and zzso zzso
