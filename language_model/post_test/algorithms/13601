Pulmonary zzso zzso is associated with fluid zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso have been used to detect fluid overload prior to zzso However, studies have reported a high false positive rate zzso The objective of this study was to develop and test a new zzso zzso zzso that reliably tracks zzso clinical zzso 

We enrolled patients with implanted zzso in 23 US centers within 2 weeks of device zzso zzso zzso data was collected automatically by the zzso every 30 zzso during emergency department zzso and every 2 h at all other zzso zzso zzso for cardiac zzso therapy zzso zzso and zzso cardiac zzso zzso devices were developed using those zzso zzso that would be available in corresponding devices and zzso zzso 

There were 75 patients zzso % zzso mean age zzso years, with a zzso of zzso % and zzso of zzso zzso zzso major clinical events occurred over zzso months of follow-up zzso zzso zzso combinations resulted in a sensitivity of zzso % (95 % confidence zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso false zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso combinations resulted in a sensitivity of zzso % zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso zzso In comparison, the zzso zzso zzso of this zzso resulted in a sensitivity of zzso % zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

This zzso zzso zzso was effective in tracking zzso clinical events in this patient zzso Additional studies are needed to zzso evaluate the performance of this zzso in a larger zzso
