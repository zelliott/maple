zzso electron zzso has been used for structural and physical characterization of zzso inclusions of lead and noble gases in zzso When the inclusion sizes approach zzso dimensions, many of their properties are seen to zzso from similar properties in bulk and in most cases the zzso will increase as the inclusion sizes zzso zzso zzso of lead and noble gases with aluminum are characterized by extremely low mutual zzso and inclusions will, therefore, exist as practically pure components embedded in the aluminum zzso Furthermore, the zzso vacancy mobility in aluminum at and above room temperature is sufficiently high to accommodate volume strains associated with the inclusions thus leading to virtually strain free zzso The inclusions grow in parallel cube alignment with the aluminum zzso and have a zzso shape, which reflects directly the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in grain boundaries can have single zzso or zzso zzso that can be explained from a generalized zzso analysis such as the zzso zzso The inclusions have been found to display a variety of zzso features such as high zzso pressure, zzso zzso during melting, zzso from the zzso shape displaying magic size effects, a shape dependence of edge energy, and so zzso All these effects have been observed and monitored by zzso using conventional imaging conditions and high-resolution conditions in combination with zzso analysis at elevated zzso
