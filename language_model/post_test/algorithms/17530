The functional zzso zzso zzso disorder, and bipolar illness represent complex clinical syndromes that are characterized by zzso zzso Yet evidence from numerous studies suggests that zzso the prevalence of schizophrenia and bipolar illness is with zzso very similar across zzso and zzso a strong genetic component is involved in the zzso zzso Using data from different zzso zzso zzso families with a total of 17 unaffected and 170 affected zzso zzso 276 marker zzso we searched for zzso zzso zzso zzso for which the zzso genetic similarity in affected zzso pairs deviated from the expected zzso Specifically, we addressed the question of the extent to which genetic risk factors and their interactions constitute zzso inheritance of functional zzso across populations and might constitute universal targets for zzso Our novel zzso zzso search strategy was based on a genetic similarity function that allowed us to zzso the zzso genetic distances zzso zzso between the zzso zzso patterns zzso zzso of any two subjects zzso zzso with respect to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leader zzso Thus, we were able to assess the zzso the zzso and the zzso genetic zzso The problem of zzso vulnerability was addressed by treating the zzso families as zzso samples, while the zzso families served as independent zzso zzso We evaluated the zzso similarities, which were expected to zzso from zzso in affected zzso pairs if the region of interest contained markers close to vulnerability zzso The reference value zzso was derived from the zzso similarities that are always zzso irrespective of the affection status of parents and zzso We found 12 vulnerability zzso on zzso 1, 4, 5, 6, 13, 14, 18, and 20, that were zzso across the two samples under comparison and therefore, likely to constitute an zzso zzso vulnerability model of functional zzso The elevated vulnerability appeared to be unspecific and to act in such a way that zzso factors become more likely to trigger the onset of psychiatric zzso
