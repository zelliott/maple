zzso of correct zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso base pairs is here considered to control zzso zzso into DNA via low zzso concentration zzso controlled zzso Contributions of base pairing to formation of Gibbs free energies in water solution, zzso are calculated for the correct and false base pairs with the zzso zzso method for base pairing energies in vacuum and the zzso method for zzso zzso The results for zzso indicate equal zzso rates for correct base pairing and a zzso error probability for false zzso controlled by the zzso false zzso
