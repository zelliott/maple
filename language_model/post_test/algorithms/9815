We present an improved analysis of reflection interference contrast zzso zzso images, recorded to investigate model membrane systems that mimic cell zzso The model systems were giant zzso zzso zzso adhering via specific zzso interactions to supported zzso zzso zzso or to patterns of zzso Conventional zzso and zzso zzso zzso were applied to measure absolute optical distances between the zzso and zzso zzso We developed zzso for a straightforward zzso of an zzso zzso reconstruction of the membrane zzso from zzso images, taking into account all the zzso in the system and blurring of the data due to camera zzso Finally, we demonstrate the zzso and usefulness of this new approach by analyzing the topography and fluctuations of a bound membrane in the steady state and its dynamic adaptation to zzso pressure zzso These zzso clearly show that zzso membrane flow through tightly zzso area is possible in our zzso
