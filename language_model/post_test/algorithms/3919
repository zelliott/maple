To derive and validate a clinical rule that zzso the risk of cardiac complications in patients hospitalized for zzso pneumonia zzso and compare its performance to the pneumonia severity index zzso zzso 

Two zzso of patients hospitalized for zzso were selected for the zzso We used zzso techniques in the derivation cohort zzso patients enrolled in the zzso Patient Outcomes Research Team study between October 1991 and March 1994) to generate a prediction rule that we validated in the validation cohort zzso patients enrolled in the zzso of zzso for zzso of Stay study between February 1998 and March zzso Discrimination and zzso analyses compared its performance against the zzso zzso 

A prediction model for cardiac complications in the derivation cohort included age, 3 zzso conditions, 2 vital signs, and 7 common laboratory or zzso zzso Discrimination zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso test, zzso zzso were zzso We derived a point score system from this model that when applied to the validation cohort also had good discrimination zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso On the basis of this score, we defined 4 categories of incremental risk of cardiac zzso The zzso of cardiac complications across risk categories increased zzso (from lowest to zzso in both the derivation zzso zzso zzso and zzso and validation zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso linear trend test, zzso The new score outperformed the zzso score in predicting cardiac complications in the validation cohort zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso proportion of patients correctly reclassified by the new score, zzso 

We derived and validated a clinical rule that accurately zzso the risk of cardiac complications in patients hospitalized for zzso
