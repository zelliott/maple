We investigate heart rate zzso zzso in the very zzso zzso range zzso zzso during deep sleep in good zzso zzso analysis of zzso during deep sleep reveals consistent zzso at zzso zzso By using zzso analysis, we find both stationary and zzso periodic patterns in the zzso range, the presence of which has been discussed but has not been fully established to zzso Although the zzso behind the unique zzso zzso remain to be fully zzso we conjecture that there is an zzso rhythmic component in human zzso in the zzso zzso Further, our results also suggest a need for caution in the interpretation of the zzso spectral power in zzso during deep zzso
