Patients with stage II zzso cell lung cancer who are not suitable for or refuse surgery are treated with zzso but the results reported so far are not zzso To improve the prognosis of such patients, we have used zzso zzso In this paper, we zzso analyzed results of the zzso 

Between 1988 and 1993, 67 patients were treated with zzso zzso with zzso zzso twice daily to a total dose of zzso zzso All patients were technically zzso but 43 had medical problems and 24 refused zzso The median age and zzso performance status score was 60 and 90 years, zzso No patient received chemotherapy or zzso The median follow-up period was 61 zzso 

The median survival time and the zzso survival rate were 27 months and zzso zzso error, SE, zzso zzso The zzso local control rate was zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso factors revealed that a higher zzso performance status score, weight loss of zzso or zzso before treatment, and zzso stage were associated with better zzso and peripheral location was of borderline significance zzso zzso zzso There were two zzso and two zzso acute grade 3 zzso and one zzso and two zzso late grade 3 zzso No grade 4 or 5 toxicity was zzso 

These results are encouraging and further studies on the use of zzso seem to be warranted for stage II zzso cell lung zzso
