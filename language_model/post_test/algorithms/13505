zzso an eye movement towards a suddenly appearing visual target is faster when an accessory auditory stimulus occurs in close zzso zzso Such zzso of zzso reaction time zzso is zzso but the exact neural mechanisms underlying the zzso effect remain to be zzso From zzso studies it has been hypothesized that coupled zzso activity in primary sensory zzso regulates zzso zzso Specifically, it is assumed that the phase of an ongoing neural zzso is shifted due to the occurrence of a sensory stimulus so that, across trials, phase values become highly consistent zzso zzso If one can identify the phase an zzso is reset to, it is possible to predict when zzso windows of high and low zzso will zzso However, in behavioral experiments the zzso phase will be different on successive repetitions of the experimental trial, and average performance over many trials will show no signs of the zzso Here we circumvent this problem by repeatedly presenting an auditory accessory stimulus followed by a visual target stimulus with a zzso delay varied in steps of 2 zzso Performing a discrete time series analysis on zzso as a function of the zzso we provide statistical evidence for the existence of distinct peak spectral components in the power zzso These zzso although varying across participants, fall within the beta and gamma range (20 to 40 zzso of neural zzso activity observed in zzso studies of zzso zzso Some evidence for zzso activity was found as zzso Our results are consistent with the phase reset hypothesis and demonstrate that it is amenable to testing by purely zzso zzso Thus, any theory of zzso processes that connects specific brain states with patterns of zzso responses should be able to account for traces of zzso activity in zzso zzso
