We present a novel zzso for the registration of zzso image sequences that combines the principles of zzso zzso elastic registration and those of zzso consistent zzso In our method, consecutive zzso of images are zzso registered to gradually extend the information through the set of images of the entire zzso The intermediate results are zzso for the registration of the following zzso We choose to zzso the images and model the deformation fields using zzso zzso zzso Novel boundary conditions are introduced to better characterize the zzso at the zzso In the experimental section, we zzso show that our method recovers from zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso Moreover, it is more robust against zzso strong noise and large zzso the state-of-the-art zzso Finally, we show that our method can be used to zzso series of zzso serial zzso which are often heavily distorted due to folding and tearing of the zzso
