In this paper, we zzso study how the zzso zzso zzso from zzso noise zzso affects the spike zzso and synchronization of 60 coupled zzso zzso zzso driven by a periodic zzso stimulus on random complex zzso It is found that the effect of the zzso depends on the network randomness p (the fraction of random zzso for larger p zzso the zzso zzso keeps being improved with increasing zzso while, for smaller p zzso zzso the zzso zzso can reach the best performance at an optimal intermediate zzso value, indicating the occurrence of zzso spike zzso The synchronization becomes enhanced with decreasing zzso and the enhancing extent for a random zzso zzso network is stronger than for a regular zzso These behaviors show that the spike zzso and synchronization of the present zzso zzso on random networks can be more strongly enhanced by various other types of external noise than by zzso noise, zzso the zzso zzso may behave more periodically in time and more zzso in zzso Our results provide the constructive roles of the zzso on the zzso activity of the present system of zzso zzso zzso
