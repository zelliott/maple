This study examined the effects of different sample sizes and different levels of bias zzso zzso between zzso zzso on the accuracy of estimates of random error calculated using two common zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso simulations were used to generate clinically realistic zzso involving random errors with a known zzso For each zzso two sets of zzso zzso were generated to provide the zzso data necessary for the zzso of the random zzso zzso and the zzso formula were applied to these paired data sets and the resulting estimates of error compared with the zzso zzso Nine different sample sizes zzso zzso 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 50, and zzso and two different types of bias zzso and zzso were examined for their effect on the estimated zzso In each case, the estimates of the random error were based on the distribution of zzso separate zzso The results indicate that with a sample of less than zzso zzso zzso the resulting estimates of error are potentially unreliable and may under or overestimate the true error, irrespective of the formula used in the zzso Where, however, a bias exists between the replicate zzso zzso formula can be expected to overestimate the true value of the random error even where the biases are small and difficult to detect by standard statistical zzso No such zzso effect was found for the zzso formula, which provided estimates of error that were not zzso different from the true value even where relatively large biases existed between the zzso These results suggest the zzso zzso A sample of at least zzso cases should be zzso to provide an estimate of the random zzso zzso Where the original study contains fewer than 20 cases, the estimate of error will be zzso In these circumstances, it would be helpful if a confidence zzso for the true error was also zzso zzso Unless one can be absolutely sure that no bias exists between the replicate zzso zzso formula should be avoided and the zzso formula used zzso
