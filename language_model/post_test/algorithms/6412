Nuclear magnetic resonance zzso provides detailed insights into the zzso features of unfolded and partially folded zzso In the case of zzso special attention should be devoted to the characterization of the properties of the metal binding sites, and specific approaches need to be developed depending on the nature of the metal zzso and its coordination zzso At the same time, zzso zzso parameters may help in getting a better picture of the average structural properties of the zzso A critical evaluation of the limits of zzso of zzso effects for solution structure determination in partially folded or unfolded proteins is zzso The zzso between zzso characterization of structure and dynamic of the zzso chain and of the metal environment provides insights into the stabilizing role of metal zzso in zzso The overall approach is illustrated for some case examples of increasing flexibility obtained far from native conditions for zzso c and zzso zzso two zzso that have been extensively studied in our lab and whose zzso forms may be relevant for important biological zzso
