The aim of the present work is to zzso evaluate the signal to noise ratio zzso and the delivered dose in zzso digital zzso imaging zzso using two types of zzso zzso a zzso zzso source (available at zzso radiation facilities and considered as gold zzso and a zzso compact zzso The energy separation zzso between the two zzso beams is 1 zzso and 4 zzso for the two sources, zzso The evaluation has been performed for both zzso and zzso zzso Different zzso have been studied to mimic clinical zzso In zzso a pathology zzso by a contrast agent has been zzso in zzso a vessel superimposed to a zzso or a zzso artery zzso has been zzso The zzso and the skin dose have been calculated as a function of the detail diameter, the contrast agent zzso and zzso and its concentration in the zzso zzso show that for zzso zzso 4 zzso a slightly higher delivered dose is required to obtain the same zzso with respect to zzso zzso 1 zzso A similar study has been performed for zzso Computer simulations of CT images performed with zzso software are shown to validate the zzso zzso
