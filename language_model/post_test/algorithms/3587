The focus of this study is to validate whether the sensitivity of dose distribution following the interface of different media can be used to distinguish between small variations of zzso energy zzso in the context of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Laboratories, zzso zzso zzso were performed in homogeneous water and zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated, in which the weights of the zzso zzso and zzso components were adjusted zzso The zzso correction factor zzso the zzso ratio for homogeneous water and zzso zzso in buildup region zzso were assessed for their relative ability to discriminate between different zzso for various field zzso In accordance with another study zzso et al zzso the superior discrimination ability of the zzso and zzso tests over the zzso test was observed for changes in an energy component as small as zzso of the total weight in the energy zzso Furthermore, new tests utilizing zzso dose profile data for discriminating between zzso Fringe Index zzso and zzso Index zzso were zzso The discrimination ability of the zzso and zzso tests was superior when a medium containing interface effects was exploited to obtain the zzso profile data zzso phantom for zzso and zzso zzso as opposed to when a homogeneous water medium was used zzso and zzso zzso
