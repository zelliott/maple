Biological Mass zzso is used to zzso peptides and zzso A mass spectrum generates a list of measured mass to charge ratios and zzso of zzso zzso which is called a zzso In order to zzso the underlying zzso acid zzso the acquired zzso are usually compared with synthetic zzso Development of suitable methods of direct zzso comparison may be advantageous for many zzso 

The zzso zzso comparison is a zzso process composed of matching of zzso embedded in two zzso zzso zzso of peak zzso and zzso zzso In our analysis, we focused on zzso and intensity based zzso We have modified the measures in order to comprise the mass zzso specific properties of mass measurement accuracy and zzso zzso We compared the zzso of zzso pairs, obtained using different factors of the zzso zzso comparison, as being the same or different to those determined by sequence database zzso In order to zzso how these factors influence the zzso comparison we adopted an analysis of zzso type method with the partial area under the zzso curve as a dependent zzso 

The analysis of zzso provides insight into the relevance of various factors influencing the outcome of the zzso zzso zzso For large zzso and zzso data sets the outcome of zzso analysis was consistent, providing a strong indication that the results presented here might be valid for many various types of zzso mass zzso
