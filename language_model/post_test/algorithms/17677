zzso of zzso can be grown on zzso zzso zzso so that their spike and burst activity can be zzso These activity patterns are quite sensitive to changes in the environment, such as chemical exposure, and hence the cultures can be used as zzso One key issue in analyzing the data from zzso networks is how to zzso the level of synchronization among different units, which represent different zzso in the zzso In this paper, we propose a synchronization zzso based on the statistical distribution of zzso correlation zzso We show that this synchronization metric changes significantly when the networks are exposed to zzso strychnine, or zzso zzso For that reason, this metric can be used to characterize zzso induced changes in a network, either for research or for zzso zzso
