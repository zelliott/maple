The use of dried and zzso biomass of the zzso zzso zzso was investigated as an alternative and zzso zzso for removal of zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso of this zzso identified zzso groups on the zzso as potentially responsible for zzso zzso and confirmed the zzso zzso The combined effects on zzso performance of equilibrium pH and metal zzso were investigated in an ideal zzso system and in more real-life zzso zzso There were either with one metal zzso or zzso and sodium zzso as representative of high zzso strength systems, or with the two metals zzso and zzso For the zzso solutions, the optimum was at pH 3, where a significant proportion of zzso was removed zzso zzso while there was zzso zzso zzso of zzso The data obtained from the more real-life zzso systems showed that zzso of one metal was improved both by the presence of the other metal and by high zzso strength, suggesting a synergistic effect on zzso rather than zzso There data zzso used for the development of a simple zzso equilibrium model based on the zzso zzso approach, which was successfully fitted to experimental data and represents a useful support tool for the prediction of zzso performance in such real-life zzso Overall, the results suggest that biomass of zzso zzso can be used as an efficient zzso for removal of zzso and zzso from zzso zzso This process thus offers an zzso solution for the zzso of the waste material of leaves that accumulate on the beach due to both human activities and to storms at zzso
