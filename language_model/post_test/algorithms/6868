In summer 1997 and winter 1998, paired boundary air and surface water samples were collected during cruises in the southern Baltic zzso zzso deposition samples were taken at zzso Island, located close to the zzso sampling zzso Water samples taken shortly after the flooding of zzso and zzso Rivers in summer 1997 were also included in the zzso zzso and gas exchange zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso composition of zzso were zzso According to zzso calculations, the zzso were close to zzso zzso zzso The net zzso varied over time, particularly during zzso zzso of the air to sea removal routes zzso gas zzso and zzso zzso were about equal for zzso while the scavenging via zzso was less important for zzso zzso zzso were used to estimate the fraction of zzso in the boundary air layer that had zzso from the zzso During summer, the fraction was approximately zzso and zzso significantly less zzso Variations in air mass origin were clearly reflected in net zzso gas exchange and zzso and zzso zzso in boundary zzso The composition of boundary air and zzso was also variable depending on zzso
