The spinal zzso has been shown to correlate with surgical zzso zzso the absence of motor responses to noxious zzso during zzso zzso Here, the authors established individual zzso functions for zzso zzso and tested the zzso power of the zzso for movement responses during zzso zzso in comparison to zzso zzso In addition, they investigated the effect of noxious stimulation on the zzso zzso 

The authors studied 12 female patients during zzso zzso before zzso The zzso concentration was increased, a zzso mask was zzso and then the zzso concentration was decreased until zzso zzso zzso over the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso concentration was kept at a constant value close to the minimum zzso concentration for suppression of movement responses after zzso stimulation zzso determined by the Dixon zzso zzso zzso modeling of zzso zzso and of the zzso Index was performed, and zzso values for motor responses to noxious electrical stimulation zzso zzso 60 zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared using the prediction zzso 

zzso depression of zzso zzso by zzso was well modeled zzso zzso zzso zzso by a zzso function with a median zzso of zzso zzso and a median slope zzso of zzso much steeper than the slope for the zzso zzso zzso calculated by zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso predicted motor responses to noxious stimulation with a prediction probability of zzso whereas the prediction probability for zzso Index and spectral edge frequency zzso were not different from chance zzso zzso stimulation was followed by a substantial increase of zzso zzso for several minutes, whereas the zzso Index and zzso exhibited no significant zzso 

zzso of movement to noxious stimulation and suppression of zzso zzso by zzso follow similar zzso zzso Although this does not imply a zzso zzso it explains the high zzso value of zzso zzso for motor responses to noxious zzso even in a narrow concentration range around the zzso
