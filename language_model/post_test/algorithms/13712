zzso We explore the roles of zzso in zzso zzso models using a method that allows the explicit linking of zzso model zzso behavior to zzso values for zzso zzso zzso shifts, and time zzso The procedure can be used to identify not only the zzso values most critical to supporting a zzso activity pattern of interest but also the relationships between parameters which may be required, zzso limited ranges of relative zzso zzso The method is the repeated use of zzso search to find hundreds or even thousands of different sets of model zzso values that allow a zzso model to produce a desired behavior, such as zzso zzso to within a desired zzso zzso frequency match to within 10 zzso zzso or other analysis may then be performed to reveal the shape and boundaries of the zzso solution regions that support the desired zzso zzso The shape of these zzso regions can reveal zzso values and relationships essential to the zzso For instance, zzso display may reveal zzso between zzso zzso values, or a much wider range of variation in some zzso zzso values than in zzso zzso We demonstrate the use of these techniques with simple, representative zzso models, primarily that of Connor et zzso for zzso walking leg zzso but also some extensions of the results are explored using the more complex model of McCormick and zzso for zzso relay zzso Both models are single zzso zzso studied include zzso zzso the time delay to first action potential in response to current steps, and the timing of action potential zzso in response to both zzso current injection and the injection of currents derived from in zzso records of zzso zzso zzso zzso Using these simple models, we find that relatively general behaviors such as zzso zzso zzso may be supported by very zzso but bounded zzso solution regions, with the shape of the solution regions revealing the relative importance of the zzso zzso of a model in creating the zzso Furthermore, we find that a focus on increasingly specific behaviors, such as zzso behavior, defined by zzso of only a few zzso combined with strict requirements for action potential zzso inevitably leads to increasingly narrow, and eventually zzso narrow, regions of acceptable zzso zzso zzso We use the Connor et zzso model to reproduce the in zzso action potential timing responses of a rat brain stem zzso to various zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
