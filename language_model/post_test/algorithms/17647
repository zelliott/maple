Patient motion and image distortion induced by zzso currents cause artifacts in maps of diffusion parameters zzso from zzso zzso zzso A novel and comprehensive approach to correct for spatial zzso of zzso imaging zzso volumes acquired with different strengths and zzso of the diffusion zzso zzso is zzso This approach uses a mutual zzso registration technique and a spatial transformation model containing parameters that correct for zzso zzso image distortion and rigid body motion in three zzso All parameters are zzso simultaneously for an accurate and fast solution to the registration zzso The images can also be registered to a zzso template with a single zzso step without additional zzso zzso Following zzso the signal zzso of each zzso volume is corrected to account for size variations of the object produced by the distortion zzso and the zzso are properly zzso to account for any rotation applied during zzso Both qualitative and quantitative results show that this approach produces a significant improvement of diffusion zzso imaging zzso data acquired in the human zzso
