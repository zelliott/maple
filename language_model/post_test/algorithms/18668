When a cortical zzso is repeatedly injected with the same fluctuating current stimulus zzso zzso the timing of the spikes is highly precise from trial to trial and the spike pattern appears to be zzso We show here that the same repeated stimulus can produce more than one reliable zzso pattern of zzso A new method is introduced to find these patterns in raw zzso data and is tested on surrogate data zzso Using it, multiple zzso spike patterns were discovered in zzso cells recorded from rat prefrontal zzso in zzso in data obtained in zzso from the middle zzso area of the monkey zzso et zzso 1998) and from the cat lateral zzso nucleus zzso and Reid, zzso The spike patterns lasted from a few tens of milliseconds in zzso to several seconds in zzso We conclude that the zzso history of a zzso may influence the precise timing of the spikes in response to a stimulus over a wide range of time zzso
