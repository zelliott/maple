Industrial applications of zzso technology are rapidly zzso zzso control of zzso production zzso however, is difficult, zzso to the uncertainties typical of biological reactions and to the lack of suitable zzso We demonstrate that well-trained zzso zzso neural networks with one hidden layer can be employed to overcome such problems with no need for a zzso knowledge of the relationships of the process variables zzso zzso network programs were written in Microsoft Visual zzso for Windows and implemented in a personal zzso The goodness of fit of the trained neural network to the reference data was determined by the zzso of determination zzso zzso state zzso and zzso ahead prediction of zzso activity and biomass zzso both in a zzso zzso and zzso zzso production could be zzso carried zzso zzso showed an excellent fit for estimated zzso activity zzso zzso zzso and biomass concentration zzso zzso zzso In zzso production, both zzso activity and biomass concentration could also be reliably predicted for 2 time intervals (10 zzso ahead with only zzso measurable zzso values as the input zzso
