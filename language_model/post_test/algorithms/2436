zzso are among the most promising building blocks for zzso zzso offering various desirable zzso Whereas these particles can be zzso with remarkable precision, comparatively less is known about their zzso zzso zzso a novel, powerful simulation method, we demonstrate that charged zzso offer considerable control over the assembly of zzso zzso zzso these findings to zzso confined to a zzso zzso we show that regular structures can be achieved even without zzso
