Recently, a zzso zzso flow model that incorporates separate zzso tissue and flow to both a zzso and an zzso zzso layer zzso was shown to better describe the observations on zzso zzso zzso in the rat small zzso than a traditional zzso zzso These theoretical models were expanded, as the zzso zzso flow model and the zzso traditional model, to view the zzso as three segments of equal lengths receiving equal flows to accommodate zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The influence of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso functions on drug zzso zzso zzso and zzso formation after intravenous and oral dosing was examined for the zzso when the tissue was the only organ of zzso zzso were performed for zzso conditions, when drug zzso readily zzso zzso or less readily zzso zzso into zzso zzso and for different gastrointestinal transit zzso The zzso clearance was found to be zzso related to the rate constant for zzso of a drug that was subjected to zzso and was positively correlated with the zzso and zzso intrinsic zzso F was positively correlated with the zzso rate constant but was zzso related to the zzso and zzso intrinsic zzso The gastrointestinal transit time decreased zzso formation, increased zzso and decreased zzso The simulations further showed that a descending zzso intrinsic clearance yielded a lower F and an ascending zzso distribution of zzso intrinsic clearance yielded a higher zzso
