We propose an zzso strategy for improving the efficiency of zzso Carlo searches for the low-energy states of zzso Our strategy is motivated by a model of how proteins alter their zzso In our model, when proteins fold under zzso conditions, their backbone zzso angles change zzso in groups of four or more to avoid zzso clashes and respect the zzso conservation zzso They zzso they do not zzso We describe a simple zzso that can be used to incorporate wriggling in zzso Carlo simulations of protein zzso We have tested this wriggling zzso against a code in which the zzso angles are varied independently zzso Our standard of success is the average zzso distance zzso between the zzso of the folding protein and those of its native zzso After 100,000 zzso Carlo zzso the relative decrease in the mean zzso as one switches from thrashing to zzso rises from zzso for the protein zzso with zzso zzso acids zzso to zzso for the protein zzso with 313 zzso and zzso for the protein zzso with 415 zzso These results suggest that wriggling is useful and that its utility increases with the size of the zzso One may implement wriggling on a parallel computer or a computer zzso
