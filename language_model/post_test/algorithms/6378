In current practice, only one out of three components of the tissue displacement zzso and one of nine components of the strain zzso are accurately estimated and zzso in ultrasound zzso zzso only the zzso component of both the displacement and strain are zzso other important elastic zzso such as zzso strains and the zzso ratio, also are not zzso Moreover, reconstruction of the Young's zzso would be significantly improved if all components of the strain zzso were zzso In this paper, we describe a new method for zzso all the components of the tissue displacement zzso following a zzso zzso The method uses zzso estimated from zzso zzso along multiple ultrasound beam zzso zzso At each spatial location in the compressed zzso zzso tissue zzso in both the zzso and lateral direction with respect to the direction of the applied zzso are estimated by curve fitting angular displacement zzso data calculated for all zzso zzso Following displacement zzso in zzso directions, components of the corresponding normal and zzso strain zzso are zzso zzso and experimental results demonstrate the utility of this technique for the zzso of the normal and zzso strain zzso
