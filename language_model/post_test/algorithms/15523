We propose a new technique for analyzing the raw zzso which enables the study of the discharge behavior of individual and group zzso It zzso an ideal zzso zzso a modified zzso zzso zzso an action potential zzso and a zzso zzso We validated our approach with both simulated data generated from muscle sympathetic zzso sampled at high rates in five healthy subjects and data recorded from seven healthy subjects during lower body negative pressure zzso The modified zzso method was superior to the classical zzso method and the regular zzso zzso procedure when applied to simulated zzso zzso The detected spike rate and spike zzso rate of the action zzso correlated strongly with number of bursts detected in the integrated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, p zzso zzso Eight major action potential zzso classes were found to describe more than zzso of all detected action zzso in all zzso One class had characteristics similar in shape and in average discharge frequency zzso zzso zzso zzso during resting zzso zzso to those of reported single zzso zzso The newly proposed technique allows a precise estimate of sympathetic nerve activity and characterization of individual action zzso in zzso zzso
