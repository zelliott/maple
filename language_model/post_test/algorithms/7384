zzso surfaces provide a useful mean for analyzing interactions between zzso such as identification and characterization of zzso binding sites to a host zzso We present a novel technique, which extracts potential binding sites, represented by zzso and characterize them by zzso zzso and by zzso zzso The binding sites are extracted using an implicit function sampling and graph zzso We propose an advanced cavity exploration technique based on the graph parameters and associated zzso zzso Additionally, we zzso zzso the zzso in the context of the molecular zzso We apply our method to the analysis of MD simulations of zzso 3, where we verify the previously described cavities and suggest a new potential cavity to be zzso
