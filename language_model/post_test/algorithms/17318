We examine the efficacy of a scheme of zzso assessment of zzso linking remote sensing on larger spatial scales with localized field zzso A zzso of ecological entities from zzso to individual organisms in the form of a zzso hierarchy is zzso such that entities at any level are differentiated in terms of their zzso involving entities at the next lower zzso We employ the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and individual organisms zzso zzso Focusing on a case study of West zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from India, we demonstrate that remotely sensed data permit discrimination of 205 patches of 11 types of sufficiently distinctive zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso by using distribution parameters of the zzso zzso zzso Index, with a zzso size of zzso zzso zzso zzso At the zzso scale, Indian zzso zzso zzso satellite data with a zzso size of zzso zzso permit discrimination of approximately 30 types of sufficiently distinctive zzso on the basis of supervised zzso Field investigations of zzso species zzso based on zzso of zzso zzso in one particular landscape of zzso zzso zzso zzso show that the seven zzso types distinguished in that locality are significantly different from each other in terms of plant species zzso This suggests that we can effectively link localized field investigations of zzso with remotely sensed information to permit extrapolations at progressively higher zzso
