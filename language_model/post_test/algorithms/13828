The objective of this paper is to compare the diagnostic efficacy of 3 zzso zzso MR zzso zzso at zzso and zzso in diagnosis of zzso zzso Thirty-one patients, including 26 patients with zzso confirmed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso underwent zzso at zzso and zzso zzso Images were interpreted by six trained observers who were blinded to zzso Twelve projections of zzso of the circle of Willis, by zzso projection algorithm, were reviewed using continuous zzso zzso It was found that zzso at zzso T was more sensitive than that at zzso T in detection of zzso The sensitivity of six observers ranged between 50 and zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso and between 61 and 86 zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso In the smaller zzso less than 5 zzso the differences between the units became zzso The sensitivity for small zzso ranged from 23 to zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso and from 31 to zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso Our conclusion was that high field strength zzso higher accuracy in the detection of zzso zzso with zzso with zzso MR zzso
