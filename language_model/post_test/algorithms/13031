This study aimed to identify and validate a gene expression signature for zzso cell zzso of the lung zzso 

A published zzso zzso from 129 zzso patients was used as a training set to identify the minimal gene set zzso zzso This was selected using the zzso R Square Algorithm zzso a novel zzso signature zzso procedure based on zzso (R zzso The signature was tested internally by zzso zzso and then zzso in three independent public lung cancer zzso zzso two zzso of zzso cell lung cancer zzso and one of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to validate the signature in a fourth independent zzso zzso 

A zzso signature that passed the internal zzso validation was zzso The signature was independently zzso for zzso in two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not in zzso The lack of zzso significance in zzso was confirmed in the Director's Challenge zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso significance of the signature was validated further by zzso in another independent cohort containing 62 zzso samples zzso ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

We identified a novel zzso zzso signature specific for zzso and showed the effectiveness of zzso to identify zzso gene expression zzso
