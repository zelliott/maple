zzso (or zzso zzso plays a key role in many machine learning zzso such as kernel methods, zzso learning, and dimension zzso However, the cost of storing and manipulating the complete kernel zzso makes it zzso for large zzso The zzso method is a popular zzso zzso approximation scheme for reducing the zzso burdens in handling large kernel zzso In this paper, we analyze how the zzso quality of the zzso method depends on the choice of landmark points, and in particular the zzso powers of the landmark points in zzso the zzso Our zzso error analysis justifies a zzso zzso zzso that uses the zzso zzso centers as landmark zzso Our zzso can be applied to scale up a wide variety of zzso that depend on the zzso decomposition of kernel zzso (or its zzso such as kernel principal component analysis, zzso zzso spectral zzso as well as those involving kernel zzso inverse such as zzso support zzso machine and zzso process zzso zzso experiments demonstrate the competitive performance of our zzso in both accuracy and zzso
