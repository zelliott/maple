We propose representing individual positions in DNA sequences by virtual zzso generated by other bases of the same zzso This is a compact representation of the zzso of a zzso The distribution of the virtual zzso over the whole sequence can be used as a representation of the entire sequence zzso zzso It is a flexible code, with a length independent of the sequence size, does not require previous zzso and is convenient for processing by neural networks or statistical zzso 

To evaluate its biological significance, the zzso code was used for training zzso zzso maps zzso in two zzso zzso detection of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of sequences zzso for zzso envelope zzso zzso into zzso zzso It was demonstrated that zzso clustered sequences belonging to different classes into distinct zzso For independent test sets, very high rates of correct predictions were obtained zzso in the first application, zzso in the zzso zzso areas of application of zzso codes include functional zzso zzso analysis, detection of zzso database zzso and automatic zzso 

Software for representing sequences by zzso code, and for training zzso zzso is made freely available from zzso 

zzso material is available at zzso
