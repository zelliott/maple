Due to zzso variety of customers with different navigational patterns and demands, zzso zzso network is a natural performance model for zzso The open zzso zzso zzso models are based on the assumption that no service center is saturated as a result of the combined loads of all the zzso Several formulas are used to calculate performance measures, including zzso residence time, queue zzso response time and the average number of zzso The solution technique of closed zzso zzso models is an approximate mean value analysis zzso zzso based on three key zzso because the exact zzso needs huge time and space zzso As mixed zzso zzso models, include some open and some closed classes, the open classes should be eliminated to create a closed zzso zzso so that the closed model zzso can be zzso Some corresponding examples are given to show how to apply the zzso mentioned in this zzso These examples indicate that zzso zzso is a reasonably accurate model of zzso and can be solved zzso
