The efficiency of four fast simulated zzso zzso for zzso zzso radiation therapy treatment plans was studied and the resulting plans were compared with each other and to zzso conventional zzso 

Four zzso were selected on the basis of their reported successes in solving other zzso problems: fast simulated zzso with a zzso generating function, fast simulated zzso with a zzso generating function, variable step size generalized simulated zzso zzso and very fast simulated zzso zzso They were tested on six clinical cases using a multiple beam zzso zzso treatment zzso Relative beam weights were zzso that zzso the minimum tumor dose subject to zzso constraints on normal organ zzso Following some initial tuning of the zzso zzso each zzso was applied zzso to each test zzso zzso tests were run using different random number sequences and different numbers of zzso 

The zzso zzso consistently produced the best zzso Using long run times, it generated plans with the highest minimum tumor dose in five of the six zzso For the short run times, the zzso solutions averaged larger minimum tumor doses than those of the other zzso for all six patients, with increases ranging from zzso to zzso zzso For three of the patients, the zzso plan gave a clinically significant increase in the minimum tumor dose over the conventional plan, ranging from zzso to zzso zzso In two other cases, there was little difference between the two treatment zzso For one case, the zzso conventional plan was much better than the zzso plan because the conventional beam arrangement included zzso which offset the multiple beam advantage of the zzso zzso 

For equal computing times of both long and short zzso the zzso zzso consistently produced zzso plans that were superior to those produced by the other zzso The simple zzso technique used in this study showed a significant potential advantage in the treatment of abdominal zzso In three of the cases, the zzso plans showed clinically important increases in tumor dose over zzso conventional zzso
