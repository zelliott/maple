In this paper, an enhanced multiple signal zzso zzso zzso is introduced to retrieve small three-dimensional elastic zzso First, the zzso response zzso zzso is built by two different ways depending on considering the multiple scattering effect or zzso The zzso structure of the zzso zzso is analyzed to identify the zzso case of zzso Second, the zzso function is built with an optimal test direction on each zzso where a balancing technique is employed to ensure the zzso zzso zzso from this MUSIC zzso the zzso inclusions can be located with a good performance against zzso zzso simulations show the proposed method has wider zzso better resolution, and more robust in the presence of noise than the standard MUSIC zzso
