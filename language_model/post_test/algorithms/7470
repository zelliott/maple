Conventional statistical shape models use Principal zzso Analysis zzso to describe shape zzso However, such a zzso model assumes a zzso distribution of zzso A model with Independent zzso Analysis zzso does not require the zzso assumption and can additionally describe the local shape zzso In this paper, we propose a zzso zzso Local Model zzso using zzso The first or coarse level of zzso locates the full landmark set, while the second level zzso a relevant landmark zzso We then apply the zzso to Down syndrome detection from photographs of young pediatric zzso Down syndrome is the most common zzso condition and its early detection is zzso After locating facial anatomical landmarks using zzso geometric and local texture features are extracted and zzso A variety of zzso are evaluated to identify Down syndrome from a healthy zzso The best performance achieved zzso accuracy using support zzso machine with zzso basis function zzso The results show that the zzso zzso outperformed both zzso zzso and zzso zzso
