We present a new fluid simulation technique that significantly reduces the zzso dissipation of zzso The proposed method is based on an apt use of particles and zzso zzso We note that a major source of zzso dissipation in the conventional zzso equations solver lies in the zzso zzso zzso starting with the conventional zzso simulator, when the details of fluid movements need to be zzso we replace the zzso part with a particle zzso When swapping between the zzso and zzso zzso the physical quantities such as the level set and zzso must be zzso For this purpose, we develop a novel zzso conversion procedure that zzso the zzso information stored in the zzso as well as in the grid zzso For the fluid regions where such details are not needed, the zzso is simulated using an zzso constrained zzso profile zzso zzso which we develop in this zzso Through several experiments, we show that the proposed technique can reproduce the detailed movements of zzso zzso such as zzso thin water zzso and zzso The increased accuracy in the zzso which forms the basis of the proposed technique, can also be used to produce better results in larger scale fluid zzso
