zzso zzso a structural protein required for the formation of zzso membrane zzso known as zzso has been implicated in cholesterol trafficking and zzso Here we investigated the contribution of zzso to zzso zzso zzso cell surface binding and zzso processing using mouse embryonic zzso zzso derived from wild type zzso or zzso zzso zzso We found that cells expressing zzso have zzso more zzso binding sites than zzso cells although these additional binding sites are not associated with zzso zzso zzso Further, zzso binding targets zzso for zzso and degradation and these processes are not correlated to cholesterol zzso Despite lower zzso zzso cholesterol zzso from zzso zzso is zzso higher than from zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression with an zzso zzso enhances cholesterol zzso from both zzso and zzso cells without increasing zzso surface binding or affecting zzso zzso Our results indicate that there are at least two independent zzso binding sites for zzso zzso zzso surface binding and zzso is not linked to cholesterol zzso indicating that membrane zzso other than zzso regulate zzso cholesterol zzso
