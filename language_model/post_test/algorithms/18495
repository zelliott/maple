In the present study, an artificial neural network was trained with the Stuttgart zzso Networks zzso in order to identify zzso species by analyzing their zzso zzso An earlier study described the combination of zzso gas zzso and atomic zzso detection we used on whole cell zzso zzso sulfur and nitrogen were detected in the zzso zzso zzso patterns were obtained from 52 zzso strains belonging to 5 close zzso These data were previously analyzed by zzso distances calculation followed by zzso Pair Group zzso of zzso a zzso zzso With this early method, strains from 3 of the 5 species zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were correctly characterized even if the 29 strains of zzso zzso were grouped into 2 zzso zzso from the 2 remaining species zzso zzso and zzso zzso cannot be zzso To build an artificial neural network, able to discriminate the 5 previous species, the zzso data of 42 selected strains were used as learning set and the 10 remaining strains as testing zzso The chosen learning zzso was zzso with zzso zzso used to train a correct network are described here, and the results zzso The obtained artificial neural network has the following zzso zzso 144 zzso in zzso 25 and 9 zzso in 2 successive hidden zzso and then 5 zzso It could zzso all the strains in their species zzso This network completes a zzso method for zzso zzso
