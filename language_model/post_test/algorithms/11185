In this work, we model the problem of mining zzso from weighted zzso zzso interaction network as a zzso problem for identifying strong interaction zzso In this regard, a zzso genetic zzso zzso technique is proposed that simultaneously zzso three objective functions to obtain dense zzso having high mean interaction zzso The performance of the proposed technique has been compared with that of other existing zzso methods on an artificial zzso zzso the proposed zzso method is applied on the records of biologically validated and predicted interactions between a set of zzso proteins and a set of human proteins to identify strong interaction zzso For this, the entire interaction information is realized as a zzso zzso We have further investigated the biological significance of the obtained zzso The human proteins involved in the strong interaction module have been found to share common biological properties and they are identified as the zzso of viral infection leading to various zzso These human proteins can be potential drug targets for developing zzso zzso
