One of the most popular feature extraction zzso for zzso zzso zzso is common spatial patterns zzso Despite its known efficiency and widespread use, zzso is also known to be very sensitive to noise and prone to zzso To address this issue, it has been recently proposed to zzso zzso In this paper, we present a simple and unifying theoretical framework to design such a zzso zzso zzso We then present a review of existing zzso zzso and describe how to cast them in this zzso We also propose four new zzso zzso Finally, we compare the performances of 11 different zzso (including the four new ones and the original zzso on zzso data from 17 subjects, from zzso competition zzso zzso showed that the best zzso methods can outperform zzso by nearly zzso in median zzso accuracy and lead to more zzso relevant spatial zzso They also enable us to perform efficient zzso zzso Overall, the best zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso and weighted zzso zzso both proposed in this zzso
