The use of nuclear magnetic resonance zzso to carry out quantum information processing zzso often requires the preparation, zzso and detection of zzso zzso In our previous work, it was shown that the use of pairs of zzso states zzso as a basis for zzso is very convenient because of the simplicity in experimental zzso It is now further demonstrated that the product of the zzso zzso corresponding to two sets of zzso that share a common zzso state has the same peak zzso as those of the common zzso zzso zzso Examples of applying two different quantum logic gates to a zzso system are zzso
