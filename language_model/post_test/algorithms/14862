The zzso zzso of the maximum specific growth rate of zzso biomass is addressed in this zzso A general zzso process model, which is valid for any realistic flow pattern, is used to develop the zzso zzso Depending on the zzso available, two zzso equations are zzso While both require measuring the zzso activity of the activated zzso one requires the additional measurement of the zzso nitrogen zzso at the two ends of the zzso and the other requires the nitrate nitrogen zzso at the same zzso The zzso also requires some zzso and kinetic zzso However, sensitivity analysis shows that the estimate is insensitive to the parameters other than the zzso zzso zzso Compared to the existing zzso the zzso developed in this article does not rely on the assumption of ideal flow pattern in the plant and does not require an zzso estimate of the zzso biomass zzso Experimental and simulation studies show that the zzso performs well and is robust to zzso variations and accidental sludge zzso
