New segments appearing in an image sequence or spontaneously accelerated segments are band limited by the visual system due to a zzso tracking of these segments by eye zzso In spite of this band limitation and acceleration of zzso a coarse zzso zzso zzso zzso can be performed by the visual zzso This is interesting for the development of purely automatic zzso zzso for multimedia zzso In this paper the zzso of the visual system is zzso and used in an automatic coarse initial zzso A suitable model for motion processing based on a spectral representation is presented and applied to the zzso of synthetic and real image sequences with band limited and accelerated moving foreground and background zzso
