A new approach to measuring bone properties at the zzso using ultrasound zzso imaging has recently zzso However, an additional source of zzso error is the substantial regional variations in the pattern of ultrasound zzso The contribution of zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso of variation can be eliminated using an zzso which selects the region of interest zzso completely zzso The objective of the present study was the clinical assessment of an automatic zzso for both broadband zzso zzso zzso and speed of sound zzso measurement using ultrasound zzso zzso The automatic zzso was defined as the circular region of lowest zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso We have tested this zzso using clinical images of the zzso from 265 zzso Mean zzso of variation were zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso and zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso for zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso in an zzso group were zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso In healthy women, the age-related decline was zzso zzso zzso per year zzso for zzso and zzso zzso per year zzso for zzso In the zzso of healthy zzso women, using zzso multiple regression, we found that zzso was predicted best by years since menopause zzso and weight, with overall model zzso zzso zzso zzso was predicted best by zzso only zzso zzso zzso Neither the range of biological variation of ultrasound parameters nor the clinical value were affected by the choice of the region of lowest zzso for zzso The automatic procedure was totally independent of operator interaction, therefore excluding loss of precision due to zzso or zzso zzso The results showed the high precision and zzso of the zzso These factors make this approach viable for routine clinical zzso
