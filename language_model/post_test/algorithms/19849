zzso sound speed estimates are desirable in a number of zzso In an effort to increase the spatial resolution of sound speed estimates, a new method is proposed for direct measurement of sound speed between arbitrary spatial zzso The method uses the sound speed zzso developed by Anderson and zzso Their least squares fit of the received zzso zzso provides an estimate of the zzso point of zzso The point of origin and the delay profile calculated from the fit are used to arrive at a zzso registered virtual zzso Between a pair of registered virtual zzso a zzso wave is zzso By zzso the data, the zzso between the two virtual sources can be zzso From this information, the local sound speed can be zzso zzso of the zzso is made using phantom and simulation zzso The set of test zzso consisted of both homogeneous and zzso zzso Several different zzso phantom zzso were used for the physical zzso The simulation validation focused on the limits of target depth and zzso ratio on virtual detector zzso The simulations also compare the impact of two- and zzso zzso zzso The phantom results varied based on zzso ratio and zzso The results for all cases were generally less than zzso mean error and standard zzso The simulation results varied somewhat with depth and zzso but primarily, they varied with zzso ratio and zzso With zzso zzso the zzso has a worst-case spatial registration bias of zzso With zzso zzso the zzso registration error gets worse with a bias magnitude up to zzso but is otherwise relatively stable over zzso The stability over depth of the bias in a given medium still allows for accurate sound speed estimates with a mean relative error less than zzso
