A soil isolate representing the zzso novel species zzso zzso was found to have zzso zzso and zzso properties consistent with its zzso in the zzso zzso An almost complete sequence of the zzso zzso of the strain was determined following cloning and sequencing of the amplified zzso The sequence was aligned with those available for zzso and zzso trees were zzso using four zzso zzso The zzso was consistently associated with the type strain of zzso zzso albeit with a relatively low zzso value recorded for zzso zzso The strain was also readily separated from representatives of all zzso described zzso species using a set of zzso zzso The zzso and zzso data indicate that the strain should be assigned to the zzso zzso as a new zzso The name proposed for the new species is zzso zzso The type strain is zzso zzso
