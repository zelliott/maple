zzso a zzso disorder of spatial vision, is thought to result from a cascade of cortical deficits over several processing stages beginning at the primary visual zzso zzso However, beyond zzso little is known about how cortical development limits the visual performance of zzso zzso We zzso analyzed the zzso and zzso responses of zzso and V2 zzso in a group of zzso monkeys exhibiting varying depths of zzso Unlike in zzso the relative effectiveness of the affected eye to drive V2 zzso was drastically reduced in the zzso zzso The spatial resolution and the orientation bias of zzso but not zzso zzso were zzso for the affected zzso zzso suppression was robust in both cortical areas, and the magnitude of suppression in individual monkeys was correlated with the depth of their zzso These results suggest that the reduced functional connections beyond zzso and the zzso spatial filter properties of V2 zzso might have substantially limited the sensitivity of the zzso eyes and that zzso suppression was likely to have played a key role in the observed zzso of V2 responses and the emergence of zzso
