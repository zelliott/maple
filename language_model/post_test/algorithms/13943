A zzso method for mapping linked quantitative trait zzso zzso using multiple linked genetic markers is zzso zzso zzso and hypothesis testing was implemented via zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso zzso zzso included were zzso zzso and substitution effects for two zzso zzso map positions of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso and residual zzso Missing data were zzso effects and zzso zzso zzso Three different zzso schemes for testing the presence of a single or two linked zzso on the zzso were zzso The first approach includes a model indicator variable representing two zzso zzso affecting the zzso one linked and one zzso zzso or both zzso linked with the zzso The second approach incorporates an indicator variable for each zzso into the model for zzso allowing or not allowing for a substitution effect of a zzso on zzso and the third approach is based on model determination by zzso jump zzso zzso were evaluated zzso by analyzing simulated granddaughter zzso All methods identified correctly a second, linked zzso and did not reject the zzso model when there was only a single zzso and no additional or an zzso zzso
