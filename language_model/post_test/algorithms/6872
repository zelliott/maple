This paper presents a zzso of the well-known zzso with a trend that allows one to account for the zzso source coordinates and information about transport process into the spatial prediction of zzso zzso The new technique is illustrated using lead data from a Dallas metropolitan area and cadmium data from zzso zzso zzso Superfund zzso Instead of modeling the local spatial trend as zzso zzso of zzso it is here expressed as a function of two factors that likely control the pollution zzso the distance to the zzso and the zzso from the major wind zzso Four different combinations of these two factors are developed, and their prediction performances are evaluated for a range of wind directions using zzso zzso with two traditional zzso zzso and zzso shows that the proposed approach leads to smaller mean square errors of prediction when the correct wind direction is zzso The best combination of trend model and wind direction is zzso and derived using zzso zzso of zzso from a global trend model is an alternative to the use of local trends, and both techniques are shown to outperform ordinary zzso
