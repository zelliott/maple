An improved zzso describing the dependence of the signal strength on relaxation times and spin zzso in zzso nuclear magnetic resonance experiments is zzso It is especially zzso to repetitive experiments such as occur in imaging zzso Essentially, it includes long-time spin zzso effects not considered in the zzso usually zzso Also, some zzso of classical concepts are zzso zzso criteria are studied using zzso zzso The zzso assumes a relatively zzso main magnetic field, but the computer simulations indicate that the zzso normally present in magnetic resonance zzso is zzso The simulations also indicate that the field zzso zzso applied in the spatial zzso procedure do not necessarily interfere seriously with the zzso of the zzso but complicate the choice of optimal formula and may in some circumstances prevent the spin system from reaching a steady zzso
