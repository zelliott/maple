In this paper, we discuss zzso support zzso machines zzso in which an input zzso is classified into the class with the maximum zzso zzso for each class we define the weighted similarity measure using the zzso called zzso that represent the class, and zzso the weights so that the margin between classes is zzso Because the similarity measure is defined for each class, for a data sample the similarity measure to which the data sample belongs needs to be the largest among all the similarity zzso zzso slack zzso we define these constraints either by equality constraints or inequality zzso As a result we obtain zzso least squares zzso zzso and zzso linear programming zzso zzso To zzso training of zzso which are similar to zzso by zzso zzso we also propose zzso by zzso zzso which zzso each similarity measure zzso Using zzso problems, we clarify the difference of zzso and zzso and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods over the conventional methods with equal weights and with weights equal to zzso
