zzso zzso testing of zzso structures can be disturbed by scattering at grain zzso zzso and modeling this so-called zzso zzso is crucial for characterization as well as detection zzso zzso noise can be considered as a fingerprint of the material under investigation, since it contains information about its zzso The interpretation of experimental data zzso an accurate comprehension of complex phenomena that occur in multiple scattering media and thus robust scattering zzso In particular, zzso models can offer the opportunity to realize zzso studies on controlled zzso However, the ability of the model to simulate wave propagation in complex media must be zzso In that perspective, the main objective of the present work is to evaluate the ability of the zzso code zzso zzso to reproduce typical features of multiple wave scattering in the context of zzso zzso zzso with an array of sources and zzso zzso were carried out with a zzso zzso around 2 zzso The sample was a zzso of zzso exhibiting a coarse grain structure with a known grain size zzso The zzso model of this zzso is based on zzso zzso Two physical parameters were used to compare zzso and experimental zzso the coherent zzso peak, and the singular value distribution of the array response zzso Though the simulations are zzso a good agreement was found between simulated and experimental zzso
