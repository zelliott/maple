To demonstrate robust detection of zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso were obtained for two serum protein profiling zzso zzso zzso for 132 patients, 67 healthy and 65 diagnosed as having adult zzso leukemia and zzso zzso for 140 patients, 70 pairs, each with matched zzso zzso zzso levels and zzso diagnoses of one benign and one prostate zzso Signal processing was performed on raw zzso and peak data were zzso using four zzso Feature selection was performed using zzso Network Analysis and a zzso was tested on withheld zzso Identification of candidate zzso was zzso 

Integrated peak zzso were resolved over full zzso zzso using local noise values was superior to global methods in reducing peak zzso reducing replicate zzso and improving feature selection zzso For the leukemia data set, potential disease zzso were detected and were found to be zzso for withheld zzso zzso assignments of protein zzso were consistent with published results and zzso zzso No zzso zzso were detected in the prostate cancer data zzso 

Signal processing, local zzso zzso zzso and zzso Network Analysis feature selection facilitate robust detection and identification of zzso proteins in zzso clinical zzso zzso
