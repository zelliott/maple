We describe how implicit surface representations can be used to solve fundamental problems in brain zzso This kind of representation is not only natural following the state-of-the-art zzso zzso reported in the literature to extract the different brain zzso but it is also, as shown in this paper, the most appropriate one from the zzso point of zzso Examples are provided for finding constrained special zzso on the cortex, such as zzso beds, zzso zzso measures, such as cortical zzso and for computing zzso fields between surfaces such as the brain zzso All these result from efficiently solving partial differential equations zzso and zzso problems on surfaces represented in implicit zzso The implicit framework avoids the need to construct intermediate zzso between 3-D anatomical surfaces and zzso objects such planes or zzso a complex step that introduces errors and is required by many other cortical processing zzso
