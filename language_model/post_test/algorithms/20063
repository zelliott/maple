The aim of the present study was the determination of the stability of a zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso at pH 10 and zzso and zzso as well as at pH zzso and zzso The analysis was performed using a validated zzso zzso zzso Rapid zzso of the incubated zzso to the zzso was observed under all zzso Linear zzso zzso and zzso peptides were the primary reaction products at pH 10 and zzso indicating that a zzso zzso is formed in the zzso In contrast, the zzso were by far the major compounds in the incubation solutions at pH 10 and zzso and at pH zzso and zzso whereas the linear zzso peptides were found only at low zzso A kinetic model was derived to fit the concentration versus time data, which consider the zzso as central intermediate for zzso formation and for zzso and zzso of the linear zzso zzso Besides the back reaction of the zzso to the zzso an additional zzso reaction of the zzso ring was considered to obtain the fit of the experimental data, indicating that additional degradation reactions have to be considered for zzso zzso
