The zzso of cell zzso can be zzso increased following the application of external electric zzso zzso approaches such as molecular modeling provide a significant insight into the processes zzso at the molecular level, the integrity of zzso cell zzso when these are subject to zzso zzso under similar conditions as those used in zzso This article reports on the progress made so far using such simulations to model zzso zzso We first describe the methods devised to perform in zzso experiments of zzso subject to zzso zzso zzso electric fields and of zzso subject to charge zzso mimicking therefore the application of zzso zzso zzso We show then that, at the molecular level, the two types of zzso produce similar zzso provided the TM zzso these zzso create are higher than a certain zzso zzso pores stabilized by the membrane zzso zzso form within the zzso time scale across the zzso zzso Similarly, when the zzso are switched off, the pores collapse zzso within similar time zzso It is shown that for similar TM zzso applied, both methods induce similar electric field zzso within the membrane zzso The cascade of events following the application of the zzso and taking place at the zzso is a direct consequence of such an electric field zzso
