We describe a fully automated zzso for finding functional sites on protein zzso Our method finds surface patches of unusual zzso properties on protein structures, and estimates the zzso probability of overlapping functional zzso Other methods for predicting the locations of specific types of functional sites exist, but in previous zzso it has been difficult to compare methods when they are applied to different types of zzso Thus, we introduce a new statistical framework that enables rigorous comparisons of the usefulness of different zzso properties for predicting virtually any kind of functional zzso The program's statistical models were trained for 11 individual properties zzso zzso zzso zzso and for 15 neural network combination properties, all zzso and tested on 15 diverse protein zzso To simulate what to expect if the program were run on proteins of unknown function, as might arise from structural zzso we tested it on zzso proteins of diverse mixed zzso In the zzso top half of all predictions, a functional zzso could typically be found within the first zzso zzso chosen at zzso The program may or may not use partial information about the zzso function type as an zzso depending on which statistical model the user chooses to zzso If function type is used as an additional zzso prediction accuracy usually increases, and is particularly good for zzso zzso sites, and zzso zzso The program can be zzso online (at zzso
