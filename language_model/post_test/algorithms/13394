The gold standard for diagnosing sleep zzso syndrome zzso is zzso zzso an expensive, zzso and time-consuming zzso zzso it would be very useful to have a screening method to allow early assessment of the severity of a subject, prior to zzso referral for zzso Several differences have been reported between simple zzso and zzso patients in the acoustic characteristics of zzso and its zzso In this paper, zzso are fully zzso in the time domain, by their sound intensity and pitch, and in the frequency domain, by their zzso zzso and several shape and energy ratio zzso We show that accurate zzso zzso of zzso subjects, with three levels of zzso can be achieved on the basis of acoustic analysis of zzso alone, without any requiring information on the duration or the number of zzso Several zzso methods are zzso The best of the approaches assessed is a zzso model using a kernel density zzso method, although good results can also be obtained by a suitable combination of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso allows early zzso of subjects according to their zzso This could be the basis of a single channel, zzso screening procedure for zzso
