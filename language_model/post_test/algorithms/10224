Chile has a low zzso organ donation zzso at the same time, living donor transplantation activity is also zzso The purpose of this study was to analyze the impact on the number and quality of transplants using various mechanisms for kidney exchange from living donors to patients on Chile's waiting zzso 

A computerized model was developed to simulate five options for living kidney donation: zzso direct zzso zzso direct donation plus zzso and three-way zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso three-way zzso and zzso allocation of donors based on the top trading cycles zzso zzso We calculated the projected number of zzso adjusting for the risk of a positive zzso as well as the average quality in terms of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso 

If all patients on the waiting list have a willing direct zzso zzso of patients will receive a zzso zzso for incompatible pairs or pairs with a positive zzso an exchange of zzso can increase the number to zzso This figure rises to zzso or zzso for zzso or three-way exchanges, zzso Although zzso ensures that zzso of the patients could be zzso the graft quality is better with an average zzso match of zzso versus zzso 

These results showed that kidney exchange mechanisms can increase the number of living donor zzso by zzso and zzso
