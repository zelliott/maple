An zzso sampled at a rate of 360 samples zzso or more produces a large amount of redundant data that are difficult to store and zzso we therefore need a process to represent the signals with clinically acceptable zzso and with as small a number of code bits as zzso In this paper, a real-time zzso zzso algorithm, zzso is zzso zzso is an efficient zzso which locates significant samples and at the same time encodes linear segments between them by using linear zzso The significant samples selected include, but are not limited to, the samples that have significant displacement from the zzso signal such that the allowed zzso error is limited to a constant zzso which is specified by the zzso The way that zzso zzso the displacement of a sample from the zzso signal guarantees that the high activity regions are more accurately zzso The results from zzso are compared with those from the well-known zzso algorithm, zzso which is also a real-time zzso It is found that under the same bit rate, a considerable improvement of zzso error zzso can be achieved by employing the proposed zzso zzso An average value of zzso of zzso can be achieved even at an average bit rate of zzso bits per sample by employing zzso By tuning the allowed zzso error of zzso such that it has similar bit rate to zzso the average value of zzso achieved by zzso is zzso while the average value of zzso achieved by zzso under the same bit rate is zzso
