This article describes a conglomerate measure of gait zzso based on nine zzso zzso the zzso zzso Index zzso zzso zzso zzso reliability and minimum zzso change zzso were evaluated in 31 patients with zzso zzso zzso through comparisons with classically used evaluation tools such as the International Cooperative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scores for the healthy population were zzso and were significantly reduced in zzso patients zzso The zzso was correlated with the global zzso score and was sensitive enough to differentiate between groups of zzso patients zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso was found to have a high zzso reliability with an zzso correlation zzso of zzso A zzso of zzso points was found necessary to ensure that a change in zzso reflects a true change rather than measurement zzso The zzso provides a quantitative measure of zzso which behaves well statistically in both zzso and patients with zzso It can be easily implemented using the supplemental data provided with this zzso zzso work is necessary to strengthen the zzso zzso
