We performed this prospective cohort study to correlate the findings of left zzso zzso zzso and zzso left zzso zzso mapping zzso in the evaluation of cardiac wall motion and also to establish standards for wall motion assessment by zzso Fifty-five patients (35 zzso mean age, zzso zzso zzso zzso eligible for zzso left cardiac zzso underwent zzso and zzso Wall motion scores, zzso ejection zzso zzso and zzso volumes derived from zzso versus zzso data were compared and analyzed zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso zzso were used to assess the accuracy of zzso in distinguishing between normal, zzso and zzso wall zzso Mean zzso procedure time was 37 zzso 11 zzso The zzso and zzso findings differed for mean zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso mean zzso volume zzso zzso 13 zzso vs 36 zzso 10 zzso and mean zzso volume zzso zzso 104 zzso vs 123 zzso 65 zzso Mean wall motion scores zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso segments were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso between wall motion types were zzso and zzso The zzso zzso showed zzso to have a zzso accuracy in zzso between zzso and zzso segments and a zzso accuracy between zzso and zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso can differentiate between normal and abnormal cardiac wall motion, although it is more accurate at zzso between zzso and zzso motion than between zzso and zzso zzso
