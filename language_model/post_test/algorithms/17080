A model for data acquired with the use of a zzso camera is given and is then used for developing a new zzso method for restoring zzso of objects observed with such a zzso The model includes the effects of point spread, zzso noise, zzso noise, zzso zzso response, zzso spectral response, and extraneous charge carriers resulting from bias, dark zzso and both internal and external background zzso An zzso zzso is identified that produces a sequence of estimates zzso toward a constrained zzso estimate of the intensity distribution of an zzso zzso An example is given for restoring images from data acquired with the use of the zzso Space zzso
