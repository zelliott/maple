Advances in biotechnology have changed the manner of characterizing large populations of microbial communities that are ubiquitous across several zzso sequencing involves decoding the DNA of organisms zzso within zzso ranging from ocean, soil and human zzso Several researchers are interested in zzso because it provides an insight into the complex zzso across several zzso zzso are using zzso to determine the role played by collection of microbial organisms within human body with respect to human health zzso and zzso 

We have developed an efficient and zzso species richness zzso zzso that uses locality sensitive hashing zzso Our zzso achieves efficiency by zzso the zzso sequence comparison operations using hashing and also incorporates matching of zzso zzso zzso criterion to improve the quality of sequence zzso We use zzso similarity function to cluster similar sequences and make individual groups, called operational zzso units zzso We also zzso different species zzso metrics by utilizing zzso assignment results to further extend our zzso 

The zzso is evaluated on synthetic samples and eight targeted zzso zzso zzso samples taken from zzso We compare the performance of our zzso with several competing diversity zzso zzso We show the benefits of our approach with respect to zzso zzso and meaningful zzso zzso We also demonstrate practical significance of the developed zzso by comparing bacterial diversity and structure across different skin zzso
