Multiple sequence alignment involves alignment of more than two sequences and is an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that use different criteria to find an approximation to the optimal solution are zzso At the heart of these approaches lie the scoring and objective functions that a given zzso uses to compare competing solutions in constructing a multiple sequence zzso These objective functions are often motivated by the biological zzso that govern functional similarities and evolutionary zzso Most existing approaches zzso a progressive process where the final alignment is constructed zzso by adding new sequences into an existing multiple sequence alignment zzso which is zzso zzso In doing this, the core scoring function to assess zzso of zzso alignments generally remains the same, while the objective functions used in zzso steps zzso Nevertheless, the overall assessment of the final multiple sequence alignment is generally calculated by an extension of zzso zzso In this chapter, we explore different scoring and objective functions used in calculating the accuracy and zzso of a multiple sequence alignment and provide zzso of these criteria in popularly used multiple sequence alignment zzso
