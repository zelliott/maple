We present a small sphere and large margin approach for novelty detection problems, where the majority of training data are normal zzso In addition, the training data also contain a small number of abnormal examples or zzso The basic idea is to construct a zzso that contains most of the normal examples, such that the volume of this sphere is as small as possible, while at the same time the margin between the surface of this sphere and the zzso training data is as large as zzso This can result in a closed and tight boundary around the normal zzso To build such a sphere, we only need to solve a convex zzso problem that can be efficiently solved with the existing software packages for training zzso zzso zzso Experimental results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed zzso
