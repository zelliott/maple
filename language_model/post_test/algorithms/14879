This report describes a zzso zzso and transit model to estimate the fraction of dose absorbed and the rate of drug zzso for passively transported drugs in immediate release zzso The model considers simultaneous small zzso transit flow and drug zzso Both zzso and zzso methods were zzso to solve the model zzso It was found that the fraction of dose absorbed can be estimated by zzso zzso zzso zzso where zzso is the human effective zzso in zzso A good correlation was found between the fraction of dose absorbed and the effective zzso for ten drugs covering a wide range of zzso zzso The model was able to explain the oral plasma concentration profiles of zzso
