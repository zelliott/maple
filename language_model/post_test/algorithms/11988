A zzso approach to the direct mapping of a quantitative trait locus zzso fully utilizing information from multiple linked gene zzso is presented in this zzso The joint zzso distribution (a mixture distribution modeling the linkage between a zzso zzso and N gene zzso is zzso challenging and invites exploration via zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso The zzso complete marginal zzso zzso are zzso allowing a diverse range of zzso zzso estimated include the zzso zzso probabilities for the zzso and the zzso the zzso zzso for the zzso and the position and additive and dominance effects of the zzso The methodology is applied through simulation to a zzso design to form an zzso pedigree structure where there is an entire class of missing zzso The capacity of the technique to accurately estimate parameters is examined for a range of zzso
