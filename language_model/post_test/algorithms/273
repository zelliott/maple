To determine the agreement between zzso retinal nerve fiber layer zzso thickness zzso from zzso time domain optical zzso zzso zzso and zzso spectral domain zzso zzso zzso zzso Dublin, zzso in normal subjects and subjects with zzso 

zzso of diagnostic test or zzso 

A total of 130 eyes from 130 normal subjects and subjects with glaucoma were zzso The subjects were divided into groups by visual field criteria: normal zzso zzso 29), glaucoma suspect zzso zzso zzso mild glaucoma zzso zzso zzso moderate glaucoma zzso zzso zzso and severe glaucoma zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso thickness was measured with zzso Fast zzso and zzso 200 zzso 200 zzso zzso zzso on the same day in 1 eye of each subject to determine zzso Two operators used the same instruments for all zzso 

Student paired zzso testing, zzso correlation zzso and zzso analysis of zzso thickness zzso 

The average age of the glaucoma group was significantly more than that of the normal group: zzso years versus zzso years, zzso For zzso zzso the average zzso thickness zzso zzso standard zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the normal, suspect, mild, moderate, and severe groups, zzso For zzso zzso the corresponding zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All zzso differences were statistically significant by paired zzso testing zzso except for the moderate group zzso zzso zzso For average zzso there was also a highly significant linear relationship between zzso minus zzso difference and zzso thickness zzso zzso plots showed that the systematic difference of zzso zzso are smaller than zzso at thinner zzso values but larger at thicker zzso zzso 

zzso thickness zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso cannot be directly zzso zzso should be aware that zzso are generally higher with zzso than with zzso except when the zzso is very thin, as in severe zzso This difference must be taken into account if comparing zzso zzso with zzso zzso
