There is a trend in single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that small and dedicated imaging systems are becoming zzso For example, many companies are developing small dedicated cardiac zzso systems with different zzso These dedicated systems have a smaller field of view zzso than a full-size clinical zzso Thus data zzso has become the norm rather than the exception in these zzso zzso it is important to develop region of interest zzso reconstruction zzso using truncated zzso This paper is a stepping stone toward this zzso This paper shows that the common generic zzso image reconstruction zzso are able to exactly reconstruct the zzso under the conditions that the convex zzso is fully sampled and the image value in a zzso within the zzso is zzso If the zzso includes a zzso that is outside the patient body, then the conditions can be easily zzso
