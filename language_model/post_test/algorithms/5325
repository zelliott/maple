We propose a new mathematical framework to formulate scale structures of general zzso zzso equations characterize a system in terms of zzso zzso Their behavior at each scale level is determined independently without referring to other zzso Most standard zzso in mathematics can be reformulated in such stack zzso By involving interaction between zzso we zzso stack equations into scale zzso zzso equations are capable to accommodate various behaviors at different scale levels into one integrated zzso On contrary to standard zzso such solutions often reveal eccentric zzso figures, providing a clue to understand zzso nature of the real zzso zzso it is suggested that the zzso noise stems from zzso scale zzso
