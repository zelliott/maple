Application of the continuity equation to zzso zzso measurement of quantitative coronary flow zzso has been reported recently to be one of the accurate methods to evaluate mild to moderate coronary zzso This method, however, has not been validated in moderate to severe coronary zzso Furthermore, the ratio of zzso zzso zzso may be influenced by side branches zzso to moderate to severe zzso Therefore we designed this study to evaluate the accuracy of the continuity equation method in the assessment of moderate to severe zzso by an zzso zzso zzso zzso guide wire (12 zzso and the influence of a side branch on zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were recorded in the straight rigid tubes (4 zzso zzso with different zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso diameter zzso without a side branch with a zzso guide zzso By the continuity zzso percent diameter zzso was calculated from the zzso and zzso zzso ratios in each model at different flow zzso In the model of zzso diameter zzso with a side branch (1 zzso zzso zzso to the zzso and the model of zzso diameter zzso with a side branch (1 zzso zzso zzso to the zzso percent diameter zzso was calculated by the same zzso zzso diameter zzso derived from the zzso zzso ratio in each model was in agreement with the true severity of zzso in each model without a side branch zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso diameter zzso from the zzso zzso ratio was also in agreement with the true severity of zzso in each model without a side branch zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In the model of zzso diameter zzso with a side branch zzso to the zzso site, however, percent diameter zzso derived from the zzso zzso ratio was underestimated compared with the real zzso and significantly smaller than that derived from the zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso On the other hand, in the model of zzso diameter zzso with a side branch zzso to the zzso site, the percent diameter zzso derived from both the zzso and zzso zzso ratios was in agreement with that derived from the zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the experimental models the zzso of zzso severity by a zzso guide wire is accurate even in moderate to severe zzso unless a side branch exists just zzso to the zzso However, the zzso zzso ratio is zzso even if a side branch zzso This suggests that severity of zzso derived from the zzso zzso ratio may be more useful than that from the zzso zzso zzso ratio in human coronary zzso with side zzso
