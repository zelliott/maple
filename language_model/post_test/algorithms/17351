Due to practical limitations in data zzso 3-D zzso zzso systems must attempt to provide rapid reconstructions of acceptable quality from a limited number of zzso The use of zzso zzso zzso for image reconstruction from an inadequate number of projections, results in view zzso zzso In this paper we investigate different zzso methods of alleviating the effects of view zzso zzso Two distinct methods and their zzso are zzso The first, termed the intermediate view zzso zzso method, involves zzso a set of intermediate views by zzso followed by a reconstruction using the zzso set of zzso The second, termed the zzso zzso method, incorporates a correction on the initial reconstruction based on the zzso zzso zzso modifications and zzso of the above methods are zzso Of the methods discussed, the zzso method is simple, tends to reduce the effects of artifacts with less zzso to secondary effects, and is zzso to zzso zzso
