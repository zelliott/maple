Despite their zzso complexity almost all functional properties of zzso networks can be derived from zzso zzso Indeed, many theoretical investigations (like zzso zzso rely on zzso function from steady zzso This leads to the interesting question as to how zzso networks avoid complex dynamics and maintain a zzso zzso Here, we expose zzso network zzso to zzso dynamics generated by simple local zzso We find that the zzso response is highly zzso Complex dynamics are systematically reduced on zzso networks compared to zzso networks with identical degree zzso Already small zzso modifications substantially enhance the capacity of a network to host complex dynamic behavior and thus reduce its zzso zzso This exceptionally pronounced zzso of dynamics zzso in the zzso may explain why zzso behavior is ubiquitous in zzso
