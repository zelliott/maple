Critical mechanical conditions, such as stress within the structure and zzso stress due to blood flow, predicted from zzso magnetic resonance image zzso zzso simulations have shown to be potential in assessing carotid plaque zzso zzso contours obtained from zzso zzso are a result of a zzso zzso due to zzso zzso However, in order to make accurate predictions, the zzso model must be based on the zzso zzso A shrinkage procedure can be used to obtain the zzso start zzso 

In this study, zzso zzso zzso of carotid plaques were obtained from 28 zzso The contours of each plaque were segmented zzso Additional to a uniform shrinkage zzso a zzso shrinkage refinement procedure was zzso This procedure was repeated until the zzso zzso zzso and zzso cap thickness had the best match with the zzso zzso 

Compared to the uniform shrinkage zzso the zzso shrinkage significantly reduced the difference in zzso shape and in cap thickness at the thinnest zzso zzso indicate that uniform shrinkage would underestimate the critical stress in the structure by zzso 

For slices with an irregular zzso shape (the ratio of the maximum zzso to the minimum zzso is more than zzso the zzso shrinkage procedure is needed to get an accurate stress profile for mechanics and zzso carotid plaque vulnerability zzso
