Phase sensitive zzso imaging extends standard zzso zzso techniques by offering up to a thousand times higher sensitivity than zzso zzso If an object is illuminated with a sufficiently coherent zzso phase contrast is achieved by moving the detector downstream from the zzso There is a quantitative relationship between the phase shift induced by the object and the recorded zzso This relationship can be used to retrieve the phase shift induced by the object through the solution of an inverse zzso Since the phase shift can be considered as a projection through the zzso zzso index, the latter can be reconstructed using standard zzso inversion zzso However, the determination of the phase shift from the recorded intensity is an zzso inverse zzso We investigate the application of zzso zzso zzso zzso to this zzso The method is evaluated using simulated and experimental data and is shown to increase the quality of zzso in terms of zzso zzso error and compared with standard zzso zzso at a three times increase in zzso zzso
