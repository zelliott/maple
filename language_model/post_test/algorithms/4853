zzso to improve zzso spin decoupling efficiency in zzso zzso of zzso and liquid zzso we have modified the original Small Phase zzso zzso zzso sequence by incorporating a frequency sweep into zzso For the resulting zzso termed zzso the decoupling performance of a large number of sweep zzso was explored by both zzso simulations and zzso zzso It is found that introducing a frequency sweep generally increases both the zzso decoupling performance and the zzso towards zzso zzso compared to the original zzso zzso This zzso the concept of extending the range of efficient decoupling by introducing frequency zzso which was recently suggested in the context of the zzso zzso zzso The sequence found to be best performing among the zzso zzso consists of fully swept 16 pulse pairs and is designated zzso Its good decoupling performance for rigid spin systems is confirmed by zzso simulations and also zzso by evaluating the zzso resonance of a powder sample of zzso under zzso For moderate zzso zzso the new sequence matches the decoupling achieved with zzso and zzso all other tested zzso including zzso and zzso zzso also shows excellent decoupling characteristics for liquid zzso systems, as exemplified by experiments on the zzso liquid zzso
