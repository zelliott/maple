Errors and zzso in distance restraints derived from zzso peak volumes are usually accounted for by generous lower and upper bounds on the zzso In this paper, we propose a new form of distance zzso replacing the zzso bounds by a potential function obtained from the error distribution of the zzso We derived the shape of the potential from molecular dynamics calculations and by comparison of zzso data with X-ray crystal zzso We used complete zzso to derive the optimal weight for the data in the zzso In a model system with synthetic zzso the accuracy of the structures improved significantly compared to calculations with the usual form of zzso For experimental data sets, the structures systematically approach the X-ray crystal structures of the same zzso Also standard quality indicators improve compared to standard zzso The results did not depend critically on the exact shape of the zzso The new approach is less zzso and uses fewer assumptions in the interpretation of zzso peak volumes as distance restraints than the usual zzso Figures of merit for the structures, such as the zzso difference from the average structure or the zzso difference from the data, are therefore less biased and more meaningful measures of structure quality than with the usual form of zzso
