Here, we describe the zzso zzso concept that can be used for the focus and zzso of zzso electron packets in the time zzso The zzso zzso are created by appropriately zzso optical zzso that interact with electrons through the zzso zzso With such an arrangement, a zzso lens equation with a form identical to that of conventional light zzso is zzso The analog of ray zzso but for zzso are constructed to help the zzso of the process of zzso electron zzso It is shown that such zzso zzso not only compensate for electron pulse broadening due to zzso zzso but also allow zzso of the packets to zzso much shorter than their initial zzso With these capabilities, zzso electron zzso and zzso can be extended to new zzso just as importantly, electron zzso can be delivered directly on an zzso techniques target zzso
