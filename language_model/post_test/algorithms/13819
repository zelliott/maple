To investigate the role of the 17 zzso long zzso zzso in the transport of the precursor of zzso zzso zzso from the zzso to the zzso we have studied the effects of point zzso upon its zzso and on the process of zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso indicates that in zzso solution zzso of the molecules have the 4-12 segment folded into an zzso The zzso environment provided by zzso zzso promotes the folding of zzso of the zzso molecules into a zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso wheel analysis of segment 4-12 and zzso zzso moments calculated considering all possible zzso zzso between 80 and 120 degrees, indicate the zzso character of the zzso assembled in water and zzso zzso interactions between the zzso pairs zzso and zzso are essential for zzso stability and condition zzso zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso for zzso results in moderate zzso of the zzso decreases protein targeting to the zzso membrane and partly zzso zzso of the protein to the zzso zzso Replacement of either zzso or zzso for zzso causes a major disruption of the zzso decreases protein targeting and blocks completely the zzso of the protein to the zzso zzso Replacement of zzso for zzso a substitution which is known to destabilize zzso in peptides and proteins as a result of the zzso bond to the zzso at zzso zzso produces similar effects as the zzso for the zzso zzso The effects of zzso on zzso stability and protein transport are partly reversed by introduction of zzso zzso at positions 2 and 3 and Ala at position zzso zzso such as zzso for zzso or zzso for zzso which change the net and local charges of the zzso without altering its zzso have no effect on the protein zzso These results provide direct evidence of the involvement of the zzso in the transport of zzso from the zzso to the zzso They show that folding of the zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso properties of the environment and is critical for targeting the protein to the zzso membrane and for its zzso to the zzso zzso
