The equation of state for the zzso with a fluid (G, zzso zzso phase transition derived earlier zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B 1999, zzso zzso in the framework of a zzso approach is zzso A term is added that takes into account the zzso zzso of mixing of the zzso and clusters of zzso zzso The results calculated from the proposed equations agree well with the experimental zzso zzso obtained for various types of zzso zzso The values of molecular areas of the zzso molecules estimated from the fitting of experimental data to the proposed equation are quite similar to the real zzso Another equation of state capable of describing the fluid state of zzso zzso and based on equations for the chemical potential of the zzso in the bulk phase and in the surface layer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B 2006, zzso zzso is also generalized to be extended to the zzso phase transition region (A zzso zzso taking into account zzso zzso for mixing zzso zzso zzso and clusters of zzso zzso The values calculated on this basis agree also well with the experimental zzso
