Many forests in the zzso are acknowledged for protecting objects, such as zzso roads, against zzso However, there is a lack of knowledge on efficient zzso strategies and interventions to maintain these forests at optimal protection zzso zzso assessment tools are required that zzso the zzso protection effect of forest stands over time, and thereby provide the ability to evaluate the necessity and effect of management zzso This paper introduces such a tool that consists of a zzso zzso module embedded in the patch based forest simulator zzso The latter is extended for this study with a new zzso zzso In a series of experiments the new combined simulation tool is evaluated with regard to zzso sensitivity, model zzso experiments with recently proposed zzso from the literature, and the ability to respond realistically to different management regimes in zzso protection zzso zzso confirm the potential of the new tool for realistic simulation of zzso activity in zzso mountain forests, but point at the urgent need to improve the knowledge base on the interaction of zzso and zzso zzso Further work will focus on model validation against empirical zzso data, and include reduced tree vitality due to damage from zzso zzso as well as the explicit consideration of downed dead zzso
