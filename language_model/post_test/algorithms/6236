In zzso regions of interest are usually much smaller than the whole slide zzso Various zzso related medical applications, such as zzso and computer aided diagnosis, are liable to benefit greatly from microscope auto positioning on previously defined regions of zzso In this paper, we present a method for zzso auto positioning on a microscope zzso The method is based on zzso of a microscopic query image using a previously acquired slide zzso It uses geometric zzso a highly efficient technique drawn from the object recognition zzso The zzso exhibits high tolerance to possible variations in visual appearance due to slide zzso zzso and zzso zzso Experimental results indicate high reliability of the zzso
