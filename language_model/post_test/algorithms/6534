For patient's zzso dose administration of insulin via oral inhalation is often considered as an alternative to subcutaneous zzso An important statistical problem is to estimate dose zzso which is the amount of drug needed to be delivered by inhalation to generate an equivalent zzso zzso response produced by a therapeutic dose of subcutaneous zzso Because of high zzso zzso a crossover design clinical trial is typically used where data from both routes of administration are obtained from the same zzso A linear mixed effects model is proposed to describe the relationship between AK response and insulin dose for the two routes of zzso zzso of dose zzso in this setting has not been discussed in the statistical zzso Several competing methods for zzso dose zzso are proposed and zzso A formula for calculating an approximate sample size necessary to estimate dose zzso with a desired precision for the new route of administration is also zzso
