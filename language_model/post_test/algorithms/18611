This paper evaluates a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso built from zzso neural zzso The zzso neural approach uses robust zzso to map standard zzso zzso and zzso data sets onto a zzso neural zzso The zzso neural network uses high speed pattern matching to recall a candidate set of matching records, which are then processed by a conventional zzso approach to determine the zzso zzso We compare various zzso of the zzso approach to a conventional approach for memory zzso training speed, retrieval speed and retrieval zzso We demonstrate the superior performance with respect to speed and memory requirements of the zzso approach compared to the standard approach and we pinpoint the optimal zzso
