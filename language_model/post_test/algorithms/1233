We have previously zzso and zzso 1993) devised methods for obtaining marginal zzso zzso and associated zzso estimates for zzso survival data, using a synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso for zzso censored survival analysis and generalized zzso equations zzso The method is zzso in that a baseline survival distribution is zzso zzso zzso models, with unspecified baseline survival, have also been developed zzso Lin and zzso zzso Lin, zzso Common to both these approaches is the provision of robust zzso for the zzso zzso However, none of this work has addressed the more difficult area of dependence zzso While zzso approaches ostensibly provide such estimates, we show that there are problems adopting these with zzso survival zzso Further, we demonstrate that these problems can affect zzso of the zzso zzso zzso An zzso ad hoc approach to dependence zzso based on design effects, is proposed and evaluated via simulation and illustrative zzso
