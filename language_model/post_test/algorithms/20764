To improve zzso ability to discriminate zzso from zzso zzso zzso through a simple clinical zzso that avoids zzso zzso 

We zzso compared the clinical and zzso fluid features of zzso adults with zzso zzso who satisfied diagnostic criteria for tuberculosis zzso or zzso zzso at one academic center zzso zzso Then, we built a decision tree model to predict tuberculosis using the zzso zzso The model was validated with an independent sample set from another center that included 74 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Among 12 potential predictor zzso the zzso tree analysis selected four zzso parameters zzso years, zzso fluid zzso zzso zzso degrees C, and zzso fluid zzso from the derivation zzso The generated zzso had zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso and an area under the zzso curve of zzso for diagnosing zzso The corresponding operating characteristics for the validation cohort were zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso a decision tree analysis that contains simple clinical and laboratory data can help in the differential diagnosis of zzso and zzso zzso zzso
