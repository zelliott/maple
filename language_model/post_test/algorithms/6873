The zzso of the equilibrium partition theory zzso for zzso zzso in submerged zzso shoots was investigated using field zzso The equilibrium state of zzso between zzso shoots and sediments was verified by testing the direct zzso zzso zzso 1 in a zzso zzso between zzso zzso in the lipids of zzso shoots zzso and in the organic fraction of sediments zzso using the zzso zzso A significant zzso was found between zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso zzso factor zzso predicted from this relationship zzso zzso zzso was in the zzso range that is suggested in the zzso These results indicate that, in our study sites, zzso is zzso to zzso in zzso zzso This opens interesting perspectives in environmental zzso
