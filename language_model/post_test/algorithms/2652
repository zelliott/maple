The recently proposed zzso region zzso has been proven robust and versatile for a modest zzso zzso The zzso zzso enables efficient fusion of different types of features, where the spatial and statistical properties, as well as their zzso are zzso The similarity between two zzso zzso is measured on zzso zzso Based on the same metric but with a zzso zzso we propose a novel tracking approach on zzso zzso with a novel incremental zzso zzso learning zzso To address the appearance variations, zzso zzso learns a zzso zzso zzso representation and efficiently adapts online to appearance changes of the target with only zzso zzso complexity, resulting in a real-time zzso The zzso representation and the zzso are then combined with the particle filter framework to allow better handling of background zzso as well as the temporary zzso We test the proposed zzso zzso tracker on numerous benchmark sequences involving different types of challenges including zzso and variations in zzso scale, and zzso The proposed approach demonstrates excellent real-time performance, both zzso and zzso in comparison with several previously proposed zzso
