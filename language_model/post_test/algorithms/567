Brain machine zzso zzso are devices that convert neural signals into commands to directly control artificial zzso such as limb zzso Previous real-time methods applied to decoding behavioral commands from the activity of populations of zzso have generally relied upon linear models of neural tuning and were limited in the way they used the abundant statistical information contained in the movement profiles of motor zzso Here, we propose an zzso order zzso Kalman filter which zzso two key features: zzso use of a zzso zzso model of neural tuning which describes neural activity significantly better than zzso linear tuning models, and zzso zzso of the movement state variables with a history of zzso recent states, which improves prediction of the desired command even before incorporating neural activity information and allows the tuning model to capture relationships between neural activity and movement at multiple time zzso zzso This new filter was tested in zzso experiments in which zzso monkeys used their cortical activity, recorded through chronically implanted zzso zzso to directly control computer zzso The 10th order zzso Kalman filter outperformed the standard Kalman filter and the Wiener filter in both zzso reconstruction of movement zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
