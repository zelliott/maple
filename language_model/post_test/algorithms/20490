zzso stability is an important fundamental quality when measuring sleep zzso yet it has been infrequently zzso zzso theory was used to estimate the short-term zzso stability of five variables commonly used to characterize zzso sleep onset zzso total sleep time, wake after sleep zzso time in bed, and sleep zzso Estimates were calculated for 32 elderly primary zzso and 32 elderly normal zzso both in the lab and at home, using both sleep logs and zzso zzso A week of recording using either zzso or sleep logs was typically sufficient to achieve adequate stability zzso as G zzso of at least zzso with some notable zzso zzso when using zzso measures with zzso a zzso average was necessary for wake after sleep onset and zzso more than a zzso average was necessary for sleep onset zzso Because of the substantial commitment involved in the zzso recording of sleep, alternative forms of zzso are considered with the intent of improving zzso zzso
