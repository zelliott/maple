The aim of this study was to compare the visual field test results in healthy children obtained via the zzso zzso zzso threshold program and standard automated zzso zzso using the Swedish interactive threshold zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This prospective study included 55 healthy children without zzso or systemic disorders who underwent both zzso and frequency doubling technology zzso zzso visual field zzso Visual field test reliability zzso test zzso global zzso zzso zzso zzso and pattern standard zzso zzso were compared between the 2 tests using the zzso zzso test and paired zzso The performance of the zzso field zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso technology zzso zzso tests between genders were compared with zzso zzso 

Fifty-five healthy children with a mean age of zzso zzso zzso years zzso from 8 years to 16 zzso were included in this prospective zzso The test zzso of zzso and zzso were similar zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, P zzso zzso MD and the zzso values obtained via zzso zzso were significantly higher than those obtained via zzso zzso zzso zzso and fixation losses and false negative errors were significantly less with zzso zzso zzso zzso A weak positive correlation between the two tests in terms of MD zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso was zzso 

Children were able to complete both the visual test zzso successfully within 6 zzso However, zzso testing appears to be associated with less depression of the visual field zzso of healthy zzso zzso zzso and zzso should not be used zzso in the follow-up of zzso
