zzso biomass and productivity have been continuously monitored from ocean color satellites for over a zzso Yet, the most widely used empirical approach for zzso zzso a zzso from satellites can be in error by a factor of 5 or zzso Such zzso is due to differences in zzso and zzso properties of zzso and related zzso of zzso organic matter zzso and zzso The empirical zzso have built-in assumptions that follow the basic zzso of biological zzso zzso regions with low zzso biomass are populated with small zzso whereas more productive regions contain larger zzso zzso With a changing world ocean, zzso composition may shift in response to altered environmental zzso and zzso and mineral zzso may become zzso from zzso stocks, creating further uncertainty and error in the empirical zzso zzso caution is warranted when using zzso derived zzso to zzso zzso changes in ocean zzso The Southern Ocean is already experiencing zzso shifts and shows substantial errors in zzso zzso for different zzso zzso zzso global assessments of zzso will require improved technology and zzso enhanced field zzso and ongoing validation of our zzso in zzso
