The main purpose of this paper is to describe zzso zzso and certain unique features of a system for zzso of intensity modulated zzso zzso The system is coupled to a commercial treatment planning system with an accurate dose calculation engine based on the kernel zzso zzso The system was designed for use for research as well as for routine clinical zzso It employs zzso and zzso objective zzso The system can zzso zzso plans with multiple target volumes zzso Each target volume may be assigned a different prescription dose with constraints on either zzso or zzso or zzso For zzso at risk more than one constraint may be zzso This feature allows simultaneous treatment of primary, regional disease and zzso treated zzso The system allows zzso of constraints on logical combinations of zzso structures, such as a region of overlap between the prostate planning target volume and zzso or the volume of lung excluding the zzso The zzso may also be performed on plans which, in addition to zzso beams, include other zzso such as zzso zzso and electron beams and zzso zzso The various features of the system are illustrated with one phantom example and two clinical examples: a brain zzso zzso case and a zzso zzso In the zzso phantom example, the use of the system for overlap regions is zzso The brain zzso zzso example shows the improvement of zzso plans over the conventional arcs based plan and the three-dimensional zzso plan with multiple fixed zzso angles and demonstrates the application of our system to cases where small grid sizes are zzso The zzso example shows the potential of zzso to simultaneously treat large and boost zzso It also illustrates the power of zzso to protect normal zzso structures for highly complex situations and the efficiency in planning and delivery achievable with zzso The overall zzso planning time is typically less than 2 h on a Sun zzso zzso most of which is spent in repeated zzso of dose zzso
