We describe a zzso efficient and zzso zzso method for large-scale electron zzso image zzso The proposed method is able to construct large image mosaics from thousands of smaller, overlapping tiles with unknown or uncertain positions, and to align sections from a serial section capture into a common coordinate zzso The method also accounts for zzso zzso both in constructing sections and in aligning sections to each zzso The underlying zzso are based on the zzso shift property which allows for a zzso efficient and robust zzso We demonstrate results on two electron zzso zzso We also zzso the accuracy of the zzso through a simulated image capture zzso The publicly available software tools include the zzso and a zzso zzso zzso for easy access to the zzso
