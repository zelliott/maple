When zzso zzso cell samples have been collected as a zzso DNA zzso source for an zzso study, whole zzso amplification zzso can be critical to maintain sufficient DNA for zzso We evaluated zzso zzso using zzso from two paired zzso zzso zzso kept in a cell zzso zzso and zzso dried and kept at room temperature for 3 days, and frozen until DNA zzso in a pilot study zzso and from 144 samples collected by mail in a breast cancer zzso zzso success was assessed as the per cent zzso of zzso zzso zzso amplification bias was assessed using quantitative zzso of 23 human zzso The pilot study showed zzso zzso completion but low zzso zzso between zzso zzso and paired blood zzso zzso and zzso for zzso A and B, zzso zzso amplification bias was observed with significantly lower human zzso amplification from zzso B than zzso Using zzso zzso samples from the breast cancer study zzso zzso an independent laboratory demonstrated that increasing template zzso to the zzso reaction improved zzso performance for 49 zzso however, average completion and zzso remained below zzso To reduce zzso zzso when zzso zzso is used, inclusion of paired zzso and/or duplicate zzso samples is critical to monitor data zzso
