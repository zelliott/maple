zzso and normal rabbit zzso samples show a marked difference in chemical composition governed by the water, zzso and protein zzso The strongly overlapping infrared zzso features of the different constituents, and the complexity of the tissue zzso render tissue zzso by direct evaluation of molecular zzso characteristics obtained from zzso zzso or attenuated total zzso zzso zzso virtually zzso We apply zzso analysis and zzso techniques based on partial least squares zzso zzso and linear zzso analysis to zzso zzso data obtained by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with high zzso accuracy during blind zzso Training data are collected from zzso and normal rabbit zzso zzso These results demonstrate the potential of zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso strategies for the zzso identification of normal and zzso zzso zzso The prospect for future zzso measurement concepts is also zzso
