zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso based on blood zzso level dependent zzso signal changes is a sensitive tool for mapping brain zzso but quantitative interpretation of the zzso response is zzso The zzso response is primarily driven by cerebral blood flow zzso changes, but is moderated by M, a zzso zzso reflecting baseline zzso and zzso the ratio of fractional changes in zzso to cerebral zzso rate of oxygen consumption zzso We compared M and zzso between cortical zzso cortex, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso regions using a quantitative approach based on zzso the zzso response with a zzso zzso Although M was similar in both regions zzso differences in zzso zzso in VC and zzso in zzso Cohen zzso produced substantially weaker zzso zzso than cortical zzso responses relative to zzso zzso Because of this strong sensitivity to zzso zzso response zzso cannot be interpreted as a quantitative reflection of underlying zzso changes, particularly when comparing cortical and zzso zzso
