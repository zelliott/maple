Traffic zzso of railroad networks was considered using an zzso that was biologically inspired by an zzso zzso zzso of the true slime mold, zzso zzso The zzso developed a transportation network consisting of a zzso structure to transport zzso It was reported that zzso can find the shortest path zzso multiple food sites during an adaptation process zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 92, zzso By mimicking the adaptation process a path finding zzso was developed by zzso et zzso zzso In this paper, the zzso is newly modified for applications of traffic distribution zzso in transportation networks of infrastructure such as railroads under the constraint that the network zzso is zzso Application of the zzso to a railroad in metropolitan Tokyo, Japan is zzso The results are evaluated using three performance functions related to cost, traveling efficiency, and network zzso The traffic distribution suggests that the modified zzso zzso balances the performances under a certain zzso range, indicating a biological zzso
