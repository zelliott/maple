zzso of contrast agent in zzso zzso has been an important research topic for many zzso Currently available methods are mostly based on the strong zzso scattering of contrast agent zzso These methods selectively extract those parts of the spectrum that show the largest difference in zzso between contrast agent and zzso The method introduced in this paper expands this extraction approach in that it additionally exploits differences in system behavior between tissue and contrast zzso The resonant nature of contrast bubbles implies that the response of a contrast bubble is zzso zzso the response not only depends on the current zzso but also on all previous zzso zzso does not show this dependence on previous zzso Our method is based on a 3 pulse design in which the echoes from 2 zzso zzso are zzso from a third zzso With this method we aim to separate and suppress those parts in an echo signal that originate from tissue while leaving the part originating from contrast bubbles relatively zzso zzso results show increases up to 30 zzso in zzso ratio zzso with this method relative to single pulse zzso This was confirmed in an in zzso experiment that showed an increase of approximately 12 zzso in zzso
