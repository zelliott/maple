We studied the performance of several zzso zzso zzso on eye movement signals recorded in zzso balance and other zzso zzso Despite the wide use of these signals their zzso has not been studied prior to our zzso The zzso methods were based on the common model of using a predictor to zzso the input and using an zzso zzso to zzso the zzso We found that these eye movement signals recorded at 400 zzso and with 13 bit zzso resolution could zzso be compressed with a zzso ratio of about zzso
