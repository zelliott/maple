In this study, the development of an zzso zzso screening zzso binding zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso Using zzso gene delivery of zzso zzso as a fluorescent probe, and a zzso imaging system, a robust zzso zzso that could be used for zzso compound profiling activities was zzso The statistically robust zzso binding zzso was developed through zzso of multiple zzso including cell zzso conditions, zzso expression levels, the image analysis algorithm, and zzso zzso zzso of structurally diverse compounds, including functional zzso zzso zzso and related zzso demonstrated good compound potency correlations between zzso imaging zzso membrane zzso polarization zzso and gene reporter zzso zzso analysis of data from a screening test set of compounds at a single zzso concentration suggested that the zzso imaging zzso binding zzso is amenable for use in hit zzso The zzso zzso zzso was rapidly developed and met statistical zzso performance targets, thus demonstrating its utility as a fluorescent zzso binding zzso suitable for compound screening and zzso
