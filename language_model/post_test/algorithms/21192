To explore the use of zzso heart rate zzso zzso as a predictor of clinical outcomes such as hospital admission, intensive care unit zzso admission and zzso We also implemented an automated zzso signal processing zzso and multiple principal component analysis zzso for zzso 

We conducted a prospective zzso clinical study at an emergency medical services zzso system in a medium sized urban setting in the United zzso zzso zzso data was obtained from a sample of 45 ambulance patients conveyed to a zzso hospital, monitored with a zzso zzso After zzso the data, filtering for noise reduction and zzso zzso beats, various zzso parameters were zzso These included time domain, frequency domain and geometric zzso zzso was performed on the hospital outcomes for these zzso 

We used a combination of zzso zzso age and vital signs such as respiratory rate, zzso and zzso coma score zzso in a zzso zzso For predicting admission to zzso sensitivity was zzso specificity was zzso and negative zzso value zzso was zzso for predicting admission to hospital, sensitivity was zzso specificity was zzso and zzso was zzso for predicting death, sensitivity was zzso specificity was zzso and zzso was zzso There was also a significant correlation of several zzso parameters with length of hospital zzso 

With signal processing techniques, it is feasible to filter and analyze ambulance zzso data for zzso We found a combination of zzso parameters and traditional zzso zzso to have an association with clinical outcomes in zzso zzso This may have potential as a zzso tool for ambulance zzso
