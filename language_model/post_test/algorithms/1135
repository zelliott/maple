In conventional zzso strain is estimated from the zzso of the displacement zzso zzso The displacement estimates involve zzso the peak location of the zzso function between matching zzso and zzso zzso zzso errors in zzso the peak location of the zzso function, amplified by the zzso operation on the displacement estimates zzso for the zzso of the zzso could result in values of zzso zzso ratio zzso that exceed the theoretical upper bounds, thereby hindering a consistent interpretation of this zzso These zzso errors have not been accounted for by the zzso We propose the use of the measured correlation zzso in the theoretical zzso expressions to estimate the zzso rather than computing them directly from the zzso This methodology results in values of zzso that are lower than the theoretical upper bounds, thereby avoiding the problems associated with computing zzso directly from the zzso Using simulated models of zzso elastic zzso a proof of principle of such an zzso measure is zzso
