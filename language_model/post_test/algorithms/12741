In order to address problems such as aging, cell death, and cancer, it is important to understand the mechanisms behind reactions causing DNA zzso One specific reaction implicated in DNA zzso damage is zzso zzso attack on zzso zzso and other zzso acid zzso The zzso reaction has been studied zzso but there are few theoretical zzso In the present study, zzso zzso at various sites, and the zzso surfaces for these zzso are investigated zzso Four zzso complexes zzso have been found, with binding energies relative to zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These four zzso complexes lead to six transition states, which in turn lie zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso below zzso zzso Thus the lowest lying zzso complex faces the highest local barrier to formation of the product zzso Between the transition states and the products lie six product zzso zzso the same order as the zzso complexes, the product complexes zzso lie at zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, again relative to separated zzso All six zzso zzso zzso pathways are zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The transition state for zzso at zzso lies at the lowest energy zzso zzso zzso relative to zzso and thus reaction is likely to occur at this zzso This theoretical prediction zzso with the observed high zzso of OH zzso with the zzso group of aromatic zzso However, the high barrier zzso zzso zzso for reaction at the zzso site makes zzso zzso zzso This last result is consistent with experimental observation of the zzso ring opening upon OH radical addition to zzso In addition, zzso zzso electronic transitions of the zzso product around zzso zzso confirm that this is the most likely site for hydrogen abstraction by zzso zzso
