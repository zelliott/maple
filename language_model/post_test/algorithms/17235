To compare the detection of zzso zzso syndrome zzso in lung transplant recipients by clinic pulmonary function laboratory measurement and home zzso 

The subjects served as their own control zzso 

A zzso zzso transplant zzso 

zzso lung transplant recipients zzso women and 19 zzso average zzso zzso age, zzso years old at the time of zzso Lung function declined to at least zzso stage 1 in 17 of the 45 zzso 

All subjects were participants in a home monitoring program utilizing home zzso zzso Clinic zzso and home zzso zzso were collected zzso The zzso of zzso staging were based on home and clinic zzso values using retrospective analysis and development of the home-based zzso staging zzso 

zzso stage 1 was detected an average of zzso to 276 days earlier with home zzso than with clinic pulmonary function testing in the 17 subjects who had a pulmonary decline to zzso stage 1, depending on the persistence of the decline (1 day or 3 days, zzso The difference in zzso detection time was statistically significant for both persistence requirements zzso zzso zzso 

Home zzso detects pulmonary decline earlier than clinic zzso home zzso can be a reliable and safe alternative to frequent pulmonary function testing in lung zzso
