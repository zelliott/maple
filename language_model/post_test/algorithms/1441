This study sought to compare acute zzso changes and late zzso narrowing during and after zzso zzso balloon zzso measured by quantitative coronary zzso with the immediate and long-term outcome of balloon zzso zzso 

Although zzso laser coronary zzso is used as an adjunct or alternative to balloon zzso limited comparative data exist regarding the immediate and long-term efficacy of zzso zzso balloon zzso versus balloon zzso zzso 

A series of 53 zzso in 47 consecutive patients successfully treated with zzso zzso balloon zzso were individually matched after completion of zzso follow-up zzso with 53 successfully treated balloon zzso zzso according to vessel location, zzso minimal zzso diameter and reference zzso Immediate and long-term zzso results were assessed by an automated zzso zzso detection zzso 

Before intervention in the laser and balloon zzso groups, respectively, minimal zzso diameter zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and reference diameter was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was followed by zzso balloon zzso in 50 zzso Mean balloon diameter at zzso inflation was similar in both treatment groups zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively), resulting in similar minimal zzso diameters after intervention of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At follow-up zzso minimal zzso diameter after zzso zzso balloon zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and that after balloon zzso alone was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso rates at follow-up using the 50% diameter zzso zzso criterion were 57% and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso analysis of a matched group of 106 successfully treated coronary zzso showed a similar immediate outcome but reduced long-term efficacy of zzso zzso balloon zzso compared with that after balloon zzso zzso
