DNA sequencing by zzso zzso zzso errors in the zzso zzso Some of them are random and disappear when the experiment is zzso Others are zzso involving repetitions in the zzso of the target zzso A good method for solving zzso problems must deal with both types of zzso In this work we propose a new hybrid genetic zzso for zzso and standard sequencing that incorporates the concept of structured zzso The zzso is then compared with other methods designed for handling errors that arise in standard and zzso zzso zzso DNA sequences used for testing are taken from zzso The set of instances for testing was divided into two zzso The first group consisted of sequences containing positive and negative errors in the spectrum, at a rate of up to zzso excluding errors coming from zzso The second group consisted of sequences containing repeated zzso and containing additional errors up to zzso added into the zzso Our new method zzso the best alternative procedures for both data zzso Moreover, the method produces solutions exhibiting extremely high degree of similarity to the target sequences in the cases without zzso which is an important outcome for zzso The zzso prepared from the sequences taken from zzso are available on our zzso zzso
