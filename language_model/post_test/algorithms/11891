Treatment planning for radiation therapy is a zzso zzso zzso Here we present a machine intelligent scheme for treatment planning based on zzso decision analysis zzso and genetic zzso zzso zzso zzso ranking strategies are represented in the zzso metric under the displaced ideal zzso Goal setting, protocol zzso and fuzzy ranking of objective importance can be incorporated into the decision scheme to zzso clinical decision zzso For distance measures in the zzso zzso a dynamic gauge function is defined based on the state energy of the decision system, which is assumed to undergo zzso cooling with iteration zzso The zzso scheme interacts with a robust zzso engine, which zzso zzso in the zzso landscape that defines the treatment plan zzso A conventionally challenging case of zzso zzso of a brain zzso was selected for zzso zzso The resulting dose zzso are compared to zzso plans, which are commonly regarded as clinically relevant and zzso zzso The zzso plans achieve substantially better sparing of critical normal zzso surrounding the brain zzso while respecting the zzso constraints on tumor dose zzso In addition, machine zzso tends to produce novel treatment strategies which zzso expert zzso The run time for producing an optimal plan is considerably shorter than the typical planning time for human experts, thus zzso can also be used to aid the human treatment planning zzso In prostate zzso zzso was specifically applied to zzso conditions in which typical surgical uncertainties in seed implant positioning occur, where noisy objectives were introduced into the zzso zzso The noisy system is found to be manageable by zzso at uncertainty levels corresponding to reasonably zzso surgery zzso In contrast, noisy objectives would be very difficult to explore by human expert zzso Potential use of noisy zzso with time series analysis is being explored for zzso computer guidance in the operating room for prostate seed zzso In conclusion, the combination of zzso and zzso zzso offers both a solution to practical treatment planning tasks and the potential for real time applications in zzso
