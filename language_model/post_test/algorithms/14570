zzso acid selective zzso zzso method not only provides information about the interface of a protein assembly by the spin relaxation experiment, but also identifies the zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso which are located close to the selectively labeled zzso acid zzso in the donor zzso Here, a new method was developed to build a precise structural model of a protein zzso which zzso the experimental zzso values, using simulated zzso zzso This method was applied to the zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso complex to build a precise complex structure compatible with that determined by X-ray zzso
