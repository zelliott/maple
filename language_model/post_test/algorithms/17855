The excited states of the water zzso have been analyzed by using the extended zzso multistate zzso method, zzso zzso in conjunction with large zzso basis sets of atomic natural zzso zzso The study includes 13 zzso and zzso excited states, both zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso series zzso to the lowest zzso potential and the zzso and zzso members zzso to the second zzso state of the zzso 1 zzso The research has been focused on the analysis of the zzso or zzso character of the zzso zzso The zzso of the 1 zzso state of water at different zzso indicates that it has a zzso zzso character at the equilibrium geometry of the zzso but it becomes progressively a zzso state described mainly by the zzso zzso promotion, as expected from a textbook of general chemistry, upon zzso of the zzso zzso The described zzso mixing is established to be originated by a molecular zzso zzso zzso process, as suggested earlier by zzso zzso Mulliken zzso zzso zzso 9, 7 zzso The same phenomenon occurs also for the 1 zzso state whereas a more complex behavior has been determined for the 2 zzso state, where both zzso zzso and zzso mixing take zzso Similar conclusions have been obtained for the zzso states of the zzso
