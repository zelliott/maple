zzso detection is critically important for accurate functional zzso and has been widely used to facilitate studies on comparative and evolutionary zzso Although various methods are now available, there has been no comprehensive analysis of performance, due to the lack of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Even in the absence of such zzso the comparison of results from alternative zzso contains useful information, as agreement enhances confidence and disagreement indicates possible zzso zzso Class Analysis zzso is a statistical technique that can exploit this information to reasonably zzso sensitivities and zzso and is applied here to evaluate the performance of various zzso detection methods on a zzso zzso Overall, we observe a zzso between sensitivity and specificity in zzso zzso with zzso methods characterized by high sensitivity, and zzso methods by high zzso Two zzso exhibit the best overall balance, with both sensitivity and zzso zzso identifies zzso across two species while zzso clusters zzso from multiple zzso Among methods that permit zzso of zzso groups spanning multiple zzso the zzso zzso zzso exhibits better zzso consistency with respect to protein function and domain architecture than the zzso zzso zzso database, and the zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso By way of using zzso we are also able to zzso assess similarities and statistical dependence between various strategies, and evaluate the effects of zzso settings on zzso In zzso we present a comprehensive evaluation of zzso detection on a divergent set of zzso zzso thus providing insights and guides for method selection, tuning and development for different zzso Many biological questions have been addressed by multiple tests yielding zzso zzso outcomes but no clear definition of truth, making zzso an attractive approach for zzso zzso
