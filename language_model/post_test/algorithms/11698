Using the zzso functional approach, we study the global stability of a class of neural networks with distributed zzso Without assuming the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso functions and symmetry of the zzso zzso we give some new sufficient conditions on the existence, uniqueness and global zzso stability of the equilibrium zzso Our results improve, extend and complement some existing zzso
