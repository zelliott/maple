The frequency distribution of a fitness function over regions of its domain is an important quantity for understanding the behavior of zzso that employ zzso sampling to search the zzso In general, exactly characterizing this distribution is at least as hard as the search problem, since the solutions typically live in the tails of the zzso However, in some cases it is possible to efficiently retrieve a collection of quantities (called zzso that describe the zzso In this paper, we consider functions of bounded zzso that are defined over zzso strings from a finite alphabet of zzso zzso Many problems in zzso zzso can be specified as search problems over functions of this zzso zzso zzso analysis of functions over finite groups, we derive an efficient method for computing the exact moments of the frequency distribution of fitness functions over zzso regions of the zzso zzso We then use this approach to derive equations that describe the expected fitness of the offspring of any point undergoing uniform zzso The results we present provide insight into the statistical structure of the fitness function for a number of zzso zzso For the graph coloring problem, we apply our results to efficiently zzso the average number of constraint violations that lie within a certain number of steps of any zzso We derive an expression for the zzso rate that zzso the expected fitness of an offspring at each fitness zzso We also apply the results to the slightly more complex frequency assignment problem, a relevant application in the domain of the telecommunications zzso As with the graph coloring problem, we provide formulas for the average value of the fitness function in zzso regions around a solution and the zzso zzso zzso
