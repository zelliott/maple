In this paper, the problem of zzso synchronization for zzso jump neural networks with zzso delay and variable zzso is zzso In the framework of the input delay approach and the linear zzso inequality technique, two zzso criteria are derived to ensure the zzso stability of the error systems, and thus, the master systems zzso zzso with the slave zzso The desired zzso controller is zzso which depends upon the maximum sampling zzso The effectiveness and potential of the obtained results is verified by two simulation zzso
