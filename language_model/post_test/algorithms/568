The successful folding of a zzso protein after expression and zzso is essential for zzso zzso and vaccination zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein is a promising vaccine candidate against zzso In the present study, the folding of zzso zzso protein has been evaluated by web based zzso tools that predict protein zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a simple indication of proper protein zzso has been used to determine whether zzso zzso protein is likely to be zzso The results indicate that the zzso zzso protein is predicted to be folded by most of the web based zzso zzso Moreover, in zzso zzso experiments, the zzso zzso which was zzso to zzso without the use of zzso gives rise to a discrete band pattern that is indicative of a folded zzso Together, the results suggest that zzso zzso protein is in a folded zzso suitable for zzso zzso and vaccination zzso
