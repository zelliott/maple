The objective of the paper is to describe an automatic zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso based on parameters extracted from zzso traces with no zzso zzso zzso The modular automatic zzso zzso for zzso diagnosis is developed and evaluated with different zzso zzso 

The database used in this study was provided by zzso for The zzso in zzso Challenge zzso Each zzso file in this database was translated into a 48 zzso zzso The modular zzso zzso used for zzso diagnosis was based on the nearest zzso Several zzso options were evaluated to zzso the zzso zzso 

Different zzso of the proposed modular zzso zzso were zzso The zzso approach achieved a top zzso rate value of zzso A zzso approach was configured using the 5 parameters with highest discrimination power, and a top zzso rate of zzso was zzso different functions to zzso the parameters were zzso Finally, two automatic zzso scanning strategies, Forward and zzso methods, were zzso The results obtained with these approaches achieved a top zzso rate of zzso 

A modular zzso zzso based on the nearest zzso was zzso The zzso performance of the zzso was evaluated using different zzso zzso zzso functions and number of zzso The automatic zzso scanning techniques achieved much better results than previously tested zzso
