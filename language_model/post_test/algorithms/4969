We assessed whether quantitative analysis of zzso flow zzso zzso is able to identify zzso zzso abnormalities in zzso and whether zzso analysis can detect changes not zzso using the zzso index zzso zzso zzso patients with no conventional cardiovascular risk factors, major organ involvement or zzso were compared to 32 zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained from the zzso artery zzso central retinal artery zzso and common carotid artery zzso The zzso were zzso using zzso decomposition and compared between groups at each zzso zzso The zzso was also zzso The zzso was comparable between zzso In the zzso and zzso there were significant differences in the lower frequency zzso components zzso zzso zzso for each zzso No differences were apparent in the CA between zzso zzso analysis of zzso flow zzso recorded in proximity of the terminal vascular bed, identified altered zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso structure could not be identified by changes in zzso the traditional measure of downstream vascular zzso This zzso approach to zzso analysis is more sensitive in detecting zzso zzso abnormalities in zzso It may hold potential as a useful tool for assessing disease activity, response to treatment, and predicting future vascular zzso
