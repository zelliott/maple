Key to successful protein structure prediction is a potential that recognizes the native state from zzso zzso Recent advances in empirical zzso based on known protein structures include improved reference states for assessing random zzso zzso pair zzso zzso for describing secondary or zzso structural preferences and, most importantly, zzso protocols that zzso the energy landscape to enhance the correlation between zzso features and the zzso zzso zzso zzso that select zzso structures on the basis of cluster density also resulted in greater prediction zzso For zzso zzso these advances allowed improvement in predicted structures relative to their initial template alignments over a wide range of zzso zzso This represents significant progress and suggests applications to zzso structure zzso
