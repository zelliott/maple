This study produced simple linear zzso equations to be used for mixed zzso space analysis for males and zzso and sexes pooled in a population living in northeastern zzso zzso of teeth were made to within zzso zzso on the dental casts of 215 boys and 215 girls zzso age zzso zzso All zzso were required to be free of any signs of dental pathology or zzso It was found that males had significantly larger teeth than females as represented by zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso indicated a close relationship between zzso zzso zzso and corresponding zzso of canine and zzso The low zzso of determination zzso of the zzso ranged between zzso and zzso and were higher for females than zzso which might be attributable to the ethnic diversity of the sampled zzso The zzso equations produced predictions of zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso and zzso arch segments that were slightly different from other reported Asian zzso zzso prediction tables at the 50th zzso were found to zzso tooth size zzso compared with the present zzso The predictions from simplified zzso equations matched well with those of this study for sexes zzso and for males and females zzso
