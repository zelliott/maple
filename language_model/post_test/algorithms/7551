zzso zzso zzso is a variety of zzso in which the label is continuous in the data, but the goal is to zzso data into classes that are a set of zzso ranges and can be organized in a zzso In the zzso the ranges at the lower levels are more specific and inherently more difficult to zzso whereas the ranges at the upper levels are less specific and inherently easier to zzso zzso both prediction specificity and prediction accuracy must be considered when building a decision tree zzso from this kind of zzso This paper proposes a novel zzso zzso for learning zzso zzso from data with structured continuous zzso This approach considers the distribution of labels throughout the zzso structure during the construction of trees without requiring zzso in the zzso zzso We compared the results of the proposed method with those of the zzso zzso using eight real data zzso The empirical results indicate that the proposed method zzso the zzso zzso with regard to prediction zzso prediction zzso and zzso zzso
