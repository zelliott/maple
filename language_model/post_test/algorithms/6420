The increasing use of zzso zzso zzso the development of methods for zzso quality zzso Here, we set forth hurdles to overcome in image analysis of zzso We emphasize the importance of objective data extraction methods resulting in reliable signal zzso Based on statistical principles, we describe a method for automated grid zzso spot zzso background zzso zzso and signal zzso A software application that we call zzso has been implemented for this zzso We identify areas where we improved upon current methods used for array image analysis at each step in the zzso Finally, we give examples to illustrate the performance of our zzso on raw zzso
