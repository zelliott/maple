We have zzso studied the motor zzso zzso in human subjects under rest and motor stimulation conditions using a zzso zzso tissue zzso Our instrument measures optical maps of the cerebral zzso at two zzso zzso and 830 zzso with an acquisition time of 160 zzso per zzso We obtained optical maps of zzso and zzso concentration changes in terms of zzso of folding average, power spectrum and zzso at the stimulation repetition frequency, and the phase synchronization zzso Under periodic motor stimulation conditions, we observed zzso and frequency or phase synchronization of the local zzso changes with zzso Our main findings are the zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso response to the motor stimulation is comparable to the zzso of the fluctuations at zzso zzso The spatial patterns of the zzso and zzso responses to the stimulation are zzso zzso The zzso response to stimulation shows a spatial zzso and a level of phase synchronization with the motor stimulation that depends on the stimulation zzso
