It has recently been shown that robust decoding of motor output from zzso signals in monkeys over prolonged periods of time has become feasible zzso et al 2010 zzso zzso 3 zzso In order to achieve these results, zzso partial zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso uses a set of zzso zzso referred to as zzso to model the relationship between the input and the output data and is known to handle zzso and possibly strongly correlated zzso and zzso zzso We developed a new decoding method called sparse zzso partial least squares zzso which was tested on a subset of the data used in Chao et al zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso et al 2011 PLoS ONE 6 zzso We show that zzso reaches the same decoding performance as zzso using just two sparse components which can each be interpreted as zzso particular combinations of motor zzso Furthermore, the sparse solution afforded by the zzso model allowed us to show the functional involvement of beta and gamma band responses in zzso and motor zzso for predicting the first zzso Based on the literature, we conjecture that this first component is involved in the zzso of movement zzso zzso the sparse and compact representation afforded by the zzso model zzso interpretation of which zzso spatial and zzso components are involved in successful zzso These advantages make the proposed decoding method an important new tool in zzso
