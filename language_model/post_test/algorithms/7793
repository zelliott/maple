zzso zzso has become a popular tool for zzso cortical zzso using zzso zzso Imaging zzso zzso A sometimes ignored issue is, however, that the output of the zzso depends on the initial placement of starting points, and that different sets of starting points therefore could lead to different zzso In this study we explore this zzso We apply zzso zzso a thousand times to the same zzso zzso collected in 10 individuals to segment two brain zzso the zzso on the zzso wall, and the zzso At the level of single subjects, we found that in both brain regions, repeatedly applying zzso indeed often leads to a variety of rather different cortical based zzso By assessing the similarity and frequency of these different solutions, we show that approximately 256 zzso repetitions are needed to accurately estimate the distribution of possible zzso Using zzso group statistics, we then propose a method to employ the zzso of zzso solutions to assess the reliability with which certain zzso can be attributed to a particular zzso In addition, we show that the proportion of zzso that can be attributed significantly to either cluster in the zzso and zzso is relatively higher than in the zzso and discuss how this difference may relate to differences in the anatomy of these zzso
