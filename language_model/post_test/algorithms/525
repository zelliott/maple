In this paper, we describe a new methodology for defining brain zzso zzso in functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso The zzso are defined based on their functional connectivity to other zzso zzso zzso are defined as sets of zzso with similar connectivity patterns to other zzso The method relies on 1) a zzso zzso zzso correlation analysis for identifying zzso correlated signals, which are not due to correlated zzso 2) a test for merging zzso which have similar connectivity patterns to the other zzso and 3) a zzso zzso for assigning zzso to zzso Since our method is fully zzso the extracted zzso and their corresponding time signals are zzso suited for a subsequent brain connectivity zzso
