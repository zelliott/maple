To zzso and zzso assess the presentation of zzso focal zzso zzso zzso at zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso using multiple high b zzso 

Twenty-five patients with 27 zzso had liver zzso at zzso T using zzso acquisition and 3 b values zzso zzso 1000 zzso zzso zzso zzso were evaluated zzso using visual analysis of zzso magnetic resonance zzso images and zzso using conventional apparent diffusion zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

All zzso zzso were visible on zzso zzso zzso 26 of the 27 zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso and 21 of the 27 zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso A total of 18 of the 27 zzso zzso exhibited a zzso central zzso on the zzso zzso images that remained visible on the zzso and zzso zzso images in 6 of the 27 zzso zzso Conventional zzso value of zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso was significantly lower than that of adjacent zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso although a substantial overlap was zzso The use of zzso zzso using the liver as reference organ resulted in a more restricted distribution of zzso values zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso show a wide range of zzso features at zzso using high b zzso Further studies are needed to fully investigate as to what extent zzso zzso may result in better zzso zzso
