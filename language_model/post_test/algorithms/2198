A crucial step in exploiting the information inherent in zzso sequences is to assign to each protein sequence its three-dimensional fold and biological zzso Here we describe fold assignment for the proteins zzso by the small zzso of zzso zzso The assignment was carried out by our computer server zzso zzso zzso which assigns folds to zzso acid sequences by comparing zzso predictions with known zzso Of the total of zzso protein zzso 103 zzso can be assigned a known protein fold with high confidence, as zzso with tests on known zzso Of these zzso 75 zzso show enough sequence similarity to proteins of known structure that they can also be detected by traditional zzso comparison zzso That is, the difference of 28 sequences zzso are zzso by the zzso method of the server but not by current zzso zzso Of the remaining zzso of sequences in the zzso zzso belong to membrane proteins and the remaining zzso cannot be assigned either because these sequences zzso to no presently known fold or because of zzso of the zzso At the current rate of determination of new folds by zzso and zzso methods, zzso suggests that folds will be assigned to most soluble proteins in the next zzso
