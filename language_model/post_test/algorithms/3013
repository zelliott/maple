zzso of zzso contraction is usually obtained by measuring globally cell zzso from the displacement of cell zzso We developed a zzso optical flow method, which zzso the zzso zzso pattern with a precise zzso of the zzso strain wave at the zzso zzso A two-dimensional image correlation analysis of zzso zzso images was developed to extract local cell zzso from zzso zzso zzso Test images, zzso from known intensity displacement fields, were first used to validate the zzso zzso strain fields were then zzso from zzso zzso sequences of single adult and zzso zzso The propagation of the zzso zzso wave during cell contraction has been successfully zzso The zzso patterns of zzso displacement were obtained accurately, even when zzso zzso occurred in pace with zzso Interestingly, the characterization of the successive zzso displacement fields show a direct zzso of the variation with time of zzso strains anywhere in the zzso The proposed method enables a quantitative analysis of zzso contraction without requiring wave tracking with the use of fluorescent calcium zzso Thus, our zzso approach provides a fast and efficient tool for analyzing the correlation between global cell zzso behavior and zzso zzso zzso
