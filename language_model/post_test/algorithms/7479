Breast tumors are zzso zzso zzso zzso presents a major challenge for cancer diagnosis and zzso Few studies have worked on capturing tumor zzso from zzso Most studies to date consider zzso measures for tumor zzso In this work we capture tumor zzso by zzso tumor zzso into zzso and zzso zzso zzso kinetic zzso features from breast dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso to obtain the zzso patterns of the zzso zzso and contrast agent zzso from each zzso Using a genetic zzso for feature selection, and a zzso zzso zzso with leave zzso cross zzso we tested our proposed zzso features for the task of zzso breast cancer recurrence zzso The zzso based on our features gave an zzso zzso of zzso outperforming previously proposed zzso texture, and spatial enhancement zzso features which give zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
