zzso treatment is a radiation therapy delivery technique for zzso zzso treatments on a zzso zzso zzso The zzso fields are created by moving the treatment couch relative to a zzso positioned at fixed zzso zzso The delivered dose distribution is controlled by moving zzso zzso zzso leaves into and out of the fan zzso The purpose of this work was to develop a zzso zzso for creating zzso zzso zzso zzso delivery was modeled using the zzso of a water zzso moving over a collection of zzso The flow rate per unit length of the water from the zzso represented the zzso zzso per unit length along the zzso of the fan zzso the collection of bottles represented the zzso in the treatment planning zzso map, and the volume of water collected in each bottle represented the delivered zzso The radiation zzso per unit length delivered to the target at a given position is given by the zzso of the intensity distribution per unit length over the zzso of the beam and the time per unit distance along the direction of travel that an zzso leaf is zzso The zzso opening times for the desired dose profiles were determined using a technique based on zzso using a genetic zzso The zzso opening times were expanded in terms of a zzso series, and a genetic zzso was used to find the best expansion zzso for a given dose zzso A series of wedge shapes zzso 30, 45, and 60 zzso and zzso zzso test zzso maps were created to test the zzso ability to generate zzso leaf zzso The accuracy of the zzso zzso was measured on a zzso zzso system using zzso film placed at depth in water equivalent zzso The measured dose profiles were compared with the desired dose zzso The agreement was within zzso zzso or 2 zzso zzso zzso in the high dose zzso regions for all test zzso The central axis measured dose was between zzso and zzso higher than the expected dose for the wedge zzso For the zzso zzso test cases, the calculated and measured doses agreed to within zzso zzso at the peak and within zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso produced deliverable dose zzso that agreed well with the calculated dose zzso This delivery technique could be used for treatment of whole intact zzso However, additional work is needed to further improve the zzso in order to get better agreement between the zzso zzso and measured dose zzso
