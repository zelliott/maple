Brain single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images acquired after injecting zzso into the internal carotid artery zzso during an zzso zzso procedure zzso zzso provide anatomical information on the blood flow distribution from the zzso In this study, zzso maps of the distribution of blood supply from the zzso were developed using the zzso zzso zzso Twenty-two sets of zzso and zzso zzso were collected from an existing zzso zzso zzso images were zzso to zzso zzso images, and spatial zzso parameters used for zzso zzso images were zzso to zzso zzso for anatomical zzso Pixel counts of zzso zzso images were then zzso and the zzso map of cerebral zzso distribution zzso zzso zzso for each zzso was determined by averaging the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso maps representing the extent of zzso territory zzso zzso zzso were also composed by averaging the zzso images obtained by zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso maps were used to zzso cerebral zzso and reserve change after zzso bypass surgery in 10 patients with zzso zzso In the zzso zzso blood supply from the zzso was found to be most likely in the zzso frontal zzso the zzso portion of the zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso Of the zzso regions, the zzso was found to be most likely to derive its blood supply from zzso In patients with cerebral zzso disease, improvements in zzso zzso and zzso reserve in the zzso zzso territory were well identified and were increased by zzso and zzso respectively, on zzso The zzso maps developed in this study illustrate the zzso distribution and extent of vascular territory for zzso and would be useful for objective evaluations of zzso status in cerebrovascular zzso
