Transformation zzso is a powerful concept for designing novel optical components such as high transmission zzso and zzso zzso The selection of specific transformations is a zzso zzso Here we reveal that transformations which allow for all zzso and broadband optical zzso zzso to zzso of elastic energy zzso for extreme values of the mechanical zzso ratio zzso For TE zzso polarized light an zzso transformation zzso zzso 1/2 is ideal and for TM zzso polarized light one should use a zzso transformation with negative zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso For the TM polarization the mechanical zzso zzso to a modified zzso functional known from the transformation zzso zzso Finally, the zzso between ideal transformations and solid mechanical material models zzso and zzso the concept of transformation zzso
