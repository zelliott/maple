We propose novel zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso have been compared with the duration of the zzso zzso intervals and other ratios in 17 normal subjects and 17 patients with old zzso zzso In the intervals and other ratios, the best separation between groups is obtained with the zzso and zzso ratios with zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso the proposed ratios increased sensitivity to zzso and specificity to zzso These zzso should be further tested to determine their usefulness in discriminating between zzso patients with and without zzso to zzso zzso
