A zzso alignment model zzso is proposed for alignment of liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso belongs to the category of zzso approaches, which are composed of two major zzso a zzso function and a set of mapping zzso zzso zzso of these functions is crucial for good alignment zzso zzso uses zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso methods to draw zzso on the model parameters and improves on existing zzso alignment methods through 1) the zzso of an efficient zzso zzso and 2) an zzso selection of zzso A block zzso zzso that zzso the problem of the zzso zzso getting stuck at local modes of the zzso distribution is used for the update of the mapping function zzso In addition, a zzso search variable selection zzso methodology is used to determine the number and positions of zzso We applied zzso to a simulated data set, an zzso zzso data set, and two zzso zzso data sets, and compared its performance with the zzso zzso curve registration zzso model, the dynamic zzso zzso model, and the continuous profile model zzso The advantage of applying appropriate zzso retention time correction prior to performing a zzso approach is also demonstrated through the zzso data zzso
