Even though frequency analysis of body sway is widely applied in clinical studies, the lack of standardized procedures concerning power spectrum zzso may provide unreliable zzso zzso tests were applied to 35 subjects zzso years, zzso zzso zzso zzso and the power spectral density function was estimated for the zzso center of pressure time zzso The median frequency was compared between power zzso estimated according to signal zzso sampling rate, test zzso and zzso zzso The median frequency reliability for different test zzso was assessed using the zzso correlation zzso When increasing number of zzso zzso test duration or applying linear zzso the median frequency values increased significantly up to zzso Even the shortest test duration provided reliable estimates as observed with the zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso for a single zzso zzso Clinical assessment of balance may benefit from a standardized protocol for center of pressure spectral analysis that provides an adequate relationship between resolution and zzso An zzso to estimate center of pressure power density spectrum is also zzso
