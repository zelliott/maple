zzso gene expression analysis of zzso brain tissue offers unique opportunities for investigating genetic mechanisms of psychiatric and neurodegenerative zzso On the other hand zzso data analysis associated with these studies is a challenging zzso In this publication we address the issue of low zzso quality data and corresponding data analysis zzso 

A detailed analysis of effects of post chip zzso quality on the measured abundance of transcripts is zzso zzso zzso zzso data zzso and zzso derived from ten different brain regions was zzso Post chip zzso quality being assessed by zzso ratio of zzso genes was found to introduce a well pronounced systematic noise into the measured transcript expression zzso According to this study zzso quality effects zzso 1) a zzso component which is introduced by the technology and 2) a systematic component which depends on the features of the transcripts and zzso Random components mainly account for numerous negative correlations of zzso zzso These negative correlations are not zzso and are mainly introduced by an increased relative level of zzso Three major contributors to the systematic noise component were zzso the first is the probe set distribution, the second is the length of zzso species, and the third is the stability of zzso zzso Positive correlations reflect the zzso to zzso direction of zzso degradation whereas negative correlations result from the zzso increase in stable and zzso zzso zzso zzso components affect the expressed transcripts by introducing irrelevant gene correlations and can strongly influence the results of the main zzso A linear model correcting the effect of zzso quality on measured zzso was zzso In addition the contribution of a number of zzso and zzso attributes to the overall detected zzso quality effect was zzso Brain zzso duration of zzso stage, zzso zzso before sampling and donor's age of death within considered limits were found to have no significant zzso 

Basic conclusions for data analysis in expression profiling study are as zzso 1) testing for zzso quality dependency should be included in the zzso of the zzso 2) investigating zzso correlation without regard to zzso quality effects could be zzso 3) data zzso procedures relying on zzso genes either do not influence the correlation structure (if zzso zzso are zzso or increase it for zzso correlated transcripts (if zzso or median zzso are included in zzso zzso 4) sample sets should be matched with regard to zzso zzso 5) zzso zzso is more sensitive to zzso quality effect, than zzso zzso
