We present a zzso and zzso scheme that is zzso both in the sense of representing the environment with high accuracy only locally and in the sense of addressing the vehicle zzso and dynamic constraints only zzso The proposed scheme uses zzso zzso cell zzso efficiently generated using the zzso zzso The zzso transform is widely used in signal and image processing, with emerging applications in autonomous sensing and perception zzso The proposed motion planner enables the simultaneous use of the zzso transform in both the perception and in the zzso layers of vehicle zzso thus potentially reducing online zzso We rigorously prove the zzso of the proposed zzso zzso and we provide zzso simulation results to illustrate its zzso
