zzso an accurate cumulative dose through individual zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso images from the lung is zzso Although the dose distribution of different zzso is similar, copying the dose distribution of one phase directly to another phase would yield a zzso error of approximately zzso without further zzso To reduce the zzso error, three-dimensional zzso elastic zzso image registration zzso was used to quickly obtain a relatively accurate cumulative dose of zzso images acquired from ten lung cancer zzso The dose distribution of the zzso phase was mapped to the zzso phase using zzso The mapped dose in the zzso phase was then compared with the directly copied dose by analysis zzso and the zzso The results showed that zzso using zzso was significantly better in the average pass rate (by zzso Our results indicate it is feasible to map the dose distribution of zzso images in lung with zzso and that the motion zzso of individual respiratory and different zzso zzso affect the differences between the mapped and actual zzso
