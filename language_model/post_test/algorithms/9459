To determine the rankings of 6 zzso functions for understanding zzso zzso and high-level speech in zzso babble without manipulating volume control for listeners with normal hearing, flat zzso hearing loss, and mildly zzso zzso hearing zzso 

Peak zzso zzso limiting, and 4 wide dynamic range zzso zzso zzso functions were compared in a zzso zzso zzso among the zzso characteristics were zzso Speech and babble were processed and recorded at 3 input zzso 45, 65, and 90 zzso sound pressure zzso Speech recognition of 3 groups of listeners zzso zzso zzso was tested for speech processed by each zzso function and at each input zzso 

zzso functions that made low-level speech audible and high-level speech less distorted by avoiding peak clipping or severe zzso yielded higher speech recognition zzso These results are consistent with previous findings in the zzso 

zzso with the low zzso ratio region extended to a high input level or with a high zzso limiting threshold were the best for speech recognition in babble when the hearing aid user cannot or does not want to manipulate the volume zzso Future studies on zzso preferences of different zzso functions are zzso
