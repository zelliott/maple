zzso zzso technologies such as DNA pooling and DNA zzso mean that zzso screens are now practical for complex disease gene discovery using association zzso Because it is currently zzso to use all available zzso a subset is typically selected on the basis of required zzso zzso Restricting markers to those within zzso zzso features of interest zzso genes or zzso or within zzso regions, reduces workload and cost while retaining much zzso We have designed a program zzso that exploits zzso assembly data to create lists of markers correlated with other zzso zzso zzso lists are generated at a zzso spacing and can target features with a zzso zzso zzso are in base pairs or linkage zzso units zzso as derived from the International zzso data, which is useful for association studies and zzso zzso may be selected on the basis of zzso and source database, and single zzso zzso zzso markers may additionally be selected on the basis of validation zzso The import function means the method can be used for any zzso features such as zzso zzso long zzso elements zzso or zzso repeats in humans, and is also functional for other species with equivalent zzso The program and source code is freely available at zzso
