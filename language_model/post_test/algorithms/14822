This paper addresses the problem of accurate and robust tracking of zzso human body pose from depth image zzso zzso the large number of degrees of freedom in human body movements from a depth image sequence is challenging due to the need to resolve the depth ambiguity caused by zzso and the difficulty to recover from tracking zzso Human body poses could be estimated through model fitting using dense zzso between depth data and an articulated human model zzso zzso zzso Although it usually achieves a high accuracy due to dense zzso it may fail to recover from tracking zzso zzso human pose may be reconstructed by detecting and tracking human body anatomical landmarks zzso based on low-level depth image zzso While this method zzso based zzso is robust and recovers from tracking failure, its pose zzso accuracy depends solely on zzso zzso accuracy of zzso To address these limitations, we present a flexible zzso framework for zzso pose zzso results obtained by methods based on zzso and local zzso Experimental results are shown and performance comparison is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed zzso
