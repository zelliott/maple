A general approach to zzso examinations of association between marker zzso and traits is zzso The approach is based on computing p values by comparing test statistics for association to their conditional zzso given the minimal sufficient statistic under the zzso hypothesis for the genetic model, sampling plan and population zzso The approach can be applied with any test zzso so any kind of zzso and zzso markers may be zzso and zzso may be included in zzso By virtue of the zzso the approach results in correct type I error probabilities regardless of population zzso the true genetic model and the sampling zzso An zzso for computing the conditional zzso is zzso and the results of the zzso for zzso of nuclear families are zzso The zzso is zzso with all pedigree structures and all patterns of missing marker zzso zzso
