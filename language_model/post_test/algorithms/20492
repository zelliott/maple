The zzso motor system chiefly employs motor unit recruitment and rate coding to zzso muscle force zzso In this paper, we studied how the recruitment of new motor units altered the firing rate of zzso motor units during precision force production in the first zzso zzso zzso Six healthy adults performed zzso increasing zzso voluntary zzso while motor unit activity and force output were zzso After motor unit zzso were identified, motor unit firing rates were calculated before and after the instances of new motor unit zzso Three procedures were applied to zzso motor unit firing rate, including the mean of a fixed number of zzso intervals and the constant zzso weighted zzso window filter method, as well as a modified zzso zzso In contrast to previous reports, the analysis of the firing rates of over 200 motor units revealed that reduction of the active firing rates was not a common mechanism used to accommodate the zzso force produced by the recruitment of a new motor zzso Similarly, during zzso there was no tendency for motor unit firing rates to increase immediately following the zzso of activity in other motor zzso zzso consistency in recruitment behavior was observed during repeated zzso However, firing rates during repeated zzso demonstrated considerably more zzso It is concluded that the zzso system does not use short-term preferential motor unit zzso to effect precise regulation of muscular force zzso
