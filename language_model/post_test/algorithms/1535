The study of plant biology in the 21st century is, and will continue to be, vastly different from that in the 20th zzso One driver for this has been the use of zzso methods to reveal the genetic zzso for not one but dozens of plant species, as well as resolving zzso differences in thousands of individuals at the population zzso zzso technology has advanced substantially since publication of the first plant zzso zzso that of zzso zzso in zzso Plant zzso researchers have readily embraced new zzso technologies and approaches to generate zzso zzso and zzso zzso for model and crop species that have permitted deep zzso into plant zzso Challenges in sequencing any zzso include zzso zzso and zzso all which are amplified in plant zzso compared to animal zzso due to the large zzso sizes, high repetitive sequence content, and rampant zzso or zzso zzso zzso The ability to generate de zzso zzso zzso provides an alternative approach to bypass these complex zzso and access the gene space of these recalcitrant zzso The field of zzso is driven by technological improvements in sequencing zzso however, software and zzso development has lagged behind reductions in sequencing costs, improved zzso and quality zzso It is anticipated that sequencing platforms will continue to improve the length and quality of zzso and that the complementary zzso and zzso software needed to handle large, repetitive zzso will zzso The future is bright for an exponential improvement in our understanding of plant zzso
