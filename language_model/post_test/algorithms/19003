In this paper, an improved zzso for the extraction of zzso signal from the zzso zzso in home zzso is zzso The whole system consists of zzso zzso acquisition using zzso textile zzso located in bed, baseline fluctuation zzso zzso zzso adjustment of sudden change in zzso area using moving average, and optimal lead zzso In order to solve the problems of previous zzso for the zzso zzso zzso signal zzso we are proposing a method for the optimal lead zzso An optimal zzso signal among the three zzso signals derived from each lead (and zzso of their zzso is selected by zzso the instantaneous frequency using the zzso zzso and then choosing the signal with minimum variation of the instantaneous zzso The proposed zzso was tested on 15 male subjects, and we obtained satisfactory zzso signals that showed high correlation zzso zzso zzso with the signal acquired from the zzso zzso zzso
