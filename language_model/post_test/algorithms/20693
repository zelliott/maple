The reduction of zzso zzso is a major barrier that has to be overcome in protein folding and zzso Changes in zzso zzso are also a major zzso Recent advances include clarification of the fundamental issues concerning the separation of zzso into zzso the treatment of association zzso in zzso and the role of size and shape effects in zzso zzso Advances in the application of zzso calculations include an emerging consensus for estimates of backbone and zzso zzso loss in protein folding via use of zzso intensive methods for zzso and use of the expanding zzso zzso
