The recently introduced fully automated protein zzso structure determination zzso zzso yields, without any human intervention, a three-dimensional zzso protein structure starting from a set of two- and three-dimensional zzso zzso This paper investigates the influence of reduced sets of experimental zzso on the quality of zzso structures obtained with zzso In a case study using the zzso zzso domain 2 from the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso five reduced data sets selected from the full set of 13 three-dimensional zzso of the previously determined conventional structure were used to calculate the protein zzso Three reduced data sets zzso only zzso and zzso for the backbone assignments and two data sets used only zzso All, some, or none of the five original zzso assignment zzso were zzso zzso were compared with those of a zzso calculation for the complete set of zzso and those of the conventionally determined zzso In four of the five cases tested, the three-dimensional structures deviated by less than zzso A in backbone zzso from the conventionally determined zzso zzso reference structure, showing that the zzso zzso is remarkably stable and accurate when used with reduced sets of input zzso
