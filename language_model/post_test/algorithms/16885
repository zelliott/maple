To zzso compare a zzso zzso zzso material dose zzso zzso zzso reconstructed with zzso reconstruction zzso zzso at standard tube zzso reconstructed with filtered back projection zzso and zzso material dose during liver dynamic zzso 

Twenty-five patients with liver zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso One hundred zzso zzso zzso zzso with standard contrast material dose of 600 zzso of zzso per zzso zzso zzso and 80 zzso with zzso material dose of 450 zzso of zzso per zzso zzso zzso CT image sets were reconstructed by using zzso zzso and that of using zzso zzso with a zzso blend of zzso reconstruction at zzso image set zzso zzso zzso obtained during 3 zzso zzso were subjected to quantitative and qualitative zzso 

The mean radiation dose and the contrast medium dose were significantly lower under protocols B and C than under protocol zzso In all zzso zzso all zzso and zzso ratios were greater under protocol C than under other protocols at all zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that image noise and diagnostic zzso were significantly higher under protocol zzso 

In all zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso material dose CT with zzso zzso yielded better contrast enhancement and image quality than a standard tube zzso standard contrast material dose CT with zzso in thin adult zzso
