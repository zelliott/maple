zzso spectrum disorders are associated with social and emotional deficits, the zzso of which are not well zzso A growing consensus is that the zzso nervous system serves a key role in emotional zzso by providing zzso signals essential to zzso zzso We hypothesized that altered zzso processing is related to the zzso deficits in zzso spectrum zzso Here, we investigated the relationship between zzso skin zzso response, an objective index of sympathetic neural activity, and brain fluctuations during rest in zzso adults with zzso spectrum disorder relative to zzso zzso Compared with control participants, individuals with zzso spectrum disorder showed less skin zzso responses zzso They also showed weaker correlations between skin zzso responses and frontal brain regions, including the anterior zzso and anterior insular zzso Additionally, skin zzso responses were found to have less contribution to default mode network connectivity in individuals with zzso spectrum disorders relative to zzso These results suggest that zzso processing is altered in zzso spectrum disorders, which may be related to the abnormal zzso zzso that characterize this zzso
