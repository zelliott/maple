zzso evoked zzso were recorded in 360 zzso spaced sites, in a volume zzso the lateral zzso zzso transition of zzso rats, in order to calculate the electric field zzso distribution with each moment in time referenced to the onset of sound zzso zzso to conduct calculations and zzso zzso and hardware, to minimize neural damage upon recording, were developed in our zzso Our results indicate a smooth transition of both zzso and direction of zzso suggestive of zzso activated sites with outward and inward zzso currents coherent with what is known of this part of the primary auditory zzso That is, anatomical sites zzso zzso and zzso for zzso matches previous research of the auditory pathway, while adding a real time perspective to the anatomical zzso recruited during the auditory evoked zzso An zzso for calculating the divergent of the zzso field, an estimate of the current source density inside the three-dimensional control volume, was used to zzso the possible current sinks and sources generating the field zzso This technique allowed a clear zzso of two distinct zzso arising from the lateral zzso towards the inferior zzso thus recording signal zzso as a movie file, with zzso zzso time zzso
