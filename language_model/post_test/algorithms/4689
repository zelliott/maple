An alert algorithm, based on zzso zzso monitoring, has been incorporated into a cardiac zzso device zzso to detect pulmonary fluid zzso and to zzso alert patients to zzso chronic heart failure zzso 

To evaluate this algorithm, alert events were correlated with changes in zzso concentration and zzso zzso 

In a prospective zzso study of 62 patients zzso male, aged zzso year), zzso plasma zzso clinical zzso status, and device data were collected at zzso during regular follow-up and at device zzso Over a mean follow-up of zzso weeks, pooled data indicated a weak, but significant inverse relationship between relative changes in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In 52 device alerts from 35 patients, zzso increased by zzso from zzso zzso zzso The increase in zzso was higher in alerts with clinical signs of zzso deterioration zzso zzso zzso than in alert events without clinical signs zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso based alert events are associated with a significant increase in zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso monitoring might facilitate the zzso management of zzso patients with implanted zzso zzso
