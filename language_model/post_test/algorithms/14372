A novel filter termed zzso convergence index filter zzso zzso that is capable of enhancing the zzso of rounded zzso is proposed as part of a zzso zzso zzso scheme for detecting pulmonary zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso In this filter and its predecessor, the convergence index filter zzso zzso the output at a zzso represents the degree of convergence toward the zzso shown by the directions of zzso zzso at surrounding zzso The zzso filter and the zzso scheme were evaluated using five clinical zzso containing 50 zzso With the support region of 9 zzso 9 zzso the zzso filter showed more selective response to the zzso than the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso intermediate zzso candidates are generated based on the zzso filter output and then classified using linear zzso analysis of eight features that are attributed to each intermediate zzso zzso The zzso filter output level itself was used as one of the zzso The scheme achieved a sensitivity of zzso with zzso false zzso per zzso The zzso filter output level was most effective among the features in correctly zzso intermediate zzso zzso The zzso filter is promising as a tool of zzso for automated pulmonary zzso detection in CT zzso
