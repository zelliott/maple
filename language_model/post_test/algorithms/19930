For some zzso patients the spinal zzso is zzso Among these patients, those with stiff zzso will need zzso disk zzso The removal of the zzso disk with only zzso images is a tedious and challenging task for the zzso With computer aided surgery and zzso zzso of the zzso disk during surgery, surgeons will have access to additional information such as the remaining disk tissue or the distance of surgical tools from critical anatomical structures like the zzso or spinal zzso We hypothesized that automatically zzso zzso information of the zzso disk from MR images would aid the surgeons to evaluate the remaining disk and would add a security factor to the patient during zzso disk zzso 

This paper presents a quantitative evaluation of an automatic zzso method for zzso reconstruction of zzso zzso disks from MR zzso The automatic zzso method is based on the watershed technique and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the main statistical metric used to validate the automatically detected zzso disk zzso The automatic zzso of zzso disks of real clinical MR images are compared to manual zzso done by zzso 

zzso show that depending on the type of MR acquisition zzso the zzso zzso can be as high as zzso zzso These zzso results are also supported by a zzso quantitative evaluation as well as by zzso and zzso zzso The mean zzso (in zzso between the manual and automatic zzso for regions around the spinal canal is of zzso zzso zzso The zzso study shows that among the five factors zzso only the type of zzso acquisition sequence can affect the zzso zzso Finally, the zzso of the automatic zzso method is lower than the zzso associated with manual zzso performed by different zzso 

This comprehensive evaluation of the automatic zzso and zzso reconstruction of zzso disks shows that the proposed technique used with specific zzso acquisition protocol can detect zzso disk of zzso zzso The newly developed technique is promising for clinical context and can eventually help surgeons during zzso zzso disk zzso
