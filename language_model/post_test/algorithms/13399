A novel zzso zzso zzso system to identify zzso factor zzso binding motifs zzso in zzso DNA sequences was zzso It is based on the comparison of two types of frequency zzso with respect to the zzso candidates in the target DNA sequences and the zzso in the background zzso with the latter generated by utilizing the zzso zzso For benchmark tests, we used DNA sequence zzso extracted by zzso and zzso techniques and identified 65 zzso and four zzso zzso with the latter including zzso The accuracy of our system was compared with those of other available programs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and was the best among them, even without tuning of the zzso set for each zzso and zzso of the target DNA zzso Moreover, with respect to some zzso for which the identified motifs are inconsistent with those in the references, our results were revealed to be correct, by comparing them with other existing experimental zzso Thus, our identification system does not need any other biological information except for gene positions, and is also expected to be zzso to zzso DNA sequences to identify unknown zzso as well as known zzso
