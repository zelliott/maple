zzso zzso zzso in zzso exhibit a wide range of firing zzso They normally fire constantly at a low rate, and speed up, firing a zzso burst when reward exceeds zzso or pause when an expected reward does not zzso zzso the detection of bursts and pauses from spike train data is a critical problem when studying the role of zzso zzso zzso in reward related learning, and other zzso dependent zzso However, few statistical methods have been developed that can identify bursts and pauses zzso We propose a new statistical method, the zzso zzso zzso zzso method, which performs an exhaustive search of bursts and pauses in spike trains zzso We found that the zzso method is adaptable to various patterns of spike trains recorded in zzso and is not influenced by baseline firing rate, making it zzso to all in zzso spike trains where baseline firing rates vary over zzso We compare the performance of the zzso method to other methods of detecting zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso Rank zzso zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of data using the zzso method reveals potential mechanisms underlying how bursts and pauses are controlled in zzso zzso
