zzso of standard input function zzso has been proposed for kinetic analysis of zzso binding potential zzso instead of invasive frequent zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to assess the zzso method in quantitative analysis of zzso zzso a central zzso zzso for zzso zzso studies were performed on 10 patients with cerebrovascular disease or zzso zzso zzso dynamic zzso scans were performed from 0 to 201 zzso after zzso zzso calculated from zzso obtained from normal volunteers zzso were compared with those of individual zzso zzso zzso Good correlations were shown between zzso and zzso in the 9 subjects, but maximum zzso were four times larger than the corresponding zzso in one zzso There were no abnormal laboratory data in this patient, but the relative zzso input count in the late period was higher than the zzso zzso studies with modified input functions revealed that height in the late period can produce significant errors in estimated zzso These results suggested that the simplified method with zzso zzso sampling and zzso can not be applied zzso One additional zzso sampling in the late period may be zzso
