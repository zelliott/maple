The advent of cost-effective zzso and sequencing methods have recently made it possible to ask questions that address the genetic basis of zzso diversity and how natural zzso interact with the zzso We developed zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso for zzso zzso a statistical method that zzso zzso gene expression and zzso data to automatically build models that both predict complex quantitative zzso and identify genes that actively influence these zzso zzso zzso zzso and gene expression data, both generated under a reference condition, to predict the response to entirely different zzso We systematically applied our zzso to data generated from a collection of zzso zzso using zzso and gene expression data generated under drug-free conditions to predict the response to 94 drugs and zzso confirmed 14 novel zzso zzso Our approach is zzso zzso to other zzso and species, and has potential for applications in personalized medicine, for example, in predicting how an individual will respond to a previously unseen zzso
