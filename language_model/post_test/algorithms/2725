The protein targets for general zzso remain zzso A tool to predict zzso binding for potential binding targets is zzso In this study, we explored whether a zzso method, zzso could serve as such a zzso 

zzso crystal data of zzso proteins zzso C, zzso and human serum zzso and a membrane protein (a zzso zzso zzso channel from zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments were performed to determine zzso affinity in solution conditions for zzso zzso calculations were performed using zzso with the zzso genetic zzso and the zzso and zzso local search method zzso Twenty general zzso were zzso into zzso The predicted binding zzso were compared with those obtained from zzso experiments for potential zzso In the case of zzso details of the binding site and their interactions were compared with recent zzso zzso zzso calculations for 6 general zzso currently used in clinical settings zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with known 50% effective concentration zzso values were also performed in all tested zzso The binding zzso derived from zzso experiments were compared with known zzso values and zzso partition zzso for the 6 general zzso 

All 20 general zzso zzso zzso into the zzso binding site identified in the crystal structure of zzso The binding zzso for 20 zzso obtained from the zzso calculations correlate significantly with those obtained from zzso experiments zzso zzso zzso In the case of zzso the identified zzso binding sites in the crystal structure are among the zzso predicted binding sites, but not the top ranked zzso zzso calculations suggest a most probable binding site located in the zzso domain of zzso The predicted affinities correlated significantly with the known zzso values for the 6 frequently used zzso in zzso for the site identified in the experimental crystal data zzso zzso zzso However, predicted affinities in zzso human serum zzso and zzso C did not correlate with these 6 zzso known experimental zzso zzso A weak correlation between the predicted affinities and the zzso partition zzso was observed for the sites in zzso 

We demonstrated that zzso binding sites and relative affinities can be predicted using zzso calculations in an automatic zzso server zzso for both zzso and membrane zzso zzso of predicted affinity and zzso for 6 frequently used general zzso was only observed in zzso a member of a protein family relevant to zzso zzso
