The internal zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channels contains a ring of eight negative charges not present in zzso channels of lower zzso zzso and zzso in zzso that zzso channel zzso through an zzso mechanism zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In BK channels there are also two zzso zzso acid zzso in an zzso loop zzso and zzso in zzso To determine the zzso influence of these charges on channel zzso we expressed zzso BK channels and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso channels on zzso zzso zzso and measured the expressed currents under patch zzso Contribution of zzso to the zzso is negligible and single channel zzso of zzso channels measured at 0 zzso in symmetrical 110 zzso zzso was zzso lower than the zzso zzso zzso displayed weak outward zzso for zzso and the double zzso The zzso differences between the zzso and zzso BK were caused by an zzso effect since they were enhanced at low zzso (30 zzso and vanished at high zzso (1 M zzso We determine the zzso potential change, zzso caused by the charge zzso using zzso block for the zzso charges and zzso for zzso zzso We measured 13 zzso 2 zzso for zzso at the zzso site when turning off the zzso charges, and 17 zzso 2 zzso for the zzso at the zzso site when the zzso charges were turned zzso To understand the zzso effect of charge zzso we determined zzso using a BK channel molecular model embedded in a zzso zzso and solving the zzso zzso The model explains the experimental results adequately and, in particular, gives an economical explanation to the differential effect on the zzso of the zzso of charges zzso and zzso
