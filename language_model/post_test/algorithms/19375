There is increasing interest in using zzso signal detection methods to support zzso safety surveillance zzso Two commonly used methods, empirical zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso and zzso reporting ratio zzso perform differently with respect to the number and types of signals zzso The goal of this study was to compare and zzso the performance characteristics of these two methods, to understand why they differ and to consider the practical implications of these differences for a large, zzso zzso zzso 

We compared the numbers and types of signals of disproportionate reporting zzso obtained with zzso and zzso using two zzso safety databases and a simulated zzso We recorded signal counts and performed a qualitative comparison of the zzso combinations zzso by the two methods as well as a sensitivity analysis to better understand how the thresholds commonly used for these methods impact their zzso 

zzso detected more zzso than zzso We observed that zzso is less subject to zzso by demographic factors because it employs zzso and is more stable than zzso when report counts are zzso zzso experiments performed using published empirical thresholds demonstrated that zzso detected zzso signals at a rate of zzso while zzso did not detect any statistical false zzso In an attempt to separate the effect of choice of signal threshold from more fundamental zzso differences, we performed a series of experiments in which we modified the conventional threshold values for each method so that each method detected the same number of zzso for the example drugs zzso This analysis, which provided quantitative examples of the relationship between the published thresholds for the two methods, demonstrates that the zzso criterion published for zzso has a higher zzso frequency than that published for zzso 

The performance differences between the zzso and zzso methods are related to zzso greater zzso by demographic factors with zzso zzso a higher tendency of zzso to detect zzso signals when the number of reports is small; and zzso the conventional thresholds that have been adapted for each zzso zzso tends to be more zzso and less zzso than zzso A zzso zzso method, when used in conjunction with medical zzso and investigation of critical medical events, may provide an efficient and robust approach to applying quantitative methods in routine zzso zzso
