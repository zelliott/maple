This article provides demonstrations and calculations, using zzso theory and method, of the zzso features zzso such as form zzso zzso and zzso zzso drawn from 28 species of insects of the zzso zzso and zzso based on their zzso The results are compared with statistical analysis made by zzso zzso and also with the traditional zzso through the pattern recognition of neural network on the basis of the zzso zzso The result of the experiments showed that when used in zzso zzso the importance of zzso was ranked from high to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso number, zzso zzso zzso zzso form zzso The results of pattern recognition by neural network were completely identical with those of traditional zzso zzso the conclusion was that this theory applied in insect zzso was more idealistic compared with statistical analysis method, and it had great significance when used with zzso neural zzso
