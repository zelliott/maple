zzso three-dimensional tumor zzso in zzso is critical to the treatment outcome, particularly when high dose zzso are zzso A number of techniques have been proposed for the zzso of anatomical structures or zzso The present study proposes an approach to a concurrent zzso of zzso accuracy and efficiency by correlation of zzso and zzso zzso The method introduces an element of direct zzso and interactive zzso of the zzso zzso images are used for the identification of a point of zzso Its position is zzso within the treatment zzso system and zzso of this position is achieved by obtaining the zzso eye view of the identified point on two projection zzso The key element of the approach is that all images used should be part of one single image data zzso The zzso of this zzso method, as part of the functionality of a Digital zzso prototype, has provided an integrated facility for zzso of zzso accuracy and precision, while easy and efficient to zzso The considerations are general and apply in principle to any imaging system that can augment zzso images with zzso
