The aim of this study was to verify the feasibility of a respiratory motion compensation technique zzso zzso zzso for zzso of coronary arteries zzso by correlation with selective coronary zzso zzso Fifteen subjects (11 patients, mean age zzso years, age range zzso years; and 4 healthy volunteers, mean age zzso years, age range zzso zzso were zzso A Philips zzso zzso was used, operating at zzso zzso was combined with the zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso respiratory zzso zzso zzso field echo sequence was zzso The real-time zzso zzso the concept of zzso weighting in combination with automatic analysis of respiratory zzso The main CA were zzso zzso analysis was performed by three blinded zzso zzso was graded on a zzso scale zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso graded 2-4 were defined as adequately zzso zzso of 88 zzso CA segments in patient, and 22 of 32 in volunteer group were adequately zzso zzso of CA was classified as excellent for zzso RCA zzso zzso good for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso middle RCA and sufficient for middle zzso zzso zzso positive and negative zzso values for coronary zzso in detection of CA zzso with zzso narrowing zzso were 88, 94, 83, and zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging in combination with zzso has proven to be a promising technique for zzso imaging of CA due to good image quality and a patient convenient zzso zzso
