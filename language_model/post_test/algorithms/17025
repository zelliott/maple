A graphic program has been developed to calculate the secondary structure content of proteins from their circular zzso zzso All the information concerning analysis and results are given on a single zzso The actual and the theoretical zzso are plotted to allow visual inspection of the fit zzso The percentages of secondary structure and statistical parameters zzso zzso are zzso The program is fully interactive for zzso zzso Moreover, zzso driven by a mouse or zzso keys are zzso onto zzso yielding all the information concerning a given zzso such as the theoretical and experimental zzso zzso values of reference model for zzso zzso and zzso zzso are provided for the zzso program of zzso and zzso
