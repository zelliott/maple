The novel method for zzso of zzso has been proposed basing on consecutive multiple alignments of consensus zzso A code can be assigned to each zzso zzso acid sequence reflecting its relative distance from the corresponding consensus sequences at three zzso zzso Thus, only the principle of sequence similarity is chosen for zzso without involving such criteria as zzso properties, zzso assignment or zzso
