An inherent drawback of the traditional diffusion zzso model is its limited ability to provide detailed information about zzso fiber architecture within a zzso This leads to erroneous fiber zzso results in locations where fiber zzso cross each zzso This may lead to the inability to zzso clinically important tracts such as the lateral projections of the zzso zzso In this report, we present a deterministic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso technique, which successfully traces through regions of crossing zzso We evaluated the method on simulated and in zzso human brain data, comparing the results with the traditional zzso and with a zzso zzso zzso By tracing the zzso tract and zzso with zzso motor zzso in both healthy subjects and patients with brain tumors, we demonstrate that zzso deterministic streamline zzso can accurately identify fiber zzso consistent with anatomy and previously not detected by conventional zzso zzso When compared to the dense connectivity maps generated by zzso zzso the method is zzso efficient and generates discrete geometric pathways that are simple to zzso and clinically zzso zzso of crossing white matter pathways can improve zzso zzso of functionally relevant white matter zzso
