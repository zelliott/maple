The successful decoding of zzso variables from spike trains of motor cortical zzso is essential for cortical neural zzso Spike trains from each single unit must be extracted from zzso neural signals and, thus, spike detection and sorting procedure is indispensable but the detection and sorting may involve considerable zzso Thus, a decoding zzso should be robust with respect to spike train zzso Here, we show that spike train decoding zzso employing zzso zzso especially a support zzso machine zzso may be more advantageous contrary to previous results which showed that an optimal linear filter is zzso The advantage became more conspicuous in the case of erroneous spike zzso Using the zzso satisfactory training of the decoder could be achieved much more easily, compared to the case of using a zzso zzso which has been employed in previous zzso Tests were performed on simulated spike trains from primary motor cortical zzso with a realistic distribution of preferred zzso The results suggest the possibility that a zzso device with a low-quality spike sorting zzso can be achieved by adopting a spike train decoder that is robust to spike sorting zzso
