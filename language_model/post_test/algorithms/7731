As the earth system moves to a novel state, model systems zzso zzso zzso are needed to assess and improve the zzso accuracy of ecological models under environments with no contemporary zzso In recent years, we have zzso studied the zzso plant associations and climates in eastern North America during the last zzso to better zzso their zzso distribution, test hypotheses about zzso and zzso controls, and assess the accuracy of zzso and zzso zzso The formation of zzso plant associations was zzso beginning first in the south-central United States; at sites in the north-central United States, it is linked to declining zzso zzso zzso and temperature were more seasonal than present, creating climates currently nonexistent in North America, and shifting zzso relationships for some zzso These shifts pose a common challenge to empirical zzso zzso species distribution models zzso and zzso models based on zzso Steps forward include combining recent and zzso data to more fully describe zzso fundamental zzso employing zzso models to model shifts in species interactions under zzso climates, and assimilating zzso data with zzso zzso zzso zzso modeling species interactions under novel environments remains a fundamental challenge for all forms of ecological zzso
