The zzso theory of linked functions was used to determine the numbers of modifier zzso involved when zzso zzso zzso zzso constants, obtained zzso using zzso zzso as a model system, were plotted on zzso paper with respect to the modifier zzso The slopes of the lines represent the net number of modifier zzso involved in the zzso zzso numbers of zzso are bound to the zzso because the zzso capacity is determined by the total number of charges zzso The zzso bind to the zzso at comparable zzso rates, irrespective of how tightly they zzso When zzso binds at pH zzso 4 zzso 4 zzso 2 zzso or zzso zzso are zzso indicating that the fully charged zzso zzso zzso By comparing zzso zzso and zzso it was possible to evaluate the contributions of the zzso zzso and each zzso to the zzso Between pH 2 and 3, where zzso has two negative charges, zzso binds largely as the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the presence of 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso facilitate the zzso by zzso zzso of the liberated zzso zzso behaved similarly to zzso but aluminum, at pH zzso promoted the binding of zzso as an zzso complex with the zzso liberation of three zzso zzso These experimental zzso zzso were found to be independent of the zzso of the other zzso zzso zzso linkage zzso can be evaluated from log K zzso log zzso plots when a direct determination of modifier binding is zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
