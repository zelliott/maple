zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso has been recently proposed for simultaneous zzso and zzso reduction of data on zzso zzso using sparse representation zzso In this work, zzso zzso is applied to the differential discrimination of zzso and zzso zzso by means of their Gene zzso zzso Our purpose was to evaluate the zzso of this zzso zzso to zzso gene expression profiles, characterized by the zzso of their representations and the low discrimination power of most of the zzso For this objective, we used zzso to reduce the zzso of a zzso zzso of 35 zzso zzso zzso with zzso original zzso zzso supervised and zzso zzso were applied to obtain the zzso model: the former was based on linear zzso analysis, the later on zzso using the zzso embedding zzso The results obtained using both approaches showed that all zzso the samples could be correctly classified and the results of all repetitions but one formed a compatible cluster of zzso zzso Finally, the embedding zzso of the zzso extracted by zzso revealed large discrimination margins between both zzso
