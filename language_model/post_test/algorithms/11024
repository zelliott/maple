Nowadays, the production of zzso zzso films is of great interest because of the growing environmental concerns regarding pollution and the need to reduce dependence on the zzso zzso A broad view of the role of different zzso added to zzso films to improve their properties, is required to guide the future zzso The zzso maps zzso provide comparisons that initially were complicated due to the large volume of the zzso Furthermore, the construction of a model capable of predicting the mechanical and barrier properties of these films will accelerate the development of films with improved zzso The water vapor zzso zzso analysis using the zzso zzso showed that the presence of zzso is very important for films with low amounts of zzso zzso zzso zzso and confirms the role of the equilibrium relative humidity in the determination of zzso Considering the mechanical properties, the zzso analysis emphasizes the important role of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso starch based zzso The properties of zzso films were predicted and zzso by using a zzso zzso coupled with a genetic algorithm, presenting a great correlation between the experimental and theoretical values with a maximum error of zzso To improve the response of the model and to ensure the zzso of the components more information will be zzso
