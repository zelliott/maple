A new lattice zzso monitoring zzso for a hybrid zzso zzso maximum zzso learning rule zzso model is zzso It aims to overcome zzso defects zzso to a rapid decrease of the neighborhood range over the finite running time in zzso map zzso The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to accelerate the formation of a zzso map and, at the same time, to simplify the monitoring zzso
