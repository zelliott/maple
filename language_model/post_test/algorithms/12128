zzso are highly dynamic protein zzso that form a crucial part of the zzso in all zzso zzso Although zzso are known to zzso from zzso zzso information on the assembly dynamics of zzso has been zzso both in zzso and in zzso to zzso of average growth and shrinkage rates over several thousands of zzso zzso As a result there is a lack of information on the sequence of molecular events that leads to the growth and shrinkage of zzso zzso Here we use optical tweezers to observe the assembly dynamics of individual zzso at molecular zzso We find that zzso can increase their overall length almost zzso by amounts exceeding the size of individual zzso (8 zzso When the zzso protein zzso zzso 6) is added, this effect is markedly enhanced and fast increases in length of about zzso zzso are zzso These observations suggest that small zzso zzso are able to add directly to growing zzso and that zzso speeds up zzso growth by zzso the addition of long zzso The achievement of molecular resolution on the zzso assembly process opens the way to direct studies of the molecular mechanism by which the many recently discovered zzso zzso proteins regulate zzso dynamics in living zzso
