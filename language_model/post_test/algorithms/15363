To validate a zzso zzso for detecting severe zzso and urinary adverse effects zzso of zzso zzso to inform the design and interpretation of outcomes studies, using administrative zzso to detect such zzso zzso 

An institutional billing analysis was performed to identify patients managed with zzso for prostate or cervical cancer at the University of Minnesota, between 2000 and zzso A zzso we identified Current zzso zzso procedural codes consistent with treatment for severe zzso zzso A retrospective chart review and a billing zzso zzso analysis were performed to detect the procedures used to treat zzso zzso The accuracy of the zzso zzso was compared with chart review (the reference zzso 

On chart review, 31 patients zzso with severe zzso and urinary zzso zzso were detected among zzso patients with zzso cancer at zzso The most common zzso was zzso zzso zzso of all zzso The sensitivity and specificity of the zzso analysis were zzso and zzso respectively for zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively for zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively for radiation zzso zzso and zzso respectively for zzso or urinary zzso and zzso and zzso respectively for radiation zzso 

We demonstrated an excellent specificity and yet fairly good sensitivity of our zzso zzso for detecting treatment of zzso zzso zzso or urinary zzso radiation zzso and zzso zzso These data might inform the design and interpretation of studies using zzso methods for the detection of severe urinary zzso of pelvic zzso
