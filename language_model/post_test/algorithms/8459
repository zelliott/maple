zzso treatment of active zzso arthritis zzso requires early diagnosis and early disease zzso zzso drug zzso treatment to have an impact on long term morbidity and zzso Clinical criteria would facilitate early referral of the patient with suspected zzso to a rheumatologist for definitive diagnosis and initiation of zzso treatment at that point in the disease most likely to have an impact on the long term zzso 

To develop a referral recommendation that may serve as a clinical guide for primary care doctors, enabling them to identify patients with suspected zzso during the early inflammatory zzso 

Key points of the referral criteria were formed based on a thorough literature review targeting early zzso early arthritis clinics, zzso treatment for early zzso zzso factors of disease zzso early zzso clinical trials, and quality of zzso Evidence was graded using the methods defined by zzso et zzso A draft version of the criterion was circulated among the authors for critical zzso A consensus integrated these zzso 

Clinical evidence strongly supports the observations that structural damage occurs early in active zzso and that early zzso treatment improves the long term outcome of the zzso The observations indicate that rapid referral to a rheumatologist is advised when zzso is zzso This may be supported by the presence of any of the zzso zzso swollen zzso zzso involvement, and morning zzso of zzso zzso 

The proposed early referral recommendation is a viable tool for primary care doctors to identify potential patients with active zzso early in the zzso Early referral to a rheumatologist for definitive diagnosis and early zzso treatment should improve the long term outcome of zzso
