To date, the zzso cycle has been the dominant paradigm for understanding the zzso zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in support of functional zzso trafficking in zzso However, studies in cell cultures have repeatedly challenged the notion that functional zzso trafficking is accomplished via the zzso cycle zzso The present study introduces and zzso alternative cycles for functional zzso trafficking that integrate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and trafficking of zzso cycle zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso for each of these alternative cycles is established by strict application of the principle of conservation of atomic species to zzso and zzso compartments in both zzso zzso and zzso In contrast to the zzso cycle, which requires zzso but not necessarily zzso zzso to function, cycles for functional zzso trafficking based on zzso transport of zzso cycle zzso require zzso processes to zzso These proposed alternative cycles are energetically more efficient than, and incorporate an inherent mechanism for transporting nitrogen from zzso zzso to zzso in support of the coordinated activities of zzso and zzso that is absent in, the zzso zzso In light of these newly elaborated alternative cycles, it is premature to zzso that functional zzso trafficking in synaptic zzso in zzso is sustained by the zzso cycle zzso
