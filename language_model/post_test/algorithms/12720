The paper is aimed to provide a novel index, named as zzso spatial triangular area, for the evaluation of the zzso correlation of multiple component traditional Chinese medicines zzso The zzso of the method was demonstrated by the example zzso The method and standard practice for evaluation of the zzso correlation for western medicines with single compound could not be applied to zzso with multiple zzso The release percentage or zzso percentage of the multiple components for zzso at the sampling time was a point in the zzso zzso The area of the triangle formed zzso the sequential three points represented the changing characteristics of the zzso release and zzso zzso The side lengths of the triangle could be calculated from the spatial distances between each two of the sequential three zzso Then the triangle area could be obtained by the side zzso The in zzso zzso zzso zzso correlation of the multiple components could be represented by the correlation between the zzso values of the release triangle areas and that of the zzso triangle zzso The results of the examples indicated that the zzso spatial triangular area method could treat the multiple components in a holistic way, in line with the zzso the hi he zzso zzso the zzso spatial triangular area method provided new methodology for the zzso correlation of the zzso with multiple zzso
