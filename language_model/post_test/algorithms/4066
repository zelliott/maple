Recent achievements in wireless technologies have opened up enormous opportunities for the zzso of ubiquitous health care systems in providing rich contextual information and warning mechanisms against abnormal zzso This helps with the automatic and remote zzso of patients in hospitals and zzso and with the supervision of zzso elderly people in their own domestic environment through automatic systems to handle the remote drug zzso This paper presents a new modeling and analysis framework for the zzso positioning in a wireless body area network zzso which exploits the spatial zzso of patients and a sparse fast zzso transform zzso feature extraction mechanism for monitoring of patients and for reporting the movement tracking to a central database server containing patient vital zzso The main goal of this paper is to achieve a high degree of accuracy and resolution in the patient zzso with less zzso complexity in the zzso using the zzso sensing zzso We represent the patients' positions as a sparse zzso obtained by the discrete zzso of the patient movement space in a circular zzso To estimate this zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso feature zzso is zzso for each received signal from the zzso embedded on the patient's body at each grid zzso This feature extraction process benefits in the combination of both zzso and long-time properties of the received zzso The zzso of the proposed zzso zzso in terms of the average positioning error is zzso evaluated using the realistic parameters in the zzso zzso standard in the presence of additive white zzso zzso Due to the circular grid pattern and the zzso feature extraction method, the proposed scheme represents a significant reduction in the zzso complexity, while improving the level of the resolution and the zzso accuracy when compared to some classical zzso positioning zzso
