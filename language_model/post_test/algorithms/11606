The zzso mechanism we earlier proposed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso J Am zzso zzso 1984, zzso zzso for the second zzso transfer of the reaction zzso by zzso zzso zzso is examined zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso levels in zzso for two zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso oxygen of the zzso group either zzso zzso as in the crystal structure, or anti zzso with respect to the zzso zzso zzso The barrier height for the zzso zzso transfer occurring in zzso is very sensitive to electron correlation zzso The zzso internal energy barrier is much lower than the zzso one, while the free energy zzso barrier is even more zzso indicating that the zzso presence is not requested to speed up that zzso An investigation of the zzso aspects of the zzso along the zzso from zzso A (with H on zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso B (with H on zzso was, however, carried out in the presence of the zzso field while using a neutral zzso with its zzso on zzso To perform the zzso simulations, it was necessary to zzso in the zzso zzso the zzso A, zzso and B species, whose partial charges have been determined with the zzso zzso with the X and Y arrangements of the zzso zzso Actually, the zzso approach produced a low barrier and a substantial balance between A and B, especially at the zzso zzso The zzso analyzed paying a particular attention to the positions assumed by zzso and by the other active site zzso put forward somewhat different zzso patterns around the X or Y zzso zzso
