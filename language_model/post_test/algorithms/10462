In this work, we develop a zzso analysis using zzso mixed effects models zzso that mimics the standard zzso analysis zzso We estimate zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso and treatment, period and sequence zzso We explain how to perform a zzso test on a secondary zzso and we propose an extension of the likelihood ratio test for zzso We compare these zzso zzso tests with standard zzso zzso We evaluate by simulation the zzso and zzso estimates and the type I error of the zzso zzso For zzso we use the zzso approximation expectation zzso zzso zzso implemented in zzso We simulate crossover trials under zzso using different numbers of subjects and of samples per zzso We simulate with different settings for zzso and zzso zzso and for the residual error zzso The simulation study illustrates the accuracy of zzso geometric means estimated with the zzso algorithm, whereas the zzso estimates are biased for sparse zzso zzso zzso tests show good type I error except for high zzso For a rich design, type I errors of zzso zzso tests zzso test and likelihood ratio zzso do not differ from the nominal level of zzso Type I errors are inflated for sparse zzso We apply the zzso zzso test based on zzso and zzso estimates to a three-way crossover trial, showing that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso powder and solution are zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tests are an alternative to standard zzso zzso However, caution is needed for small sample size and highly variable zzso
