Considering zzso stability as a result of successful zzso treatment, we aimed to verify the influence of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso anterior zzso 

The sample comprised 56 white subjects of both sexes with Class I and Class II zzso at zzso treated with extraction of 4 first zzso and zzso zzso No patient underwent zzso stripping during or after zzso Mean zzso age was zzso zzso Mean treatment time was zzso years, and mean zzso evaluation time was zzso zzso zzso anterior crowding was measured with the Little zzso index, and the zzso and zzso proportion of the zzso zzso crowns was measured with the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso were obtained from dental casts at the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso correlation zzso was calculated to determine the correlation between zzso zzso and the amount of zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso index was not significantly correlated with the amount of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is not correlated with the amount of zzso zzso
