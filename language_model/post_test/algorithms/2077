This work demonstrates new techniques developed for the prediction of protein folding class in the context of the most comprehensive zzso zzso of zzso zzso The prediction method uses global zzso of a protein in terms of the physical, chemical and structural properties of its constituent zzso zzso zzso networks are zzso to combine these zzso in a specific way to discriminate members of a given folding class from members of all other zzso It is shown that a specific zzso zzso properties work completely differently on different folding zzso This creates the possibility of finding an individual set of zzso that works best on a particular folding zzso
