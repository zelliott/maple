An audit of urine and plasma zzso and their associated zzso and zzso over a 4 week period found that there were 124 plasma and 96 urine zzso requests from 67 zzso In 21 patients zzso per zzso the zzso results were useful in reaching a more precise zzso In a further 11 cases, urine zzso rather than plasma would have been zzso Seventy-one per cent originated from the zzso zzso Unit and were largely requested zzso by the hospital computer order communication zzso Plasma zzso gaps could be calculated on 80 occasions (65 per zzso The formula zzso Na + zzso K + zzso zzso + zzso zzso + zzso proved to be more accurate than the formula zzso zzso 2 + zzso (in zzso with the latter showing a positive bias when compared to measured zzso The zzso gap was zzso 10 zzso using the more complex formula on 23 occasions in 16 patients but only twice using the simpler zzso These 16 patients usually had organ failure and were very zzso zzso sodium and zzso were measured on 72 occasions in 27 of these patients but urine zzso was never zzso zzso sodium zzso 20 zzso was found in 7 patients all of whom had relative or absolute zzso zzso sodium was measured in 73 per cent of patients investigated for zzso in general zzso Data was available to calculate the urine zzso gap on 52 zzso The value was zzso 100 zzso in 10 cases and this may be used as an index of the zzso ammonium response to zzso Much potential derived information from simple zzso is zzso As a result of this study, there was an approximate zzso of the subsequent request zzso
