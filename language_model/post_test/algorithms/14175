The manner in which anatomical rotation from an individual segment contributes to the position and zzso of the zzso can be zzso in the arena of many athletic events whose goals are to attain the zzso zzso of the most zzso zzso This study presents a new method of zzso analysis using dual zzso angles and its application in studying zzso contribution from upper zzso segments to club head speed during a golf zzso zzso zzso angle describes zzso movement as a series of ordered screw motions about each zzso axis in a streamlined zzso zzso dual transformation zzso and allows the translation and rotation component to be described in the same moving zzso zzso this method in zzso is a novel idea and the authors have previously applied the methodology to clinical studies on its use in displacement zzso The focus of this paper is zzso analysis and applications in sports zzso In this study, zzso zzso zzso with a frequency of 1000 zzso were attached to a subject during the execution of the swing to obtain the joint angles throughout the zzso The zzso of the club head was then analyzed using the dual zzso which specifies the zzso distribution of a rigid body in screw motion at any point in time as the dual zzso The contributions of each segment to the zzso zzso were also zzso In order to evaluate this method, the calculated position and zzso of the club head were compared to the values obtained from video image zzso The results indicated that there is good agreement between calculated values and video data, suggesting the suitability of using the zzso zzso method in analyzing a zzso chain zzso
