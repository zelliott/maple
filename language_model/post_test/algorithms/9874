As mathematical models are increasingly available for zzso systems, dynamic zzso can be a useful tool for manipulating zzso Dynamic zzso is a zzso tool for finding a sequence of optimal actions to attain desired outcomes from the zzso This chapter discusses two dynamic zzso zzso model zzso control and dynamic programming, in the context of finding optimal treatment strategy for correcting zzso zzso axis zzso It is shown that dynamic programming approach has the advantage over the model zzso control zzso methodology in terms of zzso to error in zzso estimates and flexibility of accommodating clinically relevant objective zzso
