zzso zzso zzso aims at predicting the location of a protein within a cell using zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of proteins indicates protein functions and helps in identifying drug zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso is an important but challenging problem, particularly when proteins may simultaneously exist at, or move between, two or more different zzso location zzso Most of the existing protein zzso zzso methods are only used to deal with the zzso zzso To better reflect the characteristics of multiplex zzso we formulate prediction of zzso zzso of multiplex proteins as a zzso learning zzso We present and compare two zzso learning approaches, which exploit correlations between labels and leverage zzso features, respectively, to induce a high quality prediction zzso Experimental results on six protein data sets under various organisms show that our described methods achieve significantly higher performance than any of the existing zzso Among the different zzso learning methods, we find that methods exploiting label correlations performs better than those leveraging zzso zzso
