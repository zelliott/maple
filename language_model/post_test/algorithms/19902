A novel zzso learning zzso for automated image zzso is presented in this zzso Given reference images marked by clinicians as relevant or zzso the image zzso is trained to detect patterns, of arbitrary size, that only appear in relevant zzso After training, similar patterns are sought in new images in order to zzso them as either relevant or irrelevant zzso zzso no manual zzso are zzso As a consequence, large image zzso are available for zzso The proposed framework was applied to diabetic zzso screening in zzso retinal image zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso of zzso examination records from the zzso screening network zzso zzso In this application, an image (or an examination record) is relevant if the patient should be referred to an zzso Trained on one half of zzso the zzso achieved high performance on the other half of zzso zzso and on zzso zzso We observed, in a subset of 273 manually segmented images from zzso that all eight types of diabetic zzso zzso are zzso
