zzso zzso X-ray zzso zzso zzso has been found useful in various zzso In medical imaging, one promising application is using zzso zzso for zzso correction in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso approaches to zzso material decomposition ignore noise characteristics and are based on zzso zzso producing noisy component zzso estimates for zzso zzso In this paper, we propose two novel zzso restoration methods based on statistical models: penalized weighted least square zzso and penalized likelihood zzso yielding less noisy component zzso estimates for zzso zzso than classical zzso The proposed methods consequently provide more precise zzso correction of the PET zzso images than do previous methods for zzso material decomposition with zzso We report simulations that compare the proposed techniques and existing zzso
