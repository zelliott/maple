We have developed a zzso protocol for quantitative zzso zzso in which the processing time and the acquisition time are under 2 minutes each for a complete brain study of 15 zzso An zzso zzso image sequence is designed to collect data suitable for analysis using a linear zzso zzso The precision is approximately twice the noise to signal ratio of the zzso The accuracy of the protocol is better than zzso for zzso in the range 0-2 seconds and deviates slightly for longer zzso zzso The protocol is insensitive to B1 field zzso If needed, the data can be zzso using a slow, zzso zzso to give an accuracy of less than zzso and a precision of approximately the noise to signal ratio throughout a range of zzso values from 0 to 4 zzso
