The selection of suitable beam angles in external beam zzso is at present generally based upon the experience of the human zzso The requirement to automatically select beam angles is particularly highlighted in zzso radiation therapy zzso in which a smaller number of modulated beams is hoped to be used, in comparison with zzso zzso It has been proved by many researchers that the selection of suitable beam angles is most valuable for a plan with a small number of beams zzso or zzso zzso In this paper an efficient method is presented to investigate how to improve the dose zzso by selecting suitable zzso beam zzso In our automatic beam angle selection zzso algorithm, the optimal zzso beam angles zzso to the lowest objective function value of the dose zzso calculated using the zzso maps of this group of candidate zzso Due to the complexity of the problem and the large search space involved, the selection of beam angles and the zzso of intensity maps are treated as two separate processes and implemented zzso A genetic zzso zzso incorporated with an immunity operation is used to select suitable beam angles, and a zzso zzso zzso method is used to quickly zzso intensity maps for each selected beam combination based on a zzso objective zzso A zzso three-dimensional zzso full scatter zzso zzso zzso is employed for the dose zzso Two simulated cases with obvious optimal beam angles are used to verify the zzso of the presented technique, and a more complicated case simulating a prostate zzso and two clinical cases are employed to test the efficiency of zzso The results show that zzso is valid and efficient and can improve the dose zzso within a clinically acceptable zzso zzso
