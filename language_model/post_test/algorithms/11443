The zzso of mouse zzso tissue zzso contain zzso which are zzso zones of zzso that can be used as zzso landmarks to examine nuclear zzso in response to a mechanical zzso This study used component tree analysis, an image zzso zzso that detects high intensity zzso that are zzso connected, to zzso the spatial organization of zzso in zzso within whole mouse zzso tissue fixed and stained with zzso The component tree analysis method was applied to zzso zzso images of whole mouse zzso zzso tissue incubated for zzso ex zzso with or without zzso zzso In stretched zzso the mean distance between zzso within zzso zzso was significantly greater zzso zzso zzso corresponding to an average of a zzso increase in zzso separation zzso zzso There was no significant difference in zzso number or average size between stretch and no zzso Average zzso distance was positively correlated with nuclear zzso area zzso zzso and nuclear volume zzso zzso and zzso correlated with nuclear aspect ratio zzso zzso and nuclear zzso index zzso zzso These results demonstrate that component trees can be successfully applied to the zzso analysis of nuclear zzso in zzso within whole zzso zzso zzso stretching of mouse zzso zzso tissue for zzso resulted in substantially increased separation of nuclear zzso in zzso tissue zzso This interior zzso of the nucleus induced by tissue stretch may impact zzso active zzso within the zzso zzso
