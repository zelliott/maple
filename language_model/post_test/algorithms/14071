To extend the harmonic phase zzso tracking method in order to track the zzso tissue that appears near the zzso zzso during zzso and reappears near the zzso zzso during zzso due to the zzso motion and zzso shape of the zzso 

A mathematical model of zzso deformation was used to zzso the accuracy of the extended zzso tracking and of the strain zzso For six healthy volunteers, the number of tracked points and the two-dimensional strain components were zzso with the extended and with the original zzso tracking zzso 

High accuracy was obtained for the zzso strain zzso error is zzso relative to zzso zzso The extended version tracked 22 zzso zzso 51 zzso zzso and 67 zzso zzso more points than the original version on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso or zzso zzso for each zzso and yielded a decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso and 12 zzso zzso for the three zzso P zzso zzso for mid and zzso at end zzso These differences in zzso strain were related to the more complete coverage of the zzso wall with tracked zzso 

The extended zzso tracking also provides strain values from zzso regions that were not covered by the original zzso zzso
