zzso detection systems were used in the past along with various techniques to detect zzso in networks zzso However, most of these systems are able to detect the intruders only with high false alarm zzso In this paper, we propose a new intelligent zzso intrusion detection model for mobile ad hoc networks using a combination of attribute selection, zzso zzso and enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso For this purpose, an effective zzso technique is proposed that improves the detection accuracy and reduces the processing zzso Moreover, two new zzso zzso an zzso Agent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso Support zzso zzso zzso are proposed for detecting the intruders in a distributed database environment that uses intelligent agents for trust management and coordination in transaction zzso The experimental results of the proposed model show that this system detects anomalies with low false alarm rate and zzso rate when tested with zzso Cup 99 data zzso
