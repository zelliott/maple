This paper describes a new approach to the automated zzso of X-ray left zzso zzso zzso based on active appearance models zzso and dynamic zzso A zzso of shape and texture information between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso frame was achieved by constructing a zzso zzso zzso of the model was compensated for by employing dynamic programming, zzso both intensity and motion features in the cost zzso Two applications are zzso a zzso method with manual model zzso and a fully automatic zzso The first proved to be highly robust and accurate, demonstrating high clinical zzso Based on experiments involving 70 patient data sets, the zzso success rate was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso with average unsigned border positioning errors of zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso volumes were accurate and zzso The fully automatic algorithm, with zzso less user interaction was less zzso but showed a high potential, mostly due to a controlled zzso descent in updating the model zzso The success rate of the fully automatic method was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso with average unsigned border positioning errors of zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso
