zzso zzso 2 zzso contains three zzso type II zzso zzso that contribute to its collagen zzso We observed that the CD zzso of the separate zzso zzso account for the CD and temperature profiles of the zzso zzso zzso Thus, to the extent of not significantly zzso the secondary structure and zzso stability characteristics of the neighboring units, the zzso within zzso do not zzso Via zzso we investigated zzso binding properties of the three repeats within zzso zzso (the zzso domain within zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso with the collagen mimic zzso zzso zzso and zzso segment zzso zzso were zzso While zzso and zzso bound zzso they zzso more zzso with zzso In contrast, zzso exhibited a higher affinity for zzso than for zzso Thus, despite their structural zzso the zzso repeats of zzso differ in zzso zzso zzso the binding affinities toward the three zzso zzso repeats were close to those determined for the individual isolated zzso or for zzso indicating that zzso these zzso each module interacts essentially as an autonomous zzso Interestingly the zzso within zzso exhibited enhanced affinities for zzso a construct that contains zzso in triple zzso zzso zzso the affinities were significantly higher for zzso and zzso relative to zzso in line with their behaviors toward zzso This hints at a cooperative participation toward zzso which is a closer mimic of zzso a hypothesis that is supported by the detected lower affinities of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso
