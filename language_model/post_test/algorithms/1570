The aim of this study was to develop and validate a simple zzso model that estimates the fat mass of white zzso women and compare it to other models available in the zzso 

zzso data such as zzso weight, waist and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which were incorporated for the development and validation of this model, were derived from 276 white zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used as the reference zzso Furthermore, a comparison with other models was made using zzso analysis and zzso correlation zzso 

The model developed in the current study was: fat mass zzso zzso zzso biceps + zzso zzso weight - zzso zzso height + zzso zzso zzso circumference - zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso reliability analysis on the validation cohort showed a zzso significant bias of zzso zzso and limits of agreement of zzso zzso the zzso correlation zzso was zzso Furthermore, the zzso of the current model also remained significant in different levels of zzso ranging from zzso zzso When other models available in the literature were tested in the current zzso bias ranged from zzso to zzso zzso while the limits of agreement from zzso to zzso zzso 

The model developed in the current work was found to be valid for the assessment of zzso women's fat mass at normal, overweight and obese zzso zzso and can be easily applied in clinical practice and zzso
