The Canadian cervical spine rule zzso has been found to be an effective tool to determine the need for zzso evaluation of the cervical spine zzso incorporating both clinical findings and zzso Previously, it has been validated only through clinical follow-up or selective use of zzso The purpose of this study was to validate it using zzso zzso zzso as the gold standard to identify zzso 

Prospective evaluation was performed on zzso blunt trauma patients who were screened by zzso and were compared with a complete zzso zzso zzso positive indicated at least one positive clinical or mechanism finding, whereas CT positive indicated presence of a zzso 

There were 192 patients with zzso fractures versus zzso without fracture on zzso The fracture group was older zzso zzso zzso years zzso zzso zzso zzso years, p zzso zzso had a lower zzso zzso zzso score zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and lower zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The sensitivity of zzso was zzso zzso specificity was zzso zzso positive zzso value was zzso zzso and negative zzso value was zzso zzso zzso zzso identified only 8 of the 19 factors included in the zzso to be independent zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso is very sensitive but not very specific to determine the need for zzso evaluation after blunt zzso Based on this study, the rule should be streamlined to improve specificity while maintaining zzso
