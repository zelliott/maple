We propose a zzso model of membrane proteins to investigate the structures of zzso bundle membrane proteins zzso using zzso zzso replica exchange zzso zzso zzso To demonstrate the method, it is used to identify the ground state of zzso in a zzso model, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and their zzso The zzso parameters of zzso zzso zzso are extracted directly from the simulations, which can be compared with their experimental zzso from zzso zzso In particular, the effects of zzso interaction among the surfaces of zzso on the zzso angles of zzso are zzso The proposed zzso model gives a reasonably good structure prediction of zzso as well as a clear physical picture for the zzso zzso orientation, and rotation of zzso The root mean square zzso zzso in coordinates of zzso atoms of the ground state zzso structure from the X-ray structure is zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso The final structure of zzso is obtained from the zzso molecular dynamics simulations by refining the predicted zzso structure, whose zzso is zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso
