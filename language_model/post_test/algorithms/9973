We study the evolution of a wave packet in a zzso Stark zzso In the absence of zzso all normal modes are zzso localized giving rise to an zzso zzso spectrum and Bloch zzso zzso zzso frequency shifts and zzso interactions and destroys zzso For large strength of zzso we observe zzso zzso as a zzso with subsequent explosive zzso followed by zzso For moderate zzso an immediate zzso takes zzso Finally, for small zzso we find linear Stark zzso as a zzso with subsequent zzso For zzso zzso and weak zzso stability intervals are predicted and observed upon variation in the zzso bias strength, which affects the zzso and the long-time zzso
