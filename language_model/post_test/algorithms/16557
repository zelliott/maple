The zzso hair cells of many auditory zzso zzso are tuned by an electrical resonance that increases their responses to stimulation over a narrow band of zzso The small zzso of membrane potential characteristic of this phenomenon have previously been zzso only through zzso zzso zzso which are zzso and zzso analysis at the level of an entire sensory zzso We used a zzso dye to image zzso electrical resonance in an intact preparation of the zzso zzso a zzso organ sensitive to zzso zzso and auditory zzso Imaging revealed distinct populations of hair cells whose resonant response varied with the frequency of zzso electrical zzso Most of the hair cells in the zzso zzso in zzso were zzso tuned to stimulation at zzso zzso The frequency dependence of the zzso signal was sensitive to pharmacological blockade of zzso zzso zzso channels and to zzso zzso At an elevated concentration of zzso we observed transient zzso signals that probably represented action zzso The zzso imaging and analysis techniques described here present a general approach for studying zzso zzso in zzso excitable zzso
