The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of reconstruction parameters on the measurement of global left zzso zzso volume and define the appropriate reconstruction parameters when using the ordered zzso expectation zzso zzso method and zzso zzso zzso method including the zzso distance response zzso recovery zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso 

An zzso torso phantom with a 56 zzso zzso part was zzso The zzso volume was calculated with zzso software by the zzso number zzso number zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso volumes calculated with zzso and zzso without zzso and scatter corrections corresponded to the true obtained by the zzso number about 32 times and 24 times when using the zzso and zzso method with zzso and scatter corrections, zzso However, zzso volumes have changed greatly in the zzso method according to the change in the zzso zzso zzso numbers of zzso and zzso are the measurement of global zzso volumes, especially when using the zzso zzso with zzso
