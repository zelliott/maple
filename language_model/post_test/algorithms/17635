The assumption of an instant equilibrium between bound and zzso drug zzso is commonly applied in zzso zzso The equation for the calculation of the zzso volume of distribution zzso from the time curve of drug concentration in plasma after intravenous zzso dose administration, which does not assume an immediate equilibrium and thus incorporates zzso and association rates of protein and tissue zzso is zzso The equation obtained zzso zzso zzso looks like the traditional zzso but instead of mean residence time zzso calculated using the total drug concentration in zzso it contains mean residence time zzso calculated using the plasma concentration of the zzso zzso The equation connecting zzso and zzso is zzso If an immediate equilibrium between bound and zzso drug zzso occurs, zzso and zzso are the same, but in general, zzso is always smaller than zzso For drugs with high protein affinity and slow zzso rate zzso may be of an order of several hours smaller than zzso so that zzso can be considerably overestimated in the traditional zzso
