In experiments on zzso zzso spin systems with evolution of the zzso zzso under the influence of a zzso nucleus zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso relaxation of the zzso zzso on the zzso time scale have been documented and zzso and methods for minimizing their effect have been zzso The zzso relaxation results in zzso zzso even in the reference signal zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso experiments, due to zzso of the zzso generated zzso zzso reducing or even eliminating the zzso zzso zzso Pulse sequences for measuring an improved reference signal zzso with minimal zzso zzso but the same number of zzso as for zzso and S have been zzso From the observed intensity zzso and the zzso signal zzso zzso can be zzso zzso zzso analogous to the zzso zzso zzso will occur in zzso zzso for zzso zzso spin zzso Even in the absence of zzso zzso fast zzso relaxation of the zzso nucleus shortens the zzso relaxation time zzso of the observed nucleus, in particular at low spinning zzso due to unavoidable zzso zzso evolution during a rotation zzso The observed zzso dependence of zzso matches the theoretical prediction and may be used to estimate zzso The effects are demonstrated on several zzso spin systems, including an zzso zzso the natural zzso zzso zzso and a model zzso zzso
