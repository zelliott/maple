The main objective of this work was the zzso of the production of the novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was used as an zzso for zzso zzso In the first step, the growth medium was zzso by using screening designs for finding the optimal carbon and nitrogen zzso In the second step, a genetic zzso was used to zzso the zzso of all medium zzso After six generations the stopping criterion was reached and a growth medium was obtained which produced zzso times more zzso than the starting zzso In the next step, an addition profile for the zzso zzso was developed to further increase zzso production by using a genetic zzso In this case, after four generations the stopping criterion was zzso By using the obtained optimal addition profile zzso activity was enhanced from 826 to zzso In comparison to the starting conditions activity could even be increased by a factor of zzso
