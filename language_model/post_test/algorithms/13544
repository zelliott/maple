Scaffolding is an important zzso in de zzso zzso zzso in which mate pair data are used to construct a linear sequence of zzso separated by zzso Here we present zzso a set of simple linear zzso derived from the geometry of zzso on the line that can be used to predict the relative positions and zzso of zzso from individual mate pair reads and thus produce a zzso zzso The zzso zzso can also filter out unreliable mate pairs and can be used as a zzso step for any scaffolding zzso We tested the zzso zzso on five real data sets ranging in complexity from simple bacterial zzso to complex zzso zzso and compared the results to the majority voting procedure used by many other scaffolding zzso zzso predicted the relative positions and zzso of the zzso with high accuracy in all cases and gave more accurate position predictions than majority voting for complex zzso in particular the human zzso Finally, we present a simple scaffolding zzso that produces linear scaffolds given a zzso zzso We show that our zzso is very efficient compared to other scaffolding zzso while maintaining high accuracy in predicting both zzso positions and zzso for real data zzso
