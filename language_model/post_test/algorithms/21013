We have constructed a new zzso zzso zzso zzso model for zzso drugs to describe zzso zzso effects on zzso pressure zzso after zzso of a combination of an zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso into zzso This model was constructed by the combination of two zzso zzso models for zzso and zzso by including zzso humor dynamics based on both action zzso We also verified the reliability of this model by confirming the drug zzso in zzso humor and zzso zzso effects after zzso of the drug zzso The zzso humor zzso of zzso and zzso were determined by an zzso and zzso zzso zzso profiles were measured using a zzso system, which was able to record automatically detailed zzso The combined model could simulate the zzso humor zzso of both drugs and the additive zzso effect after zzso of the combination using the zzso zzso program and zzso parameters which were obtained from zzso zzso effects after zzso of zzso alone or zzso zzso The theoretical concentration zzso of both drugs in the zzso humor and the theoretical zzso zzso effect zzso almost agreed with both the observed zzso and zzso zzso effects after zzso of the drug zzso These results indicate the reliability and usefulness of zzso modeling considering zzso humor dynamics to predict zzso in zzso zzso This is the first study to develop a zzso model for zzso therapy for the zzso
