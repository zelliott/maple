An inflatable zzso balloon zzso is often used during zzso body radiation therapy zzso for treatment of prostate cancer in order to reduce both zzso motion of the target and risk of zzso zzso However, the zzso can exert significant force on the zzso and this work assessed the impact of zzso position errors on deformation of the prostate and treatment dose zzso Seventy-one zzso zzso zzso zzso image zzso of nine patients with clinical stage zzso prostate cancer were zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inflated with zzso air was used during simulation and treatment, and daily zzso zzso zzso imaging was performed to zzso the zzso The shape of the zzso in each zzso was analyzed to determine errors in position, size, and zzso A zzso registration zzso was used to track the dose received by (and deformation zzso the zzso and zzso values such as zzso zzso coverage, and zzso zzso for the prostate were zzso The average balloon position error was zzso in the inferior direction, with errors ranging from zzso zzso to zzso zzso The prostate was zzso primarily in the zzso direction, and zzso primarily in the zzso zzso A significant correlation was seen between errors in depth of zzso zzso zzso and mean zzso zzso prostate zzso zzso zzso and zzso prostate zzso distance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso correlated with prostate zzso and zzso coverage zzso zzso zzso For the model of zzso zzso error in zzso position can cause zzso in the prostate that zzso affect treatment, and this additional aspect of setup error should be considered when zzso are used for prostate zzso Before treatment, the zzso position should be verified, and the zzso should be adjusted if the error is observed to exceed tolerable zzso
