Using molecular dynamics computer simulations we investigate structural and dynamic zzso properties of charged zzso suspension confined to narrow slit pores with zzso zzso zzso The system is modeled on an effective level involving only the zzso which interact via a combination of a zzso and a screened zzso zzso The aim of our study is to identify the role of the range of the zzso interaction controlled by the inverse zzso screening zzso zzso We also compare to bulk properties at the same chemical potential as determined in parallel grand zzso zzso Carlo zzso Our results reveal a significant influence of the interaction range which zzso however, with the influence of zzso At zzso zzso a decrease of range yields a decreasing mobility (and a corresponding enhancement of local zzso in the bulk system, whereas the reverse effect occurs in narrow zzso with thickness of a few particle zzso These differences can be traced back to the zzso and zzso reduction of overall density compared to the bulk zzso We also show that an increase of zzso zzso the zzso in the normal pressure as function of the wall zzso which is consistent with experimental observations concerning the influence of addition of zzso
