In this paper, we address the zzso of globally minimal zzso and surfaces for image zzso and stereo zzso We present a solution, simulating a continuous zzso flow by a novel system of partial differential zzso zzso methods are either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso contours and zzso The solution simulates the flow of an ideal fluid with zzso zzso zzso zzso constraints are defined by a metric derived from image zzso An auxiliary potential function is introduced to create a system of partial differential zzso It is proven that the zzso produces a globally zzso continuous flow at zzso and that the globally minimal surface may be obtained zzso from the auxiliary zzso The bias of minimal surface methods toward small objects is also zzso An efficient zzso is given for the flow zzso The globally minimal surface zzso is applied to zzso in zzso and zzso as well as to stereo zzso zzso in zzso agree with an existing minimal zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and stereo matching demonstrate that the new zzso is robust and free from grid zzso
