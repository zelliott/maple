We have developed an implicit zzso effective potential zzso that is suitable for molecular dynamics simulations and high-resolution zzso It is based on a novel zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Born model for the zzso component and a new zzso zzso free energy zzso The zzso term consists of an zzso for the zzso van der zzso zzso energy designed to mimic the zzso zzso zzso van der zzso interaction energy, in addition to a surface area term corresponding to the work of cavity zzso zzso makes use of a new zzso zzso to calculate the zzso zzso used in the zzso zzso scheme to take into account atomic zzso The same zzso is also used to calculate atomic surface zzso We show that excellent agreement is achieved for the zzso zzso and surface areas in comparison to accurate, but much more expensive, zzso zzso The zzso approach used in zzso and the sensitivity of the zzso model with respect to large and small zzso changes makes the model suitable for high-resolution modeling of protein zzso and zzso sites as well as high-resolution prediction of the structure and thermodynamics of zzso zzso We present illustrative results for these kinds of zzso The model is fully zzso with first derivatives and is zzso zzso It has been incorporated into the zzso molecular simulation zzso
