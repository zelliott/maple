No objective diagnostic zzso or laboratory tests have yet been developed for psychotic zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso studies consistently find significant abnormalities in multiple brain structures in psychotic patients relative to healthy control subjects, but these abnormalities show substantial overlap with zzso variation that is in the normal range and therefore zzso Recently, efforts have been made to discriminate psychotic patients from healthy individuals using zzso pattern zzso methods on zzso zzso 

zzso cortical gray matter density zzso maps were generated for 36 patients with zzso psychosis and 36 zzso and zzso control subjects using a cortical pattern matching zzso zzso differences in GMD were zzso Second, the sparse zzso zzso zzso zzso included in the zzso zzso Analysis in Python zzso package was applied to the cortical GMD maps to discriminate psychotic patients from control zzso 

Patients showed significantly lower zzso particularly in zzso cingulate, and lateral zzso brain zzso zzso zzso analysis achieved zzso accuracy in discriminating patients from controls using zzso zzso 

These results suggest that even at the early stage of illness, psychotic patients present distinct patterns of regional cortical gray matter changes that can be zzso from the normal zzso These findings indicate that we can detect complex patterns of brain zzso in early stages of psychotic illness, which has critical implications for early identification and intervention in individuals at zzso risk for developing zzso
