The zzso water exchange across the membrane of a zzso zzso is made visible by optical differences of zzso and zzso In the near infrared zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso shows pronounced zzso bands while zzso is almost zzso zzso from in zzso experiments on the zzso water zzso across the membrane of the zzso freshwater zzso zzso zzso are zzso The evaluation of the zzso zzso allows the calculation of the zzso zzso zzso and the approximation of the zzso diffusion constant, zzso The extension of zzso zzso to two dimensions opens new ways to study transport pathways up to the spatial resolution of a zzso First zzso video images demonstrate the capability of the zzso
