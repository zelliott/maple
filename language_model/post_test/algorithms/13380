zzso protein complexes is very important in biological processes since it helps reveal the zzso relationships in biological networks and much attention has been paid to accurately predict protein complexes from the increasing amount of zzso interaction zzso zzso Most of the available zzso are based on the assumption that dense zzso zzso to complexes, failing to take into account the zzso organization within protein complex and the roles of zzso Thus, there is a critical need to investigate the possibility of discovering protein complexes using the zzso information hidden in zzso 

To provide an investigation of the roles of edges in zzso networks, we show that the edges connecting less similar zzso in zzso are more significant in maintaining the global zzso indicating the weak ties phenomenon in zzso zzso We further demonstrate that there is a negative relation between the weak tie strength and the zzso zzso By using the bridges, a reliable virtual network is constructed, in which each zzso zzso zzso to the core of a zzso By this notion, the detection of the protein complexes is transformed into a classic zzso zzso A novel zzso based method is developed, which detects the zzso and attachments, zzso A comprehensive comparison among the existing zzso and our zzso has been made by comparing the predicted complexes against benchmark zzso 

We proved that the weak tie effect exists in the zzso network and demonstrated that the density is insufficient to characterize the zzso structure of protein zzso Furthermore, the experimental results on the zzso zzso network show that the proposed method zzso the state-of-the-art zzso The analysis of detected zzso by the present zzso suggests that most of these zzso have well biological significance in context of complexes, suggesting that the roles of edges are critical in discovering protein zzso
