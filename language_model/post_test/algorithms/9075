We present an zzso to form zzso zzso surfaces consistent with the zzso based zzso zzso descriptions widely used with spatial zzso zzso Such zzso descriptions are readily available online and may come from zzso zzso or from an artificial cell grown zzso These files contain only limited information about a zzso full three-dimensional shape, as they consist mostly of a list of points and diameters with connectivity zzso This representation is zzso for zzso simulations, where the space zzso are larger than geometric zzso However, the simple interpretations used for pure zzso simulation produce zzso zzso for zzso models that also involve three-dimensional zzso as such models have smaller space zzso Although one cannot exactly reproduce an original zzso full shape from zzso data, our new constructive zzso zzso geometry zzso zzso uses constructive solid geometry to define a plausible reconstruction without gaps or zzso zzso then uses zzso zzso to produce a zzso triangular mesh of the zzso surface, suitable for use in zzso zzso zzso provides the correspondence between internal zzso and surface zzso needed to make connections between zzso and membrane zzso zzso of the underlying marching cubes zzso and distance calculations enhanced the performance of constructive cubes for a zzso zzso where a large number of small objects sparsely occupy a large zzso
