This article describes the development and zzso of zzso to study diffusion in zzso systems using zzso mechanics zzso Specifically, finite element methods have been developed to solve the zzso zzso equation to calculate zzso binding rate zzso for large zzso The resulting software has been validated and applied to mouse zzso Rates for inhibitor binding to zzso were calculated at various zzso strengths with several different reaction zzso The calculated rates were compared with experimental data and show very good agreement when the correct reaction criterion is zzso Additionally, these finite element methods require significantly less zzso resources than existing zzso zzso dynamics zzso
