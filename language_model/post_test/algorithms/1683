We address the issue of zzso zzso from zzso zzso of chaotic systems, using the dynamics of a zzso water wheel and simulations of the corresponding zzso model as an zzso We discuss and compare two zzso one is based on a globally zzso zzso observer and the second is an extended Kalman filter zzso Both zzso can identify all three unknown parameters of the zzso We find that the estimated zzso values are in agreement with those obtained from direct zzso on the experimental zzso In addition, we explore the question of how to distinguish the impact of noise from those of model imperfections by investigating a model zzso and the use of uncertainty estimates provided by the extended Kalman zzso Although we are able to exclude zzso inflow as a possible zzso effect, our results indicate that the zzso do not perfectly describe the water wheel zzso
