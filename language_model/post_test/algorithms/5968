To develop an advanced diagnostic method for urinary zzso zzso zzso A novel soft computing zzso methodology based on the zzso of fuzzy cognitive maps zzso with the zzso active zzso learning zzso zzso is zzso 

One hundred and zzso cases of urinary zzso cancer were retrieved from the archives of the Department of zzso University Hospital of zzso zzso All zzso had been characterized according to the classical World Health Organization zzso grading zzso To design the zzso model for zzso zzso three experts zzso defined the main zzso features zzso and their impact on grade zzso The resulted zzso model consisted of nine zzso Eight concepts represented the main zzso features for zzso zzso The ninth concept represented the zzso zzso To increase the zzso ability of the zzso model, the AHL zzso was applied to adjust the weights of the zzso 

The proposed zzso grading model achieved a zzso accuracy of zzso zzso and zzso for zzso of grades I, II and III, zzso 

An advanced computerized method to support zzso grade diagnosis decision was proposed and zzso The novelty of the method is based on employing the soft computing method of zzso to represent specialized knowledge on zzso and on zzso zzso ability using an zzso learning algorithm, the zzso The proposed method performs with reasonably high accuracy compared to other existing methods and at the same time meets the zzso requirements for transparency and zzso
