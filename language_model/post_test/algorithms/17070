A reduced representation model, which has been described in previous reports, was used to predict the folded structures of proteins from their primary sequences and random starting zzso The molecular structure of each protein has been reduced to its backbone atoms (with ideal fixed bond lengths and zzso zzso and each side chain zzso by a single virtual zzso The coordinate variables were the backbone zzso angles zzso and zzso A statistical potential function, which included local and zzso interactions and was zzso from known protein structures, was used in the structure zzso A novel approach, employing the concepts of genetic zzso has been developed to simultaneously zzso a population of zzso With the information of primary sequence and the radius of zzso of the crystal structure only, and starting from randomly generated initial zzso I have been able to fold zzso a protein of 26 zzso with high zzso zzso The zzso structures have a root mean square error of zzso A zzso zzso error zzso zzso zzso on average to the crystal zzso Similar results for avian pancreatic zzso zzso a protein of 36 zzso are zzso Application of the method to zzso an zzso zzso with two zzso bonds, shows that it folds zzso to zzso zzso with the correct zzso bonds zzso
