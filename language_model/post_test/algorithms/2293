A generic zzso Carlo model of a zzso therapy machine is zzso The model, known as zzso is based on zzso and has been in use since zzso Its primary function has been the characterization of the incident zzso zzso for use by dose calculation zzso The accuracy of zzso is examined by comparing the dose zzso in a water phantom generated using only the zzso Carlo data with measured dose zzso for two machines in our zzso a 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso and the 15 zzso beam from a zzso zzso The zzso Carlo generated dose zzso are zzso using a dose calculation zzso based on the use of differential pencil beam zzso It was found that the match to measured data could be improved if the model is tuned by adjusting the energy of the electron beam incident on the zzso The beam profiles were found to be more sensitive indicators of the electron beam energy than the depth dose zzso Beyond the depths reached by contaminant zzso the zzso and measured depth dose zzso agree to better than zzso The comparison of beam profiles indicate that in regions up to within 1 zzso of the field edge, the measured and zzso doses generally agree to within zzso
