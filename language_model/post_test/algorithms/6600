In contrast to typical membrane proteins that span the zzso zzso via zzso zzso bacterial outer membrane proteins adopt a zzso architecture composed of zzso zzso zzso The zzso of outer membrane proteins is difficult to predict accurately using computer zzso and zzso mapping protocols commonly used for zzso membrane proteins do not work for zzso zzso We present here the zzso of the zzso zzso an outer membrane protein required for assembly and zzso of P zzso by the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso An initial attempt to map zzso zzso by zzso of zzso zzso sites was largely unsuccessful due to lack of zzso at most sites and the requirement to disrupt the outer membrane to identify zzso zzso We therefore adapted a zzso zzso labeling technique to permit zzso mapping of outer membrane proteins using small zzso zzso in intact zzso Using this method, we demonstrated that zzso has the potential to zzso up to 32 zzso zzso Based on experimental evidence, we propose that the usher consists of an zzso zzso domain comprised of 26 zzso and that a distinct zzso domain is not inserted into the membrane but is located instead within the zzso of the zzso zzso similar to the plug zzso zzso by the outer membrane zzso zzso zzso
