The American Diabetes Association recommends that people with diabetes use zzso to control their blood zzso zzso To assess the need for zzso we evaluated the zzso among 5 of the most common zzso zzso Precision zzso zzso zzso zzso Smart System, zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

We took steps to minimize zzso zzso We also eliminated user zzso by using one trained operator to collect samples and perform all zzso Each monitor was used twice with each zzso one test was performed using an aged strip and the other using a fresh zzso We compared monitors using a separate zzso for each concentration range and strip zzso 

The total zzso and the zzso lot zzso were not statistically different among zzso ranging from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso There were statistically significant differences among monitors for zzso lot zzso which ranged from nearly zzso to zzso The degree of significance increased as the concentration range increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The average percent difference between monitor pairs was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso in more than half of the paired zzso with significant differences ranging from zzso to zzso 

Monitor results can vary significantly so that agreement among them is zzso zzso is necessary to minimize zzso and to improve patient zzso
