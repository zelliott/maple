zzso zzso process planning is extremely important for efficient material recycling and components zzso The research work for the process planning in literature focuses on the generation of optimal sequences based on the zzso information of zzso The used products, unfortunately, exhibit high uncertainty since products may experience very different conditions during their use zzso The indeterminate characteristics associated to used products often makes the predetermined plan zzso Their zzso process has to be decided zzso zzso to the products' specific zzso To be able to deal with uncertainty in a dynamic decision making process, this paper presents a fuzzy reasoning zzso net zzso model to represent related decision making rules in zzso zzso Using the proposed fuzzy reasoning zzso based on the zzso model, the zzso zzso rules can be considered in the parallel way to make the decision automatically and zzso Instead of producing the zzso sequences before disassembling a whole product, the proposed method makes intelligent decisions based on zzso updated status of components in the product at each zzso zzso zzso it is zzso to the changes that arise during the zzso Finally, an example is used to illustrate the application of the proposed zzso
