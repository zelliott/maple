The zzso method can be used to model the effect of random geometric uncertainties into planned dose zzso used in radiation treatment zzso This is effectively done by zzso adding zzso small doses, each with a particular geometric zzso over an assumed infinite number of zzso However, this process inherently ignores the zzso zzso effect since only the summed physical dose distribution is zzso The zzso potential error on predicted zzso outcome zzso in this work with tumor control probability zzso equivalent uniform dose zzso normal tissue complication probability zzso and generalized equivalent uniform dose zzso has yet to be thoroughly zzso In this work, the results of a zzso Carlo simulation of geometric zzso are compared to those of the zzso method for random geometric uncertainties of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 zzso zzso zzso The zzso ratios of zzso zzso 3, 5, and 10 zzso are used to represent the range of radiation responses for different tumors, whereas a single zzso ratio of 3 zzso is used to represent all the zzso at risk zzso The analysis is performed on a zzso prostate treatment plan of 18 zzso zzso zzso The fraction numbers are varied from zzso with zzso adjustments of the corresponding zzso to maintain a constant tumor control, using the zzso cell survival zzso The average differences in zzso and zzso of the target, and in zzso and zzso of the zzso calculated from the zzso and zzso Carlo methods reduced zzso as the total fraction number increased, with the differences reaching negligible levels beyond the treatment fraction number of zzso or zzso The zzso method generally zzso the zzso zzso as compared to the zzso Carlo method, for the target volume, and zzso those for the zzso These effects are interconnected and attributed to assuming an infinite number of zzso inherent in the zzso of the zzso technique, irrespective of the uniqueness of each treatment zzso Based on the fraction numbers analyzed zzso and the range of fraction numbers normally used clinically zzso or zzso the zzso method can be used safely to estimate the effects of random geometric uncertainties on prostate treatment zzso zzso for both the target and the zzso Although the results of this study is likely to apply to other clinical sites and treatment techniques other than the zzso further validation similar to those done in this study may be necessary prior to clinical zzso
