zzso imaging and image zzso have become standard techniques for the modern cell biologist because they can form the basis of an increasing number of zzso for molecular function in a cellular zzso There are two major types of zzso zzso and restoration zzso zzso zzso remove blur but treat a series of optical sections as individual two-dimensional entities and therefore sometimes zzso blurred zzso Restoration zzso determine an object that, when zzso with the zzso function of the zzso could produce the image zzso The advantages and disadvantages of these methods are discussed in this zzso Image zzso in zzso zzso has usually been applied to high-resolution imaging to improve contrast and thus detect small, dim objects that might otherwise be zzso Their proper use demands some consideration of the imaging hardware, the acquisition process, fundamental aspects of zzso zzso and image zzso This can prove daunting for some cell zzso but the power of these techniques has been proven many times in the works cited in the chapter and zzso Their usage is now well zzso so they can be incorporated into the capabilities of most zzso A major application of zzso zzso is the quantitative measurement of the zzso zzso and interactions of cellular zzso The introduction of green fluorescent protein and its spectral zzso has led to a significant increase in the use of zzso zzso as a quantitative zzso zzso For quantitative imaging zzso it is critical to consider the nature of the zzso system and to validate its response to known zzso Any zzso zzso used before quantitative analysis should preserve the relative signal levels in different parts of the zzso A very common zzso algorithm, image zzso is used to remove blurred signal from an zzso There are two major types of zzso approaches, zzso and restoration zzso zzso zzso remove zzso but treat a series of optical sections as individual two-dimensional entities, and therefore sometimes zzso blurred zzso Restoration zzso determine an object that, when zzso with the zzso function of the zzso could produce the image zzso The advantages and disadvantages of these methods are zzso
