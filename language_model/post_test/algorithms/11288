Typically, light microscopic zzso using conventional zzso are limited by the zzso limit yielding resolutions that cannot be reached lower than approximately zzso However, using appropriate zzso pairs, zzso zzso resonance energy transfer zzso allows the zzso to zzso and in some cases zzso molecular interactions on the order of zzso In this chapter, the basic principles of zzso are introduced using both steady state and lifetime modes to detect the close association of fluorescent donor and zzso zzso The basic design of experiments and optical and imaging components is discussed to create a microscope that is capable of monitoring dynamic molecular associations in living zzso
