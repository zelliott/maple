Neonatal zzso has been evaluated as a means of eliminating zzso zzso infection in laboratory mouse zzso The purpose of the present study was to evaluate zzso of zzso zzso zzso from zzso infected zzso after zzso zzso and to determine the effects of sex and housing strategy on zzso zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso mice zzso 1 to 4 zzso were fostered zzso In all fostered mice, zzso samples collected at 21 and 42 days of age and zzso samples collected at 42 days of age tested negative for zzso zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso Our results demonstrate that removal of the male prior to zzso extends the zzso period to yield zzso zzso In a second experiment, the effects of time of infection, housing strategy, and sex on zzso zzso zzso shedding and zzso colonization were zzso Neither time nor housing strategy affected bacterial zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso bacterial loads were higher in male mice versus female zzso A novel zzso zzso was developed to predict zzso bacterial colonization levels in light of zzso bacterial zzso Our findings likely will prove useful in zzso zzso efforts and in studies designed to further zzso the role of zzso zzso in zzso
