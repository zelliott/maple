We propose an zzso for zzso zzso population association studies, which is a development of that introduced by Molitor et zzso zzso Am J zzso zzso zzso It uses zzso of zzso to overcome the major limitations of many current zzso zzso We define a zzso score that is simple, yet appears to capture much of the information about evolutionary zzso of the zzso in the vicinity of a zzso putative zzso zzso zzso clusters can then be defined via a putative ancestral zzso and a zzso zzso The number of an zzso two zzso that lie within the cluster predicts the zzso zzso at the zzso zzso This predicted zzso can then be investigated for association with the zzso of zzso We implement our approach within a zzso zzso Carlo zzso that, in effect, searches over locations and ancestral zzso to identify large, zzso zzso The zzso successfully zzso a zzso zzso in a test analysis using real data, and achieves almost zzso accuracy in predicting the zzso at the zzso zzso A simulation study indicates that the new zzso is substantially superior to alternative approaches, and it also allows us to identify situations in which zzso approaches can substantially improve over zzso zzso Our zzso runs quickly and there is scope for extension to a wide range of disease models and zzso zzso
