The introduction of zzso for the practice of zzso zzso skills opens a wide range of design zzso An obvious one is zzso visual information early in practice, in particular a direct view of the site instead of the zzso zzso We studied the effects of such zzso visual information on the simulated zzso of tissue with straight, horizontal and parallel zzso zzso view had an immediate beneficial effect on performance as compared with zzso zzso However, in subsequent tests with zzso view the benefits disappeared and turned into costs for some aspects of performance, zzso zzso This finding highlights for a simulated surgical task that zzso of practice by a performance criterion may not result in zzso by a transfer zzso 

zzso surgery represents a challenge for human zzso skills, but new zzso training methods give leeway for zzso A candidate is zzso visual feedback, in particular a direct rather than zzso view of the zzso However, performance becomes dependent on the zzso feedback so that the costs outweigh the zzso
