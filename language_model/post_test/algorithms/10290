A left zzso block zzso pattern with a dominant zzso in zzso is common in idiopathic zzso zzso zzso Discrimination between idiopathic and zzso zzso pattern VA has important clinical zzso We hypothesized that the VA zzso zzso is influenced by the presence of zzso scar, allowing zzso discrimination of VA arising from structurally normal versus scarred zzso 

zzso zzso of 297 zzso pattern zzso VA were recorded during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso characteristics associated with zzso VA were identified in retrospective analysis of 118 zzso pattern VA (95 zzso 23 zzso to develop a zzso zzso that was zzso tested in 179 zzso pattern VA zzso zzso 59 zzso The diagnosis of zzso was based on zzso rhythm surface zzso cardiovascular imaging, and zzso zzso zzso A zzso transition beyond zzso notching of the zzso zzso in lead zzso or zzso and a duration from the onset of zzso to the zzso in zzso zzso zzso were independent zzso for zzso zzso The proposed zzso classified a VA as zzso if any of these criteria was zzso If none of the criteria was present, a VA was classified as zzso In prospective zzso the zzso was highly sensitive zzso and specific zzso for the identification of zzso zzso pattern zzso 

The zzso zzso of VA is different between zzso and idiopathic zzso A simple zzso zzso is sensitive for identifying zzso zzso VA, which could be helpful in guiding further evaluation of these zzso
