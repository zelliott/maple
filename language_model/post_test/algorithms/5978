The zzso of model proteins zzso serum zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso in zzso zzso systems formed by a salt zzso zzso sodium zzso and ammonium zzso and a mixture of two zzso of different molecular zzso The ratio between the zzso masses in the zzso was changed in order to obtain different zzso average molecular zzso The effect of zzso molecular mass and zzso on the protein partition zzso was zzso The relationship between the zzso of the protein partition zzso and the average molecular mass of the zzso zzso was found to depend on the zzso molecular mass, the salt type in the bottom phase and the molecular weight of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso proved to be a very useful tool to increase the separation between two proteins having similar zzso zzso
