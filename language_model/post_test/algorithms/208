The measurement of breathing pattern in patients with chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso by electrical zzso zzso zzso requires the use of a mathematical zzso model incorporating not only zzso characteristics zzso evaluated in healthy zzso but probably functional zzso associated with COPD as zzso The aim of this study was to analyze the association between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso lung volumes, and carbon monoxide zzso capacity zzso in a group of male patients to develop a zzso equation for converting zzso signals into volume zzso 

We measured forced vital capacity zzso forced zzso volume in 1 second zzso zzso residual volume, total lung capacity, zzso carbon monoxide transfer zzso zzso and standard zzso parameters in 28 patients with a zzso ratio of zzso We then compared tidal volume zzso from a previously validated zzso unit and a standard zzso 

The mean zzso lung function results were zzso 72 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso residual volume, zzso zzso total lung capacity, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso tidal volumes measured by the zzso and the zzso unit were zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso associations were found between zzso zzso and CO transfer zzso The mathematical model developed to adjust for the differences between the 2 zzso zzso zzso was compensation zzso - zzso height zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The measurement of breathing pattern by zzso in patients with COPD requires the use of a previously calculated zzso equation that incorporates not only individual zzso characteristics but gas exchange parameters as zzso
