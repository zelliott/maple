When three-dimensional imaging is necessary in zzso oral surgery or maxillofacial surgery, conventional zzso zzso or cone beam zzso zzso is chosen zzso However, there are two obvious zzso Metallic zzso lead to pronounced streak zzso in conventional zzso zzso Moreover, the resolution of both conventional zzso zzso and cone beam zzso zzso is limited to zzso zzso This resolution is not sufficient for the fabrication of dental zzso In order to improve the quality of the two different zzso zzso techniques and to eliminate streak zzso fusion with optical zzso images can be zzso The resolution of optical zzso images can reach the range of some zzso depending on the zzso of the zzso Metal zzso do not zzso The fusion of zzso zzso images without zzso and optical zzso images leads to a mean zzso of corresponding points for the two imaging techniques of zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso zzso images with metal zzso are used, the zzso increases up to zzso zzso zzso zzso The accuracy of image fusion is significantly reduced by metal zzso zzso zzso zzso When image fusion of zzso zzso and optical zzso images is used in clinical studies, the mean zzso of corresponding points for the two imaging techniques for zzso and zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The available data on image fusion show that the quality of zzso zzso data without streak zzso can be significantly improved by registration with optical zzso zzso The precision of the fused images exceeds the resolution of the original zzso zzso When streak zzso are present, image fusion makes it possible to increase the quality of the data to the level of the original resolution of zzso zzso without zzso
