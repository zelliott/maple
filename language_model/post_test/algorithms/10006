Many real-life networks exhibit a spatial zzso zzso the probability to form an edge between two zzso in the network depends on the distance between zzso We investigate the influence of spatial dependence on the spectral density of the zzso When increasing spatial dependence in zzso zzso and zzso networks, it is found that the spectrum zzso Due to the spatial dependence the degree of zzso and the number of zzso zzso This results in a higher asymmetry zzso Our results show that the spectrum can be used to detect and zzso zzso and spatial dependence in a zzso
