zzso zzso zzso is the treatment of choice for certain types of cardiac zzso Recent studies have suggested that using gold instead of platinum as the zzso material for cardiac zzso zzso leads to larger zzso zzso due to its higher zzso zzso In this study we created computer models to compare the effects of different zzso materials on zzso dimensions using different zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso 

zzso element method zzso models of two cardiac zzso zzso zzso length 4 zzso and zzso length 10 zzso made of zzso gold, and copper were created with tissue zzso depths of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cooling was applied to the zzso and tissue based on zzso from previous studies at different flow zzso zzso zzso were simulated with both temperature control and constant power control zzso to determine temperature profiles after 60 zzso 

With the constant power zzso there was no difference in zzso dimensions between the zzso materials over the range of zzso With the temperature control algorithm, zzso zzso and depth were only marginally larger ( approximately zzso zzso with the gold and copper zzso compared to the platinum zzso for all zzso zzso 

Our computer zzso results show only minor increases in zzso zzso dimensions with zzso materials of higher zzso zzso These observed differences likely do not provide a significant advantage during clinical zzso
