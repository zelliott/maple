Rapid zzso pacing alone or in combination with low- or zzso shocks has limited efficacy in zzso rapid zzso zzso zzso when delivered through two zzso zzso zzso This prospective study determined the efficacy and safety of an zzso that used a sequence of rapid zzso pacing zzso and zzso (5 and 15 zzso and zzso zzso single, zzso shocks delivered by two zzso zzso zzso in conjunction with a zzso zzso in patients with sustained zzso The zzso shock was simultaneously delivered over two electrical zzso via a common right zzso zzso zzso and tow zzso consisting of the superior zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The electrical therapy delivered was determined by the cycle length of zzso Slow VT zzso length greater than 300 zzso was zzso treated by zzso followed by incremental zzso shocks of 5, 15, and 25 zzso Rapid VT zzso length less than 300 zzso was treated with no incremental zzso shocks of 15 and 25 zzso VT was zzso to determine zzso of the zzso for episodes that were successfully zzso For patients in whom the primary zzso failed, a second zzso was used that excluded 5 and 15 J shocks and went directly to a 25 J zzso VT was zzso twice and the secondary zzso was zzso Thus, zzso of termination of VT with the primary and secondary zzso was zzso Fifty episodes of slow VT and 40 episodes of rapid VT were induced in 22 patients zzso left zzso ejection fraction 31 zzso zzso Six patients had rapid zzso nine patients had slow zzso and seven patients had zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
