This work has proposed a methodology based on the concept of zzso rates to study the complexity of the short-term zzso zzso zzso for improving risk zzso to predict sudden cardiac death zzso of patients with established zzso zzso zzso The short-term zzso was analyzed during daytime and nighttime by means of zzso zzso An zzso rate was calculated on the zzso series, previously transformed to symbol sequences by means of an zzso A statistical analysis permitted to zzso zzso and low-risk patients of suffering zzso with a specificity zzso of zzso and sensitivity zzso of zzso
