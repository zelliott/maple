Several studies have shown that natural zzso descent for zzso learning is much more efficient than standard zzso zzso In this article, we derive natural zzso in a slightly different manner and discuss implications for zzso learning and zzso linking them to existing zzso such as zzso zzso and optimal brain zzso The Fisher zzso plays an important role in all these zzso The second half of the article discusses a layered approximation of the Fisher zzso specific to multilayered zzso Using this approximation rather than the exact Fisher zzso we arrive at much faster zzso learning zzso and more robust pruning zzso
