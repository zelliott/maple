zzso ensembles are powerful tools to represent the range of zzso that can be sampled by zzso They can be generated by using purely theoretical methods or, as is most often the case, by fitting ensembles of zzso to experimental data that report on the zzso of protein zzso zzso ensembles have been useful instruments to study fundamental properties of proteins such as the mechanism of molecular recognition, the early stages of protein folding and the mechanism by which structural information zzso through the structures of zzso proteins structures via correlated backbone zzso In this chapter I will review the various approaches that have been put forward in the literature to generate zzso ensembles for proteins and present a selection of examples of how such representations of the structural zzso of proteins have been used to explore the fundamental properties of these zzso Finally, I will look ahead at likely future developments in this area, which is important for structural and chemical biology as well as for zzso
