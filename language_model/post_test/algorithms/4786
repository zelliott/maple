We present a substantial improvement of zzso our recently proposed method for flexible fitting in three zzso electron zzso zzso at a resolution range of zzso together with a comparison of the method capabilities with zzso zzso Analysis zzso application examples and a user's zzso zzso uses the evolutionary information contained in protein domain databases like zzso by means of the structural alignment of the elements of a protein zzso The added development is based on a recent extension of the zzso Value zzso zzso zzso specifically designed for situations with missing zzso zzso zzso Value zzso zzso zzso can manage gaps and allows considering more zzso in the structural alignment of a zzso extending the range of application and producing better models for the fitting step of our zzso Our previous zzso flexible fitting approach can only take into account positions with no gaps in the zzso being appropriate when the zzso members are relatively similar and there are few zzso However, with new data coming from structural zzso works, the later situation is becoming less zzso making zzso the technique of choice for further zzso We present the results of using zzso in the process of flexible fitting with both simulated and experimental zzso maps zzso and zzso zzso cell entry zzso
