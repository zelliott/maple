Certain biological experiments investigating cell motion result in time zzso video zzso data which may be modeled using zzso differential zzso These models suggest statistics for zzso experimental results and testing relevant zzso and carry implications for the qualitative behavior of cells and for underlying zzso zzso zzso cell motion in response to a zzso termed zzso has previously been modeled at a zzso level using the zzso diffusion zzso The zzso model cannot distinguish certain modes of zzso and this motivates the introduction of a richer class of models which is nevertheless still amenable to statistical zzso A state space model zzso is used to link models proposed for cell zzso to observed zzso zzso zzso Carlo methods enable zzso zzso via maximum likelihood for a range of zzso zzso One particular experimental situation, involving the effect of an electric field on cell behavior, is considered in zzso In this case, an zzso zzso model for cell zzso is found to compare favorably with a zzso diffusion zzso
