The functional characterization of genes and their gene products is the main challenge of the zzso zzso zzso interaction information for every gene product is a direct way to assemble the zzso puzzle of proteins into a functional zzso Here we demonstrate a method in which the information gained from pull-down experiments, in which single proteins act as zzso to detect interactions with other zzso is zzso by using a network-based strategy to select the zzso Because of the zzso distribution of protein interaction networks, we were able to obtain fast coverage by focusing on highly connected zzso zzso zzso Unfortunately, locating hubs requires prior global information about the network one is trying to zzso Here, we present an zzso zzso strategy that identifies highly connected zzso using only local information that is collected as successive pull-down experiments are zzso Using this strategy, we estimate that zzso of the human zzso can be covered by 10,000 pull-down experiments, with 50% of the interactions confirmed by zzso pull-down zzso
