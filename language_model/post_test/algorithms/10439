It has been well established that theoretical kernel for recently surging zzso association study zzso is statistical zzso of linkage zzso zzso between a tested genetic marker and a putative locus affecting a disease zzso However, zzso analysis is vulnerable to several zzso factors of which population zzso is the most zzso zzso many methods have been proposed to correct for the influence either through predicting the structure parameters or correcting inflation in the test statistic due to the stratification, these may not be feasible or may impose further statistical problems in practical zzso 

We propose here a novel statistical method to control zzso zzso in zzso from population structure by incorporating a control marker into testing for significance of genetic association of a zzso marker with zzso variation of a complex zzso The method avoids the need of structure prediction which may be zzso or inadequate in practice and accounts properly for a varying effect of population zzso on different regions of the zzso under zzso zzso and statistical properties of the new method were tested through an intensive computer simulation study and an zzso zzso mapping of expression quantitative trait zzso in genetically divergent human zzso 

The analyses show that the new method zzso an improved statistical power for detecting genuine genetic association in zzso and an effective control of zzso associations stemmed from population structure when compared with other two popularly implemented methods in the literature of zzso
