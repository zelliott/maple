Advances in operative technique and zzso care have reduced surgical morbidity and mortality considerably after pulmonary zzso Various single and combined parameters of functional zzso have been proposed to assess the surgical zzso Patients with normal or only slightly impaired pulmonary function zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and no cardiovascular risk factors can undergo pulmonary zzso up to a zzso without further zzso For others, exercise testing, pulmonary zzso studies, or a combination of these methods are zzso zzso exercise testing, most frequently performed as a zzso test with the measurement of zzso zzso the pulmonary and cardiovascular zzso A zzso of less than 10 zzso generally is considered prohibitive for any zzso a value of greater than 20 zzso or greater than zzso predicted normal, safe for major zzso zzso studies are zzso zzso of the zzso values of various zzso The currently used zzso parameters are zzso zzso and zzso Suggested zzso values for safe zzso are: zzso and zzso zzso or greater than predicted, and zzso zzso or greater than predicted, combined with an absolute value of greater than or equal to 10 zzso The lowest acceptable zzso values remain to be confirmed by additional prospective zzso zzso involving not more than one lobe usually lead to an early functional deficit followed by zzso The permanent loss in pulmonary function is small zzso zzso and exercise capacity is reduced only slightly or not at zzso zzso leads to an early permanent loss of about zzso in pulmonary function and approximately zzso in exercise zzso Pulmonary function tests alone therefore overestimate the functional loss after lung zzso
