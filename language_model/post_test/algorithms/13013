We report studies of zzso human zzso development that correlate zzso image analysis and gene expression zzso By examining a large set of zzso from in zzso zzso zzso we find that success in progression to the zzso stage can be predicted with zzso sensitivity and specificity by measuring three zzso zzso imaging parameters by day 2 after zzso before embryonic zzso zzso zzso These parameters can be reliably monitored by automated image analysis, confirming that successful development follows a set of carefully orchestrated and predictable zzso Moreover, we show that imaging zzso reflect molecular programs of the zzso and of individual zzso zzso gene expression analysis reveals that zzso develop cell zzso with some cells advancing to zzso and others zzso These studies indicate that success and failure in human zzso development is largely determined before zzso Our methods and zzso may provide an approach for early diagnosis of zzso potential in assisted zzso
