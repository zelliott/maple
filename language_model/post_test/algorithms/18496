There are regularly arranged zzso that contain zzso labeled by zzso zzso zzso in the zzso layer of the primary visual zzso zzso of monkeys and zzso This theoretical study demonstrates that zzso patterns can be reproduced based on the zzso model for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso from two different groups of zzso to the zzso layer of the visual zzso Computer simulation based on the model shows that within a particular zzso range each blob is centered in the zzso dominance zzso band, as observed in zzso monkeys and zzso Furthermore, by increasing the strength of correlation in activity between zzso from the two eyes, nearby zzso merge across zzso borders, as seen in the cat visual zzso Finally, for zzso zzso zzso in the deprived eyes shrink as observed in monkeys and zzso For zzso zzso less intensely labeled zzso were zzso while the blob density did not change as observed in zzso
