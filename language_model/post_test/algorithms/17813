Given the recent development of newer and zzso treatments for pulmonary hypertension, and the long wait for lung zzso early and correct diagnosis of this condition is increasingly zzso The purpose of this study was to determine and improve the accuracy of a zzso zzso zzso zzso for detecting a pulmonary vascular limit to zzso 

We performed 130 zzso incremental zzso tests for zzso symptoms with pulmonary and zzso artery zzso in zzso Pulmonary vascular limit was defined as pulmonary vascular resistance at maximum exercise zzso zzso zzso and a zzso systemic oxygen delivery zzso predicted, without a pulmonary mechanical limit or poor zzso We applied a previously reported zzso zzso zzso to each patient and zzso manipulated branch point threshold values to maximize zzso 

The sensitivity of the original zzso zzso for pulmonary vascular limit was zzso specificity was zzso and accuracy was zzso zzso did not change with systematic zzso of zzso threshold values, but specificity and accuracy improved to zzso and zzso zzso zzso improved most by zzso the threshold values for percent predicted maximum oxygen zzso and carbon dioxide output zzso zzso at zzso zzso 

zzso zzso exercise testing is a useful tool for detecting and excluding a pulmonary vascular limit and for determining whether abnormal pulmonary zzso limit zzso zzso
