Deaf sign language transmitted by video requires a zzso resolution of 8 to 10 zzso for effective zzso Conventional videoconferencing applications, when operated over low bandwidth telephone lines, provide very low zzso resolution of pictures, of the order of less than a frame per second, resulting in jerky movement of zzso This paper presents a practical solution for sign language communication, offering adequate zzso resolution of images using moving zzso sketches or zzso implemented on standard personal computer hardware with low-cost cameras and zzso over telephone zzso To extract cartoon points an efficient feature extraction zzso zzso to the global statistics of the image is zzso To improve the zzso quality of the zzso images, irreversible zzso techniques, such as isolated point removal and zzso zzso are zzso A simple, efficient and fast zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso of successive zzso reduces the additive and zzso noise from low-cost zzso An efficient three-dimensional zzso zzso scheme codes the zzso zzso zzso tests performed on the system confirm that it can be used for sign language communication over telephone zzso
