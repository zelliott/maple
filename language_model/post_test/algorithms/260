Currently, the precursor zzso selection strategies in zzso mainly choose the most prominent zzso signals for zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins are identified by zzso of many zzso whereas proteins of lower abundance might elude zzso We present a novel, zzso and zzso approach for precursor zzso selection that significantly increases the efficiency of an zzso analysis by decreasing data zzso and analysis zzso By simulating different strategies for precursor zzso selection on an existing data set, we compare our method to existing zzso strategies and evaluate its performance with regard to mass zzso database size, and sample zzso
