We investigated the hypothesis that zzso charge zzso zzso exchange in zzso with continuous zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso having approximately the same size zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but different net charge zzso and zzso zzso were test zzso Each zzso was labeled with the fluorescent probe zzso zzso zzso did not significantly change zzso size, but increased negative charge on each zzso by one zzso zzso An in zzso fluorescent microscope technique zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 252 zzso zzso zzso 21): zzso zzso was used to measure zzso zzso zzso zzso in single zzso of zzso zzso at zzso degrees zzso The mean P for zzso measured when zzso pressure was 10 zzso was zzso X zzso zzso and the mean P for zzso was zzso X zzso zzso Our results conform to the hypothesis that the zzso pathways of zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso With the use of a zzso model for zzso zzso charge density in the zzso is estimated as zzso zzso zzso of measured Ps with those for small zzso in zzso zzso zzso indicates that molecular size is a zzso more significant zzso of zzso zzso in continuous zzso than is zzso zzso
