The zzso of a zzso zzso or a zzso down an zzso tube increases the resistance to gas flow down the zzso The extent to which this occurs depends on the relative diameters of the zzso tube and the zzso introduced zzso This study zzso a laboratory model to zzso this effect, using a steady flow down an zzso between two tubes whose long axes lie zzso Two diameters of an zzso tube were zzso to represent flow down adult and zzso zzso zzso these were of internal diameter zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and of length zzso 555 zzso A steady flow of air was generated to pass through the model zzso zzso zzso were calculated to give Re of approximately zzso for the larger zzso tube, and of approximately zzso for the zzso These values zzso to clinically appropriate zzso in adult and zzso patients, zzso The pressure drop zzso down the zzso tube was measured initially without any zzso using a zzso pressure zzso zzso of diameter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were introduced into the larger diameter zzso tube, while zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were introduced into the smaller one, and flow was restored to its original zzso The pressure drops zzso down the zzso tubes were measured with the zzso introduced a length zzso into the tube, to zzso zzso zzso and to zzso zzso zzso zzso are compared with a theoretical calculation on the basis of zzso flow for concentric zzso If a sampling tube or zzso zzso is used down the length of an zzso zzso tube, the results show that for most values of zzso there is a significant rise in zzso Where a flexible zzso is used down an zzso tube or a telescope down a rigid zzso the value of zzso may also increase unacceptably where zzso is zzso The results show that for equal zzso and equal values of zzso zzso are lower for higher values of Re than for zzso and that for lower values of Re there is a more rapid increase in zzso as zzso increases, than for higher zzso especially at low values of zzso This result zzso confirms clinical experience; that care must be taken in introducing a zzso down a zzso zzso zzso zzso of these results from the theoretical calculation is less for the smaller Reynolds numbers and smaller values of zzso because under these conditions the flow is more likely to be zzso with a greater degree of zzso
