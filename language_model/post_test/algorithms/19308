A major problem in clinical management of patients with zzso zzso cancer zzso is the largely unpredictable response to zzso treatment and the occurrence of zzso after complete initial response, associated with broad zzso to even structurally dissimilar zzso During tumor development and zzso multiple zzso zzso take place that might contribute specifically to the treatment response and eventually impact on disease zzso One area of intense research is the identification of molecular markers to accurately assess the prognosis of zzso patients and to define innovative therapeutic zzso A large survey of recent published data indicates the need to revisit traditional molecular markers with respect to their contribution to the assessment of overall survival in selected zzso Furthermore, recent technological developments that enable simultaneous measurement of many parameters zzso zzso hold the promise of identifying new molecular zzso and zzso zzso
