To compare the deposition of zzso particles into bovine zzso by diffusion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 10 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (10 zzso and zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso zzso at 400 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso particle movements induced at 10, 400, and zzso zzso zzso were analyzed with light zzso and stack imaging in real zzso zzso zzso were measured at various zzso depths using wavelength zzso zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso post hoc zzso zzso zzso 

zzso levels in teeth treated with zzso were significantly higher than diffusion at depths 10 and 20 zzso zzso and diffusion were relatively ineffective at greater zzso The highest zzso zzso at 10, 20, and 50 zzso depths were found in the zzso zzso After 20 minutes, zzso increased zzso zzso by zzso at 50 zzso and zzso at 100 zzso compared to baseline levels zzso zzso zzso zzso particle movement was induced by negative zzso at 10 zzso positive zzso at zzso zzso and zzso at 400 zzso zzso
