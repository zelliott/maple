Researchers use zzso zzso to reveal large-scale organization in biological and social networks, but community detection is useful only if the communities are significant and not a result of noisy zzso To assess the statistical significance of the network communities, or the zzso of the detected structure, one approach is to zzso the network structure by removing links and measure how much the communities zzso However, zzso sparse networks is challenging because they are inherently zzso they shatter easily if links are zzso Here we propose a simple method to zzso sparse networks and assess the significance of their zzso We generate zzso networks by adding extra links based on local information, then we zzso the information from multiple zzso networks to find a zzso description of significant zzso In addition to testing our method on benchmark networks, we use our method on the sparse network of the European Court of Justice zzso case law, to detect significant and insignificant areas of zzso We use our significance analysis to draw a map of the zzso case law network that reveals the relations between the areas of zzso
