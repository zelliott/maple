The quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction zzso remains a cornerstone technique in gene expression analysis and sequence zzso Despite the importance of the approach to experimental biology, the confident assignment of reaction efficiency to the early cycles of real-time zzso reactions remains zzso zzso noise may be generated when few cycles in the amplification are available to estimate peak zzso An alternate approach that uses data from beyond the zzso amplification phase is explored in this article with the aim of reducing noise and adding confidence to efficiency zzso zzso reaction efficiency is zzso to estimate the zzso profile of an zzso departed peak efficiency even when this is not closely zzso in the measurable zzso The process can be repeated over replicates to develop a robust estimate of peak reaction zzso This leads to an estimate of the maximum reaction efficiency that may be considered primer design zzso Using a series of biological scenarios, we demonstrate that this approach can provide an accurate estimate of initial template zzso
