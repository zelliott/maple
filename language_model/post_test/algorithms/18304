zzso zzso zzso was recently introduced as a very fast and robust zzso to detect dynamic complexity changes in time zzso It was also suggested as a useful screening zzso for zzso events in zzso zzso In the present work, we tested its efficacy on scalp zzso data recorded from three zzso zzso With a receiver operating characteristics zzso analysis, we evaluated the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso resulting from zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, the dependency of zzso on vigilance state was tested by correlation zzso A good zzso of zzso and zzso phase was found, nevertheless zzso was shown to be sensitive to changes in vigilance zzso The changes of zzso during the zzso phase and at seizure onset coincided with changes in vigilance state, restricting its possible use for seizure prediction on scalp zzso this finding however suggests its possible usefulness for an automated zzso of vigilance zzso
