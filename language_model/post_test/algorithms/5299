Forensic zzso can provide significant supporting evidence during criminal zzso However, it is still an zzso field of investigation with its most common application limited to identifying specific as well as suspected illegal zzso The ubiquitous presence of plant species can be useful in zzso but the absence of an accurate identification system remains the major obstacle to the present inability to routinely and correctly identify trace zzso zzso Many plant materials cannot be identified and differentiated to the species level by traditional zzso characteristics when zzso specimens are zzso and lack physical zzso By taking advantage of a universal zzso system, DNA sequencing, and other zzso techniques used routinely in forensic zzso two zzso DNA regions were evaluated for their use as zzso markers for plant identification in the field of zzso We therefore investigated the forensic use of two zzso zzso regions, zzso and zzso to create a zzso system for species identification that could be useful throughout the plant zzso The sequences from 63 plants belonging to our local zzso were submitted and registered on the zzso zzso zzso comparison to set up the level of identification zzso zzso or zzso through zzso zzso allowed us to assess the suitability of this zzso The results confirmed the effectiveness of our zzso universal zzso zzso in forensic zzso
