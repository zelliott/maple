To examine the zzso profile of zzso in cats before and during zzso induced zzso 

8 zzso zzso young adult, female zzso 

zzso was administered zzso as a single zzso and 72 hours later by zzso zzso the cats were zzso for 5 weeks with zzso zzso zzso of body weight, zzso once zzso to induce zzso zzso zzso zzso 217 zzso 17 zzso Blood samples were obtained at appropriate intervals before and during zzso and were analyzed for plasma zzso concentration by use of zzso liquid zzso 

In all zzso a zzso model best described the control and zzso intravenous zzso The change in zzso status from zzso to zzso caused a significant zzso zzso zzso but small reduction in zzso area under the curve zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso 1,400 zzso after zzso zzso In contrast, after oral administration during the zzso state, a twofold increase zzso zzso zzso in zzso area under the curve zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso 112,000 zzso and peak serum zzso concentration zzso zzso 247 zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso were attributed to significant zzso zzso zzso increase in zzso zzso caused by increased fractional zzso zzso zzso zzso vs 137 zzso zzso and decreased total body clearance zzso zzso 27 zzso vs 30 zzso 19 zzso Mean arrival time after oral dosing was significantly zzso by zzso zzso zzso 38 minutes vs 157 zzso 71 zzso 

zzso changes in zzso zzso may signal the need to reduce doses of zzso when they are orally administered to zzso zzso
