zzso are proposed for comparing two diagnostic tests for the same data where a threshold for positive for each test is zzso One method contrasts the diagnostic zzso estimated zzso A second method compares the two zzso zzso zzso When thresholds for positive test results are specified a zzso maximum likelihood zzso and their zzso zzso are derived and test statistics are presented for both zzso and zzso methods of zzso The zzso is proposed as a method to assess differences in risk zzso when thresholds for positive test results are chosen by scanning the zzso Examples are given to illustrate the zzso
