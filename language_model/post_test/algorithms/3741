The zzso head group containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso are major zzso zzso components playing an important role in forming membrane zzso and serve as precursor of signaling zzso Both lipids can be monitored by positive zzso mode zzso tandem mass zzso using a parent zzso scan of zzso zzso Although PC species appear at even zzso and zzso species at odd zzso there may be a significant overlap of their zzso In order to separate PC and zzso species, an isotope correction zzso was established, which zzso calculated isotope percentages to correct the measured peak zzso for their zzso zzso We could demonstrate that this approach was zzso to correct the isotope overlap resulting from spiked PC and zzso zzso zzso was achieved by addition of different PC and zzso species prior to zzso zzso The developed zzso showed a precision, detection limit and zzso sufficient for routine zzso Furthermore, an analysis time of only zzso zzso combined with automated data analysis using zzso Excel zzso allows zzso zzso In zzso this zzso may be a valuable tool for detailed zzso analysis of PC and zzso species in a variety of sample zzso
