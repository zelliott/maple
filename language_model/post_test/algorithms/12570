The apparent zzso motion in an image zzso called optical flow, is a useful primitive for automatic scene analysis and various other applications of computer zzso In general, however, the optical flow zzso suffers from two significant problems: the problem of zzso that varies with time and the problem of motion zzso induced by objects moving with respect to either other objects or with respect to the zzso Various integrated approaches for solving these two problems simultaneously have been zzso Of these, those that are based on the zzso zzso Median of zzso appear to be the most zzso The goal of this paper is to carry out an error analysis of two different zzso approaches, one based on the standard zzso zzso and the other using a modification zzso as proposed by us zzso While it is to be expected that the zzso accuracy of any approach would decrease with increasing levels of noise, for zzso methods, it is not always clear as to how much of that decrease in performance can be attributed to the fact that only a small number of randomly selected samples is used for forming temporary zzso To answer this question, our study here includes a baseline zzso in which all of the image data is used for forming motion zzso We then compare the zzso errors of the two zzso methods with the baseline zzso Our error analysis demonstrates that, for the case of zzso noise, our modified zzso approach yields better estimates at moderate levels of noise, but is outperformed by the standard zzso method as the level of noise zzso For the case of zzso noise, the modified zzso method consistently performs better than the standard zzso zzso
