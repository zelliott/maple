In this paper, a parallel zzso zzso approach is proposed for the problem of zzso electroencephalogram zzso patterns zzso The approach is based on zzso representation of the zzso signals using a parallel combination of zzso where each model represents a particular zzso The performance of the proposed zzso is studied using an artificial zzso database, and two real zzso zzso a database of two classes of zzso zzso during a task of imagery of hand upward and downward movements of a computer screen zzso zzso zzso and a database of two classes of zzso zzso zzso during a zzso zzso motor imagery task zzso zzso The results show that the proposed zzso zzso other commonly used methods with zzso rate improvement of 2 and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso III, zzso In addition, the proposed method zzso a support zzso machine zzso with a linear zzso when both zzso zzso the same feature zzso The results also show that a model architecture which includes a zzso scheme with no zzso five states and three zzso zzso the other tested zzso due to the fact that it allows a better modeling of the zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso
