We use the zzso zzso and synthesis allow dramatically enhanced nuclear zzso method to achieve zzso polarization of approximately zzso in seconds in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso are observed as a function of zzso and the line broadening of C1 is pronounced in the region of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso needed for spin order transfer vary with pH and are best resolved at low pH leading to our use of pH approximately 3 for both the molecular addition of zzso to zzso zzso and the subsequent transfer of spin order from the nascent zzso to C1 of the zzso acid zzso The methods described here may zzso to zzso of other zzso zzso The C1 zzso relaxation time at neutral pH and zzso T is measured as 27 s in zzso and 56 s in zzso Together with known rates of zzso zzso in zzso this allows an estimate of the prospects for the molecular zzso of zzso
