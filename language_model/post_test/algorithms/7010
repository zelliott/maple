A zzso database search scheme is proposed for modeling zzso zzso and zzso regions of zzso zzso proteins up to six zzso in zzso In the first step, geometric zzso the number of zzso involved and target distances corresponding to the separation of C alpha atom positions adjacent to the zzso segment, are zzso In the second step, a database of high-resolution X-ray structures is scanned for segments with similar zzso and selected segments are zzso according to zzso zzso In the third and fourth steps, the selected zzso are zzso into the zzso and geometric and energetic criteria are used to determine their viability as segment zzso The fifth step consists of an interaction scheme in which the geometric zzso are zzso This compensates for the use of a limited database and/or for the use of a poor original protein model adjacent to the missing zzso The procedure has been tested on zzso zzso in the zzso proteins zzso and zzso and on the zzso regions of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and human zzso The test cases represent a wide variety of secondary structural elements zzso sheet, turn and zzso and zzso lengths zzso to 4 zzso It is shown that zzso of the test cases are accurately modeled zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso using the proposed zzso Failure of the scheme zzso atom zzso zzso greater than zzso zzso in zzso of the cases appears to be related to the presence of infrequently observed zzso or locally unique folds of the target proteins with respect to the database zzso of the test zzso the remaining zzso are zzso Geometric and energetic criteria are able to discriminate between trial zzso that zzso to the X-ray structures and those that are different in zzso of the zzso generated by the zzso database search zzso The scheme is shown to be relatively insensitive to uncertainty in the template zzso since the geometric zzso were taken from the zzso protein zzso zzso in the position of zzso range from zzso to zzso A for the accurately modeled test zzso It is demonstrated that the scheme can be used to correct local sequence zzso
