zzso point detection is an important task for several problems in discrete zzso such as zzso preserving thinning in image processing to zzso discrete zzso In this paper, the approach to simple point detection is based on techniques from zzso zzso a framework zzso suited for problems in image zzso A zzso zzso cube (for a zzso digital zzso is associated with every discrete picture element, instead of a point in zzso (the zzso zzso zzso as has been done zzso A simple point in this setting then refers to the removal of a zzso cube without changing the zzso of the zzso complex induced by the digital zzso The main result is a characterization of a simple point p zzso simple zzso zzso in terms of the zzso groups of the zzso - 1) neighborhood of p for arbitrary, finite dimensions
