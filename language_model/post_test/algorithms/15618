Moore's Law states that the processing power of zzso doubles every one to two zzso This observation might apply to the nascent field of molecular zzso in which zzso carry out logical zzso zzso of new technologies that improve sensitivity and zzso has increased the complexity of problems that can be zzso It is an ultimate goal for molecular computers to use the full potential of massive zzso
