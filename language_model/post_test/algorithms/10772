A method to convert integrated electronic portal imaging device zzso images to zzso for the purpose of reconstructing the dose to a phantom is investigated here for simple open zzso Ultimately, the goal is to develop a method to reconstruct the dose to zzso The zzso images are transformed into incident intensity zzso by spatial filtering with a zzso zzso The kernel uses a general mathematical form derived from a zzso Carlo calculation of the point spread function of an zzso The zzso kernel is fitted using a downhill search zzso that zzso the difference between the reconstructed dose and the dose measured in zzso The beam profile zzso that are removed by the zzso zzso procedure are restored to the resulting images by direct zzso using the measured zzso zzso zzso zzso the fitted kernel to an zzso image provides the incident zzso for that zzso This beam zzso is then entered into an independent dose calculation zzso for phantom or patient dose zzso The phantom dose was zzso to an accuracy of zzso of the zzso dose at one standard zzso The method is general and can possibly be applied to any zzso equipped with an integration zzso We demonstrate the application of the fitted kernel in two clinical zzso zzso
