This study examined the characteristics and operational parameters of the zzso reduction of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso in order to produce zzso acid zzso zzso Eight operational variables were also zzso using the zzso method with consideration of the freshness of zzso cells as a noise zzso An zzso zzso array was used to design the zzso The reaction yield and the product's optical purity were considered as two product quality zzso A zzso function was applied to combine these two qualities as a single objective zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso ratio was used to estimate the zzso in product zzso zzso was undertaken not only to yield the best performance, but also to minimize the variation in zzso The confirmation experiments indicated that the reaction performance and the zzso of the product quality under the zzso conditions were higher than those obtained in other experiments in this zzso Our results further demonstrate that the product's optical purity could be increased to zzso by adjusting the operational level of the main zzso
