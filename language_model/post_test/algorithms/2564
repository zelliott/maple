zzso functional theory zzso and zzso density functional theory zzso calculations were carried out to simulate the molecular and electronic structures together with the electronic zzso zzso of a series of peripheral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, 2, 3, and zzso zzso charge distribution and zzso potential analysis indicate that the presence of zzso and zzso groups leads to the zzso of charges and obvious polarization effects to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso groups introduced onto zzso ring were revealed to destroy the zzso of zzso resulting in significant zzso splitting for the zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso and zinc zzso compounds display similar electronic structures and zzso due to the almost none contribution of the zinc atom or inner zzso to the frontier molecular zzso The microscopic mechanism of the zzso zzso has been clarified on the basis of zzso zzso electron zzso These theoretical studies would be helpful for the molecular design of novel zzso zzso
