Clinical application of zzso tissue characterization zzso zzso through the chest zzso Different distances between zzso and zzso region of interest result in variable zzso zzso zzso meaningful comparisons of zzso echo intensity zzso are difficult with current zzso The present study aims at the zzso and compensation of zzso zzso zzso Ten zzso 14 patients with mild zzso zzso 7) or moderate zzso zzso 7) zzso left zzso zzso and 10 transplant candidates were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signals of zzso long axis zzso were zzso Mean zzso echo zzso were determined in zzso and zzso wall regions of zzso The slope of zzso was determined from these clinically obtained data by plotting the distances between zzso and regions of interest against zzso echo zzso An zzso zzso derived from this slope was used for compensation of the zzso losses of zzso echo zzso Compared with zzso compensated mean zzso echo zzso were significantly lower in mild or moderate zzso left zzso zzso but showed no significant difference in transplant zzso Despite several limitations, the method employed in this study appears to be a possible approach to in zzso zzso and compensation of zzso
