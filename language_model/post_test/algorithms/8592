The activity of motor zzso zzso zzso conveys movement intent sufficiently well to be used as a control signal to operate artificial devices, but until now this has called for extensive training or has been confined to a limited movement zzso Here we show how activity from a few zzso zzso zzso can be zzso into a signal that a monkey is able to use immediately to move a computer zzso to any new position in its zzso zzso degrees zzso 14 degrees visual zzso Our results, which are based on recordings made by an zzso array that is suitable for human use, indicate that zzso based control of movement may eventually be feasible in zzso zzso
