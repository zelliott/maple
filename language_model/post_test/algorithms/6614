zzso flux rate from soil is one of the most important factors for the evaluation of environmental zzso zzso The objective of our study is to make a rough zzso of the nationwide zzso flux rate from soil in zzso Considering the zzso to the large area and complex distribution of soil types in China, a simple model was zzso To test the model, field zzso on zzso flux rate totally in 47 points from different areas were carried out from spring to summer in zzso Laboratory experiments of each soil sample on related soil properties, such as zzso zzso water zzso soil dry bulk density and soil texture were performed zzso zzso zzso of the samples had very consistent calculated values with their measured values, their relative errors were less than zzso In spite of the large uncertainties in the model which is influenced by so many factors, the considerable validation of the model can be zzso Based on the discussion of distribution of the errors as well as the reasons causing the zzso a trial modification of the model was zzso A modification function looked necessary when soil water content was zzso
