This article proposes a novel and general mixture component model, the features of which include a zzso structure with random effects, mixture components characterized by zzso linear zzso and mixing mechanisms governed by zzso zzso The model was developed as a consequence of attending to long-standing psychological theory about schizophrenic zzso Scientifically revealing results are obtained by fitting the model to a data set concerning zzso and schizophrenic zzso behavior under different zzso Included are descriptions of the zzso for model fitting, specifically the zzso zzso for large sample modal zzso and the Gibbs zzso for simulating the zzso zzso For guidance on model comparison and selection, we use zzso zzso check zzso to obtain zzso zzso zzso for likelihood ratio statistics, which do not have zzso zzso 2 reference zzso These zzso zzso zzso suggest that all the mixture components in our model are zzso The final model is selected using a combination of scientific zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of relevant zzso
