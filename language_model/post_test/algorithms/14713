We address the problem of zzso zzso design for extended target recognition in cognitive radar zzso A zzso active target recognition radar system is extended to the case of a zzso cognitive radar network, in which a generalized likelihood ratio zzso based sequential hypothesis testing zzso framework is zzso Using zzso zzso measured by multiple zzso the target aspect angle for each radar is zzso The joint probability of each target hypothesis is then updated using observations from different radar line of sights zzso Based on these zzso a minimum correlation zzso is proposed to zzso design the transmit zzso for each radar in an zzso fluctuation zzso zzso results demonstrate performance improvements due to the cognitive radar network and zzso zzso zzso Our minimum correlation zzso zzso the zzso solution and other zzso zzso design zzso
