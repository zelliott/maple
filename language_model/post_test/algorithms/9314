zzso reconstruction from zzso zzso serial sections substantially differs from modeling body parts by linking convoluted planes delivered by CT and zzso zzso variations both in relative zzso position and rotation of the target elements between the adjacent images and also additional problems caused by zzso deteriorated or missing sections can only be overruled by an aligning zzso which exploits all the zzso information, and results in an optimal fitting with selected zzso This paper presents a complex computer program called zzso zzso which performs the precise zzso of zzso shift and relative rotation of two consecutive zzso The required searching process will be customized by setting four independent parameters which relate the span and density of the zzso basic zzso zzso of fitting accuracy versus running time can be achieved by a rather short training zzso The potential precision of zzso zzso based on complex zzso is far superior to manual aligning of zzso photographs with the zzso zzso The resulted database of alignment orientation parameters can serve as an advanced source for the zzso reconstructing zzso zzso zzso software tool zzso by Hungarian Space Office grant zzso zzso will be demonstrated on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso performed in zzso zzso laboratory zzso by zzso grant zzso
