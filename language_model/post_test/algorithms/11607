zzso zzso for six base pairs have been zzso at a variety of efficient levels of electronic structure theory and compared to zzso In addition to previously defined levels of theory, modified zzso with adjusted parameters in hybrid zzso zzso and zzso zzso models were zzso Of the pure and hybrid density functional levels, zzso performed most zzso as judged by comparison not only to the available experimental data, but also to data from more robust electronic structure methods for 22 additional base zzso The low zzso cost of the zzso model was further exploited in an investigation of various base zzso zzso and one base zzso A carefully zzso zzso model, zzso was able to achieve similar levels of accuracy at a still greater savings in terms of zzso zzso
