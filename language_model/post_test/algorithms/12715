The medicinal plant zzso zzso zzso zzso has demonstrated an array of biological activities that are generally attributed to the presence of zzso and other zzso Recently this plant has been of interest due to its potential for the treatment and prevention of zzso 

The aim of this study was to develop a liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso method for rapid identification and zzso of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso 

zzso extracts were prepared from fresh zzso zzso using different percentages of ethanol and were stored at zzso zzso and zzso zzso was isolated and used as a standard for quantitative zzso 

zzso parameters for the zzso analysis of zzso were as zzso zzso zzso zzso intermediate precision, zzso zzso range, zzso limit of zzso zzso and limit of zzso zzso Eight zzso in the zzso zzso extract were identified based on zzso fragmentation patterns, and zzso analysis confirmed the identity of the most abundant of these as zzso zzso was extracted most efficiently in zzso containing zzso ethanol, and was stable in zzso extracts stored at all three zzso 

These results demonstrate the effectiveness of zzso for quantitative and qualitative analysis of zzso We show that zzso is effectively extracted in ethanol, and is stable in ethanol extracts for over 6 months, even at room zzso
