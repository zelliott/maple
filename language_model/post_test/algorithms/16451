zzso zzso analysis using an optimal sensor set and a reliable zzso would be useful in the gait zzso An original approach for ambulatory zzso of zzso angles in anatomical coordinate system is zzso which is composed of a zzso zzso and zzso zzso To test the approach, a zzso monitoring system composed of zzso and zzso was developed and evaluated on lower zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso rotation angles of the knee joint in the anatomical joint coordinate system were zzso In this method, since there is no integration of angular acceleration or angular zzso the result is not distorted by offset and zzso The three zzso angles within the anatomical coordinate system are independent of the orders, which must be considered when zzso angles are zzso Besides, since there are no physical sensors implanted in the knee joint based on the zzso algorithm, it is feasible to analyze zzso zzso with less numbers and types of sensors than those mentioned in some others zzso Compared with results from the reference system, the developed zzso sensor system is available to do gait analysis with fewer sensors and high degree of zzso
