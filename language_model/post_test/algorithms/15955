zzso interaction models to recognize native folds are designed and zzso Different sets of parameters are considered but the focus was on 20 zzso 20 contact zzso zzso solution of zzso and zzso of the zzso of the energy find zzso that recognize exactly the native folds of zzso sequences and structures from the protein data bank zzso The set includes many zzso pairs, which present a difficult recognition zzso zzso recognition ability is recovered with a small number of parameters zzso the zzso zzso However, full recognition requires a complete set of zzso zzso In addition to structures from the zzso a folding program zzso was used to generate decoy structures for 75 zzso It is impossible to recognize all the native structures of the extended set by contact zzso We therefore searched for a new functional zzso An energy function zzso which is based on a sum of general zzso interactions limited to a resolution of 1 zzso is zzso This set was zzso zzso We therefore conjecture that it is not possible to find a folding potential, resolved to 1 zzso which is a sum of pair zzso
