A novel zzso approach to zzso the intensity frequency range of the object based on supervision is zzso It consists of three zzso First, the region of interest zzso is determined in the zzso Then, from the zzso of the zzso the frequency range in which the proportion of the background to the zzso varies is estimated through zzso Finally, the threshold is determined by minimizing the zzso error within the constrained variable background zzso The performance of the approach has been validated against 54 brain MR images, including images with severe intensity zzso and/or noise, CT chest images, and the zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso methods, the proposed approach is substantially more robust and more zzso It is also zzso efficient and can be applied to a wide class of computer vision problems, such as character recognition, fingerprint zzso and zzso of a wide variety of medical zzso
