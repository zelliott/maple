zzso zzso zzso produced by densely zzso space radiation are not located randomly in the zzso recent data indicate zzso zzso along zzso zzso zzso at large zzso from zzso zzso down to approximately 2 zzso is modeled using a zzso zzso A zzso model of zzso is combined with a track model, that predicts the zzso distribution of energy from an zzso and the zzso zzso zzso in software called zzso This model zzso the zzso model, whose zzso zzso distribution is zzso to zzso zzso zzso induction due to track interaction with the DNA volume depends on the radiation quality zzso zzso This zzso zzso depends only zzso on zzso zzso high-dose effects depend on the cluster intensity zzso zzso zzso to zzso as defined by the zzso zzso After zzso is determined by a zzso experiment, the model reduces to one adjustable zzso zzso The best zzso fits to the experimental data, determining zzso are zzso The knowledge of zzso and Q allows us to give zzso based extrapolations of high-dose DNA zzso data to low doses or to high zzso
