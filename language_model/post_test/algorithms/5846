In this paper, we propose a new zzso model for pattern formation and regulation in a zzso zzso namely zzso The model is defined in the form of a system of zzso equations with zzso boundary conditions coupled with a system of ordinary differential zzso The production of zzso zzso molecules has a zzso dependence on the density of these molecules and is modeled by additional ordinary differential zzso We study the zzso mechanism of pattern formation and we demonstrate the advantages and constraints of its ability to explain different aspects of pattern formation and regulation in zzso The properties of the model demonstrate a range of stationary and zzso zzso zzso patterns, arising from multiple zzso homogeneous steady states and switches in the production zzso
