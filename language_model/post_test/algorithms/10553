Parallel zzso zzso and sequencing experiments produce vast quantities of zzso data which must be arranged and analyzed in a concerted zzso One approach to addressing this challenge is the machine learning technique known as self organizing maps zzso zzso enable a parallel zzso and zzso view of zzso data combined with strong zzso and zzso analysis zzso The paper aims at bridging the gap between the potency of zzso learning to reduce dimension of zzso data on one hand and practical applications with special emphasis on gene expression analysis on the other zzso 

The method was applied to generate a zzso characterizing the whole zzso expression profiles of 67 healthy human zzso selected from ten tissue categories zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sexual zzso muscle, immune system and nervous zzso zzso mapping reduces the dimension of expression data from ten of thousands of genes to a few thousand zzso each representing a zzso of zzso single zzso zzso and common properties shared between groups of zzso emerge as a handful of localized spots in the tissue maps collecting groups of zzso and zzso zzso The functional context of the spots was discovered using overrepresentation analysis with respect to zzso gene sets of known functional zzso We found that tissue related spots typically contain enriched populations of genes related to specific molecular processes in the respective zzso Analysis techniques normally used at the zzso such as zzso zzso zzso are better represented and provide better zzso ratios if applied to the zzso zzso zzso analyses zzso the zzso broadly into three clusters containing nervous, immune system and the remaining zzso 

The zzso technique provides a more intuitive and zzso global view of the behavior of a few zzso zzso of correlated and zzso expressed genes than the separate discovery of the expression levels of hundreds or thousands of individual zzso The program is available as zzso zzso
