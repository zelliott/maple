zzso image registration plays an important role in medical image zzso The principle of zzso image registration is to align a given set of images to a hidden template space in an zzso manner without explicitly selecting any individual image as the zzso Although many approaches have been proposed to address the zzso image registration problem for registering a single group of images, few attentions and efforts have been paid to the registration problem between two or more different groups of zzso In this paper, we propose a statistical framework to address the registration problems between two different image zzso The main contributions of this paper lie in the following aspects: zzso In this paper, we demonstrate that directly registering the group mean images estimated from two different image groups is not sufficient to establish the reliable transformation from one image group to the other image zzso zzso A novel statistical framework is proposed to extract anatomical features from the white matter, gray matter and zzso fluid tissue maps of all aligned images as zzso signatures for each zzso The extracted features provide much richer anatomical information than the zzso intensity of the group mean image, and can be integrated with the zzso Demons registration zzso to perform the registration zzso zzso The proposed method has been extensively evaluated on two publicly available brain zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso databases, and it is also compared with a conventional zzso image registration approach which directly performs zzso registration between the group mean images of two image zzso Experimental results show that the proposed method consistently achieves higher registration accuracy than the method under zzso
