The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between zzso movement and facial zzso parameters measured using zzso CT zzso 

We have developed a zzso movement tracking and simulation zzso The zzso movement data were acquired from 22 subjects (6 males and 16 zzso 3 who had no clinical facial zzso and 19 who had zzso zzso The subjects voluntarily performed maximum mouth opening and closing zzso zzso maximum linear movements of selected points zzso zzso zzso and zzso were calculated to represent zzso zzso zzso zzso values were measured zzso from CT data and bilateral zzso values were divided into 2 groups according to the zzso zzso the deviated side, and zzso side zzso zzso zzso were calculated to evaluate the relationship between zzso movements and facial zzso 

zzso linear movements of all selected points on the zzso were positively correlated with zzso A zzso and zzso B zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso were significantly correlated with zzso zzso lateral zzso body angle, zzso zzso and zzso body zzso zzso movement was positively correlated with lateral zzso body angle and zzso body zzso Multiple zzso linear zzso analysis was performed to evaluate the model predicting the effect of zzso values on zzso zzso zzso movement was associated with the zzso zzso value zzso zzso for the deviated side, zzso value zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and movement of the zzso was associated with both zzso and zzso length zzso value zzso zzso Movement of the zzso could be predicted by zzso zzso zzso and zzso head length zzso value zzso zzso 

The zzso facial zzso values were associated with variations in zzso movement, and zzso parameters contributed to predicting the movement of the zzso with different zzso
