zzso heart disease zzso is the most common cause of heart failure zzso however, the role of zzso in these patients is still zzso Consensus on proper use of cardiac imaging to help determine which candidates should be considered for zzso has been hindered by the absence of clinical studies that zzso and zzso compare the zzso information of each test obtained using both standard and advanced zzso 

This paper describes the design and methods to be used in the Alternative Imaging zzso in zzso Heart Failure zzso zzso zzso The primary objective is to compare the effect of zzso imaging strategies on the composite clinical zzso of cardiac death, zzso zzso zzso cardiac arrest and zzso for cardiac zzso zzso patients with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso will follow zzso imaging strategy zzso according to the zzso asked by the physicians (for example, Is there zzso and/or zzso in agreement with local zzso Patients will be zzso to either standard zzso Single zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso for zzso and/or viability or advanced imaging zzso cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, eligible and zzso patients who could not be randomized, but were allocated to standard or advanced imaging based on clinical decisions, will be included in a zzso 

zzso will be the largest zzso trial evaluating the role of standard and advanced imaging zzso in the management of zzso zzso and heart zzso This trial will complement the results of the zzso Treatment for zzso Heart Failure zzso viability zzso and the PET and Recovery Following zzso zzso zzso The results will provide policy makers with data to support (or zzso further investment in and wider dissemination of alternative zzso imaging zzso
