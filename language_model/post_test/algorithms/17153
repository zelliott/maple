Medical diagnosis and therapy planning at modern intensive care units zzso have been refined by the technical improvement of their zzso However, the bulk of continuous data arising from complex monitoring systems in combination with zzso assessed zzso and qualitative data creates a rising information management problem at zzso zzso zzso We developed methods for data validation and therapy planning which incorporate knowledge about point and zzso data, as well as expected qualitative trend descriptions to arrive at unified qualitative descriptions of parameters zzso data zzso Our methods are based on zzso for zzso transformation and curve fitting which express the dynamics of and the reactions to different degrees of zzso abnormalities as well as on smoothing and adjustment mechanisms to keep the qualitative descriptions zzso We show their zzso in detecting anomalous system behavior early, in recommending therapeutic actions, and in assessing the effectiveness of these actions within a certain zzso We implemented our methods in zzso an zzso zzso monitoring and therapy planning system for artificially zzso newborn zzso The zzso and usefulness of our approach are illustrated by examples of zzso Finally, we present our first experiences with using zzso in a real clinical zzso
