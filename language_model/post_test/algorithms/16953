Time course expression analysis constitutes a large portion of applications of zzso zzso One primary goal of such experiments is to detect genes with the zzso changes over a period of time or at some interested time zzso zzso arising from data with small number of replicates over only a few zzso time points in multiple groups pose challenges for efficient statistical zzso Some known methods are limited by the zzso assumptions or by the scope of applications for only two zzso We present a new method for detecting zzso expressed genes under zzso time course experiments in multiple zzso The new method first models the time course curve of one gene by a zzso process to align the zzso time course data and to zzso the zzso of the time course curve as well, the latter of which is used as directional information to enhance the sensitivity of detection for zzso zzso Second, we adopt a zzso method to test a surrogate hypothesis based on the zzso data from the zzso process zzso The proposed method is robust in terms of model fitting and zzso It does not require any zzso assumption for the observations or the test statistic and the method works for the case with as few as zzso samples over four or five time points under multiple zzso We show the effectiveness and superiority of the new method in comparison with some existing methods using simulated models and two real data zzso
