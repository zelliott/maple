zzso zzso imaging zzso constitutes the most used paradigm among the zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso techniques due to its simplicity and application zzso Recently, real-time zzso in zzso has deserved special attention, with several proposals aiming at the zzso of meaningful diffusion parameters during the repetition time of the acquisition zzso zzso focusing on zzso the underlying model of the noise present in the acquired data is not taken into account, leading to a zzso zzso of the diffusion zzso In this paper, we propose an optimal real-time zzso framework for zzso reconstruction in single-coil zzso By including an online zzso of the zzso noise zzso associated to the acquisition process, the proposed method achieves the sequential best linear unbiased zzso zzso on both synthetic and real data show that our method zzso those so far proposed, reaching the best performance of the existing proposals by processing a substantially lower number of diffusion zzso
