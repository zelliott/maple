An alignment of the zzso zzso zzso enabled the identification of sequence zzso specific to the zzso zzso which were used as queries to search for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso half and full-length zzso were found, and a close relationship with zzso zzso 7 zzso was zzso Each half of the zzso zzso is predicted to comprise a zzso domain zzso composed of six zzso and a large zzso loop, followed by a zzso domain zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso which might have a regulatory zzso The zzso predicted for the zzso zzso was compared to the crystal structures of the zzso and zzso bacterial zzso The alignment of the zzso and zzso zzso provided an estimate of the degree of zzso conservation in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso tree of zzso zzso zzso based upon the zzso zzso consists of three major zzso corresponding to the zzso single zzso and to the zzso zzso and zzso A zzso tree of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso confirmed the evolutionary relationship between zzso zzso 7 zzso and zzso zzso half and zzso
