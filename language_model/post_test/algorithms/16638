This paper presents a hybrid control strategy, combining zzso zzso zzso zzso network with conventional zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the greenhouse climate zzso A model of zzso conservation laws of zzso and matter between numerous system variables affecting the greenhouse climate is zzso zzso network is used to tune and identify all zzso gain parameters online and zzso The presented zzso control scheme is validated through simulations of zzso tracking and zzso zzso We compare the proposed zzso online tuning method with the zzso tuning scheme that employs zzso Algorithm zzso to search the optimal gain zzso The results show that the proposed strategy has good zzso strong zzso and real-time performance while achieving satisfactory control performance for the complex and zzso greenhouse climate control system, and it may provide a valuable reference to formulate environmental control strategies for actual application in greenhouse zzso
