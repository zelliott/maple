Typically spatial zzso of the zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso requires many repeated motion cycles limiting the zzso to highly zzso tissue motions zzso This paper describes the validation of a novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso framework for the measurement of complex and dynamic zzso soft tissue deformation following just three motion zzso zzso are applied to zzso induced deformation measurement of the upper arm and a silicone gel zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso methodology is presented allowing continuous zzso sampling of zzso dynamic soft tissue deformation using non segmented zzso zzso The zzso deformation is reconstructed by the combination of three mutually zzso tagging directions, thus requiring only three repeated motion zzso In addition a fully automatic zzso framework is presented employing zzso zzso and zzso analysis for tag zzso zzso and zzso surface fitting aided by zzso filter bank derived surface zzso zzso is derived following tracking of tag surface zzso triangle zzso The dynamic deformation zzso were validated using zzso tests zzso deep at zzso on a silicone gel soft tissue phantom containing contrasting markers which provide a reference measure of zzso In addition, the techniques were evaluated in zzso for dynamic skeletal muscle tissue deformation measurement during zzso of the biceps region of the upper arm in a zzso 

For the phantom and volunteer tag point location precision were 44 and zzso respectively resulting in individual zzso zzso of 61 and zzso zzso For both the phantom and volunteer data cumulative displacement measurement accuracy could be evaluated and the difference between initial and final locations showed a mean and standard zzso of zzso and zzso for the phantom and zzso and zzso for the human zzso Finally accuracy of zzso displacement was evaluated using marker tracking in the silicone gel zzso zzso between true and predicted marker locations showed a mean of zzso and a standard zzso of zzso 

A novel zzso zzso zzso and fully automatic zzso framework for the measurement of complex zzso dynamic soft tissue deformation following just three repeated motion cycles was zzso The techniques demonstrate dynamic measurement of complex zzso soft tissue deformation at zzso accuracy and precision and were validated for zzso sampling of deformation speeds up to zzso
