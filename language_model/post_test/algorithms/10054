The zzso stabilization and growth of zzso is a dynamic process by which developing zzso establish connections with the other elements of the nervous system; this process is under the control of zzso cues, among which zzso factors play a crucial zzso Due to the complexity of the zzso evolution of the zzso network, particularly in the early stages of growth, it is not easy to obtain information about the relevant parameters from qualitative zzso We have developed a quantitative description of the dynamics of production and stabilization of zzso processes in a zzso experimental model of peripheral zzso in culture, and we have combined it with a simulation approach to extract the differences between the zzso in the absence and in the presence of the zzso factor basic zzso Growth Factor zzso We show that the factor rapidly zzso the zzso zzso to a bipolar zzso by shifting the zzso process from a zzso phase to a more ordered and organized zzso
