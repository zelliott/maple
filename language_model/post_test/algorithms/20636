We present an zzso total zzso zzso for computing images of the interior structure of highly scattering media by using the zzso zzso zzso For imaging the dense scattering media in optical zzso a zzso approach has been described previously zzso Wang et zzso zzso zzso zzso 58 zzso zzso zzso Barbour et zzso in Medical zzso zzso zzso Imaging and Monitoring zzso of zzso zzso zzso Bellingham, zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso a zzso equation of the form W delta zzso zzso delta zzso In order to solve this zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso have been used in the past to determine best fits to the measurement data delta I while assuming that the operator zzso W is zzso In practice, errors also occur in the operator zzso Here we propose an zzso total zzso zzso method that zzso the errors in both weights and detector zzso zzso the total zzso zzso solution is given by the singular zzso of the zzso zzso delta zzso associated with the smallest singular zzso The proposed zzso method zzso this solution by using a zzso zzso method that is particularly suitable for very large zzso zzso results have shown that the zzso method can yield a significantly more accurate result than the zzso zzso
