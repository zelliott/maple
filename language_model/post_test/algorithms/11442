In this study, we sought to evaluate the image quality and effective radiation dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso triggered zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients of zzso heart rate and zzso This retrospective cohort study consisted of 41 zzso and 41 matched zzso zzso patients whom underwent clinically indicated zzso dual source zzso between December 2010 to June zzso Image quality and motion artifact score (both on a zzso scale zzso with 4 being the zzso effective dose, and zzso were zzso The effect of heart rate zzso and heart rate zzso zzso on image motion artifact score and zzso was analyzed with zzso correlation zzso All 82 exams were considered diagnostic with 0 zzso zzso zzso zzso patients had a higher maximum HR, wider zzso were less likely to be in zzso rhythm, and received less zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No difference in effective dose was observed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Image quality score zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and motion artifact score zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso were lower in zzso zzso than in zzso zzso For zzso zzso an increase in zzso was not associated with a negative impact on motion artifact score nor zzso For zzso zzso an increase in zzso was associated with increased motion artifacts and zzso zzso demonstrated no correlation with motion artifact and zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, both zzso zzso and zzso zzso yielded diagnostic examinations at zzso heart rates and rhythms with similar effective radiation, but zzso zzso resulted in more consistent radiation exposure and image quality across a wide range of rates and zzso
