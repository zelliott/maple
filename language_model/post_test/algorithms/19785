Several approaches exist for the zzso of proteins in complex samples processed by liquid zzso zzso followed by fragmentation analysis zzso One of these approaches is zzso zzso zzso which takes advantage of the information zzso from zzso spectrum observations to estimate the abundance of a protein in a zzso As a first step in this approach, fragmentation zzso are typically matched to the peptides that generated them by a search zzso Because different search zzso identify overlapping but zzso sets of zzso here we investigate whether these differences in zzso identification have an impact on the zzso of the proteins in the zzso We therefore evaluated the effect of using different search zzso by examining the zzso of protein zzso in technical repeat zzso of the same zzso From our results, it is clear that a search engine effect does exist for zzso zzso protein zzso zzso As a general conclusion, it is recommended to address the overall possibility of search zzso bias in the protein zzso results of zzso zzso methods by performing the analysis with two or more distinct search zzso
