The zzso error of zzso based coded zzso techniques increases with decreasing zzso which causes the zzso of zzso zzso In this paper, a zzso based coded zzso technique with reduced zzso errors through dynamic zzso control is zzso To improve the zzso resolution with no frame rate reduction, the proposed method performs simultaneous transmit zzso focusing using two mutually zzso complementary zzso zzso In the proposed method, the two mutually zzso sequences of length 16 are simultaneously transmitted toward two different focal zzso which are separately compressed into two short zzso on receive after dynamic focusing is zzso After carrying out the same zzso operation for the same scan line with the complementary set of the zzso zzso codes, a single scan line with two transmit zzso is zzso The computer simulation results using a linear array with a center frequency of zzso zzso and zzso 6 zzso bandwidth show that the range zzso level can be suppressed below zzso zzso when zzso is maintained not smaller than zzso The performance of the proposed scheme for a smaller zzso of 2 was also verified through actual experiments using a zzso zzso curved linear array with zzso 6 zzso zzso Both the simulation and experimental results show that the proposed method provides improved lateral resolution compared to the conventional zzso and zzso based coded zzso imaging using zzso zzso
