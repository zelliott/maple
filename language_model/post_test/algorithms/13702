zzso left zzso has been studied for many years as a method for assessing left zzso zzso All currently used quantitative left zzso methods evaluate functional status based on different assumptions concerning the time course of contraction, shape of the zzso zzso and/or fixed points of zzso zzso analyses are performed using only zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso itself not only in spatial zzso zzso area of affected zzso but also in zzso zzso zzso zzso from a zzso contraction during zzso zzso comparisons omit information contained in other frames of the cardiac zzso zzso each single method has a limited reliability or zzso The present study used several quantitative methods, fitted zzso correlation zzso of the percentage of zzso zzso from end zzso to end zzso and zzso zzso of the polar coordinates of the zzso zzso zzso Features were derived from a sequence of zzso of a whole cardiac cycle from patients with anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso and without zzso zzso to address three major zzso zzso zzso features derived from zzso that discriminate between the two patient groups and do so with the highest zzso zzso zzso or lowest error zzso zzso compare the accuracy of features generated by different quantitative zzso and zzso group features generated by the different quantitative methods to achieve higher zzso The zzso capabilities of several feature sets were tested on a patient sample containing 102 patients zzso patients with zzso 39 patients with no zzso using zzso zzso The zzso zzso had a zzso Learning design with two zzso assigning the patients to the two patient zzso Each zzso method showed a characteristic pattern for detecting zzso or normal wall zzso Combining features generated by different extraction methods into one feature set improved the correct zzso zzso
