A national survey of patient doses for diagnostic zzso was planned in the Republic of zzso We performed a pilot study for this survey to develop a protocol of the dose zzso zzso skin doses and organ (including zzso zzso and zzso doses were measured by zzso zzso and calculated by means of zzso Carlo simulations for several diagnostic zzso We derived a formula and used the zzso software for the zzso of entrance skin zzso This formula involves several factors, such as zzso zzso the zzso and aluminum zzso zzso software was applied to obtain zzso entrance zzso which were converted to entrance skin doses by considering the zzso radiation from the zzso zzso doses were measured using a zzso phantom and calculated using a mathematical phantom for several diagnostic zzso zzso significant doses were calculated from zzso and zzso doses for the evaluation of zzso zzso zzso doses were determined from the zzso doses by considering the increase in zzso size with zzso zzso We found that the patient doses studied in this work were all below the reference doses recommended by the National zzso Protection Board of the zzso
