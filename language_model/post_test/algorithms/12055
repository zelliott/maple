zzso of secondary structure prediction have undergone the developments of nearly 30 zzso However, the problem of how to appropriately evaluate and compare zzso has not yet completely zzso A graphic method to evaluate zzso of secondary structure prediction has been proposed zzso Traditionally, the performance of an zzso is evaluated by a number, zzso accuracy of various zzso Instead of a number, we use a graph to completely evaluate an algorithm, in which the mapping points are distributed in a three-dimensional zzso Each point represents the zzso result of the secondary structure of a zzso Because the distribution of mapping points in the zzso space generally contains more information than a number or a set of numbers, it is expected that zzso may be evaluated and compared by the proposed graphic method more zzso Based on the point distribution, six evaluation parameters are proposed, which describe the overall performance of the zzso zzso Furthermore, the graphic method is simple and zzso As an example of application, two advanced zzso zzso the zzso and zzso methods, are evaluated and zzso It is shown that there is still much room for further improvement for both zzso It is pointed out that the accuracy for predicting either the zzso or zzso in proteins with higher zzso or zzso content, respectively, should be greatly improved for both zzso
