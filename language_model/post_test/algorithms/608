Using zzso sum scores in genetic studies of twin data is common zzso This practice zzso an investigation of the measurement model relating the individual items to an underlying zzso zzso of measurement zzso across a grouping variable such as gender or environmental exposure refers to group differences with respect to the measurement zzso It is shown that a decomposition of a sum score into genetic and environmental zzso components leads to path zzso of the additive genetic factor that are biased zzso across groups if individual items are zzso The arising group differences in path zzso are identical to what is known as zzso sex zzso when gender is the grouping zzso or as zzso by environment zzso when environmental exposure is the grouping zzso In both cases the interpretation would be in terms of a zzso effect size of the genetic zzso This interpretation may be incorrect if individual items are zzso
