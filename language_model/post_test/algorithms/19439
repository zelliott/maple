zzso form projected images from illuminated objects, such as cellular zzso which are recorded at a distance through the optical system's field of zzso A telescope on a satellite or airplane also forms images with a similar optical projection of objects on the zzso Typical visible zzso form a displayed set of zzso channels (Red Green Blue zzso that are combined from three image sensor zzso zzso focal plane zzso into a single zzso coding for each color present in the zzso Analysis of these zzso color images develops a qualitative image representation of the zzso 

Independent component analysis zzso is used for analysis and enhancement of zzso images, and compared with the similar and widely used principal component zzso 

The data examples indicate that the zzso enhancement, and the resulting zzso image combination display, can be useful in processing zzso of cellular data where isolation of unknown subtle image elements representing objects is zzso 

zzso image enhancement can aid processing of zzso of cellular data by clarifying subtle image zzso These zzso zzso can be implemented for zzso online zzso
