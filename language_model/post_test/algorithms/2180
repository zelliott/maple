A zzso Carlo simulation model was developed for the spread of zzso bacteria in hospital zzso The model allows for the representation of every patient and staff zzso zzso zzso staff zzso compliance, admission of zzso patients, and zzso use are included in the zzso The simulation model provides colonization zzso for patients and staff and offers the possibility of simulating different kinds of hospital zzso zzso of the spread of an zzso pathogen in an intensive care unit was zzso We studied the impact of zzso compliance on zzso The importance of zzso in preventing colonization and the influence of admission of zzso patients in perpetuating an epidemic were confirmed by the zzso The model offers a new approach to modeling the spread of zzso pathogens in hospital zzso It allows one to study the impact of infection control measures and represents a valuable educational tool for zzso
