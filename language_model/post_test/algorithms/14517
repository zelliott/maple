zzso zzso and kinetic studies were carried out for the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso solution using the grafted zzso orange peel zzso zzso and zzso zzso models were applied to describe the zzso of the metal zzso onto zzso The influences of pH and contact time of solution on the zzso were zzso zzso model fitted the equilibrium data better than the zzso zzso According to the zzso zzso the maximum zzso capacities for zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared with the unmodified orange peel, the zzso capacity of the modified biomass increased zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso followed the zzso zzso The free energy changes zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso process were found to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, which indicates the spontaneous nature of zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso and zzso groups were involved in the zzso of the metal zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso was effectively achieved in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
