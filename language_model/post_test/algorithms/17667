We studied zzso zzso zzso changes in the alpha and beta range during a sequence of two movements in 7 healthy volunteers, in order to investigate the relationship between these changes and each component in the zzso 

The sequence consisted of a wrist active zzso zzso followed by a first and second finger zzso A total of zzso s sweeps were recorded using the level of surface zzso zzso activity in wrist zzso as trigger, including a zzso s zzso The sweeps were also zzso manually zzso using as trigger the end of the first zzso burst, or the beginning of the second zzso An index of the changes in zzso energy in the zzso zzso range was obtained by averaging zzso zzso zzso 

The duration of each of the movements in the sequence and the relationship between them were compatible with the use of two different motor zzso in the zzso In the beta band, a decrease in energy zzso zzso zzso began zzso s before the onset of the first movement, and was sustained until the end of the second zzso No energy increases were observed until the end of the second zzso In the alpha band, the zzso began zzso seconds before the first movement and was sustained throughout the zzso 

These findings suggest that the zzso zzso is related to the end of the whole motor process, and not to the end of each motor zzso
