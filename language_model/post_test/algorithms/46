We present an optical method based on zzso zzso for measuring zzso zzso in zzso Fluorescence differential path length zzso zzso determines zzso concentration based on the zzso intensity corrected for zzso The concentration of the zzso zzso zzso was studied in zzso in normal rat liver, which is highly zzso and therefore highly zzso Concentration estimates of zzso measured by zzso on the liver are compared with chemical zzso Twenty-five rats were injected with zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso optical concentration zzso were performed on tissue 3, 24, 48, and 96 h after zzso administration to yield a zzso variation in tissue zzso After the optical zzso the liver was harvested for chemical zzso zzso showed good correlation with chemical zzso zzso also showed a correlation between zzso zzso and blood volume fraction at the two shortest zzso zzso This suggests different zzso zzso of zzso for different zzso intervals that can be resolved using zzso zzso zzso in measured zzso concentration between zzso and chemical extraction are related to the interrogation volume of each zzso approximately zzso zzso and approximately zzso zzso zzso This indicates zzso variation in zzso distribution in the liver on the scale of the zzso sampling zzso
