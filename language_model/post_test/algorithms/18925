The zzso zzso analysis is useful to type bacteria that have a high number of expressed type II zzso zzso are usually committed to zzso and zzso zzso systems, in which the restriction zzso zzso high pressure on the expression of the zzso zzso that hinder zzso system zzso Conventional cluster methods do not reflect this zzso An zzso was developed for zzso construction reflecting the propensity for conservation of zzso Type II zzso 

The new zzso was applied to 52 zzso zzso strains from different geographical regions and compared with conventional zzso zzso The zzso works by first grouping strains that share a common minimum set of zzso systems and gradually adds strains according to the number of the zzso systems zzso zzso revealed a cluster of African zzso which suggest that zzso systems are present in zzso zzso since its human host zzso from zzso
