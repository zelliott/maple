zzso DNA sequences often form during zzso chain reaction amplification, especially when sequencing single regions zzso zzso zzso or zzso Internal zzso zzso to assess diversity or compare zzso zzso zzso may be zzso as novel species, causing inflated estimates of diversity and zzso zzso of differences between zzso zzso and removal of zzso is therefore of critical importance in such zzso 

We describe zzso a new program that detects zzso sequences with two or more zzso zzso either uses a database of zzso sequences or detects zzso de zzso by exploiting abundance zzso zzso has better sensitivity than zzso zzso the most sensitive database zzso especially with short, noisy zzso In testing on artificial bacterial communities with known zzso zzso de zzso sensitivity is shown to be comparable to zzso zzso is zzso faster than zzso and zzso faster than zzso
