A zzso video technique is presented for rapidly and accurately gathering, storing and depicting three-dimensional anatomical structures in thick zzso Several optical sections through the zzso are combined to produce high-resolution photographs with essentially infinite zzso Further, the depth information implicit in the series of optical sections makes the creation of zzso pairs relatively zzso The technique employs a real-time zzso frame store and a zzso A video camera is attached to a microscope and successive optical sections are stored digitally as the plane of focus is systematically zzso After storage, the image of each optical section is enhanced to emphasize elements that are sharply zzso The final two-dimensional image is generated by selecting for each point in the final picture the darkest zzso value occurring at the corresponding point in any of the pictures in the zzso zzso A picture with essentially infinite zzso is produced when points of correspondence in the series are determined by a ray passing normal to the plane of optical zzso Right and left pictures for a zzso pair are produced when points of correspondence are determined by a ray zzso either left or right of zzso This technique is illustrated with zzso zzso zzso from zzso cricket zzso with zzso zzso from zzso goldfish zzso with zzso zzso from cat visual cortex, and with sections of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso
