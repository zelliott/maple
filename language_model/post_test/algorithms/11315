zzso crest cells exhibit dramatic migration behaviors as they populate their distant zzso Using a line of zzso expressing green fluorescent protein zzso in neural crest cells we developed an zzso to analyze and zzso cell migration as a population, and use it here to characterize in detail the subtle defects in cell migration caused by ethanol exposure during early zzso The challenge was to zzso changes in the in zzso migration of all zzso expressing cells in the visual field of zzso zzso To perform this analysis we used an zzso zzso zzso for motion detection and combined the analysis with a fit to an zzso zzso Through this analysis we detected and zzso significant differences in the cell zzso of zzso positive zzso neural crest populations in ethanol treated versus zzso zzso Specifically, treatment affected migration by increasing the zzso asymmetry of the zzso cells and by altering the direction of cell zzso Thus, by applying this novel zzso analysis, we were able to zzso the movements of populations of cells, allowing us to detect subtle changes in cell zzso Because zzso neural crest cells contribute to the formation of the frontal mass these subtle differences may zzso commonly observed facial zzso in normal human zzso
