zzso models of the zzso process have led to valuable insights into the generic properties of the folding of zzso On the basis of theoretical arguments, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 90, zzso have proposed a specific method to generate folding sequences for one of zzso Here we present a model of folding in zzso that is comparable in simplicity but different in spirit to the one studied by zzso and zzso In our model, the proposed recipe for constructing folding sequence zzso We find that, as a rule, the construction of folding sequences is impossible to achieve by looking at the native zzso zzso Rather, competing zzso have to be taken into account zzso An evolutionary zzso that generates folding sequences by zzso both stability of the native state and folding time is zzso zzso this zzso zzso among others, sequences that fold zzso to zzso zzso
