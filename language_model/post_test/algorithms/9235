zzso zzso network models can help us understand how synaptic and cellular mechanisms zzso brain zzso However, these complex models are difficult to develop and are zzso to most zzso Moreover, even the most biologically realistic network models disregard many zzso anatomical features of the zzso Here, we describe a new software application, zzso that zzso the creation, zzso and analysis of networks of zzso zzso in zzso zzso A zzso user interface allows model generation and modification without zzso Models within zzso are based on new zzso zzso standards, allowing automatic generation of code for zzso or zzso zzso zzso was tested by zzso published models and its simulator independence verified by comparing the same model on two zzso We show how more zzso realistic network models can be created and their properties compared with experimental zzso by extending a published zzso zzso zzso cell layer model to zzso
