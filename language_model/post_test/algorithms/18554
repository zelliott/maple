The zzso of a substance is often tested using animal zzso In the functional zzso battery, animals are exposed to a test agent and multiple outcomes are recorded to assess zzso using approximately 40 animals measured on up to 30 different zzso This design gives rise to a challenging statistical problem: a large number of outcomes for a small sample of zzso We propose an exact test for multiple zzso zzso under the assumption that the correlation among these items is zzso This test is based upon an exponential model described by zzso and Ryan zzso zzso 10, zzso and extends the methods developed by Corcoran et zzso zzso zzso 57, zzso who developed an exact test for zzso correlated zzso data for groups zzso of correlated zzso We present a method that zzso an exact zzso testing for a joint zzso zzso An estimate of the zzso for dose response is also determined along with its zzso confidence zzso The method is illustrated using data from a zzso zzso for the chemical zzso
