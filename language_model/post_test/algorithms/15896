The present study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a specific zzso with continuous zzso dynamic overdrive pacing to prevent zzso zzso zzso after coronary artery bypass graft zzso zzso 

zzso zzso occurs in zzso to zzso of patients after cardiac surgery with a peak zzso on the second zzso It still represents a challenge for zzso prevention and treatment and may have medical and cost zzso 

zzso consecutive patients undergoing zzso for severe coronary artery disease and in zzso rhythm without zzso therapy on the second zzso day were zzso to have or not 24 h of zzso pacing through temporary zzso wires using a permanent dynamic overdrive zzso zzso zzso recorded the same day in both groups were analyzed to detect zzso zzso 

No difference was observed in baseline data between the two study groups, particularly for age, male zzso history of zzso zzso function, severity of coronary artery disease, zzso zzso blocking agent therapy or zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was significantly lower zzso zzso zzso in the paced group zzso compared with control subjects zzso zzso analysis showed zzso zzso to increase with age zzso zzso zzso but not in patients with pacing zzso zzso zzso It decreased with a better left zzso ejection fraction only in conjunction with zzso pacing zzso zzso zzso 

We conclude that continuous zzso pacing with an zzso for dynamic overdrive reduces significantly zzso of zzso the second day after zzso surgery, particularly in patients with preserved left zzso zzso
