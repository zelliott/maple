zzso zzso a zzso soil zzso displays a rich variety of body shapes and zzso during its zzso locomotion in complex zzso Here we show that the individual body postures and entire trails of zzso zzso have a simple zzso description in zzso zzso Our model is based on the assumption that the zzso wave is generated in the head segment of the zzso body and zzso zzso We have found that a simple harmonic function for the zzso can capture multiple zzso shapes during the zzso zzso The zzso body zzso can be well represented in terms of zzso zzso zzso with abrupt changes in zzso zzso and zzso
