zzso zzso zzso zzso systems are widely used for the measurement of light beam zzso most often described by zzso zzso that carry information about an interrogated zzso The sample polarization properties can be described more thoroughly through its Mueller zzso which can be derived from judiciously chosen input polarization zzso zzso and zzso measured output zzso zzso However, several sources of error complicate the construction of a Mueller zzso from the measured zzso zzso Here we present a general zzso to examine these sources of error and their effects on the derived Mueller zzso and identify the optimal input polarization states to minimize their effects in a dual zzso zzso zzso zzso The input zzso zzso states leading to the most robust Mueller zzso determination are shown to form zzso zzso in the zzso sphere space; we also identify the optimal zzso orientation of these zzso for error zzso
