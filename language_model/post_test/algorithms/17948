Signal space separation zzso is a novel method for processing zzso zzso zzso It is useful for a variety of applications including interference suppression, movement compensation and conversion of zzso between sensor zzso The performance of zzso has been examined mainly on a zzso zzso zzso zzso To facilitate the adaptation of the method to other zzso systems, the effect of various properties of the sensor array on its performance needs to be zzso To this end, we examined the effects of zzso zzso sensor zzso errors and erroneous sensor geometry information on zzso using zzso The results indicate that depending on the application, zzso balance on the level of zzso to zzso may be needed for satisfactory zzso zzso For zzso zzso this requires very careful attention in zzso Errors in zzso zzso and geometry information were found to have less zzso
