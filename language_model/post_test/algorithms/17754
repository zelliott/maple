Conventional methods for solving zzso between two offset zzso surfaces often include zzso using zzso expensive zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, these methods ignore the relations between the intersection zzso of zzso surfaces with different offset zzso The zzso presented in this paper, makes full use of the zzso relations between different intersection zzso and zzso intersection zzso with the help of previously calculated intersection zzso It first zzso two zzso surfaces to obtain the characteristic points, called zzso transition points zzso which can help in the subsequent finding of the zzso of the intersection zzso Then these points are zzso into several distinct groups, and we can determine the calculation strategy for searching initial points by analyzing the properties of these zzso on the zzso zzso all intersection zzso can be marched from initial points by the tracing zzso The proposed zzso could calculate intersection zzso robustly and zzso and has been tested to be capable of overcoming the zzso conditions such as loop and zzso leaking that occur frequently in conventional zzso
