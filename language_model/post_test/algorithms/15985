It is important to be able to zzso changes in gait pattern accurately in order to understand the clinical implications of surgery or zzso Although supervised zzso zzso neural networks are very efficient in many zzso tasks, the genetic zzso neural network zzso which can search in some appropriate space, has not been used previously for zzso zzso This study discusses how to use the zzso approach in zzso recognition, and evaluates the complexity and training strategy of the particular zzso zzso Both the zzso and a traditional artificial neural network zzso were used to zzso the gait patterns of patients with ankle zzso and normal zzso The zzso model was able to zzso subjects with recognition rates of up to zzso In contrast, the ANN trained by using all possible predictor variables was only able to zzso the subjects with recognition rates of zzso It is suggested that the zzso model is more suitable to exploit the patient's gait zzso The value of the zzso output can be used as an index of the difference from zzso By this means, all pathological gait patterns may be presented zzso
