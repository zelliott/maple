To determine zzso zzso zzso ratio, and zzso error zzso in various zzso zzso zzso zzso acquisitions of an zzso phantom containing urinary stones before and after zzso of a zzso diffusion zzso zzso algorithm, and to compare the zzso with those of zzso CT zzso 

After institutional review board approval, written informed consent was zzso and 36 calcium zzso stones were evaluated after CT acquisitions in an zzso phantom at variable tube currents zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was applied to all zzso zzso ratio, zzso ratio, and expected zzso error were determined using manually drawn regions of interest to zzso the effect of the noise reduction on the image zzso 

The value of zzso error zzso using the zzso zzso zzso obtained at tube currents as low as 33 zzso s (up to zzso dose reduction zzso were similar to standard imaging at 137 zzso zzso The zzso images at reduced doses up to zzso dose reduction have higher zzso than the zzso images without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed significant zzso zzso zzso effect of dose length product on zzso and zzso error zzso 

Based on objective zzso image quality zzso the zzso zzso zzso may be useful as a robust and fast zzso and it has the potential to improve image quality in zzso CT zzso zzso
