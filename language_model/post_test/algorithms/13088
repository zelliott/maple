Multiple zzso zzso models in zzso enhanced ultra zzso zzso have been zzso for experimental results of selective separation of zzso zzso and Co zzso with zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso as zzso agent using synthetic waste zzso This model is based on mass balance analysis coupled with the zzso theory, zzso model and gel polarization zzso This model is characterized by the zzso membrane resistance zzso membrane zzso zzso back transport zzso zzso zzso and mass transfer zzso zzso These parameters are estimated by using the zzso method coupled with the zzso zzso Due to cross currents caused by the superficial zzso some zzso are removed from the membrane surface and go into the bulk known as back transport zzso Hence back transport zzso plays significant role in explaining the extent of zzso The simulation results show a good agreement with the experimental data of zzso quality and zzso The consideration of negligible gel thickness is suitable for dilute zzso
