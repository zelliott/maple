Contemporary coronary magnetic resonance zzso techniques suffer from zzso ratio zzso zzso We propose a method to enhance zzso in zzso echo coronary magnetic resonance zzso by using sensitivity zzso zzso While the use of sensitivity zzso to improve zzso seems zzso it can be exploited by reducing the number of zzso zzso during the acquisition window while lowering the signal zzso zzso therefore improving the zzso receive to zzso transmit duty zzso Under certain conditions, this leads to improved zzso The use of sensitivity zzso for improved zzso in three-dimensional coronary magnetic resonance zzso is investigated using zzso simulations and an in zzso and an in zzso zzso A maximum zzso zzso enhancement for coronary magnetic resonance zzso was found both in zzso and in zzso which is well consistent with the zzso zzso This method is most suitable for zzso zzso echo coronary magnetic resonance zzso in which a high zzso and spatial resolution is zzso
