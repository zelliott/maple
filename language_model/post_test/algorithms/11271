A spectral correlation zzso for the analysis of zzso zzso images is proposed by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 18, zzso zzso Here, it is applied to the analysis of zzso zzso zzso plaques being related to the Alzheimer's disease zzso Sections of zzso zzso mice model brains are double stained with zzso zzso known to bind to zzso protein zzso zzso zzso images of the brain sections are recorded and by applying the correlation zzso the spectral zzso of the zzso samples is mapped in terms of zzso distribution and spectral zzso To further investigate the progression of zzso zzso plaque formation, 19 zzso mice of different ages up to 23 months are zzso enabling a statistical analysis of the plaque zzso In accordance with recent findings by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 8, zzso zzso the spectral distribution within zzso plaques is found to vary with age throughout the lifespan of the zzso With the new correlation algorithm, it is possible to zzso the spectral abundance of the two zzso depending on the relative distance from the plaque center and mouse zzso Thus, we demonstrate the use of the correlation analysis approach in zzso experiments and how it is possible to relate these to zzso changes in biological zzso
