The currents measured during zzso clamp of a zzso zzso reflect zzso as well as membrane zzso One wishes to remove the former in the hope that the latter will reveal quantitative information on the nature of the zzso gated channels at the clamp zzso We here show that Cole's zzso can be used to directly remove the zzso component from simulated zzso clamp zzso It is direct in the sense that it requires neither simulation nor zzso As it comes down to zzso the clamp current and then zzso with respect to clamp zzso it may indeed be implemented in real zzso When applied to synthetic zzso currents in straight fibers we find that our method accurately and robustly recovers both zzso zzso and zzso channel zzso We indicate the degree to which such accuracy is diminished for cells that taper and/or zzso
