Recognizing that the sensitivity of zzso is influenced by factors such as zzso and zzso constant of the sample, we propose the receiving efficiency R to characterize how efficiently the zzso signal can be observed from a unit zzso zzso in a sample under optimal probe tuning and matching zzso zzso the relative receiving efficiency can be defined as the ratio of the zzso signal induced by a unit zzso zzso in a sample of interest and a reference zzso Based on the zzso relationship between zzso and observation in zzso the relative receiving efficiency can be correlated with the 90 degrees pulse length zzso In the special case of perfect probe tuning zzso matched to 50 zzso R is zzso zzso to zzso Application of the zzso receiving efficiency in quantitative analysis potentially enables a single external concentration reference for almost any sample, eliminating the need to know its exact chemical composition or detailed electromagnetic zzso
