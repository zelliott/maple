After 6 months there was a statistically significant improvement in the percentage of patients achieving the primary and secondary zzso targets zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increase from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increase from zzso to zzso zzso These improvements were sustained at 12 zzso There was a statistically significant improvement in the percentage of patients achieving all three zzso secondary zzso (an increase from zzso to zzso at 12 zzso zzso however, this was mainly driven by improved zzso zzso The proportion of patients achieving the primary or secondary zzso hormone targets did not zzso 

A greater proportion of dialysis patients achieved improved zzso but not zzso hormone control by switching from a predominantly active vitamin D zzso treatment regimen for mineral and bone disorder to a zzso zzso that incorporated zzso and zzso active vitamin D zzso as zzso zzso
