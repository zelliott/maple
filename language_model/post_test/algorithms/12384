The accuracy of protein secondary structure prediction has steadily improved over the past 30 zzso Now many secondary structure prediction methods routinely achieve an accuracy zzso of about zzso We believe this accuracy could be further improved by including structure (as opposed to zzso database comparisons as part of the prediction zzso Indeed, given the large size of the zzso Data Bank zzso zzso the probability of a newly identified sequence having a structural zzso is actually quite zzso 

We have developed a method that performs zzso sequence alignments as part of the secondary structure prediction zzso By mapping the structure of a known zzso zzso ID zzso onto the query zzso zzso it is possible to predict at least a portion of that query zzso secondary zzso By zzso this structural alignment approach with conventional zzso secondary structure methods and then combining it with a zzso system to generate a consensus result, it is possible to attain very high prediction zzso Using a zzso test set of zzso proteins from zzso this new method achieves an average zzso score of zzso zzso testing indicates this is approximately zzso better than any other method currently zzso zzso using non zzso test sets zzso of those used in zzso zzso or structural zzso indicate that this new method can achieve a zzso score approaching zzso 

By using both sequence and structure databases and by exploiting the latest techniques in machine learning it is possible to routinely predict protein secondary structure with an accuracy well above zzso A program and web server, called zzso that performs these secondary structure predictions is accessible at zzso For high zzso or batch sequence zzso the zzso programs, databases (and zzso can be downloaded and run zzso
