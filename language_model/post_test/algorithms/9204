As part of ongoing efforts to develop computerized planning tools for zzso the current study provides a comparison between two recently developed methods for planning, known as bubble packing and zzso zzso 

For the purpose of comparison, four zzso prostate models were reconstructed from ultrasound zzso The quality of planning for each method was evaluated based on zzso transfer zzso 

Both methods are shown to be robust planning tools in zzso Typical results show at least zzso of the target region volume having temperatures below a target temperature zzso for zzso While the zzso zzso method yields superior planning results, it comes at the expense of an order of magnitude longer run time, with only moderate zzso 

Due to time constraints in a clinical setup, bubble packing alone may be considered adequate for computerized zzso Furthermore, only bubble packing is demonstrated to be adequate for zzso zzso
