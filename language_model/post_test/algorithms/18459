The objective of this research was to study the in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso of zzso with and without the effect of penetration zzso In zzso zzso of zzso was studied using a Franz diffusion cell and rat zzso Both zzso and zzso were detected in the receiver solution with a reversed phase zzso zzso The steady state flux of zzso zzso zzso and lag time were zzso zzso enhancers such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were added to the donor compartment to increase the skin zzso of zzso The flux of zzso was increased by zzso and zzso using zzso and zzso zzso The in zzso zzso was determined by measurement of zzso zzso by the slide latex zzso zzso The in zzso zzso study showed that the zzso of zzso induced in the rats were not affected by topical application of zzso zzso The results show that zzso has low flux to exert a systemic effect with and without penetration zzso However these results may support the use of topical zzso for the treatment of some zzso disorders with minimum side zzso
