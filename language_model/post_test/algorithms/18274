zzso dynamics is a complex type of zzso behavior that has been observed both zzso and zzso in numerous zzso systems in the natural zzso The zzso zzso model for the zzso zzso is an example of a system that exhibits a wide variety of zzso patterns upon variation of a control zzso One characteristic feature of this system is the presence of multiple time zzso In this article, we study the zzso model from a geometric point of zzso We show that the observed zzso dynamics is caused by a slowly varying canard zzso By appropriately transforming the model zzso we reduce them to an underlying three-dimensional zzso form that can be analyzed via a slight adaptation of the approach developed by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
