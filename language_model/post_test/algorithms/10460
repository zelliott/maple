We propose a novel zzso zzso method for identifying zzso of subjects with enhanced treatment effects based on a differential effect search zzso The idea is to build a collection of zzso by zzso zzso a database into two zzso at each parent group, such that the treatment effect within one of the two zzso is zzso compared with the other zzso The process of data splitting continues until a zzso stopping condition has been zzso The method is similar to zzso zzso approaches that allow incorporation of a zzso interaction in the splitting zzso However, unlike other zzso methods, this method searches only within specific regions of the zzso space and generates multiple zzso of potential zzso We develop this method and provide guidance on key topics of interest that include generating multiple promising zzso using different splitting criteria, choosing optimal values of complexity parameters via zzso and addressing Type I error rate inflation inherent in data mining applications using a zzso zzso We evaluate the operating characteristics of the procedure using a simulation study and illustrate the method with a clinical trial zzso
