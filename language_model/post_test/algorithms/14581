zzso learning concerns the problem of learning in the presence of labeled and zzso zzso Several boosting zzso have been extended to zzso learning with various zzso To our knowledge, however, none of them takes all three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso together into account during boosting zzso In this paper, we propose a novel cost functional consisting of the margin cost on labeled data and the zzso penalty on zzso data based on three fundamental zzso zzso Thus, minimizing our proposed cost functional with a greedy yet zzso functional zzso procedure leads to a generic boosting framework for zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrate that our zzso yields favorite results for benchmark and real-world zzso tasks in comparison to state-of-the-art zzso learning zzso including newly developed boosting zzso Finally, we discuss relevant issues and relate our zzso to the previous zzso
