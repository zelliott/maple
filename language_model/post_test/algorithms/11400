We propose a novel zzso zzso filter to efficiently recover quantitative phase from a series of noisy intensity images taken through zzso We first transform the wave propagation equation and zzso observation model zzso zzso into a complex zzso state space zzso From the state space model, we derive a sparse zzso complex extended Kalman filter zzso to zzso the complex optical field zzso and zzso and find that it zzso under mild zzso Our proposed method has a zzso complexity of zzso zzso and storage requirement of zzso compared with the original zzso method, which has a zzso complexity of zzso and storage requirement of zzso where zzso is the number of images and N is the number of zzso in each zzso Thus, it is efficient, robust and zzso and may be feasible for real-time phase recovery applications with high resolution zzso
