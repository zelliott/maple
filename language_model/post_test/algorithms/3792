zzso current zzso from zzso measurement is an zzso problem that requires prior assumptions about brain activity and an efficient zzso zzso In this article, we propose a new zzso zzso method introducing a zzso prior that can effectively incorporate both structural and functional zzso zzso In our method, the zzso of the source current at each source location is considered an unknown zzso and estimated from the observed zzso data and prior information by using the zzso zzso zzso The zzso information can be imposed as prior information on the zzso distribution rather than the zzso itself so that it gives a soft constraint on the zzso A spatial zzso zzso that the neural activity within a few zzso radius tends to be similar due to the neural connections, can also be implemented as a zzso zzso The proposed method provides a unified theory to deal with the following three situations: zzso zzso with no other data, zzso zzso with structural zzso data on cortical surfaces, and zzso zzso with both structural zzso and zzso zzso We investigated the performance of our method and conventional linear inverse methods under these three zzso zzso results indicate that our method has better accuracy and spatial resolution than the conventional linear inverse methods under all three zzso It is also shown that accuracy of our method improves as zzso and zzso information becomes zzso zzso results demonstrate that our method appropriately resolves the inverse problem even if zzso data convey inaccurate information, while the Wiener filter method is seriously deteriorated by inaccurate zzso zzso
