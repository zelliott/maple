An approach is described for joint zzso recording, real-time processing, and analysis of zzso data zzso The method employs zzso decomposition to find common information in a set of conventional zzso zzso recorded in the zzso sampling mode, and builds a model of zzso zzso zzso While preserving sensitivity per unit of measurement time and allowing for zzso spectral resolution, the approach reduces data collection time on average by 2 orders of magnitude compared to the conventional zzso The zzso zzso HD spectrum, which is represented as a set of zzso zzso zzso is easy to handle and amenable for automated zzso The method is exemplified by automated assignment for two protein systems of low and high spectral zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso and zzso zzso zzso 13 zzso The collection and backbone assignment of the data sets are achieved in real time after approximately 1 and 10 zzso zzso The approach removes the most critical time bottlenecks in data acquisition and zzso Thus, it can significantly increase the value of zzso zzso in structural biology, for example, in zzso structural zzso zzso
