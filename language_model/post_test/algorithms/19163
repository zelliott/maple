The major limitation for the acquisition of high-quality zzso zzso recordings is the presence of disturbances of zzso and technical zzso eye movements, cardiac signals, muscular zzso and environmental noise are serious problems for zzso signal zzso In the last years, zzso zzso systems have undergone rapid technological developments in terms of noise reduction, and many processing methods have been proposed for artifact zzso Independent component analysis zzso has already shown to be an effective and generally zzso technique for zzso removing artifacts and noise from the zzso zzso However, no standardized automated system based on zzso has become available so far, because of the intrinsic difficulty in the reliable categorization of the source signals obtained with this zzso In this work, approximate zzso zzso a measure of data zzso is successfully used for the zzso of the signals produced by zzso allowing for an automated artifact zzso The proposed method has been tested using zzso data sets collected during zzso auditory and visual zzso It was demonstrated to be effective in attenuating both biological artifacts and environmental noise, in order to reconstruct clear signals that can be used for improving brain source zzso
