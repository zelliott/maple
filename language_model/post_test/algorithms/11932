The interaction of zzso zzso widely used as a specific protein zzso C zzso zzso with rat brain zzso zzso channels zzso expressed in Chinese zzso zzso cells was investigated using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its inactive zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso currents at zzso zzso in a zzso zzso manner with an apparent zzso value of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso accelerated the zzso rate of zzso of zzso currents but did not significantly modify the zzso of current zzso Other specific zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso had no effect on zzso and did not prevent the zzso effect of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso was highly zzso between zzso and 0 zzso zzso range of channel zzso suggesting that both drugs interact zzso with the open state of the zzso The additional zzso by zzso zzso displayed a zzso dependence zzso zzso zzso in the full zzso zzso range positive to 0 zzso but was not shown in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The rate zzso of association and zzso for zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the time constant of zzso of tail currents from zzso 35 to zzso zzso resulting in tail crossover zzso zzso zzso had no effect on the zzso dependence of zzso zzso zzso zzso produced zzso zzso of zzso which was consistent with the slow recovery from zzso in the presence of zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso directly zzso zzso channels in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
