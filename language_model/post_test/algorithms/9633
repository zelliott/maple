Support zzso zzso zzso is now a well-established method for zzso zzso zzso However, the standard zzso is not effective to deal with severe zzso contamination of both response and predictor variables commonly encountered in numerous real zzso In this paper, we present a bounded influence zzso which zzso the influence of zzso in all the zzso zzso The proposed approach adopts an zzso weighting strategy, which is based on both a robust zzso scale zzso for large zzso zzso and the statistic of a zzso hat zzso for leverage point zzso Thus, our zzso has the ability to accurately extract the dominant subset in corrupted data zzso zzso linear and zzso data sets show the zzso of our zzso against zzso zzso chemical and zzso data sets that exhibit severe zzso contamination are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach in real zzso
