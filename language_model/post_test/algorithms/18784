The aims of the study were to: zzso compare the accuracy of standard zzso zzso in the zzso of fetal weight zzso zzso test two new zzso in order to improve the global performance of zzso prediction by adding fetal subcutaneous tissue zzso 

We enrolled 398 patients who were between 34 and 42 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso parameters as well as subcutaneous tissue thickness ultrasound parameters were zzso zzso zzso between ultrasound zzso in order to evaluate the degree of zzso between these zzso were assessed to develop a zzso multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Contributions of single ultrasound zzso in predicting zzso were zzso by fitting zzso zzso versus single ultrasound zzso We found that the zzso tissue area was able to significantly improve the performance of the zzso prediction process when added to the other standard ultrasound zzso We derived two new zzso which appeared to be better at predicting zzso zzso there was a lower minimum absolute zzso error noted when compared to other reported zzso 

Our zzso showed that the addition of the zzso tissue evaluation in zzso prediction was valuable in comparison to zzso prediction models which are based on routine ultrasound zzso
