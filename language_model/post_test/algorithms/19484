The Cox zzso hazards model usually assumes an exponential form for the dependence of the hazard function on zzso zzso However, in practice this assumption may be violated and other relative risk forms may be more zzso In this article, we consider the zzso hazards model with an unknown relative risk zzso zzso in model interpretation are zzso We propose a method to estimate the relative risk form and the zzso parameters simultaneously by first zzso the zzso of the relative risk form by a zzso and then employing the maximum partial likelihood zzso An zzso alternating zzso procedure is developed for efficient zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and of the relative risk form based on zzso zzso theory is zzso The proposed methods are illustrated using simulation and an application to the zzso Administration lung cancer zzso
