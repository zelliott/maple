Current zzso zzso zzso scanners zzso zzso retrospective overlapping zzso acquisition zzso which zzso a higher than desired radiation zzso Although the radiation burden of zzso zzso zzso zzso can be efficiently reduced by dose zzso and limiting field of view, a further decrease in radiation without compromising diagnostic image quality would be indeed very zzso An alternative imaging mode is the zzso prospective zzso acquisition zzso zzso This study was done to compare the effective radiation dose and the image quality with two techniques to reduce radiation doses with zzso studies utilizing zzso zzso The study included 149 consecutive patients zzso females and 101 zzso zzso zzso age zzso 67 zzso 11 years, zzso zzso Patients underwent CT coronary zzso using one of three zzso retrospective triggering with dose zzso prospective triggering with padding zzso and shoot acquisition with additional adjacent zzso and prospective triggering without padding zzso phase acquisition zzso Based on body zzso two different zzso were zzso 100 zzso zzso zzso or 120 zzso zzso zzso zzso doses and image quality zzso to noise zzso was measured for each patient, and compared between different acquisition zzso The signal zzso ratio of the ascending zzso zzso was calculated from the mean zzso values of the zzso left zzso chamber divided by the standard zzso of these zzso zzso Use of 100 zzso reduced radiation dose zzso using prospective triggering and zzso using retrospective imaging as compared to 120 zzso zzso zzso zzso Use of prospective imaging reduced radiation exposure by zzso as compared to retrospective imaging zzso zzso zzso Using both prospective imaging and 100 zzso without padding zzso phase data, no other zzso zzso radiation dose was reduced by zzso zzso zzso zzso In terms of image quality, the zzso of variation of ascending zzso contrast enhancement between zzso of 120 and zzso of 100 was zzso zzso 95 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the pulmonary zzso The prospective zzso acquisition and 100 zzso images were of diagnostic quality, allowing adequate assessment in all zzso zzso using PA and 100 zzso reduced the radiation dose by up to zzso without compromising the image zzso
