We report the addition of two zzso zzso termed zzso and zzso to the freely available Visual zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso produce zzso of complex zzso molecules and zzso zzso and are a zzso and zzso of those we previously developed in a zzso package for zzso zzso highlights each ring in a molecular structure with a zzso which is zzso according to the ring zzso zzso traces zzso bonds with a ribbon that twists according to the relative orientation of successive sugar zzso Combination of these novel zzso and new ring selection statements with the large set of zzso already available in zzso allows for unprecedented flexibility in the level of detail displayed for zzso zzso and zzso protein structures, as well as other zzso zzso We highlight the efficacy of these zzso with selected illustrative examples, clearly demonstrating the value of the new zzso not only for structure zzso but also for zzso insights into molecular structure and zzso
