A wide range of zzso reflecting activity in a number of biological systems zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been found to zzso predict zzso zzso and mortality outcomes in older adult zzso zzso of these zzso zzso or in zzso may serve as an early warning system of risk for future adverse health zzso In the current investigation, 13 zzso were examined as zzso of mortality occurrence over a 12-year period in a sample of men and women zzso zzso zzso zzso years of age at enrollment into the zzso zzso examined in analyses included markers of neuroendocrine functioning zzso zzso zzso and zzso immune activity zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cardiovascular functioning zzso and zzso blood zzso and zzso activity zzso zzso zzso cholesterol, total to HDL cholesterol ratio, and zzso zzso zzso zzso techniques were used to identify a set of zzso composed of combinations of different zzso that were associated with a high-risk of mortality over the 12-year zzso Of the 13 zzso zzso almost all entered into one or more high-risk pathways although combinations of neuroendocrine and immune markers appeared frequently in high-risk male zzso and zzso blood pressure was present in combination with other zzso in all high-risk female zzso These findings illustrate the utility of zzso zzso techniques in identifying zzso combinations zzso of mortal outcomes in older adults, as well as the zzso of biological pathways to mortality in elderly zzso
