To test zzso zzso CT zzso in order to evaluate setup errors in prostate zzso 

The setup of 9 patients was verified weekly by electronic portal imaging zzso and zzso both zzso in the same treatment zzso zzso were compared with digitally reconstructed zzso zzso zzso were matched to simulation zzso by manual registration based on bone markers zzso by manual registration based on soft zzso zzso - zzso zzso and seminal zzso - and by automatic registration zzso performed by a mutual information zzso Shifts were evaluated along the three main zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Finally, in 4 additional patients showing zzso zzso the zzso mismatch error was used to evaluate the three zzso matching zzso 

A total of 50 pairs of zzso zzso and 50 zzso were zzso Assuming an overall tolerance of 2 zzso no significant differences were observed comparing zzso vs zzso in any zzso A significant difference zzso zzso zzso was observed along the zzso axis comparing zzso vs zzso and zzso vs zzso On the zzso data set zzso zzso the zzso mismatch along the zzso direction was significantly lower zzso zzso zzso after zzso than after zzso or zzso 

Bone markers were not an effective surrogate of the target position and significant differences were observed comparing zzso or zzso vs zzso supporting the assessment of soft tissue position by zzso to verify and correct patient setup in prostate zzso
