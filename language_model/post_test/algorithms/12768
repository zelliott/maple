The past few years have seen a rapid development in novel zzso technologies that have created large-scale data on zzso interactions zzso across human and most model zzso This data is commonly represented as networks, with zzso representing proteins and edges representing the zzso A fundamental challenge to zzso is how to interpret this wealth of data to zzso the interaction of patterns and the biological characteristics of the zzso One significant purpose of this interpretation is to predict unknown protein zzso Although many approaches have been proposed in recent years, the challenge still remains how to reasonably and precisely measure the functional similarities between proteins to improve the prediction zzso 

We used a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso framework to more effectively predict unknown protein functions at different functional zzso The framework relies on a new protein similarity measurement and a zzso protein function prediction zzso The new protein similarity measurement incorporates the zzso structure of the zzso network, as well as the zzso semantic information in terms of known protein functions at different functional zzso zzso on real zzso zzso were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in predicting unknown protein zzso 

The proposed framework has a higher prediction accuracy compared with other similar zzso The prediction results are stable even for a large number of zzso Furthermore, the framework is able to predict unknown functions at different functional layers within the Munich Information Center for zzso zzso zzso zzso functional zzso The experimental results demonstrated that the new protein similarity measurement reflects more reasonably and precisely relationships between zzso
