One can generate zzso to simulate a system of chemical reactions using either zzso direct method or Gibson and zzso next reaction zzso Because one usually needs many zzso to understand the dynamics of a system, performance is zzso In this paper, we present new zzso of these methods that improve the zzso complexity of the zzso We present zzso zzso available from zzso that offer better performance than previous zzso There is no single method that is best for all zzso zzso zzso often work best for systems with a small number of zzso while some sophisticated methods offer the best performance for large problems and scale well zzso We investigate the performance of each zzso on simple biological systems using a wide range of problem zzso We also consider the zzso accuracy of the direct and the next reaction zzso We have found that special precautions must be taken in order to ensure that randomness is not discarded during the course of a zzso
