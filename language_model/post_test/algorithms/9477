zzso zzso zzso in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome has shown that zzso gas is not zzso zzso Although regional ventilation can be studied by isotope and magnetic resonance techniques while zzso of the lungs can be zzso using CT, these techniques are not available at the zzso Recently, electrical zzso zzso has been introduced as a true bedside technique which provides information on regional ventilation zzso 

zzso zzso zzso can reliably determine regional ventilation in healthy lungs and various models of induced lung injury when compared with CT, electron beam CT, and single zzso zzso zzso In healthy volunteers and patients with acute lung injury, relative zzso changes on the electrical zzso zzso image demonstrate an excellent correlation with regional changes in lung air content detected by zzso In a limited number of patients with respiratory dysfunction, gas exchange was found to improve when electrical zzso zzso was used to adjust zzso settings, improving regional ventilation and avoiding tidal zzso zzso 

In view of recently published data, it can be concluded that, in critically ill patients, electrical zzso zzso determines reliable regional zzso zzso this technique has the potential to become a valuable bedside zzso
