zzso and zzso presented a model of the zzso zzso which zzso accounts for the characteristic response properties used to distinguish zzso cell type in zzso In this paper we test the zzso ability to reproduce zzso tabulated data on the dependency on stimulus shape and size, with a new zzso of the model in the neural simulation language zzso Data of zzso and zzso relating zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell responses to moving worm, zzso and square-shaped stimuli of various edge lengths are used to test stimulus shape and size zzso A close match to the data can be achieved by tuning some of the model parameters while still retaining the characteristic responses to the typical stimulus zzso We stress here the importance of a zzso approach to the zzso We place more emphasis on the variation of response properties in a population of zzso of the same class, rather than zzso for the zzso of a given zzso As an example of the zzso approach we offer a model for the respiratory zzso response following researchers who argue that a zzso of zzso zzso are activated by stationary boundaries zzso to the zzso self induced respiratory eye zzso
