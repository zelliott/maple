This paper presents a method for zzso zzso deformation recovery from zzso zzso The method is based on a zzso model that is nearly zzso a desirable property since the zzso has been shown to be nearly zzso The model uses a zzso zzso basis function to represent zzso displacement fields, which is a first order approximation of zzso This representation allows for deformation modeling of an arbitrary zzso with a relatively small number of zzso which is suitable for representing the motion of the zzso structure of the zzso The zzso needs to be segmented in an initial frame after which the method automatically determines the tissue deformation everywhere in the zzso throughout the cardiac zzso Two studies were carried out to validate the zzso In the first study the zzso deformation was recovered from a zzso anatomical zzso zzso sequence of a healthy volunteer and then validated against the manual zzso of the zzso wall and against the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The average volume agreement between the model and the manual zzso had a false positive rate of zzso false negative rate of zzso and true positive rate of zzso The average distance between the model and manually determined zzso of perpendicular tag planes was zzso zzso zzso The same procedures was repeated on another set of zzso anatomical and zzso zzso scans of the same volunteer taken four months zzso The recovered deformation was very similar to the one obtained from the first set of zzso In the second study the method was applied to zzso anatomical zzso zzso scans of three patients with zzso zzso and three zzso healthy zzso The recovered strains of the normal subjects were clearly stronger than the recovered strains of the patients and they were similar to those reported by other zzso The recovered deformation of all six subjects was validated against manual zzso of the zzso wall and against corresponding zzso zzso zzso The agreement was similar to that of the first zzso
