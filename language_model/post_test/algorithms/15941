An zzso zzso membrane zzso incorporating a zzso zzso zzso was used in a zzso zzso detector for the zzso determination of organic zzso of biological zzso Different zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sugar zzso and zzso were detected sensitively after separation on a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was coated by directly casting the zzso mixture on a glassy carbon support of 3 zzso diameter and used in a zzso flow zzso The analysis conditions were zzso to obtain both efficient separation and sensitive zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso dependence on the injected concentration for zzso higher than zzso zzso zzso M and a linear dependence for injected zzso below this zzso Under zzso conditions, detection limits of zzso zzso zzso M zzso zzso were attained when a sodium hydroxide solution was used as an zzso No zzso system was needed in this zzso The relative standard zzso for consecutive injections was zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso lifetime was at least 2 zzso The utility of zzso detection is further demonstrated in a zzso zzso separation for zzso analysis of a synthetic mixture of zzso compounds containing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
