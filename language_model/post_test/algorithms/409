This paper describes a new methodology to process zzso radar data for direct use as zzso input to zzso and zzso models and in real time control of urban drainage zzso In contrast to the adjustment of radar data with the help of rain zzso the new approach accounts for the zzso properties of current zzso In a first step radar data are corrected for zzso This phenomenon has been identified as the main cause for the general zzso of radar zzso zzso variation of the zzso zzso within zzso bounds allows robust zzso zzso zzso event specific zzso relations are applied to the corrected radar zzso data in order to generate quantitative reliable radar zzso zzso The results of the methodology are validated by a network of 37 rain zzso located in the zzso and zzso river zzso Finally, the relevance of the correction methodology for radar zzso forecasts is zzso It has become clearly obvious, that the new methodology significantly improves the radar zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso are zzso in real zzso
