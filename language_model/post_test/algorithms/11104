Identification of zzso rare zzso that are associated with complex traits poses a central challenge on zzso association zzso However, most current research focuses only on testing the global association whether the rare zzso in a given zzso region are collectively associated with the zzso Although some recent work, zzso the zzso risk index method, have tried to address this problem, it is unclear whether the zzso rare zzso can be consistently identified by them in the zzso zzso We develop a new zzso method, the so-called zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to tackle this zzso The new method simultaneously addresses two issues: zzso zzso association zzso Are there any of the zzso associated with the disease, and zzso zzso zzso zzso Which zzso if any, are driving the zzso The zzso ensures the zzso rare zzso to be consistently identified in the zzso situation by imposing some appropriate prior zzso on the model and model specific zzso The zzso results indicate that the zzso is more powerful for testing the global association than the existing methods, such as the combined zzso and collapsing test, weighted sum statistic test, zzso sequence kernel association test, and zzso risk index, and also more powerful for identification of zzso rare zzso than the zzso risk index zzso The zzso has also been successfully applied to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It identified a few zzso rare zzso that have been verified in the zzso
