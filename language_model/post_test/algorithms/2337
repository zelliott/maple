A computer simulation program capable of demonstrating various artifacts, such as image distortion caused by metallic implants in MR imaging, is zzso The structure of the program allows for the zzso of various imaging situations as long as spins only experience weak interaction, zzso the Bloch equations are zzso The raw data are obtained by repeatedly applying the Bloch equations to the zzso zzso of each point of the simulated object, throughout the pulse zzso With only a limited number of spins in each zzso the effects of zzso zzso and zzso require special attention, and zzso for this have been zzso
