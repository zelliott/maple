An effective computer program for assembling DNA fragments, the zzso assembly program zzso has been zzso In the zzso program, a filter is used to eliminate quickly zzso pairs that could not possibly zzso a dynamic programming zzso is applied to zzso the zzso overlapping alignment between each remaining pair of fragments, and a simple greedy approach is employed to assemble fragments in order of alignment zzso To identify the true zzso zzso the dynamic programming zzso uses specially chosen sets of alignment parameters to tolerate sequencing errors and to zzso zzso changes between different copies of a repetitive zzso The performance tests of the program on zzso data from zzso sequencing projects produced satisfactory zzso The zzso program is efficient in computer time and zzso it took about 4 h to assemble a set of zzso fragments into long zzso on a Sun zzso
