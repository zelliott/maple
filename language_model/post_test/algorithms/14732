For data center cooling and intelligent zzso systems, real time cabinet environmental monitoring is a strong zzso Monitoring data, such as temperature, zzso and noise, is important for operators to manage the facilities in zzso We here propose a sensing network, called zzso which is energy efficient and reliable for cabinet environmental zzso zzso achieves above zzso reliable data yield and sends fewer zzso compared to periodic zzso It does so through a zzso zzso zzso In addition, based on zzso we propose a scheduling scheme to increase the lifetime of the network by reducing unnecessary message snooping and channel zzso thus it is more energy efficient than zzso The performance of zzso is evaluated by simulations and zzso
