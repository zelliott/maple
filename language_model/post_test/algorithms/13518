When assessing differential gene expression from zzso sequencing data, commonly used statistical tests tend to have greater power to detect differential expression of genes zzso longer zzso This phenomenon, called zzso zzso will influence subsequent analyses such as Gene zzso enrichment zzso In the presence of length bias, Gene zzso categories that include longer genes are more likely to be identified as zzso These categories, however, are not necessarily biologically more zzso We show that one can effectively adjust for length bias in Gene zzso analysis by including transcript length as a zzso in a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso model makes the statistical issue underlying length bias more zzso transcript length becomes a zzso factor when it zzso with both the Gene zzso membership and the significance of the differential expression zzso The inclusion of the transcript length as a zzso allows one to investigate the direct correlation between the Gene zzso membership and the significance of testing differential zzso conditional on the transcript zzso We present both real and simulated data examples to show that the zzso zzso approach is simple, effective, and zzso
