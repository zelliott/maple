We study a selective light scattering elimination procedure in the case of highly scattering rough zzso zzso to the case of low scattering levels, the elimination parameters are shown to depend on the sample zzso and to present rapid variations with the scattering zzso On the other hand, when the slope of the surface is moderated, we show that this parameters present zzso variations and little dependence to the zzso even when the zzso is zzso These results allow an important selective reduction of the scattered light, with a basic experimental mounting and an zzso determination of the elimination zzso Such selective scattering reduction is demonstrated by simulations and experiments and applied to the imaging of an object situated under a highly rough zzso
