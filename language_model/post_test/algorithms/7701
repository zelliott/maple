zzso filtering has recently been introduced to perform zzso zzso in conjunction with zzso and zzso models to estimate the diffusion zzso zzso filters are particularly well adapted to the zzso problem as they offer a way to approximate a probability distribution over all paths originated from a specified zzso given the diffusion zzso In practice however, they often fail at consistently capturing the zzso of the target zzso For brain white matter zzso this means that multiple fiber pathways are unlikely to be tracked over extended zzso We propose to remedy this issue by zzso the filtering distribution as an zzso zzso zzso mixture zzso Such a zzso preserves all the properties of a classical particle filter while improving zzso zzso We apply this zzso particle filter to both zzso and zzso models and propose to estimate zzso the number of modes of the filtering zzso We show on synthetic and real data how this zzso zzso the previous versions proposed in the zzso
