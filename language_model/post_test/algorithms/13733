Automatic detection of zzso oxygen zzso was investigated by collecting pulse zzso zzso data through an zzso Two zzso one based on a threshold principle and the other based on moving median calculations, performed the zzso The median zzso detected fewer zzso events than did the threshold algorithm, but also did not detect some zzso events that the threshold zzso zzso zzso detection zzso will likely need to incorporate into their decision-making other patient information in addition to zzso A proposed recording zzso is zzso
