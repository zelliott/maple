Breaking of symmetry is often required in biology in order to produce a specific zzso In this work we address the problem of protein diffusion over a zzso zzso surface towards one pole of the zzso in order to produce ultimately an active protein cluster performing a specific biological zzso Such a process is, for example, prerequisite for the assembling of proteins which then zzso catalyze the zzso of zzso zzso to sustain the growth of zzso tails as occurs in natural zzso such as those contained in zzso zzso By this process such zzso may propel themselves within the cell by the principle of zzso In this work the zzso treatment of diffusion of large zzso within a cellular membrane is extended to zzso the case when proteins may be zzso poised by zzso structures zzso the membrane as has been recently documented in the zzso In such case the exchange of proteins between adjacent corrals occurs by zzso transitions instead of classical zzso motion, yet the present analysis shows that long-range movements of the zzso may still be described by a classical diffusion law though the diffusion zzso has then a different physical zzso Such a model explains why otherwise classical diffusion of proteins may give rise to too small diffusion zzso compared to predictions based on the protein zzso This model is implemented to examine the rate of proteins zzso at one pole of a zzso zzso and its outcome is discussed in relevance to the mechanism of zzso comet tails zzso
