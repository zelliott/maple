zzso Count zzso was widely used for protein abundance zzso in zzso On the basis of that, Mann and co-workers corrected the SC by dividing spectrum counts by the number of zzso peptides per protein and named it zzso Here we present modified spectral count index zzso for protein abundance zzso which was defined as the number of observed peptides divided by protein relative identification possibility zzso zzso was derived from zzso zzso and protein expression data zzso from human liver zzso and related to zzso three physical and chemical properties zzso For 46 proteins in mouse zzso cells, zzso shows a linear relationship with the actual protein zzso similar or better than zzso zzso Also, multiple linear zzso were performed to quantitative assess several zzso impact on the zzso abundance zzso Our results shown that the primary factor affecting protein levels was zzso abundance zzso followed by zzso in protein zzso zzso and protein turnover zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, we found that the zzso between zzso transcripts and protein expression was not consistent among all protein functional zzso This correlation was lower for signaling proteins as compared to metabolism zzso It was determined that zzso was the primary factor affecting signaling protein abundance zzso on average), followed by zzso abundance zzso In contrast, only zzso (on zzso of the zzso of zzso protein abundance was explained by zzso much lower than zzso abundance zzso These results provide the impetus for further investigation of the biological significance of mechanisms regulating the zzso abundance correlation and provide additional insight into the relative importance of the technological zzso zzso in zzso correlation zzso
