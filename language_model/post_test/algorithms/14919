A closed form zzso solution of the zzso zzso equation was obtained for temperature zzso in the skin tissue subject to the zzso heat zzso Phase shifts in the surface temperature response were revealed to be related to local blood zzso rate and heating zzso The influence of the zzso contact resistance on the zzso zzso was zzso It has been proved that this influence is relatively small because of the phase shift based zzso and can be effectively eliminated by application of highly zzso zzso This analysis provides the theoretical foundation for a new zzso zzso of blood zzso zzso based on the surface temperature measurement which can have significant applications in future clinical zzso
