zzso methods in zzso are generally applied in order to enhance the zzso of blood vessels by eliminating bones and surrounding zzso from X-ray zzso The main limitation of these methods is the sensitivity to patient movement, which leads to artifacts and reduces the clinical value of the zzso zzso In this paper we present a novel method for rigid motion compensation with primary application to road zzso frequently used in zzso zzso Using the general concept of zzso zzso we zzso the physical position and orientation of the zzso X-ray device, thought of as the rigid zzso transformation accounting for the patient zzso The registration is carried out using a zzso zzso strategy and a similarity measure based on the zzso of intensity differences, which has been shown to be most suitable for zzso zzso Performance evaluation demonstrated the capabilities of the proposed approach to compensate for potential zzso patient motion, being more resilient to the fundamental problems of pure zzso zzso
