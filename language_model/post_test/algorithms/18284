In the pharmaceutical preparation of a controlled release drug, it is very important and necessary to understand the release zzso In previous papers, a combination of the zzso time law and zzso law equations was confirmed to be a useful equation for qualitative zzso It was also confirmed that the combination equation could analyze the release properties of layered zzso as well as zzso zzso The drug release property from layered zzso is different from that of zzso zzso A time lag occurs before release, and the entire release property of layered zzso was analyzed using the combination of the zzso time law and zzso law zzso It is considered that the analysis method is very useful and efficient for both zzso and layered zzso Comparing the zzso methods, it is easier to control the manufacturing process by tumbling zzso zzso zzso than by zzso bed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso layered zzso by a zzso bed zzso might be convenient for the preparation of controlled release dosage forms as compared with a tumbling zzso because the layered zzso prepared by the zzso bed zzso can zzso and dry at the same zzso The time required for drying by the zzso bed zzso is shorter than that by the tumbling zzso so the zzso bed zzso is convenient for preparation of zzso in handling and shorter processing time than the tumbling zzso It was also suggested that the zzso layered zzso prepared by the zzso bed zzso were suitable for a controlled release system as well as the zzso zzso zzso
