To automatically differentiate radiation necrosis from zzso tumor at high spatial resolution using zzso zzso zzso 

zzso data retrieved from 31 patients (15 zzso tumor and 16 radiation zzso who underwent zzso therapy after surgical zzso included zzso zzso zzso zzso inversion recovery, zzso density, apparent diffusion zzso zzso and zzso imaging zzso zzso relative cerebral blood volume zzso relative cerebral blood flow zzso and mean transit time zzso After alignment to post contrast zzso an zzso feature zzso was zzso An zzso zzso machine zzso was trained using a radiation necrosis training zzso zzso parameters were zzso based on the area under receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso The zzso was then tested on the full zzso 

The sensitivity and specificity of zzso zzso for zzso was zzso and zzso zzso The area under zzso curve was zzso The distribution of zzso classified as radiation necrosis was supported by the clinical interpretation of follow-up scans for both zzso and progressing test zzso The zzso map derived from zzso imaging and zzso zzso derived from zzso were found to make a greater contribution to the discrimination than the conventional zzso 

zzso learning using zzso zzso features may be a promising approach to identify the distribution of radiation necrosis tissue in zzso zzso zzso patients undergoing zzso
