We demonstrate the feasibility of using optical zzso zzso zzso to detect and image an zzso response: zzso induced optical changes zzso in soft biological zzso A zzso electric field was applied to ex zzso samples of zzso heart zzso while zzso signals were acquired zzso Experimental results show that the zzso of the zzso signal change is zzso to the zzso and zzso zzso to the frequency of the applied electric zzso We show that the zzso component of the sample was eliminated in the zzso zzso zzso To the best our knowledge, this is the first time a two-dimensional image related to the zzso response of soft zzso is obtained with depth zzso Since zzso properties can change during zzso zzso imaging can potentially be used for cancer zzso
