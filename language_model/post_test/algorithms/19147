The feasibility of functional imaging of zzso brains was studied in a zzso zzso manner by using reflection mode zzso technique for the first zzso zzso were conducted to examine the quality of zzso signals and zzso images across a newborn infant zzso With the designed system, zzso imaging of blood vessels through the infant skull has been achieved with an zzso resolution up to zzso and a lateral resolution up to zzso Experimental results also indicate that zzso imaging of zzso brain with a depth of zzso or more beneath the skull is feasible when working with zzso zzso Moreover, the performance of this technique for measuring and monitoring the changes in blood zzso level through the newborn infant skull has also been zzso This study suggests that reflection mode zzso imaging holds promise to become a novel and powerful tool for zzso diagnosis, monitoring and prognosis of disorders in zzso zzso
