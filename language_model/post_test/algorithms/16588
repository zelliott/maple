To compare parameters describing left zzso zzso zzso function obtained with three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with retrospective valve tracking and two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso heart zzso Second, to compare zzso of zzso zzso function, and in particular for discriminating restrictive filling patterns, with both zzso techniques versus zzso zzso 

The zzso and zzso zzso zzso early zzso and zzso zzso peak flow rate zzso determined from zzso zzso zzso were zzso Also, net forward flow volume per cycle and zzso zzso fraction were zzso zzso in zzso zzso filling patterns between zzso and zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso was evaluated using zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso with retrospective valve tracking was statistically significantly different from zzso zzso zzso zzso for net forward flow volume and zzso fraction through the zzso valve and all parameters describing the zzso zzso filling pattern, except for the E zzso time and zzso filling zzso zzso between zzso zzso zzso zzso with retrospective valve tracking and zzso for zzso zzso filling patterns was superior to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso with retrospective valve tracking better describes zzso zzso function as compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso heart zzso
