We study the problem of detecting objects in still, zzso zzso Our primary focus is the development of a zzso approach to the problem that makes use of a zzso zzso zzso A vocabulary of distinctive object parts is automatically constructed from a set of sample images of the object class of interest; images are then represented using parts from this zzso together with spatial relations observed among the zzso Based on this zzso a learning zzso is used to automatically learn to detect instances of the object class in new zzso The approach can be applied to any object with distinguishable parts in a relatively fixed spatial zzso it is evaluated here on difficult sets of real-world images containing side views of cars, and is seen to successfully detect objects in varying conditions zzso background clutter and mild zzso In evaluating object detection approaches, several important zzso issues arise that have not been zzso addressed in previous zzso A secondary focus of this paper is to highlight these issues and to develop rigorous evaluation standards for the object detection zzso A critical evaluation of our approach under the proposed standards is zzso
