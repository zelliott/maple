zzso is a World Wide Web server for the visual presentation of three-dimensional zzso protein zzso zzso indicates the presence of potential errors zzso by zzso zzso PROVE or zzso identifies buried zzso and depicts sequence zzso As zzso the server takes a file of zzso Data Bank zzso coordinates and, zzso a multiple sequence zzso As zzso the server returns a zzso file, replacing the zzso column with values of the chosen zzso zzso quality, zzso burial or zzso Thus, the coordinates of the analyzed protein zzso by zzso can be zzso displayed with structure viewers such as zzso in order to zzso the zzso clusters of regions with common features, which may not necessarily be adjacent to each other at the zzso acid sequence zzso In particular, zzso may serve as a tool to judge a zzso quality at various stages of the modeling and refinement (during both experimental structure determination and zzso zzso The zzso group used zzso in the fifth Critical Assessment of zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso to successfully identify zzso parts of preliminary zzso models and to guide the refinement of zzso protein zzso zzso is freely available for academic use at zzso
