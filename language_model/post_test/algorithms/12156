We propose a two-dimensional zzso to the zzso case of the zzso decomposition structure zzso proposed by zzso and further investigated by zzso based on a zzso pair of zzso We particularly address: 1) the construction of the dual basis and 2) the resulting directional zzso We also revisit the necessary zzso stage in the zzso zzso While several reconstructions are possible because of the zzso of the zzso we propose a new optimal signal reconstruction technique, which zzso potential zzso zzso The effectiveness of the proposed zzso decomposition is demonstrated via zzso comparisons on several image types zzso texture, zzso with various zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso improvements in terms of both overall noise reduction and direction preservation are zzso
