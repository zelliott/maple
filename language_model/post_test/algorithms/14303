This paper presents a new approach to the zzso zzso simulation of zzso geometry via zzso global zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso global zzso is founded upon the rigorous mathematics of zzso surface theory and Hodge zzso The zzso is globally zzso everywhere except for a minimum number of zero zzso Within our zzso zzso any zzso point surface is functionally equivalent to a zzso enabling popular and powerful zzso modeling and zzso simulation tools to be readily adapted for point geometry processing and zzso In addition, we propose a zzso surface zzso paradigm in which the partial differential equations (for dynamic physical zzso can be applied and solved directly over point samples via Moving zzso zzso zzso shape functions defined on the global zzso domain without explicit connectivity zzso The global zzso zzso provides a common domain to facilitate accurate zzso simulation and efficient zzso modeling for complex branching zzso Through our experiments on zzso elastic deformation and fracture zzso we demonstrate that our zzso method is very natural, and that it has great potential to further broaden the application scope of zzso geometry in graphics and relevant zzso
