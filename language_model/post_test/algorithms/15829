An exact expression for the zzso of random frequency that a given word has in text generated by a zzso chain is zzso The result is applied to periodic zzso zzso which describe the zzso DNA sequences better than simple zzso zzso A new solution to the problem of word overlap is zzso It was found that the expected frequency and overlapping properties determine most of the zzso The expectation and zzso of counts for triplets are compared with experimental counts in zzso coli coding zzso
