The objective of this study was to assess the zzso delivery of drugs using zzso with zzso and zzso fibers as controlled drug delivery zzso zzso of charged model drugs with the zzso fibers was studied as a method to achieve controlled zzso drug zzso Drug release from the zzso fiber into a zzso saline was dependent on the zzso of the zzso The release rates of zzso zzso and zzso were significantly slower than that of zzso zzso zzso of zzso across the skin was directly related to the zzso current density and drug concentration zzso zzso fiber was tested with zzso sodium zzso The zzso flux enhancement of sodium zzso from the fiber was zzso As the drug has to be released from the zzso fiber before zzso across the skin, a clear reduction in the drug zzso from the zzso and zzso fibers were observed compared to the respective zzso of the drugs in zzso Overall, the zzso fibers act as a drug zzso controlling the release and zzso zzso delivery of the zzso
