We present a model for predicting the transport of zzso magnetic zzso in a passive zzso system that consists of a zzso chamber positioned above a zzso zzso The model is based on a zzso equation that zzso the particle concentration in the zzso We solve this equation zzso using the finite volume zzso We apply the model to the zzso process wherein the magnetic force produced by the magnet attracts magnetic carrier particles with zzso gene zzso toward the bottom of the chamber for zzso with target zzso We study particle transport and zzso as a function of key zzso Our analysis indicates that the particles are zzso focused toward the center of the chamber during zzso and that the rate of zzso at the base can be enhanced using larger particles and/or by reducing the spacing between the magnet and the zzso The model provides insight into the physics of particle transport at the zzso and enables rapid zzso analysis of particle zzso which is useful for zzso novel zzso zzso
