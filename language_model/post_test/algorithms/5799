Gene expression experiments are common in molecular biology, for example in order to identify genes which play a certain role in a specified biological zzso For that purpose expression levels of several thousand genes are measured simultaneously using DNA zzso Comparing two distinct groups of tissue samples to detect those genes which are zzso expressed one statistical test per gene is performed, and resulting zzso are adjusted to control the false discovery zzso In addition, the expression change of each gene is zzso by some effect measure, typically the log fold zzso In certain cases, however, a gene with a significant zzso can have a rather small fold change while in other cases a zzso gene can have a rather large fold zzso The biological relevance of the change of gene expression can be more intuitively judged by a fold change then merely by a zzso zzso confidence intervals for the log fold change which accompany the adjusted zzso are zzso 

In a new approach, we employ an existing zzso for adjusting confidence intervals in the case of zzso data and apply it to a widely used linear model for zzso zzso Furthermore, we adopt a concept of different relevance categories for effects in clinical trials to assess biological relevance of genes in zzso zzso In a brief simulation study the properties of the adjusting zzso are maintained when being combined with the linear model for zzso zzso In two cancer data sets the adjusted confidence intervals can indicate significance of large fold changes and distinguish them from other large but zzso fold zzso zzso of confidence intervals also zzso the assessment of biological zzso 

Our new combination approach and the categorization of fold changes zzso the selection of genes in zzso experiments and helps to interpret their biological zzso
