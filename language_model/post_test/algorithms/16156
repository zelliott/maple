Modern zzso studies often aim to evaluate the zzso effect of a point exposure on the risk of a disease from cohort or zzso zzso zzso Because zzso bias is of serious concern in such zzso studies, investigators routinely adjust for a large number of potential zzso in a zzso zzso analysis of the effect of exposure on disease zzso Unfortunately, when zzso are not correctly zzso standard zzso zzso is likely biased in its estimate of the effect of exposure, potentially leading to erroneous zzso We partially resolve this serious limitation of standard zzso zzso analysis with a new zzso approach that we call zzso zzso which carefully combines standard zzso zzso with a zzso zzso analysis in which exposure is the dependent variable and the outcome and zzso are the independent zzso As a result, we obtain a correct estimate of the zzso odds ratio, if either zzso zzso zzso of the outcome given exposure and zzso factors is correct, or the zzso model of exposure given the outcome and zzso factors is correct but not necessarily both, that is, it is zzso In fact, it also has certain zzso efficiency zzso The approach is general in that it applies to both cohort and zzso studies whether the design of the study is matched or zzso on a subset of zzso Finally, an application illustrates the methods using data from the National Cancer Institute's zzso Cancer Survival zzso
