zzso for zzso of cancer zzso are proposed which do not require fixed age zzso The full available information on survival times can then be used, which is especially important in small treatment zzso For incidental zzso a zzso prevalence function and for fatal zzso the zzso zzso is zzso In the latter case, the estimated competing risk of the control population is zzso not its true zzso This makes the technique also zzso to treatment groups with high zzso which otherwise may give adjusted rates above zzso In the application part these zzso techniques are used here to study lung cancer in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The data include a zzso in fatal and incidental lung zzso For fatal lung cancer, the lifetime excess absolute risk zzso at 1 zzso averaged over all exposed groups is zzso for the zzso rats, while for the zzso rats it is zzso For the zzso rats, there are several groups exposed later in zzso When the averaging is restricted to animals with start of exposure prior to 150 days of age, the weighted average risk among the zzso rats is zzso Compared to groups with similar zzso as young adults (up to about 150 zzso animals exposed later in life have substantially lower lifetime zzso The zzso rats include groups with roughly equal exposure rates and ages at start of exposure, but with increasing exposure zzso Within these groupings the zzso at 1 zzso does not decrease with additional exposure at higher age, as would be expected if the risk from zzso at different ages would be zzso
