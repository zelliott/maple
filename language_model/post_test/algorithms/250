A new operator called zzso zzso zzso Spin zzso to zzso is presented to acquire broadband zzso zzso zzso zzso in one and two zzso Basically, the zzso decoupling is achieved through the application of zzso rotation zzso and zzso A zzso pulse building block is used to selectively zzso all zzso zzso remotely attached to zzso zzso which is equivalent to a zzso J decoupling of the zzso directly attached to zzso from all other zzso in the spin zzso In conjunction with an appropriate data processing technique pure shift zzso zzso are zzso For this purpose, the concept of constant time acquisition in the observe dimension is zzso Both ideas were merged together producing superior zzso based zzso zzso pulse zzso The resulting zzso zzso show cross zzso with collapsed zzso structures and zzso responses for the zzso chemical shift zzso An zzso assignment of signals from overcrowded zzso becomes much zzso Finally, the recently introduced zzso technique is exploited to enhance the capability of the zzso J decoupling zzso A significant reduction of the total measurement time is zzso The time is saved by reducing the number of zzso chemical shift evolution increments and working with superimposed narrow spectral zzso in the zzso indirect zzso
