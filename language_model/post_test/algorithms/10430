Under acute zzso from outer environment, a normal cell can trigger cellular self-defense mechanism in response to zzso zzso To investigate the zzso of cellular zzso process at single cell level further, a model of DNA damage generating and repair is proposed under acute Ion zzso zzso by using mathematical framework of kinetic theory of active particles zzso zzso we focus on illustrating the profile of Cellular zzso System zzso instituted by two zzso each of which is made up of the active particles with different discrete zzso Then, we implement the mathematical framework of cellular zzso zzso and illustrate the dynamic processes of Double Strand zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes zzso zzso and toxins zzso Finally, we roughly analyze the capability of cellular zzso zzso cellular activity of transferring DNA damage, and zzso stability, especially the different fates of a certain cell before and after the time thresholds of zzso zzso that a cell can tolerate zzso under different zzso zzso zzso
