Our study aimed to introduce an automatic three-dimensional method for measuring the zzso zzso and identifying potential gender differences and the effects on zzso component placement in total knee zzso Three hundred zzso zzso were scanned with zzso zzso Automatic and manual bone zzso and component placement were compared using a virtual zzso zzso For standard component use, zzso of the zzso were male and zzso were zzso For zzso component use, zzso were female and zzso were zzso zzso errors in both component translation and rotation existed but were zzso From these results, gender alone did not dictate component use in primary total knee zzso The restoration of zzso zzso profile in 3 dimensions can be obtained by accurately measuring patient zzso zzso anatomy and the appropriate zzso component design zzso Additional bone cuts, zzso zzso and adverse outcomes in fitting the patient to the zzso component may be zzso
