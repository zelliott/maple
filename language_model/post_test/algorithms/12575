This study investigates a level set method for complex zzso image zzso It consists of minimizing a functional containing an original observation term derived from zzso approximation and a complex zzso image representation and a classical boundary length zzso The zzso is carried out efficiently by a new zzso method which zzso a simple partition constraint directly in curve evolution to guarantee a partition of the image domain from an arbitrary initial zzso zzso are shown on both synthetic and real zzso zzso performance evaluation and comparisons are also zzso
