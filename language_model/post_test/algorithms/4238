The purpose of this study was to develop new and modified tools that allow zzso zzso quality assurance tests to be carried out efficiently without film, video cameras, zzso and mechanical zzso and to devise methods that use these new tools for daily and quarterly check procedures, which are efficient and provide increased accuracy compared to previous zzso The zzso zzso system tested was the zzso zzso zzso zzso Various zzso and treatment zzso designed for this system were zzso To measure the absolute position of the source, a simple tool was built that uses a zzso frame, a template for zzso zzso and a zzso for radiation zzso For daily zzso and source strength tests, modifications were made of a Model zzso zzso zzso zzso quality assurance zzso which is used with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso procedures and analysis protocols were developed that use the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet zzso Independent determination of source positions was made with a computer video camera and zzso zzso Using the new zzso for a straight zzso the measured source position is found to be within zzso zzso zzso of the mechanically set distance, for a ring zzso zzso zzso zzso for a tandem zzso zzso zzso and for an zzso zzso zzso zzso Using the modified zzso daily dwell position can be determined with an accuracy of zzso zzso and timer accuracy can be determined with an accuracy of zzso over a 20 s time zzso The time needed to carry out quarterly tests is estimated to be reduced by two- to zzso compared to previous zzso New and modified equipment and procedures have been developed for measuring zzso zzso dwell position and dwell times efficiently with high zzso The equipment described in this work can be built and modifications can be made in most zzso zzso of dwell position can be determined in straight zzso and ring and zzso zzso zzso zzso and accuracy can be zzso zzso strength can be zzso zzso efficiency is improved compared to previous methods that used film, video cameras, mechanical zzso and zzso
