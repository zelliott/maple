The purpose of our study was to develop a new method for zzso the severity of zzso lung disease using chest CT and to evaluate this method in patients with zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso (all zzso mean age, zzso zzso underwent chest CT and pulmonary function testing including zzso capacity for carbon monoxide zzso All patients were at their clinical baseline on the day of zzso Standard quantitative CT metrics including the percentage of the lung volume zzso zzso zzso and the 15th zzso of zzso units were zzso from the zzso of lung zzso A new zzso analysis method was developed to zzso the zzso volume and the volume of the remaining lung by zzso the entire lung zzso zzso into two underlying zzso one from the zzso and the other from the remaining lung zzso 

The mean zzso zzso for quantitative lung metrics was zzso zzso zzso for percentage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 47 zzso for 15th zzso of zzso units, and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso The correlation between pulmonary function tests and CT metrics was strongest for the percentage of zzso volume for all pulmonary function testing indexes, with correlations between forced zzso volume in 1 second zzso percentage predicted and the CT metrics of r zzso zzso r zzso zzso and r zzso zzso for the percentage of lung zzso zzso zzso the 15th zzso of zzso units, and the percentage of zzso volume, zzso 

A new method for zzso zzso volume as a percentage of total lung volume using chest CT zzso with pulmonary function parameters in patients with zzso and may have utility in the assessment of disease severity and progression of zzso lung zzso
