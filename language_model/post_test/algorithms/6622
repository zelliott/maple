Treatment of patients with suspected deep vein zzso zzso or pulmonary embolism zzso is problematic if diagnostic imaging is not immediately zzso zzso clinical probability zzso and zzso assessment can be used to identify patients for whom empirical protective zzso is zzso To evaluate whether zzso and zzso assessment, together with the use of zzso zzso zzso allow objective appraisal of zzso and zzso to be deferred for up to 72 hours, patients with suspected zzso and zzso were zzso zzso 

Patients identified with a high zzso or a moderate zzso with positive zzso test results received a protective zzso treatment of zzso the remaining patients were discharged without zzso zzso However, all patients were scheduled to undergo objective tests for zzso or zzso within 72 zzso Standard zzso therapy was administered when deferred diagnostic tests confirmed zzso zzso 

In total, 409 consecutive patients with suspected zzso and 124 with suspected zzso were included in this zzso A total of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso of patients had confirmed zzso zzso At the short-term follow-up zzso hours), only a single zzso event zzso upper zzso zzso zzso had occurred, whereas at the zzso zzso 5 events zzso zzso zzso zzso had occurred in patients in whom diagnosis of zzso or zzso had previously been ruled zzso None of the patients had major bleeding zzso zzso percent of patients were treated as zzso 

Our study demonstrates that this approach allows the safe deferral of diagnostic procedures for zzso and zzso for up to 72 zzso
