zzso see zzso zzso see zzso zzso play a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease due to their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso see zzso zzso can lead to zzso and zzso pairs via zzso zzso and zzso association, zzso Small zzso zzso adopt the zzso zzso whereas zzso contain at least zzso zzso To date, the underlying growth mechanism from zzso to the mature zzso still remains to be zzso Here, we performed zzso molecular dynamics simulations in explicit zzso on single zzso zzso and zzso zzso pairs of different size ranging from the zzso to the zzso We found that the initial zzso zzso per zzso is maintained over time in all zzso The observed zzso of zzso from the starting structure increase significantly with size due to the twisting of the zzso parallel zzso see zzso This twist causes long zzso to be unstable and leads to a zzso zzso pairs, which are stabilized by a zzso zzso exhibit more zzso properties such as the overall structure and the twist zzso Thus, they can act as stable zzso templates for further zzso zzso Key properties like the twist angle, shape zzso and zzso show a zzso behavior so that small zzso favor the zzso zzso whereas large zzso favor the zzso pair zzso The region for this zzso transition is at the size of approximately twelve zzso see zzso zzso From that, we propose the following growth mechanism from zzso see zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso of short zzso zzso breakage of large zzso zzso formation of short zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso
