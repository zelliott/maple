The zzso zzso is an indicator for diffusion restrictions in biological zzso It is observed zzso that the zzso is largest for directions perpendicular to the fiber direction in white zzso The directional dependence of the zzso can be described by the diffusion zzso zzso Since the intention of diffusion zzso imaging is to detect diffusion zzso the fit of the zzso zzso should be dominated by directions perpendicular to the zzso In this work, it is shown that the basic approach, which is solving the occurring linear system by a zzso zzso may completely fail in this regard if the diffusion is highly zzso This problem is solved by adapting the weights of the zzso thus emphasizing directions of restricted water zzso a direct fit of the zzso zzso to the measured zzso zzso Moreover, due to its large number of degrees of freedom, the zzso zzso can assume complicated shapes resulting in a fit which is sensitive to zzso This article demonstrates that the quality of the zzso zzso calculation can be further improved if the fit is zzso by suppressing too large and too small zzso zzso values and thus restricting the possible zzso zzso
