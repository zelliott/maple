This study suggests an approach to effective transmission of multimedia content in a rapidly changing Internet environment including zzso zzso zzso in networks is currently an important research zzso When zzso zzso zzso zzso packets in a zzso network environment, network A may assign priority in an order zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the other hand, network B may reverse the order to a priority zzso zzso zzso and zzso In this case, the zzso packets that received the best quality of service in network A will receive the lowest in network B, which may result in dropping of packets in network B and vice zzso This study suggests a way to guarantee zzso between hosts by minimizing the loss of zzso packet class when one network zzso zzso class packets to another network with differing zzso It is expected that zzso guarantees and their experimental value may be zzso as principles which can be applied to various zzso environments based on zzso
