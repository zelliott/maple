zzso zzso of tissue zzso in terms of different components zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso provides a set of zzso for tumor zzso zzso integration of these zzso in whole slide images zzso from a large zzso can provide zzso models of the clinical zzso However, the performance of the existing zzso zzso techniques is hindered as a result of large technical and biological variations that are always present in a large zzso In this paper, we propose an zzso for zzso of tissue zzso based on zzso sparse decomposition zzso and spatial pyramid matching zzso which zzso sparse tissue zzso signatures at various locations and zzso The method has been evaluated on two distinct zzso of different tumor types collected from The Cancer Genome zzso zzso The zzso of our approach are: zzso zzso to different tumor zzso zzso zzso in the presence of wide technical and biological zzso and zzso zzso with varying training sample zzso
