zzso of medical images is a complex problem zzso to the large variety of their zzso In the automated analysis of breast zzso two image classes may be distinguished according to whether one considers the zzso of DNA zzso level images of isolated zzso or the detection of zzso zzso zzso images of zzso zzso The study of these image classes generally involves the use of largely different image processing zzso We therefore propose a new zzso derived from the watershed transformation enabling us to solve these two zzso problems with the same general zzso We then present visual and quantitative results to validate our zzso
