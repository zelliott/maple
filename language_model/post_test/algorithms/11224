The surprising observation that virtually the entire human zzso is transcribed means we know little about the function of many emerging classes of zzso except their astounding zzso Traditional zzso function prediction methods rely on sequence or alignment information, which are limited in their abilities to zzso the various collections of zzso zzso zzso To address this, we developed zzso of zzso by Analysis of zzso zzso a machine zzso approach for zzso of zzso zzso zzso uses biologically zzso features including zzso length and zzso specificity to distinguish between different zzso zzso We evaluated zzso using zzso small zzso sequencing data sets from four human tissue types and were able to zzso six different types of zzso with zzso zzso zzso Analysis by zzso revealed that zzso small zzso and zzso zzso are highly discernible and consistent across all human tissue types zzso whereas long zzso zzso small zzso zzso and small nuclear zzso show less consistent zzso The ability to reliably zzso zzso across tissue types demonstrates the potential of zzso to characterize zzso using small zzso sequencing data in less zzso zzso
