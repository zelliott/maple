Due to the characteristic artifacts of ultrasound images, zzso zzso noise, shadows and intensity zzso traditional zzso methods usually have limited success on the zzso of fetal abdominal zzso This paper presents a novel approach to detect and measure the abdominal zzso from fetal ultrasound images in two zzso First, a local zzso measure called zzso feature asymmetry zzso is de zzso from the zzso signal to detect the boundaries of fetal zzso The zzso measure is intensity zzso and provides an absolute measurement for the zzso zzso of features in the zzso Second, in order to detect the zzso that zzso to the abdominal zzso the zzso zzso zzso transform is employed to exclude the zzso of the inner zzso after which the detected zzso gradually zzso to the outer boundaries of the zzso Experimental results in clinical ultrasound images demonstrate the high agreement between our approach and manual approach on the measurement of abdominal circumference zzso sign difference is zzso and correlation zzso zzso is zzso which indicates that the proposed approach can be used as a reliable and accurate tool for zzso care and zzso
