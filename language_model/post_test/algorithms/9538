zzso zzso groups are involved in a large variety of electron transfer reactions because of their ability to exist in both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso state without any large differences in zzso Our studies on zzso coordinated by two zzso zzso and zzso coordinated by zzso and zzso zzso will be zzso In both of these coordination zzso the zzso core can exhibit zzso low spin zzso zzso resonance zzso signals with large zzso values (also called Type I, highly zzso low spin, or highly zzso low spin, zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso coordinated zzso zzso and zzso envelopes are related to the orientation of the His groups with respect to each other such that zzso parallel His planes results in a zzso signal and zzso perpendicular His planes results in a zzso zzso zzso between the structure of the zzso and its zzso for zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as derived from a large series of zzso c zzso show, however, that for such a combination of zzso zzso there is no clear-cut difference between the large zzso and the zzso zzso cases as a result of the relative zzso zzso Nonetheless, a new linear correlation links the average shift delta of the zzso zzso groups with the zzso zzso
