The purpose of this study was to compare the pressure required to abolish zzso as predicted from a previously derived zzso zzso with the true effective pressure zzso determined during a continuous positive airway pressure zzso zzso zzso 

Sleep clinic of a university zzso 

We zzso studied zzso patients with sleep zzso undergoing zzso zzso The following protocol was zzso zzso began at a pressure zzso calculated from a previously derived equation based on body mass index, neck zzso and zzso index zzso If zzso at zzso was zzso 10, the pressure was increased in steps of 1 zzso zzso until zzso became zzso zzso If, on the other hand, zzso at zzso was zzso 10, the pressure was reduced in increments of 1 zzso zzso until zzso became zzso zzso The lowest pressure that zzso sleep zzso is defined as the zzso zzso zzso tests, linear zzso and distribution of zzso - zzso were used to compare zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso was accomplished in 276 patients zzso Mean zzso was similar to mean zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was a significant correlation between these two pressures zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso of the distribution of zzso - zzso revealed that in zzso of patients, zzso was within zzso 1 zzso zzso of zzso in zzso of patients, the two measures were within zzso 2 zzso zzso and in zzso within zzso 3 zzso zzso 

We conclude that pressure predicted from an zzso based on simple zzso and sleep variables constitutes a good starting point for zzso zzso allowing the optimum pressure to be achieved with only a few incremental zzso
