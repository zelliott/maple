The zzso zzso measure of the human startle zzso response is the zzso zzso zzso However, zzso measurement is not always zzso as with special populations or during functional zzso We evaluated an alternative, zzso zzso measure that uses infrared zzso light reflected from the zzso By simultaneously recording zzso and zzso during an acoustic zzso zzso of startle zzso we were able to directly compare the two measures and evaluate the relative reliability and zzso of the zzso measure as an index of startle response zzso Although fewer responses were detected using zzso than zzso both measures were equally sensitive to zzso zzso of response zzso zzso and zzso We conclude that when the goal is simply to assess the effects of a zzso on the startle response, zzso zzso is an adequate alternative to zzso
