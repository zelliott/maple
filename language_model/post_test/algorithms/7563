We consider the problem of network formation in a distributed zzso Network formation is modeled as a zzso game, where agents represent zzso that form and sever zzso links with other zzso and derive utilities from these zzso Furthermore, agents can form links only with a limited set of zzso Agents trade off the benefit from zzso which is determined by a zzso reward function, and the cost of maintaining zzso When each agent acts zzso trying to maximize its own utility function, we can characterize zzso networks through the notion of Nash zzso In fact, the introduced reward and cost functions lead to Nash zzso zzso which exhibit several desirable properties such as zzso zzso diameter, and efficiency zzso minimum number of zzso Since Nash networks may not necessarily be efficient, we also explore the possibility of zzso the set of Nash networks through the introduction of zzso utility zzso Such utility functions may represent dynamic phenomena such as establishment costs zzso positive or zzso Finally, we show how Nash networks can be the outcome of a distributed learning zzso In particular, we extend previous learning processes to so-called zzso zzso zzso games, and we show that the proposed network formation games belong to this class of zzso
