In some social and biological networks, the majority of zzso belong to multiple zzso It has recently been shown that a number of the zzso specifically designed to detect overlapping communities do not perform well in such highly overlapping zzso Here, we consider one class of these zzso those which zzso a local fitness measure, typically by using a greedy zzso to expand a seed into a zzso We perform synthetic benchmarks which indicate that an appropriate seeding strategy becomes more important as the extent of community overlap zzso We find that distinct zzso provide the best zzso We find further support for this seeding strategy with benchmarks on a Facebook network and the zzso zzso
