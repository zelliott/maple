The zzso zzso System is a hand-held zzso system used to administer zzso an approved therapy for pulmonary zzso zzso Our goal was to establish an in zzso method for delivering a standard dose of zzso through a zzso circuit and artificial zzso 

An zzso II jet zzso zzso air flow at zzso zzso Medical zzso was placed in the zzso circuit with a test zzso Two zzso were tested, the zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso Medical zzso and zzso zzso without zzso zzso dose was defined by capturing zzso particles zzso the zzso tube with a filter zzso and measuring zzso zzso zzso were measured zzso to the zzso tube by cascade zzso We hypothesized that drug delivery would be determined by the number of breaths needed, such that the complete time of inspiration totaled zzso zzso number of breaths zzso where zzso is the zzso time of an average breath read from the zzso zzso 

zzso output was linear for zzso and the standard prescribed target dose of zzso zzso of full zzso was delivered in zzso Using our zzso zzso to control delivery, the mean zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso delivered higher doses than zzso zzso of mode, breathing pattern, and zzso zzso pressures were not zzso The mass median aerodynamic diameter and fine particle fraction were zzso and zzso zzso 

Using the algorithm, it was possible to deliver zzso zzso at controlled doses, via mechanical ventilation over a wide range of controlled breathing zzso The conditions of zzso must be precisely followed (one full zzso per treatment, use of the zzso II zzso continuous zzso using an external flow of zzso bypass of the zzso or removal of zzso heat and moisture zzso and treatment completed in zzso or zzso
