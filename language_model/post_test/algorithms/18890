The zzso binding mode of a zzso zzso to zzso and zzso was investigated by zzso methods including zzso and circular and linear zzso zzso and zzso zzso Immediately after mixing with zzso the zzso zzso exhibited zzso and zzso in the zzso spectrum and negative CD and zzso zzso With further zzso in zzso the CD and zzso magnitude in the zzso region became increasingly negative over zzso After it was zzso the magnitude of the reduced zzso zzso in the zzso region was larger than that in the DNA zzso region, indicating that the second zzso was also zzso Following the rapid zzso of the first zzso the very slow zzso of the second followed with zzso zzso In the zzso case, a zzso CD spectrum was observed in the zzso region suggesting stacking of the zzso The small zzso in the CD spectrum and increased zzso which followed the initial rapid spectral change, was of the second zzso This zzso in the spectral properties was attributed to the zzso change of zzso near the binding site because the overall shape of the CD spectrum was zzso in spite of the changes in the zzso zzso
