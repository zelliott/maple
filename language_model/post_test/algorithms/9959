zzso devices are usually zzso by electric field zzso over zzso defined zzso patterns on zzso crystal zzso For the optimal zzso optical performance of such devices, the zzso domain structure must ensure good zzso to the designed grating zzso We present a zzso zzso method to evaluate the quality of periodically zzso zzso zzso zzso by utilizing index zzso caused by the internal field zzso Our proposed method is much simpler than the conventional zzso generation experiment, and provides a fast, low-cost but accurate means for zzso quality zzso
