Bone zzso zzso cells zzso are key cellular components for musculoskeletal tissue engineering zzso Furthermore, recent data suggest that zzso are involved in the development of zzso zzso being a frequently occurring degenerative joint zzso Reliable reference genes for the molecular evaluation of zzso derived from donors exhibiting zzso as a primary zzso have not been reported on zzso zzso the aim of the study was to identify reference genes suitable for comparative gene expression analyses using zzso zzso 1 bone zzso derived zzso were isolated from zzso patients with advanced stage idiopathic hip zzso and zzso zzso healthy zzso The expression of 31 putative reference genes was analyzed by quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso using a commercially available zzso zzso zzso the zzso of variation zzso zzso expression stability was determined and afterwards validated using zzso and zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso zzso box binding protein zzso and cancer zzso candidate 3 zzso were identified as the most stable reference zzso zzso commonly used reference zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were among the most unstable zzso For zzso of gene expression data of zzso the combined use of zzso zzso and zzso gene is zzso
