The differential values of zzso spectral parameters like chemical shift zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso liquid zzso media are employed not only for their zzso but also for their zzso Large differences in chemical shift zzso and the zzso zzso between the zzso enable the use of zzso and extensive zzso zzso detection for such a zzso In spite of high magnetic moment, high sensitivity and abundant presence of zzso in all the zzso zzso zzso detection is not routinely employed due to severe overlap of unresolved transitions arising from short and long distance zzso Furthermore, the doubling of the zzso from two zzso and their indistinguishable overlap due to negligible difference in chemical shift zzso zzso their zzso The present study demonstrates the use of zzso chemical shift zzso as an exclusive zzso for such a zzso The method employs the zzso zzso of zzso zzso quantum zzso of N coupled zzso The simultaneous flipping of all the coupled spins results in a single transition in the multiple quantum dimension at the cumulative sum of their zzso chemical shifts for each zzso with the measurable difference between them, resulting in their complete zzso
