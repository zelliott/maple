In this paper, zzso variable structure neural control is investigated for a class of zzso systems under the effects of zzso state delays and uncertain zzso zzso The unknown zzso delay uncertainties are compensated for using appropriate zzso zzso in the design, and the effect of the uncertain zzso with the zzso zzso model representation is also zzso using the proposed zzso By utilizing the zzso zzso function, the zzso control system is proved to be zzso zzso ultimately bounded zzso zzso simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed zzso
