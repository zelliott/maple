A combination of inverse procedures is employed in the design of zzso zzso coils with specific examples in, but not restricted to, magnetic resonance zzso The first inverse procedure is the use of functional methods for the zzso of zzso characteristics subject to restrictions on the field zzso Continuous current zzso are derived from analysis of the fields they are required to zzso To make use of these zzso at a desired frequency, the method of moments is applied as a second inverse procedure to a zzso version of the current zzso The advantage of this hybrid technique is that it provides a zzso zzso for zzso of zzso zzso zzso matching and other aspects of zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso has been built using the engineering values predicted by the zzso Experimental results including images acquired from the zzso zzso are zzso
