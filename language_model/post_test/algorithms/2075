We describe a novel approach for predicting the function of a protein from its zzso zzso Given features that can be zzso from the zzso sequence in a straightforward fashion (such as zzso molecular weight, and zzso zzso the technique allows us to answer questions such zzso Is the protein an zzso If so, in which zzso Commission zzso class does it zzso Our approach uses machine learning zzso techniques to induce zzso that predict the zzso class of an zzso from features extracted from its primary zzso We report on a variety of experiments in which we explored the use of three different zzso techniques in conjunction with training zzso derived from zzso and from zzso We also explored the use of several different feature zzso Our method is able to predict the first zzso number of an zzso with zzso accuracy zzso assigning the zzso to one of six broad categories of zzso zzso and to predict the second zzso number of an zzso with zzso accuracy zzso assigning the zzso to one of 57 zzso of zzso zzso This technique could be a valuable complement to zzso searches and to zzso zzso
