The objective of this paper was to face the complex zzso dynamics shown by zzso zzso data by applying a zzso distributed approach for the Blind Sources zzso The effort was to characterize and zzso the zzso of a zzso respiratory exercise used in the treatment of obsessive compulsive zzso 

The patient performed a precise respiratory zzso at one breath per minute for 31 minutes, with 10 minutes resting phase before and zzso The two steps of classical Independent zzso zzso have been performed by using a Cellular zzso Network with two sets of zzso The choice of the couple of suitable templates has been carried out using genetic zzso zzso zzso 

Performing zzso with a zzso distributed approach, the zzso of the CNN have been compared to the zzso zzso In all the protocol zzso the main components founded with CNN have similar trends compared with that ones obtained with zzso Moreover, using this distributed approach, a spatial location has been associated to each zzso 

To underline the zzso and the zzso of the neural process a distributed zzso architecture has been zzso This strategy has been designed in order to overcome the hypothesis of linear combination among the sources signals, that is characteristic of the zzso approach, taking advantage of the spatial zzso
