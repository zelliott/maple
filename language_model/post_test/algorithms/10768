As the Human Genome Project and other zzso projects experience remarkable success and a flood of biological data is produced by means of zzso sequencing techniques, detection of horizontal gene transfer zzso becomes a promising field in zzso This review describes two zzso zzso zzso for zzso Windows and zzso for zzso zzso is a zzso user interface program that offers functions to reconstruct the zzso network among the donor and zzso hosts from the gene and species distance zzso zzso is a set of zzso driven programs used to detect zzso in zzso While zzso impresses with a zzso interface and drawing of the zzso network, the strength of zzso is an extensive statistical framework of zzso and the zzso display of the estimated sequence position probabilities for the candidate zzso transferred zzso
