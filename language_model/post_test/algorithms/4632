Human zzso zzso zzso are surviving traces of ancient zzso infections and now reside within the human zzso Recently zzso expression has been detected in both normal zzso and diseased zzso However, the activities zzso zzso of individual zzso sequences are mostly zzso 

We introduce a zzso mixture model, based on Hidden zzso zzso for zzso the activities of the individual zzso sequences from zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso We use the model to estimate the relative activities of 181 zzso We also zzso justify a faster zzso method for zzso activity zzso and use it to estimate the activities of zzso zzso The majority of the zzso activities were previously zzso 

zzso Our methods estimate activity accurately based on experiments on simulated zzso zzso Our estimate on real data shows that zzso of the zzso are zzso The active ones are spread zzso into zzso groups and relatively zzso in terms of estimated zzso zzso with the zzso zzso gene are more often active than zzso without zzso Few of the active zzso have open reading frames for zzso zzso
