zzso and interpretation of reconstructed images using a zzso electrical zzso zzso zzso requires a zzso phantom including imaging objects with known complex zzso zzso + zzso zzso We describe imaging experiments using the recently developed zzso system called the zzso zzso with the frequency range of 10 zzso to 500 zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso system, we first measured complex zzso zzso of different imaging objects including zzso zzso zzso zzso animal hide zzso banana and zzso Based on an analysis of how zzso and zzso affect measured complex boundary zzso we suggested a new complex version of a zzso zzso image reconstruction zzso Imaging experiments were conducted to produce zzso images of the objects at multiple zzso using the proposed zzso Images of a conductor zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso were used to set a common scale bar to display all zzso Comparing reconstructed zzso images at multiple zzso with measured complex zzso zzso we found that they showed an overall similarity in terms of changes in complex zzso values with respect to zzso However, primarily due to the limitation of the difference imaging algorithm, we suggest that zzso zzso images must be interpreted in terms of relative contrast changes with respect to zzso We propose further imaging studies using biological zzso of known complex zzso zzso and using human subjects to find clinical applications of the zzso zzso
