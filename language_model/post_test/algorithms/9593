zzso zzso zzso represent a large zzso carbon store and as such have the potential to be either an ongoing net sink of carbon or a significant net source of zzso In the UK many zzso zzso are managed for a range of purposes but these purposes have rarely included carbon zzso However, there is now an opportunity to consider whether management practices could be altered to enhance storage of carbon in zzso zzso Further, there are now voluntary and regulated carbon trading schemes operational throughout Europe that mean stored zzso if verified, could have an economic and zzso zzso This means that new income zzso could become available for zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso project has developed a model for calculating carbon zzso from zzso zzso that covers all carbon zzso and release pathways zzso zzso and gaseous zzso The model has been developed so that the impact of common management options within UK zzso zzso can be zzso The model was run for a decade from zzso and applied to an area of 550 zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the Peak zzso The study estimates that the region is presently a net sink of zzso zzso CO2 equivalent at an average export of zzso zzso CO2 zzso If management interventions were targeted across the area the total sink could increase to zzso zzso zzso at an average export of zzso zzso CO2 zzso However, not all interventions resulted in a zzso some resulted in increased losses of CO2 zzso Given present costs of zzso restoration and value of carbon zzso the study suggests that 51% of those areas, where a carbon benefit was estimated by zzso for targeted action of management interventions, would show a profit from carbon offsetting within 30 zzso However, this percentage is very dependent upon the price of carbon zzso
