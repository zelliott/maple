A mathematical model of the zzso activity of zzso in norm and psoriasis is zzso which consists of a system of two autonomous zzso differential zzso A qualitative analysis of the model was done, and zzso solutions at the zzso values corresponding to these state were zzso It was shown that, in norm, the system can exist only in one stationary equilibrium state of the zzso type, and in zzso due to an increase in the growing zzso zzso and enhanced migration of zzso a stable limiting cycle arises from the state of an unstable zzso The existence of two stable states zzso and the limiting zzso is regulated by a zzso that describes the zzso of division of maturing cells of zzso zzso layers by the intrinsic zzso zzso of zzso of zzso zzso The model is consistent with experimental data on the zzso of cell proliferation in the zzso in norm and psoriasis and the clinical course of the zzso
