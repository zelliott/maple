We assessed zzso transfer of the zzso realignment zzso of zzso adaptation in right-handers by examining alternate target pointing with the two hands for 40 successive trials, 20 with each zzso zzso for the right hand was not different as a function of exposure sequence order or zzso test order, in contrast with adaptation for the left zzso zzso was greater for the left hand when the right hand started the alternate pointing than when the sequence of zzso movements started with the left zzso Also, the largest zzso adaptation appeared when that hand was tested first after zzso Terminal error during exposure varied in cycles for the two hands, zzso on zero when the right hand led, but no difference appeared between the two hands when the left hand zzso These results suggest that transfer of zzso realignment occurs from the right to the left hand during both exposure and zzso zzso Such transfer reflects the process of maintaining spatial alignment between the two zzso Normally, the left hand appears to be zzso with the right-hand spatial map, and when the two hands are zzso the zzso spatial map is zzso with the right-hand spatial zzso
