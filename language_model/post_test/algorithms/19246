In the assessment of zzso bone mineral density zzso with quantitative zzso zzso accuracy is limited by systematic errors caused by zzso effects and unknown zzso and fat zzso in zzso zzso zzso depends on precise repositioning of the patient, selection of the region of interest zzso and apparatus zzso In an integrated approach, these error sources were taken into zzso zzso methods are incorporated and tested to avoid systematic zzso zzso zzso for automated zzso determination that work reliably and offer improved zzso and efficiency are zzso A new design of reference phantom with solid zzso materials provides zzso in zzso units and checks apparatus zzso zzso methods are necessary to achieve accuracy of zzso or zzso zzso zzso definition and reference phantom methods are mandatory for zzso of zzso or zzso
