zzso zzso is routinely used in modern biology to zzso the functional or zzso roles of protein zzso and plays an important role in the field of rational protein zzso Over the past decade, a number of zzso tools have been developed that can predict the effect of point zzso on a zzso zzso zzso However, these programs usually provide predictions for only a single zzso Furthermore, online versions of these tools are often zzso to use for examination of large and diverse sets of zzso We have created a new web application, zzso that can simultaneously predict the effect of zzso on stability, zzso affinity and zzso zzso zzso also provides an expanded zzso with respect to other online tools which includes the ability to obtain predictions for multiple zzso in one zzso As a result, researchers who use zzso zzso can access state-of-the-art protein design methods with a fraction of the effort previously zzso The results of zzso zzso on standard zzso demonstrate that its accuracy for all three prediction types compares well to currently available zzso We illustrate zzso potential by using it to investigate the influence of zzso on the activity of zzso zzso This example demonstrates how the ability to obtain a wide range of information from one source, that can be combined to obtain deeper insight into the influence of zzso makes zzso a valuable service to both experimental and zzso zzso
