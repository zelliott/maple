To characterize the diversity of bacterial populations in zzso studies, sequencing reads need to be accurately assigned to zzso units in a given reference zzso zzso that cannot be reliably assigned to a unique leaf in the zzso zzso zzso are typically assigned to the lowest common zzso of the set of species that match zzso This introduces a potentially severe error in the zzso of bacteria present in the sample due to false zzso since all species in the zzso rooted at the zzso are implicitly assigned to the read even though many of them may not match zzso 

We present a method that maps each read to a zzso in the zzso that zzso a penalty score while balancing the relevance of precision and recall in the assignment through a zzso zzso This mapping can be obtained in time linear in the number of matching zzso because zzso queries to the reference zzso take constant zzso When applied to six different zzso zzso our zzso produces different zzso zzso depending on whether coverage or precision is zzso Including information on the quality of the reads reduces the number of zzso reads but increases the number of ambiguous reads, stressing the relevance of our zzso Finally, two measures of performance are described and results with a set of artificially generated zzso are zzso 

The assignment strategy of sequencing reads introduced in this paper is a versatile and a quick method to study bacterial zzso The bacterial composition of the analyzed samples can vary significantly depending on how ambiguous reads are assigned depending on the value of the zzso zzso zzso of our results in an artificial zzso confirm that a combination of values of zzso produces the most accurate zzso
