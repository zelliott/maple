The study of zzso groups is fundamental to zzso zzso and in particular to image zzso One of the most developed zzso employs a zzso approach using zzso zzso zzso To date, the zzso of the zzso log and exponential maps on the zzso group have been defined implicitly via an zzso zzso zzso In this paper we the employ zzso (1991) polar zzso to decompose a zzso h as zzso zzso S o zzso where zzso zzso zzso is the zzso of a convex function p and S zzso zzso is a zzso zzso We show that all such zzso zzso form a zzso which we term zzso generated by zzso flows from the zzso Using the natural zzso the zzso zzso is zzso This allows us to calculate the zzso log map on this zzso of zzso in closed form, and develop extremely efficient zzso image registration zzso This result has far-reaching implications in terms of the statistical analysis of anatomical zzso within the framework of zzso zzso
