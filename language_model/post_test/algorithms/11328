Nowadays the formula to calculate the sample size for estimate a proportion (as zzso is based on the zzso distribution, however it would be based on a zzso distribution which confidence zzso was possible to be calculated using the Wilson zzso zzso By comparing the two zzso zzso and zzso zzso the variation of the zzso of the confidence intervals is relevant in the tails and the center of the zzso In order to calculate the needed sample size we have simulated an zzso sampling zzso which shows an zzso of the sample size for values of prevalence closed to 0 or 1, and also an zzso for values closed to zzso zzso to these results we proposed an zzso based on Wilson zzso method that provides similar values for the sample size than zzso obtained by zzso
