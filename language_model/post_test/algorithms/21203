To improve birth weight zzso in fetuses weighing zzso 1600 g at birth by zzso a new formula including zzso obtained using three-dimensional zzso zzso 

In a prospective cohort study, zzso data of 150 singleton fetuses weighing zzso 1600 g at birth were obtained by zzso examination within 1 week before zzso zzso criteria were multiple pregnancy, zzso death as well as major structural or zzso zzso A new formula was derived using our data, and was then compared with currently available equations for zzso weight in the zzso zzso 

Different statistical zzso strategies were zzso zzso boosting with zzso wise smoothing zzso achieved the best zzso The resulting new formula zzso fetal weight zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso HC + zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso FL + zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso where zzso is abdominal volume determined by zzso zzso HC is head zzso zzso is thigh volume determined by zzso zzso FL is zzso length and zzso is zzso zzso proved to be superior to established equations in terms of mean squared prediction zzso signed percentage errors and absolute percentage zzso 

Our new formula is relatively easy to use and needs no adjustment to weight zzso or to fetal zzso In fetuses weighing zzso 1600 g at birth it is superior to weight zzso by traditional zzso using two-dimensional zzso
