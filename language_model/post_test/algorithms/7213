zzso zzso method is an economical and environmentally friendly or zzso technology, which has been of interest for more than six decades for the purpose of enhancement of zzso zzso However, in spite of many studies, questions about the effective mechanisms causing increase in oil recovery still zzso In addition, the majority of the mechanisms mentioned in the previous studies are theoretical or zzso One of the changes that could be recognized in the fluid properties is zzso reduction due to radiation of ultrasound zzso In this study, a technique was developed to investigate directly the effect of zzso waves zzso zzso of 25, 40, 68 zzso and powers of 100, zzso 500 zzso on zzso changes of three types of oil zzso oil, zzso oil, and zzso and a zzso zzso The zzso calculations in the smooth zzso tube were based on the mathematical models developed from the zzso zzso The experiments were carried out for uncontrolled and controlled temperature zzso It was observed that the zzso of all the liquids was decreased under ultrasound in all the zzso This reduction was more significant for uncontrolled temperature condition zzso However, the reduction in zzso under ultrasound was higher for lighter liquids compare to heavier zzso zzso difference was diminished by decreasing in the fluid zzso in all the cases which increases fluid flow ability, which in turn aids to higher oil recovery in enhanced oil recovery zzso zzso Higher ultrasound power showed higher liquid zzso reduction in all the zzso Higher ultrasound frequency revealed higher and lower zzso reduction for uncontrolled and controlled temperature condition experiments, zzso In other words, the reduction in zzso was zzso zzso to increasing the frequency in temperature controlled zzso It was concluded that zzso heat generation, and zzso reduction are three of the promising mechanisms causing increase in oil recovery under zzso
