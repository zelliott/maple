Abstract zzso technological advances have fueled an explosive growth in the scope and scale of biological data and have propelled life sciences into the realm of zzso zzso that cannot be managed or analyzed by conventional zzso Big Data in the life sciences are driven primarily via a diverse collection of zzso technologies, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso enrichment analysis is a powerful approach for interrogating large zzso zzso leading to the identification of biological mechanisms associated with observed zzso While several factors influence the results from such analysis, the impact from the contents of zzso databases is often zzso zzso databases often contain variously named pathways that overlap with one another to varying zzso Ignoring such redundancies during zzso analysis can lead to the designation of several pathways as being significant due to high zzso rather than truly independent biological zzso zzso such zzso also result in correlated p values and zzso leading to biased zzso We investigated the level of redundancies in multiple zzso databases and observed large discrepancies in the nature and extent of zzso zzso This prompted us to develop the application, zzso zzso Control in zzso zzso to control redundancies in zzso databases based on zzso zzso Analysis of zzso and genetic zzso using zzso zzso versions of zzso and zzso zzso led to a reduction in zzso among the zzso zzso and allowed for the inclusion of additional zzso representing possibly novel biological zzso Using obesity as an example, zzso analysis further demonstrated that zzso identified from zzso zzso databases show stronger evidence of prior association to obesity compared to pathways identified from the original zzso
