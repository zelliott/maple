zzso coding has established itself as a useful tool for the representation of natural data in the zzso as well as zzso zzso The aim of this letter, inspired by the human brain, is to improve on the performance of the sparse coding zzso by trying to bridge the gap between zzso and zzso To this end, we build on the localized zzso cycle in cognitive zzso by zzso it under the umbrella of zzso attention, which lends itself to increase gradually the contrast between relevant information and irrelevant zzso zzso in another way, irrelevant information is filtered away, while relevant information about the environment is enhanced from one cycle to the zzso We may thus think in terms of the information zzso which, in a zzso context, was introduced in the literature by Fraser zzso In a zzso context, the information filter provides a method for zzso zzso of zzso zzso The information filter may therefore be viewed as the basis for improving the zzso performance of sparse zzso To support this performance improvement, the letter presents two computer zzso The first experiment uses simulated zzso data that are generated to purposely make the problem zzso The second uses real-life radar data that are complex zzso hence the proposal to introduce zzso calculus into derivation of the new zzso
