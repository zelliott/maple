We assessed complementary zzso zzso zzso as an alternative statistical model for zzso zzso prevalence ratios zzso and their confidence zzso Using the delta method, we derived an expression for zzso the zzso of the zzso estimated using zzso zzso Then, using simulated data, we examined the performance of zzso zzso in terms of the accuracy of the zzso estimates, the zzso of the confidence zzso and the empirical coverage zzso and compared it with results obtained from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Within the range of values of our simulated data, zzso zzso performed well, with only slight bias of point estimates of the zzso and good confidence zzso zzso In addition, and importantly, the zzso zzso did not have the convergence problems occasionally exhibited by zzso zzso The technique is easy to implement in zzso zzso Institute, Cary, zzso and it does not have the theoretical and practical issues associated with competing zzso zzso zzso is an alternative method of zzso zzso that warrants further zzso
