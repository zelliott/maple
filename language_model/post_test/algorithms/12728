zzso zzso is typically highly correlated with visual difficulty for zzso zzso and zzso detection zzso has been widely used as a zzso zzso in zzso zzso increasing zzso sensitivity in detecting subtle zzso without increasing zzso rates is zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of training database case selection on zzso performance in detecting zzso breast zzso 

A zzso digital zzso image database that included 525 cases depicting zzso masses was randomly zzso into three zzso A zzso scheme was applied to detect all initially suspected mass regions and zzso region zzso Training samples were zzso selected from two of the zzso Four types of training data zzso one including all available zzso mass regions in the two zzso zzso zzso one including 350 randomly selected mass regions zzso zzso one including 350 zzso mass regions zzso and zzso one including 350 zzso mass regions zzso zzso In each training data set, the same number of randomly selected zzso regions as the zzso were also zzso Two zzso an artificial neural network zzso and a zzso neighbor zzso algorithm, were trained using each of the four training data sets and tested on all suspected regions in the remaining data zzso Using a zzso zzso method, the performance changes of the zzso schemes trained using one of the four training data sets were zzso and zzso 

zzso initially detected zzso zzso mass regions depicted on zzso cases zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso regions zzso per zzso in the entire zzso Using the all training data set, zzso achieved the highest overall performance on the entire testing zzso However, zzso detected the highest number of zzso masses when the difficult training data set was used for zzso zzso did agree for both zzso and zzso zzso in all zzso Compared to the use of the all training data set, the sensitivity of the schemes trained using the difficult data set decreased by zzso and zzso for the ANN and zzso zzso on the entire database, respectively, but the detection of zzso masses increased by zzso and zzso for the ANN and zzso zzso at a zzso rate of zzso per zzso 

zzso performance depends on the size, diversity, and difficulty level of the training zzso To increase zzso sensitivity in detecting subtle cancer, one should increase the fraction of difficult cases in the training database rather than simply increasing the training data set zzso
