An alternate zzso testing zzso has been proposed which includes a zzso zzso followed by an zzso zzso differentiation supplemental test for zzso specimens and a zzso acid test zzso for specimens with zzso zzso 

To evaluate the performance of five rapid tests zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Trinity Biotech zzso as the supplemental zzso zzso in the zzso 

A total of zzso serum and plasma specimens that were third-generation zzso repeatedly zzso and Western zzso zzso negative or indeterminate were tested with rapid tests and zzso zzso were classified by zzso zzso zzso infected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso unknown zzso zzso zzso zzso or by zzso zzso zzso positive zzso and zzso zzso and zzso positive zzso Excluding zzso positive zzso we calculated the proportion of zzso rapid tests among specimens with zzso and zzso zzso 

The proportion of infected specimens with zzso rapid test results and negative or indeterminate zzso ranged from zzso zzso to zzso zzso depending on the rapid zzso From zzso to zzso of zzso specimens had zzso rapid test zzso 

In these zzso challenging zzso all rapid tests identified infections that were missed by the Western zzso but only zzso could differentiate zzso from zzso Regardless of which rapid test is used as a supplemental test in the alternative algorithm, zzso zzso results zzso zzso screening and rapid test in zzso zzso may occur, which will need to be resolved during the baseline medical zzso
