Within the context of hand gesture recognition, zzso gesture zzso is the task of zzso in a video zzso where the gesturing hand is located and when the gesture starts and zzso zzso gesture recognition methods typically assume either known spatial zzso or known zzso zzso or zzso This paper introduces a unified framework for simultaneously performing spatial zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the proposed zzso information flows both bottom-up and zzso A gesture can be recognized even when the hand location is highly ambiguous and when information about when the gesture begins and ends is zzso Thus, the method can be applied to continuous image zzso where gestures are performed in front of moving, cluttered zzso The proposed method consists of three novel zzso a zzso matching zzso that can accommodate multiple candidate hand zzso in every frame, a zzso pruning framework that enables accurate and early rejection of poor matches to gesture models, and a zzso reasoning zzso that learns which gesture models can falsely match parts of other longer zzso The performance of the approach is evaluated on two challenging zzso recognition of zzso digits zzso by users wearing zzso shirts, in front of a cluttered background, and retrieval of zzso of signs of interest in a video database containing zzso zzso signing in American Sign Language zzso
