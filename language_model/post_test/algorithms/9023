Network representations are becoming increasingly popular for analyzing kinetic data from techniques like zzso zzso State zzso and Transition zzso zzso zzso continuous phase space zzso into a relatively small number of discrete states helps in zzso of the data and in zzso complex dynamics to concrete zzso However, not only are molecular networks derived from molecular dynamics simulations growing in number, they are also getting increasingly complex, zzso partly to the growth in computer power that allows us to generate longer and better zzso zzso The increased complexity of the networks makes simple interpretation and qualitative insight of the molecular systems more difficult to zzso In this paper, we focus on various network representations of kinetic data and zzso to identify important edges and pathways in these zzso The kinetic data can be local and partial (such as the value of rate zzso between zzso or an exact solution to kinetic equations for the entire system (such as the stationary flux between zzso In particular, we focus on the zzso method that provides zzso as the main zzso We proposed Global zzso Weight Pathways as a useful tool for analyzing molecular mechanism in zzso zzso A closely related definition was made in the context of Transition zzso zzso We consider three zzso to find Global zzso Weight zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso efficiency of the zzso is analyzed and zzso tests on finite networks show that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are most efficient for sparse and dense networks, zzso Pathways are illustrated for two examples: zzso unfolding and membrane zzso Finally, we illustrate that networks based on local kinetic information can lead to incorrect interpretation of molecular zzso
