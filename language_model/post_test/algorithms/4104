Local zzso zzso zzso and remote zzso zzso zzso are promising zzso therapies in zzso zzso zzso zzso We zzso zzso to investigate whether zzso initiated at the zzso laboratory would reduce zzso size, as measured using serum zzso zzso zzso zzso release as a surrogate zzso zzso to assess if the combination of zzso and zzso would provide an additional zzso Patients zzso were randomly allocated to one of the following groups: zzso control group, zzso zzso coronary zzso zzso alone; zzso zzso group, zzso combined with zzso consisting of three cycles of zzso inflation and zzso zzso of an zzso zzso cuff initiated before zzso zzso zzso group, zzso combined with zzso and zzso consisting of four cycles of zzso inflation and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso area under the curve zzso over zzso was reduced in zzso and zzso groups, by 31 and zzso respectively, compared to the Control zzso however, zzso zzso differences between the three groups were not statistically significant zzso Peak zzso zzso zzso to area at risk zzso ratio, and peak zzso level to zzso ratio were all significantly reduced in the zzso and zzso groups, compared to the Control zzso On the contrary, none of these parameters was significantly different between zzso and zzso zzso To zzso starting zzso therapy immediately prior to zzso was shown to reduce zzso size in zzso patients, yet combining this therapy with an zzso strategy did not lead to further decrease in zzso zzso
