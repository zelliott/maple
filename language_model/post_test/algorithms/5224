A zzso zzso blend between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was used as a zzso for the zzso drug delivery under applied electrical zzso zzso films and the blend films were prepared by solution casting with zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso agent, followed by the blending of zzso particles and the zzso zzso The effects of zzso ratio and electric field strength on the diffusion of the drug from zzso and zzso zzso were investigated using a modified zzso cell with an zzso buffer of pH zzso and at 37 degrees C, for a period of zzso The diffusion zzso of the drug is calculated using the zzso zzso with and without an electric field, at various zzso zzso The drug diffusion zzso decreases with increasing drug zzso size ratio, irrespective of the presence of the zzso zzso as the drug zzso The diffusion zzso at the applied electric field of zzso becomes larger by an order of magnitude relative to those without the electric zzso
