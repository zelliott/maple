The goal of this preliminary study was to investigate the feasibility of using singular value decomposition zzso to eliminate the zzso from the surface zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso muscle in order to extract the zzso zzso An zzso zzso combining the zzso method and a subsequent filtering is zzso It was evaluated with zzso signals registered from surface of zzso zzso muscles with simulated zzso and its performance was compared with a conventional fixed zzso The filtering strategy proposed showed a good performance in zzso conditions where there were no traces of the zzso In dynamic conditions, the zzso zzso was robust but with some remaining zzso zzso It would be as a consequence of modifications in the data zzso and, therefore, in the zzso generator columns and the singular zzso In general, the fixed filter was very sensitive to input signal zzso In all of these conditions there was a greater power reduction for the zzso filter than for the fixed zzso
