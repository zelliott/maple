Despite their mobility differences under zzso zzso a natural tooth and an implant are often used together to support fixed zzso In some situations, zzso partial zzso include zzso zzso especially in the zzso region where the bone is inadequate for placement of an additional zzso 

In this study, engineering beam theory was used to study the effects of the mobility differences between the implant and the tooth on the force and moment distribution, due to zzso loads in zzso zzso 

The zzso was treated as a linear elastic beam and the supports were modeled as springs with zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso moments and forces on the supports were calculated as functions of the parameters that describe the zzso position of the zzso load, and zzso ratios zzso implant or zzso of the zzso 

zzso moments on the supports were more sensitive to the relative zzso mobility between the supports and their individual values than to the relative zzso zzso The moment at the implant was minimized when the supports had similar zzso A preliminary design concept was introduced and eliminated the moment at the implant without significantly increasing the magnitude of the moment at the zzso zzso the zzso resulted in moderately increased zzso moments and considerable zzso forces on the supports for a broad range of the parameters that describe the geometry and zzso 

From this zzso it is suggested that zzso extensions should be avoided or supported by a short zzso which will only restrain the vertical movement of the zzso zzso
