In this paper we zzso zzso properties of zzso single zzso from zzso data using a zzso zzso In the first step the yield stress is obtained using zzso and Young's zzso data, followed by the zzso of the flow zzso The zzso approach is first validated with data from the existing zzso It is observed that zzso single zzso exhibit zzso mechanical response with a lower yield stress along the zzso zzso direction compared to the zzso zzso Both work zzso rate and work zzso zzso are found to be higher for zzso along the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso extracted here could be used for developing zzso models for zzso single zzso
