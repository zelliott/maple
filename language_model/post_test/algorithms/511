The zzso zzso zzso zzso naturally carried diverse strains of bacteria on its zzso The bacterial community composition zzso remained very conservative even when the zzso was fed different zzso zzso species, indicating that the food per zzso did not much affect zzso associated with the zzso In zzso zzso treatments, however, zzso zzso differed with each zzso zzso even though the same bacterial source was used to inoculate the zzso In addition, starved zzso taken at the same location but at different times significantly differed in their zzso zzso species composition and zzso life history therefore serve to regulate zzso associated with zzso and spatial and zzso variations in zzso species composition and zzso origin would alter zzso zzso
