One of the main clinical parameters expressing the health of a cornea is the cell density of its zzso This information is particularly important in an eye bank environment, where donor zzso are screened to assess their suitability as a human zzso zzso cell density is conventionally estimated by a long, tedious and zzso manual counting zzso performed by cornea experts on zzso images observed through an optical zzso An alternative solution is zzso a computer program that provides automatic zzso of cell density in donor zzso by zzso the spatial zzso contained in the zzso A circular band in the zzso discrete zzso transform of the image is shown to contain the relevant information about the cell zzso A system for zzso from this spatial frequency information an estimate of the cell density has been zzso A clinical evaluation of the proposed technique was performed on 18 zzso where the zzso provided by the proposed technique were compared with those manually obtained by two zzso The results showed an average percentage difference of zzso zzso zzso a value well within the measured zzso range of zzso The proposed automatic procedure confirmed its ability to estimate correctly zzso zzso cell zzso
