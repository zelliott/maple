zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been zzso to zzso estimate stroke volume from the pulse zzso The ability of these pulse zzso devices to accurately predict stroke volume is zzso when zzso changes zzso There is a need for a zzso device capable of identifying when vascular tone has zzso Shelley et zzso previously described a qualitative relationship between peripheral pressure volume zzso zzso (in which pressure zzso from an zzso zzso are combined with volume zzso from the zzso zzso and changes in vascular zzso The purpose of this study was to zzso compare changes in the area of peripheral zzso zzso with changes in systemic vascular resistance zzso in a patient population undergoing major zzso zzso data from ten patients undergoing liver transplantation was extracted from a zzso zzso A peak detection zzso was applied to both the zzso and zzso zzso which were manually aligned so that the zzso occurred at identical time zzso zzso loop area zzso for each heartbeat was calculated and median zzso was recorded for each zzso zzso for each patient was zzso to the average value for the first zzso (because zzso zzso has no standard and is not comparable between zzso and compared to zzso zzso at all points for which zzso was zzso zzso and zzso were plotted as a function of time and zzso zzso zzso The zzso correlation zzso describing the relationship between zzso and zzso was zzso zzso of data, zzso sign test over 10 zzso and between zzso and zzso was zzso There was no meaningful correlation between zzso and either zzso or zzso (based on zzso zzso zzso values of zzso are correlated with zzso values of zzso and may serve as a useful monitor for changes in zzso but in their present form do not offer added value above the measurement of zzso zzso of different zzso finger, zzso and redundant zzso zzso sites may significantly improve the accuracy of this zzso
