A zzso zzso beat zzso zzso procedure is zzso The first stage separates typical beats from zzso on the basis of area and polarity zzso At the second stage, the zzso are classified in zzso cluster zzso of adjacent shape zzso zzso This approach avoids the use of threshold values for discrimination between zzso beats of different shapes, which could be critical in borderline zzso A pattern shape feature conventionally called a zzso zzso in combination with a polarity attribute, was found to be a good criterion for zzso zzso An additional advantage of this pattern zzso method is its good zzso efficiency, which zzso the opportunity to implement it in real-time zzso
