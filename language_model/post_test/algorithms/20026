For high zzso zzso association zzso zzso data of complex disease, there are usually a large portion of zzso zzso zzso that are irrelevant with the zzso A simple random sampling method in random forest using default zzso zzso to choose feature zzso will select too many zzso without zzso zzso Exhaustive searching an optimal zzso is often required in order to include useful and relevant zzso and get rid of vast of zzso zzso However, it is too time-consuming and not favorable in zzso for zzso zzso The main aim of this paper is to propose a zzso sampling method for feature zzso selection to generate decision trees in a random forest for zzso zzso zzso Our idea is to design an zzso zzso scheme for zzso to divide zzso into multiple zzso In feature zzso selection, we randomly select the same number of zzso from each group and combine them to form a zzso to generate a decision zzso The advantage of this zzso sampling procedure can make sure each zzso contains enough useful zzso but can avoid a very high zzso cost of exhaustive search of an optimal zzso and maintain the randomness of a random zzso We employ two zzso zzso data sets zzso zzso data comprised of zzso zzso and zzso zzso data comprised of zzso zzso to demonstrate that the proposed zzso sampling method is effective, and it can generate better random forest with higher accuracy and lower error bound than those by zzso random forest generation zzso For Parkinson data, we also show some interesting genes identified by the method, which may be associated with neurological disorders for further biological zzso
