zzso zzso that are mutually coupled via dissimilar (or zzso variables display distinct regimes of zzso zzso In identical chaotic zzso zzso coupled in this manner, complete synchronization occurs only by chaos suppression when the coupled zzso drive each other into a regime of periodic zzso Furthermore, the zzso does not zzso but acts as an zzso zzso When the zzso are mismatched, phase synchronization occurs, while in a master slave zzso generalized zzso zzso These effects are demonstrated in a system of coupled chaotic zzso zzso
