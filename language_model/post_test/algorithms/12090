To explore the usefulness of nuclear zzso analysis for the differentiation between zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the chest zzso 

zzso images of zzso zzso from 27 cases of zzso zzso and 15 cases of zzso of the lung were zzso zzso zzso analysis and a zzso zzso were applied to derive estimates for a case diagnosis correct zzso zzso 

zzso from zzso zzso and zzso of the lung showed statistically significantly different properties, but there was a region of overlap in feature space such that approximately zzso of cases could not be correctly zzso The zzso signatures derived from the zzso cases with zzso function scores that might result in case zzso and the cases of zzso of the lung spanned a similar range of degree of nuclear zzso However, the distribution of nuclear zzso values for the zzso cases has a mode at zzso zzso from normal, whereas the distribution seen in lung zzso cases had a mode at about zzso zzso 

Cases of zzso zzso and zzso of the lung have zzso with a wide range of zzso from normal in the spatial and statistical distribution of their nuclear zzso For approximately zzso of cases, correct case zzso can be provided by nuclear zzso zzso Cases of zzso zzso with highly abnormal zzso overlap in feature space with zzso from zzso of the zzso However, it is possible that characterization by a zzso signature may allow correct assignment for those zzso
