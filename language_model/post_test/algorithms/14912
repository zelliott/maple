Due to many experimental reports of zzso neural activity in the brain, there is much interest in understanding synchronization in networks of neural zzso and its potential for computing zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso we find that networks of locally coupled zzso zzso can quickly zzso Furthermore, we examine the time needed to zzso such zzso We observe that these networks zzso at times zzso to the zzso of their size, and we give the parameters used to control the rate of zzso Inspired by locally zzso globally zzso zzso network zzso dynamics with relaxation zzso zzso & Wang, zzso we find that global zzso can play a similar role of zzso in a network of zzso zzso We illustrate that a zzso architecture with zzso zzso can be similarly used to address image zzso
