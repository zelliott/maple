We use a power grid model with M generators and N consumption units to zzso the grid and its zzso Each consumer demand is drawn from a zzso zzso distribution, thus simulating the instantaneous load zzso Each generator has a maximum power zzso A generator is not overloaded if the sum of the loads of consumers connected to a generator does not exceed its maximum zzso In the standard grid each consumer is connected only to its designated zzso while we consider a more general organization of the grid allowing each consumer to select one generator depending on the load from a zzso consumer dependent and sufficiently small set of generators which can all serve the zzso The model grid is interconnected in a graph with zzso drawn from an ensemble of random zzso zzso while each allowed zzso of loaded links represent a set of graph covering zzso zzso the zzso character of the grid and the zzso connections between generators (and many other details relevant to realistic power zzso are ignored in this zzso zzso We focus on the zzso limit, zzso and zzso , and we show that the zzso allow significant expansion of the zzso zzso for which the probability of a generator overload is zzso zzso Our construction explores the formal relation between the problem of grid zzso and the modern theory of sparse zzso zzso We also design zzso zzso that achieve the zzso optimal selection of loaded zzso We conclude discussing the ability of this approach to include other effects such as a more realistic modeling of the power grid and related zzso and control zzso
