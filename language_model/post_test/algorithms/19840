To assess zzso related quality of life zzso with zzso and zzso and compare their abilities to predict mortality in chronic dialysis patients, after adjusting for traditional risk zzso 

The zzso Health zzso zzso with the embedded zzso was applied in 301 dialysis patients zzso Physical and mental component summary zzso zzso zzso and zzso scores were zzso Clinical and demographic data were zzso zzso zzso for up to zzso was analyzed with Kaplan zzso plots and Cox zzso zzso after zzso for zzso zzso zzso factors were observation time zzso zzso and missing component summary scores zzso for zzso zzso for zzso thus 252 patient were included in the zzso 

In 252 patients zzso zzso zzso dialysis vintage zzso zzso zzso mortality during follow-up was zzso zzso zzso correlations were observed between zzso and zzso zzso zzso and between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso rate was highest in patients in the lowest zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was not associated with zzso zzso hazard ratios for mortality were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso - zzso zzso for the lowest compared with the highest zzso zzso zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso is an independent predictor of poor outcome in dialysis zzso The zzso provided similar predictions of mortality as zzso and may serve as an zzso clinical tool because it requires less time to zzso
