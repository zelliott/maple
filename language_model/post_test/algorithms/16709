Secure reconstruction of the right zzso vein zzso is essential for the successful zzso of a right liver graft during living donor liver transplantation zzso To develop reliable surgical techniques for zzso zzso we performed 3 concurrent zzso a simulation study using a fluid dynamics experimental model and a zzso simulation zzso an zzso study analyzing the zzso changes during zzso interventions for zzso zzso and a prospective clinical study establishing zzso surgical zzso The simplified fluid dynamics experimental model revealed that actually measured zzso volumes were very similar to theoretical values derived from a fluid dynamics zzso The zzso simulation model showed that zzso decreases were nearly zzso correlated with the degree of zzso when it exceeded zzso The clinical zzso study revealed that mild zzso moderate zzso and severe zzso zzso zzso had mean pressure zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The prospective clinical study was performed for patients who underwent zzso reconstruction with zzso angle zzso and inferior zzso zzso enlargement zzso zzso zzso a historical control group of patients who underwent reconstruction by other methods zzso zzso zzso was also zzso zzso zzso within 2 weeks and 1 year was necessary for 1 patient zzso and 5 patients zzso in the study group, respectively, and for 9 patients zzso and 21 patients zzso in the control group, respectively zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso length of zzso zzso zzso was greater in the study group versus the control group zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, our modified zzso reconstruction technique significantly reduces the risk of zzso zzso We thus suggest the routine or selective use of this technique as a part of graft zzso for zzso using a right liver zzso
