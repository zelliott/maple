It is often necessary for chemical risk assessment to determine a quantitative relationship between the internal dose of a chemical and its biological zzso The tool best suited for this purpose is a biologically based zzso zzso zzso Such a zzso model was developed previously (10) to simulate chemically induced zzso zzso and it was zzso zzso in zzso mouse liver slices in zzso The zzso model simulated formation of zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso substances zzso over time and was originally zzso with different zzso of zzso zzso and zzso The objective of the present work is to refine this zzso model so it can describe the zzso and the dose response of zzso zzso induced by a zzso zzso chemical, zzso zzso The zzso model parameters were zzso to reflect the chemistry of zzso Two basic zzso linear and square zzso for the description of zzso free radical production from zzso were zzso zzso with the square root zzso fit the experimental data employing zzso as an end point better than those by the linear zzso The zzso zzso model will be used to support our future mathematical description of zzso zzso in zzso
