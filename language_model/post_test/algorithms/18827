In recent years, zzso least zzso scale zzso zzso has emerged as one of the most powerful methods for image zzso Its strength relies on providing a simple and, yet, very effective local statistical description of oriented pyramid zzso neighborhoods via a zzso zzso This can be viewed as a fine adaptation of the model to the signal zzso at each scale, orientation, and spatial zzso Here, we present an enhancement of the model by introducing a zzso adaptation level, where a larger neighborhood is used to estimate the local signal zzso within every zzso We formulate our model as a zzso zzso using zzso zzso The model can be also applied to image zzso by first performing a global blur compensation, and then doing local zzso zzso We demonstrate through simulations that the proposed method, besides being zzso and zzso it is also robust and zzso Its performance, measured visually and in zzso terms, is significantly higher than the original zzso method, both for zzso and zzso
