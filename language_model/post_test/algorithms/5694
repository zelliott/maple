This study describes a new method for zzso seizure detection using zzso zzso zzso The proposed method integrated two interrelated steps: zzso establishing a zzso space on the basis of the zzso mean of the spectral power in the gamma zzso after a thorough evaluation of zzso and zzso features and zzso constructing an artificial neural network that operated on this zzso space to delineate zzso files that contained zzso from those that did zzso The data were obtained from 14 patients who underwent zzso zzso surgery with zzso zzso Of the total 157 files considered, 35 (21 zzso and 14 zzso zzso data files or zzso were selected randomly and used initially in a training zzso The remaining 122 zzso data files or zzso were then used in the testing phase to assess the merits in selecting gamma power as means to detect a zzso The results obtained exhibited an accuracy of zzso a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso Although this method had to contend with the complex nature of zzso and the inherent heavy zzso load, the constructed artificial neural networks together with the chosen zzso space yielded the best possible zzso The proposed method was based on zzso the power in the 36 to zzso frequency range and analyzing its behavior in time, looking for patterns indicative of seizure zzso It was shown that the power measurement in the gamma range contains the information needed to discriminate seizure files from zzso zzso The zzso consisted in establishing a decision space most suitable for zzso data zzso by relying on the power zzso in the gamma zzso and constructing and implementing an artificial neural network that generates the highest zzso accuracy zzso It was noted that although only zzso zzso of the files were used randomly for training the zzso high measures in sensitivity, zzso and accuracy were still achieved in the remaining files, which were subsequently used in the testing zzso zzso are known to occur zzso and zzso and massive amounts of zzso or zzso data need to be analyzed zzso to detect zzso This is a challenge that can only be met through reliable and zzso zzso zzso an affirmation this study attempted to zzso
