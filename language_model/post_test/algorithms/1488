The objective of this study was to evaluate in zzso the accuracy of the zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso under different geometric conditions simulating the presence of multiple zzso A steady flow loop model was used to test the influence of the presence of a concentric obstruction of zzso area reduction positioned at a distance of 10, 20 and 30 tube zzso either zzso or zzso to the zzso under zzso The zzso under evaluation was either concentric or eccentric and had a percentage of area reduction ranging from zzso to zzso An ultrasound color zzso system was used to perform both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso by dividing the maximum zzso of the jet by the zzso at 6 and 10 diameters both zzso and zzso to the zzso under zzso A strong correlation was obtained between zzso zzso using color flow and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that using the zzso zzso as a reference zzso generally provided a more sensitive zzso index to grade zzso zzso than using the zzso zzso From a curve fit model, the measured percentages of zzso were calculated from the zzso data and compared to the true zzso The correlation zzso zzso was zzso When the zzso and zzso zzso were at 10 diameters of the zzso investigated, r was zzso while it increased to zzso when the distance was 20 diameters or zzso Although zzso is theoretically not influenced by zzso factors, we demonstrated that, in practice, the presence of multiple zzso reduced its zzso zzso flow zzso are suggested to zzso this zzso
