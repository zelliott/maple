Biological membrane fusion involves a highly precise and ordered set of zzso zzso zzso is a key player in this zzso zzso studies of its single zzso segment suggest that it zzso in a sequence specific zzso Using the zzso methods developed for the successful structure prediction of the zzso A zzso zzso we have calculated a structural model for the zzso zzso Our zzso search yields a zzso cluster of right-handed structures consistent with the zzso determined zzso zzso The three-dimensional structure contains an interface formed primarily by zzso and zzso zzso atoms and has no zzso hydrogen zzso The model is the first three-dimensional picture of the zzso zzso zzso and provides a basis for further focused zzso on its structure and association zzso
