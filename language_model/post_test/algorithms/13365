In this paper, we present an zzso to detect the presence of diabetic zzso zzso zzso from zzso images based on a common zzso approach that is capable of identifying both red and bright zzso without requiring specific zzso or zzso Our solution zzso a visual word dictionary representing points of interest zzso located within regions marked by specialists that contain zzso associated with DR and zzso the zzso images based on the presence or absence of these zzso as normal or zzso zzso The novelty of our approach is in locating DR zzso in the zzso zzso images using visual words that combines feature information contained within the images in a framework easily zzso to different types of retinal zzso or zzso and builds a specific projection space for each class of interest zzso white zzso such as zzso or normal zzso instead of a common dictionary for all zzso The visual words dictionary was applied to zzso bright and red zzso with classical cross validation and cross zzso validation to indicate the zzso of this zzso We obtained an area under the curve zzso of zzso for white zzso detection and an zzso of zzso for red zzso detection using fivefold cross validation and our own data consisting of 687 images of normal zzso 245 images with bright zzso 191 with red zzso and 109 with signs of both bright and red zzso For cross zzso analysis, the visual dictionary also achieves compelling results using our images as the training set and the zzso and zzso images as test zzso In this case, the image zzso resulted in an zzso of zzso when zzso the zzso zzso and in an zzso of zzso when zzso the zzso zzso both cases for bright zzso zzso The results indicate the potential for training with different acquisition images under different setup conditions with a high accuracy of referral based on the presence of either red or bright zzso or zzso The zzso of the visual dictionary against image quality zzso resolution, and retinal background, makes it a strong candidate for DR screening of large, diverse communities with varying cameras and settings and levels of expertise for image zzso
