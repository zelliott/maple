The introduction of automated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso tests has led some laboratories in the United States to use new syphilis screening zzso that start with a zzso zzso We compared the economic and health outcomes of this new zzso with the standard zzso from the perspective of the United States health zzso 

We used a cohort decision analysis to estimate the expected costs and effects (including zzso and zzso of the 2 zzso from a health-care system zzso In the standard algorithm, rapid plasma zzso zzso is followed (if zzso by zzso zzso In the new algorithm, zzso is followed (if zzso by zzso If the zzso is negative, zzso zzso passive particle zzso zzso zzso test is used zzso 

For a cohort of 200,000 individuals zzso current infections and 10,000 previous zzso the net costs were zzso m zzso and zzso m zzso The zzso option treated 118 more cases zzso zzso zzso but resulted in a substantially higher number of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Treating the additional 118 cases might prevent 1 case of zzso zzso The estimated zzso ratios were zzso zzso and zzso zzso per case zzso The zzso was a function of the specificity of the zzso and the lack of independence of zzso and zzso 

The zzso option costs slightly more and results in more unnecessary zzso
