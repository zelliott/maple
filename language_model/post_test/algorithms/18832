Many important problems in statistical signal processing can be formulated as function zzso from randomly scattered sensors in a zzso space, zzso image reconstruction from zzso images and field zzso from scattered zzso We present a novel approach to the study of signal reconstruction from random samples in a zzso zzso In particular, we study a classical zzso reconstruction method and demonstrate that it forms a sequence of unbiased estimates for zzso signals, which zzso to the true function in the zzso zzso We subsequently rely on the zzso zzso method for zzso image reconstruction and field zzso from sensors scattered according to a zzso zzso and uniform zzso Computer simulation experiments are used to demonstrate the efficiency of the zzso zzso method in image reconstruction and field zzso from randomly scattered zzso
