In this work, we present a zzso scheme for finding high probability zzso of zzso The scheme zzso the probability of a given zzso of the given zzso sequence using the probability distribution of zzso zzso zzso of the states of a zzso on the states of its first neighbors along the chain is zzso Prior probabilities of zzso states are obtained from a zzso zzso zzso probabilities are calculated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso States Model of zzso zzso The zzso of a zzso with highest probability is determined by using a hidden zzso model zzso zzso First, the probability distribution of the zzso states of the zzso is zzso Using the highest probability zzso state, one can zzso step by step, states with lower zzso To validate the method, the highest probability state of zzso in a given sequence is calculated and compared with probabilities obtained from the zzso zzso zzso based on the method are zzso better than predictions based on the most probable states of zzso The ensemble of zzso high probability zzso of a given protein is also determined using the zzso zzso with zzso zzso
