A zzso mixture model with a finite number of components and correlated random effects is zzso The ultimate objective is to model zzso cell count information in dairy cattle and to develop criteria for genetic selection against zzso an important zzso zzso zzso zzso is by maximum likelihood or by an extension of restricted maximum zzso A zzso Carlo zzso zzso is used for this zzso The expectation step is carried out using Gibbs zzso whereas the zzso step is zzso zzso rules based on the conditional probability of membership in a putative group of zzso animals, given the zzso cell information, are zzso Several extensions of the model are zzso
