zzso of the breast region is a fundamental step in any system for computerized analysis of zzso In this work, we propose a novel procedure for the zzso of the breast zzso based upon zzso zzso zzso The method includes an zzso zzso zzso zzso extraction of the zzso ribbon by zzso zzso method and the zzso distance zzso zzso filtering with 18 real zzso and a step for suppression of false edge points using the magnitude and phase responses of the zzso On a test set of zzso images from different acquisition zzso zzso and zzso digital zzso the average zzso and zzso distances obtained were zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, with reference to the zzso boundaries provided by an expert zzso When compared with the results obtained by other state-of-the-art methods on the same set of images and with respect to the same zzso zzso our method mostly outperformed the other zzso The results demonstrate the effectiveness and zzso of the proposed zzso
