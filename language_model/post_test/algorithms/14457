zzso sequence alignment is a central problem in zzso which forms the basis of various other zzso Two related sequences are expected to have a high alignment score, but zzso is usually judged by statistical significance rather than by alignment zzso Recently, it was shown that zzso statistical significance gives promising results as an alternative to database statistical significance for getting individual significance estimates of zzso alignment zzso The improvement was mainly attributed to making the statistical significance zzso process more zzso and zzso In this paper, we use zzso and zzso substitution zzso to derive the estimates of zzso statistical significance, which is expected to use more zzso information in zzso zzso statistical zzso zzso on a benchmark database with zzso substitution zzso at different levels of zzso contribution were conducted, and results confirm that using zzso substitution zzso for zzso zzso statistical significance is significantly better than using a standard zzso like zzso and than database statistical significance estimates reported by popular database search programs like zzso zzso (without zzso zzso and zzso on a benchmark database, but with zzso zzso zzso results are significantly zzso Further, using zzso substitution zzso for zzso zzso statistical significance gives significantly better results even than zzso using zzso zzso
