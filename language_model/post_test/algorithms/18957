The absorbed zzso zzso of electrons in sensitive layers of human respiratory tract were calculated in this zzso For that purpose the source code for simulation package zzso based on zzso Carlo method, was zzso The human respiratory tract was modeled according to zzso publication, where zzso of electrons was calculated using zzso simulation zzso Some approximations used in zzso were corrected in this work, and new values of zzso for zzso progeny are zzso zzso energy zzso that electron can have during transport through material is 1 zzso in zzso while it is set as low as 100 zzso in the presented zzso zzso value of zzso gives more accurate results for zzso when initial energy of electrons is below 50 zzso To represent zzso water is used in zzso while in this work zzso tissue is zzso
