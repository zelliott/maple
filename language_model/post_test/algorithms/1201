A method is described capable of correcting artifacts in zzso computer zzso zzso images due to beam zzso in an arbitrary number of zzso The method works with reconstructed image data and does not require the original raw zzso It is necessary to have an estimate of the spectrum of the incident zzso zzso The method is similar to previously described zzso methods that correct artifacts induced by zzso Our zzso was designed to correct for zzso in both bone and zzso contrast zzso It is necessary to identify those regions of the image which contain bone and zzso A central concept is that of effective density, which is the ratio of CT number of the substance to that of zzso It is necessary to establish by a preliminary experiment the relationship between CT number and mass density of zzso or zzso From these data one estimates path zzso through soft tissue zzso zzso bone, and zzso using a zzso zzso applied to the given zzso Given this zzso a key equation is solved zzso which provides a correction term to be zzso from the zzso zzso This can be shown to eliminate the zzso terms in the projections due to beam zzso assuming that the original density estimates were zzso In principle, the method can be repeated zzso to improve the zzso However, in our experience using an image of a phantom containing zzso zzso and zzso scanned using the zzso Evolution electron beam zzso zzso the quality of the corrected image was excellent and no further iteration is needed for the zzso zzso More research is needed to implement the method on clinical zzso
