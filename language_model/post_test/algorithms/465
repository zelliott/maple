The biological zzso control in agriculture, an zzso practice, maintains the density of zzso below an economic injury level by releasing a suitable quantity of their natural zzso This work proposes a zzso zzso solution to biological zzso control for soybean crops, considering both the cost of application of the control action and the cost of economic zzso The system model is zzso with impulsive control zzso in order to cope more effectively with the actual control action to be applied, which should be performed in a finite number of discrete time zzso The dynamic zzso problem is solved using the zzso a fast and trustworthy zzso genetic zzso The results suggest a dual zzso control policy, in which the relative price of control action versus the associated additional harvest yield determines the usage of either a low control action strategy or a higher zzso
