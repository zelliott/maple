To introduce a new zzso zzso for monitoring a patient's cerebral status during zzso 

zzso epochs zzso zzso zzso duration 30 see per zzso yield patterns used as the training input of a zzso neural network zzso gas zzso Each pattern contains spectral zzso An additional zzso zzso reflects the proportion of flat zzso during an zzso zzso and reduces the shortcomings of spectral zzso The enhanced pattern zzso enables the recognition of zzso periods representing depressed cerebral activity during zzso Following training with zzso zzso epochs zzso in 196 zzso patients in the period beginning 5 minutes before induction of zzso to zzso the network knows 125 basic patterns zzso zzso The neural clusters are responsible for different stages of zzso some zzso are activated by zzso epochs of awake patients, others are zzso by deep zzso The zzso of the zzso epochs of cluster is zzso The portion of the zzso epochs not zzso by the network zzso contains zzso and sporadic patterns zzso outlines caused by zzso 

In comparison with commonly used variables of zzso zzso monitoring zzso edge or median zzso neural zzso analysis achieves better discrimination between awake and deeply zzso stages zzso of zzso zzso zzso On the basis of 56 complete sequences of patterns (from the beginning of the infusion of zzso to the occurrence of burst zzso a trend value of between zzso and zzso is assigned to each neural zzso In contrast to existing methods, induction of zzso causes a strictly linear increase in the zzso zzso 

zzso neural cluster and zzso analysis on the basis of the model described leads to an improved zzso zzso which better reflects the hypnotic effects of zzso agents and zzso reactions caused by pain zzso zzso of awake and zzso stages are zzso The neural network learns to recognize the complex changes in zzso patterns during induction of zzso with different zzso
