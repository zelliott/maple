The identification of zzso and their target zzso and the construction of their regulatory networks may give new insights into biological zzso This study proposes a zzso method to discover the functional zzso regulatory zzso zzso that is, groups of zzso and their target zzso that are believed to participate zzso in zzso gene regulation under specific zzso The proposed method identifies zzso regulated patterns of zzso and zzso which associate with cancer and normal conditions, respectively, in a prostate cancer data zzso GO and the literature also suggest that they may relate with prostate zzso It can potentially identify the biologically relevant chains of zzso gene zzso zzso
