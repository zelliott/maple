Phase rotation zzso zzso is a zzso digital receive zzso zzso However, due to its high zzso requirement, it has traditionally been supported by zzso zzso zzso zzso integrated circuits zzso or more recently zzso gate zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the feasibility of supporting software-based zzso on a zzso zzso To alleviate the high computing requirement, the analog front-end zzso chips zzso zzso zzso in addition to zzso conversion were defined and zzso With these new zzso chips, only delay alignment and phase rotation need to be performed by zzso substantially reducing the zzso zzso We implemented the delay alignment and phase rotation zzso on a Texas zzso zzso zzso with 8 zzso We found it takes 200 zzso to zzso zzso samples from 64 channels using 2 zzso With 4 cores, 20 million samples can be zzso in one zzso zzso zzso zzso up to 40 zzso with zzso decimation in zzso chips or up to 20 zzso with no decimation can be supported as long as the zzso zzso requirement can be zzso The remaining 4 zzso can work on back-end processing tasks and applications, zzso color zzso or ultrasound zzso One zzso being able to handle both zzso and back-end processing could lead to zzso and low-cost ultrasound machines, benefiting ultrasound imaging in general, particularly portable ultrasound zzso
