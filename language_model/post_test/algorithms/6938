We consider the problem of separating two distinct classes of k similar sequences of length zzso over an alphabet of size s that have been zzso zzso An objective function based on minimizing the consensus score of the separated halves is introduced and we present an zzso zzso zzso and two optimal zzso zzso for the zzso The zzso zzso involve progressively more powerful lower bound functions for pruning the zzso search zzso The simpler lower bound takes zzso time to evaluate given zzso global data structures and the stronger bound takes zzso time by virtue of an efficient solution to the problem of finding the zzso envelope of a set of zzso zzso zzso In a series of empirical trials we establish the degree to which classes can be separated using our metric and the effective pruning efficiency of the two zzso zzso
