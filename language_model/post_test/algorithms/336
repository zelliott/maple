For short-range zzso radiation therapy, the biological effects are strongly affected by the zzso of the specific energy distribution delivered to tumor zzso zzso information at the cellular level is ideal for this type of study, but it is extremely difficult to zzso In this paper, a novel zzso analysis, which zzso the specific energy distribution directly from the zzso information in individual zzso zzso is applied to in zzso human zzso zzso and normal brain tissue in zzso zzso capture zzso zzso energy zzso were obtained for both zzso and they are consistent with a uniform zzso zzso We also used a zzso model for cell survival analysis based on the specific energy and were able to bridge it with the model based on the corresponding zzso zzso zzso using existing experimental zzso The survival constant for the microscopic model was zzso cell survival zzso were predicted for uniform and zzso source zzso zzso sources and cell zzso bound together totally or only zzso The results indicate that the behavior of the survival curve can vary widely, which may have important clinical zzso
