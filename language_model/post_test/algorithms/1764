In this paper, we investigate the zzso mechanisms responsible for zzso and zzso membrane flux decline in zzso zzso zzso zzso We have used the zzso mechanism models proposed by zzso zzso namely pore zzso cake formation, complete blocking and intermediate zzso Based on an zzso approach and using experimental data extracted from the literature, we propose a systematic procedure for identifying the most likely zzso mechanism in zzso zzso as well as long-term experiments are considered and zzso It was found that short-term experiments are usually characterized by two zzso zzso during which the same zzso mechanism or two different mechanisms affect the zzso In contrast, in long-term experiments involving cleaning cycles, membrane zzso appears to be better ascribed to one phase zzso The impact of zzso parameters on membrane zzso mechanisms is reviewed and discussed in the light of these zzso Finally, it is shown that the mechanism most responsible for membrane zzso in an zzso is cake zzso This main result will be useful for the future development of simple integrated models for zzso and zzso
