zzso zzso zzso is an optical imaging technique that has recently been considered for zzso interface zzso zzso To date, zzso studies have primarily made use of zzso features of brain activity, derived from the zzso of optical signals measured from discrete locations, to differentiate mental zzso However, functional brain imaging studies have indicated that the spatial distribution of zzso activity is also rich in zzso Thus, the progression of a response over both time and space may be valuable to brain state zzso In this paper, we investigate the implication of including zzso features in the zzso zzso of zzso events for a zzso problem by exploiting this information from dynamic zzso zzso 

The value of zzso information was explored through a comparative analysis of four different zzso schemes performed on zzso zzso data collected from the prefrontal zzso during a mental zzso zzso task and zzso zzso a linear zzso zzso data were zzso using zzso features, zzso features, and a collective pool of zzso and zzso zzso We also considered a majority vote combination of three zzso each established using one of the above feature zzso Lastly, two separate task zzso (20 and 10 zzso were considered for feature zzso 

With features from the longer task zzso the highest overall zzso accuracy was achieved using the majority voting zzso zzso zzso zzso which was greater than the accuracy obtained using zzso features alone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso While results from the shorter task duration were lower overall, the zzso employing only zzso features (with an average accuracy of zzso zzso zzso achieved a higher average accuracy than the rate obtained using only zzso features zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso these results suggest that zzso information can be of value in the analysis of functional zzso data, and improved zzso rates may be obtained in future zzso applications with the inclusion of this zzso
