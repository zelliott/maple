Experimental data collection time in zzso nuclear magnetic resonance experiments can be significantly decreased if the zzso of all the components of one of the ID zzso of the spectrum are zzso When this condition is zzso a simple linear least squares fit of the zzso signal taking the zzso into account not only allows saving time in data collection, but also improves sensitivity and zzso The reliability of the proposed procedure is carefully addressed in the particular case of zzso zzso This strategy applied to a zzso experiment reduced experimental time by a factor of zzso
