We investigate the effect of zzso disorder on a system of forced threshold zzso where each element is arranged on top of complex zzso zzso zzso results indicate that the response of the system to a weak signal can be amplified at an intermediate level of zzso disorder, thus indicating the occurrence of zzso zzso Using mean field method, we obtain an zzso understanding of the resonant phenomenon by zzso the effective potential of the zzso Our findings might provide further insight into the role of network zzso in signal amplification in biological zzso
