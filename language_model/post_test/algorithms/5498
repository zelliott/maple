zzso modeling has traditionally played an important role in zzso the mechanisms for cardiac zzso zzso zzso models, likely the most sophisticated virtual zzso to date, integrate detailed information across the spatial scales of cardiac zzso and mechanics and are capable of capturing the emergent behavior and the interaction between electrical zzso and mechanical contraction of the zzso The goal of this review is to provide an overview of the latest zzso in zzso zzso modeling of the zzso We first detail the general framework of zzso zzso zzso modeling and describe the state of the art in zzso techniques and experimental validation zzso The powerful utility of zzso zzso models in providing a better understanding of cardiac function is then demonstrated by reviewing the latest insights obtained by these models, focusing primarily on the mechanisms by which zzso zzso contributes to zzso zzso the relationship between electrical zzso and mechanical contraction in the normal heart, and the mechanisms of mechanical zzso and zzso in the failing zzso zzso modeling of cardiac zzso will continue to complement basic science research and clinical zzso and holds promise to become an important clinical tool aiding the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac zzso
