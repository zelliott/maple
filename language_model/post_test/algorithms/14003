This paper uses a symbiotic zzso zzso zzso to breed neural network models for the River zzso zzso It advances on traditional evolutionary approaches by evolving and zzso individual zzso Furthermore, it is ideal for zzso with alternative objective zzso Recent research suggests that sum squared error may not result in the most appropriate models from a zzso zzso Models are bred for lead times of 6 and 24 hours and compared with conventional neural network models trained using zzso The zzso is also modified to use different objective functions in the zzso process: mean squared error, relative error and the zzso zzso of zzso The results show that at longer lead times the evolved neural networks outperform the conventional ones in terms of overall zzso It is also shown that the sum squared error objective function does not result in the best performing model from a zzso zzso
