An zzso zzso assist device zzso under development at the zzso facility is intended for use as a long-term zzso zzso At high speeds zzso zzso can collapse the native zzso and damage the heart muscle, lung zzso and zzso A zzso zzso was developed to maintain zzso zzso to the vital zzso while preventing zzso collapse, through analysis of the electrical current zzso of the zzso The premise of the control zzso is that the zzso of the patient are reflected in the shape of this zzso This approach is intended to eliminate the need for invasive sensors, thus effectively using the pump itself as a zzso The control zzso regulates the speed of the pump by comparing the zzso zzso with reference zzso using a matched zzso The matched filter was evaluated by its zzso and differentiation zzso Thus far, the authors have been able to zzso the zzso into one of the four zzso regions zzso zzso or above the optimal range, and zzso zzso with over zzso zzso zzso work is directed toward improving the detection of zzso zzso as this condition must be strictly zzso
