This paper presents an example of how optimal design methodology was used to help design a phase II clinical zzso The planned analysis would relate the clinical zzso to exposure zzso via the area under the curve zzso rather than zzso zzso design methodology was used to compare a number of candidate phase II designs, and an zzso for finding optimal designs was zzso The zzso zzso with baseline zzso model was used to relate the clinical zzso to individual subject zzso and the primary metrics were D zzso and the standard error zzso of the zzso required to yield a clinically relevant change in the clinical zzso The performance of the candidate designs were compared across four different zzso exposure response relationships zzso from the analysis of an earlier proof of concept zzso zzso The results suggested the total sample size should be increased from the planned 540 individuals, and that the optimal design with 700 individuals would be equivalent to zzso individuals with the reference design (a zzso zzso The performance with this design was considered acceptable, although all designs performed poorly if the true exposure response relationship was very zzso This work allowed a prospective assessment of the likely performance and precision from the exposure response zzso prior to the start of the phase II study, and hence allowed the design to be revised to ensure the subsequent analysis would be of most zzso
