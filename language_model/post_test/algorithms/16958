The authors evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of second-generation zzso zzso zzso zzso coronary zzso zzso with zzso reconstructions for detecting zzso coronary artery disease zzso 

Between June 2010 and February 2011, we enrolled 160 patients (85 zzso mean age zzso zzso with suspected zzso All patients underwent zzso and conventional coronary zzso zzso For the zzso scan zzso zzso zzso we use prospective tube current zzso and zzso zzso of zzso contrast material zzso 400 zzso zzso zzso Data sets were reconstructed with zzso reconstruction zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso reports were used to evaluate accuracy using the threshold for significant zzso at zzso and zzso zzso 

No patient was excluded from the zzso Heart rate was zzso zzso and radiation dose was zzso zzso Disease prevalence was zzso zzso zzso specificity and positive and negative zzso values of zzso in detecting significant zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Positive and negative likelihood ratios at the zzso level were zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso with second-generation zzso in the real clinical world shows a diagnostic performance comparable with previously reported validation zzso The excellent negative zzso value and likelihood ratio make zzso a zzso zzso method for diagnosing zzso zzso
