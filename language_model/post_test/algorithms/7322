In this paper we introduce a new reconstruction zzso for X-ray differential zzso Imaging zzso Our approach is based on 1) a zzso zzso with a weighted data term and 2) a zzso scheme that allows for fast convergence while reducing reconstruction zzso In order to improve the quality of the reconstruction we take advantage of zzso zzso zzso In addition, the prior information on the support and zzso of the zzso index is considered, which yields significant zzso We test our method in two reconstruction experiments involving real zzso our results demonstrate its potential for zzso and medical zzso
