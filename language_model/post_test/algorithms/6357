zzso deposition in the zzso and zzso zzso is dependent on a number of factors including local zzso flow distribution patterns, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso transport in the zzso Although many of these factors are difficult to measure, zzso zzso in the zzso zzso has been zzso determined for a few zzso In the present study an experimental procedure was combined with zzso fluid dynamic zzso techniques to further describe some of the factors that govern zzso zzso zzso The fraction of zzso absorbed by the zzso zzso zzso was zzso determined for a number of zzso by measuring the concentration drop between zzso zzso into one zzso and that zzso the zzso zzso while the subject performed a zzso zzso zzso zzso were measured with a zzso zzso zzso were delivered to the zzso at flow rates of zzso and 10 zzso The zzso closure zzso zzso flows were then simulated using zzso techniques in a 3-D zzso accurate human nose zzso the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso The comparison between the zzso simulations and the experimental results lead to an zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso and the zzso effective zzso transport zzso The results of the study suggest that the increase in zzso resistance of the zzso layer over that of a thin layer of water seemed to be general and zzso however, the zzso zzso was zzso specific and usually followed the trend that zzso with lower water zzso were more soluble in the zzso than would be predicted from water zzso zzso The ability of this approach to model zzso movement in the zzso cavity was evaluated by comparison of the model output with known values of zzso zzso zzso
