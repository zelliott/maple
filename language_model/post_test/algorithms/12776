zzso zzso in the properties of zzso channels generates spatial zzso of zzso zzso which is modulated by gap zzso zzso However, it is possible to simulate conditions in which local differences in zzso properties are zzso silent and only play a role in pathological zzso We use a zzso procedure on the zzso phase 1 model of the zzso action potential zzso in order to find a modified set of model parameters which generates an action potential profile zzso almost identical to zzso We show that, although the two zzso zzso from resting conditions as a single zzso are very similar and belong to zzso sharing similar passive electrical properties, the modified membrane generating zzso is a weaker current source than the one generating zzso has different sensitivity to zzso of zzso channels and to zzso zzso and a different electrical zzso zzso We study zzso interaction of zzso and zzso type zzso in cell pairs and in cable zzso and find differences in zzso properties which are masked in zzso conditions and become manifest during zzso zzso or partial block of zzso channels, leading to zzso block and spatial zzso zzso We provide zzso plot representations that zzso differences and zzso The present report characterizes an inverse problem in cardiac cells, and strengthen the recently emergent notion that a comprehensive characterization and validation of cell models and their components are necessary in order to correctly understand simulation results at higher levels of zzso
