Mechanical support of a failing heart is typically performed with rotary blood pumps running at constant speed, which results in a limited control on cardiac workload and zzso zzso A potential solution to overcome these limitations is to zzso the pump speed to create zzso This study aims at developing a zzso control zzso for rotary pumps, while investigating its effect on left zzso unloading and the zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rotary blood pump was implanted in 5 sheep and zzso from the zzso zzso to the descending zzso A modified controller was connected to the pump yielding direct speed control via analog zzso zzso speed zzso patterns, including zzso saw zzso triangle, and square zzso with 2 different phase shifts, were synchronized with zzso Various zzso zzso such as left zzso pressure and volume, coronary flow, and zzso pressure, were analyzed to examine the influence of pump zzso 

The pump speed zzso significantly affected left zzso pressure and volume and zzso pressure, whereas coronary flow was not influenced by pump support zzso Stroke work in the zzso modes varied from zzso to zzso of baseline value and from zzso to zzso of constant speed zzso zzso cardiac workload can be adjusted to provide relaxation, which may lead to zzso zzso 

A synchronized pulsing rotary blood pump offers a simple and powerful control zzso for heart zzso This technique provides zzso zzso which is more zzso than continuous blood flow and may be useful for zzso of the other zzso
