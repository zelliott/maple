A zzso blood cell sorting model with a zzso structure is proposed in the frame of immersed boundary and lattice zzso method zzso The fluid dynamics is obtained by solving the discrete lattice zzso zzso and the cells motion and deformation are handled by the immersed boundary zzso A zzso consists of two parallel slope post rows which are adopted to separate red blood cells zzso from white blood cells zzso in which the cells to be separated are transported one after another by the flow into the zzso between the two post zzso zzso by the cross flow, zzso are zzso to get through the pores of the zzso post row since they are smaller and more zzso compared with zzso zzso are required to move along the zzso post row till they get out the zzso zzso results indicate that for a fix zzso of zzso the slope angle of the post row plays an important role in cell zzso The cells mixture can not be separated properly in a small slope angle, while obvious zzso by zzso will take place to disturb the continuous cell sorting in a big slope zzso As an optimal result, an zzso slope angle is found to sort zzso form zzso correctly and zzso
