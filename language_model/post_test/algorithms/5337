We consider the phenomenon of Fermi acceleration for a classical particle inside an area with a closed boundary of oval zzso The boundary is considered to be periodically time varying and zzso of the particle with the boundary are assumed to be zzso It is shown that the breathing geometry causes the particle to experience Fermi acceleration with a growing zzso rather smaller as compared to the no breathing zzso Some zzso properties of the zzso zzso are discussed in the framework of zzso zzso
