zzso zzso CT zzso images are acquired repeatedly during a course of radiation therapy and a natural question to ask is whether zzso images obtained earlier in the process can be zzso as prior knowledge to reduce patient imaging dose in subsequent zzso The purpose of this work is to develop an zzso prior image constrained compressed sensing zzso method to solve this zzso zzso images using full projections are taken on the first day of radiation therapy treatment and are used as prior zzso The subsequent scans are acquired using a protocol of sparse zzso In the proposed zzso algorithm, the prior images are zzso as an initial guess and are incorporated into the objective function in the compressed sensing zzso zzso reconstruction zzso Furthermore, the prior information is employed to detect any possible mismatched regions between the prior and current images for improved zzso For this purpose, the prior images and the reconstructed images are classified into three anatomical zzso air, soft tissue and zzso zzso regions are identified by local differences of the corresponding groups in the two classified sets of zzso A distance transformation is then introduced to convert the information into an zzso zzso relaxation zzso In constructing the relaxation map, the matched regions zzso zzso between the prior and current images are assigned with smaller weight values, which are translated into less influence on the zzso zzso reconstruction zzso On the other hand, the mismatched regions zzso zzso are associated with larger values and the regions are updated more by the new projection data, thus avoiding any possible adverse effects of prior zzso The zzso approach was systematically assessed by using patient data acquired under standard and zzso protocols for qualitative and quantitative zzso The zzso method provides an effective way for us to enhance the image quality at the matched regions between the prior and current images compared to the existing zzso zzso Compared to the current zzso imaging zzso the zzso zzso allows an imaging dose reduction of zzso times due to the greatly reduced number of projections and lower zzso tube current level coming from the zzso zzso
