The dynamics of a classical system driven by a rapidly zzso field (with frequency zzso in the presence of friction has been investigated using the multiple scale zzso theory zzso By exploiting the idea of separation of time zzso the slow motion has been zzso in a systematic expansion in the inverse of zzso to the order zzso This zzso series can be viewed as a zzso of the calculation presented by zzso and zzso for zzso zzso (where the point of suspension is moved zzso in the presence of zzso The radiation induced dynamics of the system is found to be described by an effective zzso potential with friction that controls the slow zzso The explicit appearance of friction in our zzso effective potential is a manifestation of the zzso effect due to the fast zzso The present study demonstrates that zzso can be used to understand and predict the classical dynamics of a driven system in the presence of zzso
