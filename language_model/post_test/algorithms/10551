A zzso approach based on a zzso process zzso prior is useful for zzso genetic population structures because it can zzso the number of populations and the assignment of individuals zzso However, the properties of the zzso prior method are not well zzso and therefore, the use of this method is relatively zzso We characterized the zzso prior method to increase its practical zzso 

First, we evaluated the usefulness of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a technique for improving the mixing of zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso Although this zzso has been implemented in a preceding program, zzso its effectiveness has not been zzso We showed that this zzso was effective for population structure zzso Implementation of this zzso was useful with regard to the accuracy of zzso and zzso zzso Second, we examined the effect of a zzso for the prior distribution of zzso zzso and showed that the zzso of this zzso was important and could be resolved by considering the zzso as a zzso Third, we compared the zzso prior method with other zzso zzso methods and showed that the zzso prior method was suitable for data sets with unbalanced sample sizes among zzso In contrast, although current popular zzso for population structure analysis, such as those implemented in zzso were suitable for data sets with uniform sample sizes, zzso with these zzso for unbalanced sample sizes tended to be less accurate than those with the zzso prior zzso 

The zzso method based on the zzso prior was found to be useful because it can zzso the number of populations and simultaneously assign individuals into zzso and it is suitable for data sets with unbalanced sample sizes among zzso Here we presented a novel program, zzso that zzso the zzso zzso and can consider the zzso for the prior distribution of zzso zzso to be a zzso
