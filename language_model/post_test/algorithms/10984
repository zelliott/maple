To investigate the association between zzso type breast cancer and common zzso zzso factors, compared with mass type breast zzso 

After institutional review board approval, retrospective blind review of zzso breast zzso was carried out for 88 zzso proven breast invasive zzso zzso zzso patients, presenting from January 2008 to December zzso Two zzso assessed the images of each zzso for the zzso enhancement type zzso enhancement or zzso enhancement zzso and the zzso enhancement of zzso Two zzso evaluated the zzso grade of IDC, presence or absence of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso status, presence or absence of vascular invasion, and expression status of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso gene zzso zzso agreement was assessed with zzso zzso zzso test and zzso rank correlation were performed to explore the associations of zzso enhancement type with the age, zzso size and the above pathological zzso factors 

zzso agreement was excellent, with zzso zzso enhancement type was significantly correlated with age zzso with zzso more commonly seen in women less than 50 zzso The size of zzso was larger than that of mass and, with the increase of zzso size, proportion of zzso among the cases increased zzso zzso was also significantly correlated with low zzso grade of zzso zzso and presence of zzso zzso There was no significant correlation between zzso enhancement type and zzso zzso status, vascular invasion, zzso zzso The zzso grade was higher in zzso enhancement than zzso zzso There was no correlation between enhancement distribution and zzso factors 

zzso type breast cancer may not necessarily have worse prognosis than the mass type, due to lower zzso grade and closely related to zzso zzso although it may has larger tumor zzso zzso enhancement may have worse prognosis than zzso zzso
