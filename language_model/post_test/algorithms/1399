A method is described for the correction of geometric zzso occurring in echo zzso zzso The geometric zzso are caused in large part by zzso magnetic field zzso leading to zzso shifts, particularly in the phase zzso zzso By characterizing the field zzso from a field map, the image can be zzso so that accurate alignment to conventionally collected images can be zzso The zzso to perform the zzso is zzso and results from echo zzso images collected at zzso and 4 zzso are zzso
