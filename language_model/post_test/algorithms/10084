The ongoing obesity epidemic is associated with numerous health problems related to altered zzso zzso Among these is type 2 diabetes, characterized by lowered insulin sensitivity zzso zzso the development of simple zzso to assess IS has research and clinical zzso The zzso a new index of zzso was recently described by zzso et zzso zzso & zzso zzso and validated in zzso zzso overweight and obese zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to validate the index in zzso 

The data used in this project came from sedentary men zzso aged zzso years, all of whom underwent a zzso clamp and zzso oral zzso tolerance test zzso zzso with zzso zzso infusion rate zzso divided by insulin zzso zzso and zzso divided by zzso mass zzso were obtained by four well-known zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as with the new zzso zzso zzso correlations and zzso analyses were obtained for every index versus clamp zzso 

The best correlate of IS in the present study was the zzso zzso zzso The agreement of this method with the zzso zzso as assessed by zzso zzso was similar to those of the other zzso and to those previously described in zzso zzso 

The new index proposed by zzso et zzso is as good a predictor of IS in sedentary men as the other commonly used zzso and appears to be as reliable in this population as it was in the original study of zzso zzso
