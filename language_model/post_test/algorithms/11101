The question whether newborns possess zzso social skills is a long debate in zzso zzso Fetal behavioral and anatomical observations show zzso for the control of eye movements and facial behaviors during the third zzso of pregnancy whereas specific zzso areas, like the superior zzso zzso and the zzso appear to be functionally mature to support these zzso These observations suggest that the newborn is potentially mature for developing minimal social zzso In this zzso we propose that the mechanism of sensory alignment observed in SC is particularly important for enabling the social skills observed at birth such as facial preference and facial zzso In a zzso simulation of the maturing superior zzso connected to a simulated facial tissue of a zzso we model how the incoming tactile information is used to direct visual attention toward zzso We suggest that the zzso superficial visual layer zzso and the deep zzso layer zzso in SC are combined into an intermediate layer for zzso integration and that zzso alignment in this third layer allows newborns to have a sensitivity to zzso of eyes and zzso We show that the visual and tactile maps align through a zzso learning stage and and strengthen their synaptic links from each other into the intermediate zzso It results that the global network produces some emergent properties such as sensitivity toward the spatial zzso of zzso patterns and the detection of eyes and mouth zzso
