A least square fitting zzso for alignment of zzso segments and point pairs of anatomical features obtained from both portal images and simulation zzso has been developed for patient position zzso in radiation zzso A coordinate system associated with each curved segment pair is constructed so that the discrepancies of each segment pair can be obtained zzso The zzso allows users to select not only multiple curve pairs but also individual point pairs on the important zzso zzso The zzso is measured by the sum of the position zzso of individual point pairs and zzso discrepancies of all segment pairs from their corresponding coordinate zzso A mathematical zzso method is applied to seek an optimal transformation for matching of all segment and/or point pairs zzso The reliability of the zzso has been tested with both phantom and clinical zzso The test results indicate that the typical errors are less than 1 zzso and 1 degrees in translation and zzso zzso
