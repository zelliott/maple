Advances in ultrasound system development have led to a substantial improvement of image quality and to an increased use of ultrasound in clinical zzso Nevertheless, ultrasound zzso and zzso artifacts cannot be entirely avoided and continue to challenge medical image computing zzso We introduce a method for zzso a zzso confidence in the information depicted by ultrasound images, referred to as an ultrasound confidence map, which emphasizes uncertainty in attenuated and/or shadow zzso Our main novelty is the modeling of the confidence zzso problem within a random walks framework by taking into account ultrasound specific zzso The solution to the random walks equilibrium problem is global and takes the entire image content into zzso As a result, our method is zzso to a variety of ultrasound image acquisition zzso We demonstrate the zzso of our confidence maps for ultrasound shadow zzso zzso zzso ultrasound zzso and zzso image zzso
