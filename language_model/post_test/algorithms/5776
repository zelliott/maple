Master equations for zzso zzso reactions and the reverse zzso zzso reactions are solved for a series of model reaction systems and evaluated with respect to broadening zzso It is shown that weak collision center broadening factors zzso zzso can approximately be related to the collision efficiencies zzso through a relation zzso zzso zzso max zzso zzso zzso In addition, it is investigated to what extent weak collision zzso zzso in general can be expressed by the limiting low and high pressure rate zzso together with central broadening factors zzso zzso It is shown that there cannot be one zzso zzso expression for broadening factors zzso as a function of the reduced pressure scale zzso zzso zzso Instead, zzso zzso zzso of various reaction systems, for given zzso zzso and zzso fall into a band of about zzso zzso in zzso A series of zzso expressions for zzso from simple zzso to more elaborate zzso broadening factors, are compared and shown to reproduce the band of zzso broadening factors with satisfactory zzso
