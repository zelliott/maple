zzso biological response is simulated in a modified zzso zzso that zzso steady and zzso dynamic zzso under zzso zzso zzso zzso cells adhere to a protein coating on the surface of the rotating plate, receiving nutrients and oxygen from an zzso medium that flows zzso and zzso accompanied by zzso diffusion in the zzso toward the active zzso This process is modeled as zzso zzso and zzso diffusion with angular symmetry in zzso zzso The zzso boundary condition on the surface of the rotating plate includes zzso zzso zzso consumption via the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso Linear transport laws in chemically zzso systems that obey zzso zzso predict the existence of zzso between zzso reaction rates and the magnitude of the zzso zzso zzso zzso selecting only those elements of zzso v experienced by zzso cells that are bound to zzso zzso Stress sensitivity via the zzso of irreversible thermodynamics introduces a zzso contribution to zzso reaction rates that must be zzso when zzso zzso chemically anchored cells, or vacant active protein sites are not present on the surface of the rotating zzso Computer simulations of zzso consumption profiles via simple zzso zzso zzso zzso suggest that zzso zzso designs should consider zzso when the zzso zzso number zzso ratio of the zzso zzso rate of zzso consumption relative to the rate of zzso diffusion toward active cells zzso to the rotating zzso is greater than approximately zzso of the stress-free zzso zzso zzso zzso simulations are presented for simple zzso simple zzso and complex stress-free zzso where the latter includes a zzso rate expression that considers zzso zzso via the zzso modification of the zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso accompanied by the formation of zzso zzso zzso parameters are identified to obtain equivalent stress-free zzso consumption in the exit zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rotation of the active plate at zzso zzso mimics zzso cardiovascular flow and demonstrates that these zzso zzso must operate above the critical zzso zzso number, identified under steady zzso conditions, before dynamic zzso has a distinguishable effect on zzso zzso
