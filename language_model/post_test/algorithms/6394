We describe a zzso efficient statistical framework for zzso networks of zzso zzso This framework exploits zzso conditional independence relationships among zzso zzso to estimate patterns of zzso We use this approach to estimate a zzso network from zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso We demonstrate the biological utility of this approach by showing that a large number of zzso pathways are zzso represented in the estimated zzso We describe a complementary zzso graph search zzso for discovering locally distinct zzso of a large weighted zzso We apply this zzso to our zzso network model and show that zzso found using this approach zzso to particular biological processes or contain representatives of distinct gene zzso
