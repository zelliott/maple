The ability to sustain high swimming speeds is believed to be an important factor affecting resource acquisition in zzso While we have gained insights into how fin zzso and motion influences swimming performance in coral reef fishes, the role of other traits, such as body shape, remains poorly zzso We explore the ability of two zzso models of the zzso relationship between body zzso ratio and endurance zzso to predict maximum zzso speed zzso ) among 84 fish species from the Great zzso zzso zzso A drag model, based on zzso data on the drag of zzso submerged bodies of revolution, was applied to species that employ zzso propulsion with a rigid body at U zzso An alternative model, based on the results of computer simulations of optimal shape in zzso undulating bodies, was applied to the species that swim by zzso propulsion at zzso zzso For zzso swimmers, zzso increased with zzso and the rate of increase decreased with zzso as predicted by the drag zzso While the zzso and statistical models of the relationship between zzso and zzso were very similar, the zzso (and zzso model explained only a small fraction of the zzso in zzso zzso For zzso swimmers, we found a zzso relationship between zzso and zzso , which was largely negative over most of the range of zzso This pattern fails to support either predictions from the zzso models or standard functional interpretations of body shape variation in zzso Our results suggest that the widespread hypothesis that a more optimal zzso increases zzso performance via reduced drag should be limited to zzso that swim with rigid zzso
