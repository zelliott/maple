Many current methods for protein analysis depend on the detection of similarity in either the primary zzso or the overall zzso structure (the zzso atoms of the protein zzso These common sequences or structures may imply similar functional characteristics or active zzso Active sites and zzso binding sites usually occur on or near the surface of the zzso so similarly shaped surface regions could imply similar zzso We investigate various methods for describing the shape properties of protein surfaces and for comparing zzso Our current work uses zzso from computer vision to describe the protein surfaces, and methods from graph theory to compare the surface zzso Early results indicate that we can successfully match a family of related zzso binding sites, and find their similarly shaped surface zzso This method of surface analysis could be extended to help identify unknown surface regions for possible zzso binding or active zzso
