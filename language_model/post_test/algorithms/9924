Left zzso function is zzso zzso Our aim was to validate different zzso zzso with zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso acquired simultaneously on hybrid zzso 

Fifty patients zzso men, 17 women, mean age 59 years zzso zzso referred for coronary artery disease evaluation underwent zzso PET zzso zzso zzso and zzso CT coronary zzso simultaneously on hybrid zzso Left zzso ejection zzso zzso volume and zzso volume from quantitative gated PET at rest, were calculated using quantitative gated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Emory zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso software and then compared with zzso The paired zzso and zzso plots were used for zzso 

There was no significant difference between CT and both zzso and zzso for calculating zzso Otherwise there were significant differences zzso zzso between CT coronary zzso and all other software zzso in calculating zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a bias towards zzso zzso volume with mean differences of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The limits of agreement zzso zzso zzso for left zzso ejection fraction zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The systematic error (or mean zzso of the zzso zzso is the zzso and zzso zzso shows the least statistical error (or limits of zzso when calculating ejection fraction from zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso and zzso The wide limits of agreement between the different zzso mean that they are not zzso
