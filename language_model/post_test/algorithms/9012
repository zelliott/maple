To assess the diagnostic value of zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso volume zzso zzso spin echo acquisition zzso imaging in detecting zzso and root tears of the zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso confirmed zzso or root tears of the zzso underwent magnetic resonance imaging zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were reviewed independently by two musculoskeletal zzso blinded to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso agreement were calculated for zzso and root zzso Both zzso reported confidence scale for the presence of zzso tears in zzso zzso imaging, zzso zzso imaging, and zzso imaging, based on a zzso zzso zzso signed rank test was used to compare confidence zzso 

The sensitivity, zzso and accuracy of zzso zzso zzso MR imaging versus zzso MR imaging were as zzso zzso zzso and zzso versus zzso zzso and zzso respectively in reader 1, and zzso zzso and zzso versus zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in reader zzso zzso agreement for detecting zzso tears was excellent zzso with zzso zzso zzso The confidence scale was significantly higher for zzso zzso images than zzso imaging zzso and significantly higher in zzso images than zzso zzso image in detecting zzso and root zzso 

zzso zzso zzso had a better diagnostic performance in evaluating zzso and root tears of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso plane obtained from zzso zzso zzso MR imaging is useful in detecting zzso and root tears of the zzso
