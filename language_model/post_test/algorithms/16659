zzso zzso cycles, as well as zzso zzso modifications of zzso are widely diffused within cellular systems and are crucial for the control of complex responses such as learning, memory, and cellular fate zzso Despite the large body of deterministic studies and the increasing work aimed at zzso the effect of noise in such systems, some aspects remain zzso Here we study the stationary distribution provided by the two-dimensional chemical master equation for a well-known model of a two step zzso cycle using the zzso state approximation of zzso zzso Our aim is to analyze the role of fluctuations and the molecules distribution properties in the transition to a zzso zzso When detailed balance conditions are satisfied it is possible to zzso equilibrium zzso in a closed and explicit zzso When detailed balance is not satisfied, the stationary zzso state is strongly influenced by the chemical zzso In the last case, we show how the external field derived from the generation and zzso transition rates, can be zzso by the zzso zzso into a conservative and a zzso zzso zzso Moreover, this decomposition allows to zzso the stationary distribution via a zzso zzso For a finite number of molecules there exists diffusion dynamics in a zzso region of the state space where a relevant transition rate between the two critical points is zzso Further, the stationary distribution function can be zzso by the solution of a zzso zzso We illustrate the theoretical results using several zzso zzso
