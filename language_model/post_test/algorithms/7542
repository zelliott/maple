The aim of this paper is to detail the development of a novel tracking framework that is able to extract the cell zzso indicators and to determine the cellular division zzso events in large zzso zzso image zzso To address the challenges induced by zzso zzso motion, cellular zzso and cellular zzso the process of automatic zzso cell tracking is carried out in a sequential manner, where the zzso cell association is achieved by assessing the variation in the local cellular structures in consecutive frames of the image zzso In our study, a strong emphasis has been placed on the robust use of the zzso information in the cellular tracking process and in the development of targeted pattern recognition techniques that were designed to zzso the problems caused by zzso zzso and to precisely identify zzso using a backward zzso tracking zzso The proposed zzso has been evaluated on dense zzso cellular data and the experimental results indicate that the proposed zzso is able to accurately track zzso and zzso cells in zzso image sequences that are characterized by low contrast and high level of zzso Our zzso achieved zzso overall tracking accuracy and zzso zzso detection zzso
