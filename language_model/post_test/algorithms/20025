zzso of zzso tuberculosis complex zzso mutate over zzso Among the zzso of zzso zzso zzso type zzso and zzso zzso repetitive unit zzso patterns are commonly used to zzso clinical zzso zzso In this study, we present an evolution model of zzso zzso using zzso patterns to zzso the ancestors of zzso We use a large patient zzso from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention zzso to generate this zzso Based on the zzso deletion assumption and rare observation of zzso evolution, we first generate the most zzso forest of zzso called a zzso using three genetic distance zzso An analysis of zzso attributes of the zzso and number of variations at the direct repeat zzso locus of each strain reveals interesting properties of deletions in the DR zzso First, we compare our zzso model to existing zzso models of zzso and find that our zzso model produces as many zzso zzso events as other models, with slightly higher segregation zzso Second, based on our zzso model, the number of descendant zzso follows a power law zzso Third, contrary to prior studies, the power law distribution does not zzso fit to the zzso length zzso Moreover, we find that the total number of zzso events at consecutive zzso follows a zzso zzso zzso The two modes are zzso 13 and 40, which are hotspots for zzso zzso and the change point is zzso 34, which is absent in most zzso zzso Based on this zzso we built two alternative models for zzso length zzso the Starting Point Model zzso and the zzso Block Model zzso Both models are zzso good fits to the zzso length frequency distribution, as verified by the zzso zzso We also apply zzso and zzso to a zzso from Institut zzso de zzso and verify that these models hold for different strain zzso
