zzso a zzso method for formative evaluation of statistical zzso Learning zzso zzso that zzso existing biomedical zzso as reference zzso 

In the first step optimum parameters are zzso A zzso zzso of entities is generated by finding the set of entities present in a later version of the zzso that are not present in an earlier version of the zzso A named entity recognition system is used to identify entities in a corpus of biomedical documents that are present in the zzso zzso generating a reference zzso The output of the zzso (new entity zzso produced by statistical methods, is subsequently compared against this reference zzso An OL method that performs perfectly will be able to learn all of the terms in this reference zzso Using evaluation metrics and zzso zzso for different thresholds and zzso we zzso the optimum parameters for each zzso In the second step, human judges with expertise in zzso development evaluate each candidate suggested by the zzso configured with the optimum parameters previously zzso These judgments are used to zzso two performance metrics developed from our previous work: zzso zzso Rate zzso and zzso Acceptance Rate zzso 

Using this method, we evaluated two statistical OL methods for OL in two medical zzso For the pathology domain, we obtained zzso zzso zzso zzso with the Lin method and zzso zzso zzso zzso with the Church zzso For the zzso domain, we obtain zzso zzso zzso zzso using Lin method and zzso zzso zzso zzso using Church zzso 

This method is sufficiently general and flexible enough to permit comparison of any OL method for a specific corpus and zzso of zzso
