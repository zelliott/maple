The performance of long distance imaging systems is typically zzso by phase errors imparted by atmospheric zzso In this paper we apply coherent imaging methods to zzso and remove, these phase errors by digitally processing coherent recordings of the image zzso In this manner we are able to remove the effects of atmospheric turbulence without needing a conventional zzso optical zzso Digital holographic detection is used to record the zzso zzso optical field for a series of atmospheric and object zzso Correction of atmospheric phase errors is then based on maximizing an image sharpness metric to determine the aberrations present and correct the underlying zzso Experimental results that demonstrate image recovery in the presence of turbulence are zzso zzso obtained with severe turbulence that gives rise to zzso are also zzso
