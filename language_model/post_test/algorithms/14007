This paper presents a new development of the zzso zzso zzso zzso relevant atmospheric and oceanic parameters by minimizing the difference between the observed satellite zzso and those zzso from zzso transfer simulations zzso by artificial neural zzso zzso optical properties are zzso using the zzso size distribution allowing taking into account highly absorbing zzso The major improvement to the method has been to implement an zzso cost function zzso that makes the zzso more zzso This zzso of zzso has been applied to zzso wide zzso sensor zzso zzso A comparison with in zzso zzso and the standard zzso results for cases without absorbing zzso shows that this version of zzso remains consistent with the zzso Finally, the processing of zzso images of a plume of absorbing zzso off the US East coast demonstrate the ability of this improved version of zzso to deal with absorbing zzso
