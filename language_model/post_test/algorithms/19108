zzso zzso zzso with a time resolution of approximately 1 zzso was applied to study the zzso of the primary radical pair zzso in zzso zzso zzso reaction centers with blocked electron transfer from zzso to zzso The block in the electron transfer was realized in two ways: by either reducing or removing zzso We found very different zzso of the zzso zzso in these two zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with the instrument response function allowed resolution of as many as three kinetic components of zzso zzso and zzso lifetimes in zzso with zzso reduced and in isolated reaction centers both with zzso either reduced or removed (with or without zzso but with variable relative zzso zzso zzso or adding zzso to isolated reaction centers increased the zzso of the zzso zzso phase relative to that of the fastest zzso On the basis of these zzso we propose that reaction centers adopt three zzso states characterized by different zzso zzso of zzso These zzso states appear to be controlled by the charges in the vicinity of the zzso site as revealed by the effects of zzso reduction and zzso zzso of the sites close to zzso
