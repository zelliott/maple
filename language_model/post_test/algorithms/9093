The study analyzes noise in X-ray zzso phase zzso in a biomedical zzso The impact of noise on detection of iron oxide zzso in mouse brain is zzso The part of the noise due to the imaging system and the part due to biology are zzso expressed in a zzso zzso detection strategy with two models of zzso This represents a practical extension of previous work on noise in zzso X-ray imaging which focused on the theoretical expression of the zzso ratio in zzso zzso taking account of the statistical noise of the imaging system zzso We also report the impact of the phase retrieval step on detection zzso Taken together, this constitutes a general methodology of practical interest for quantitative extraction of information from X-ray zzso phase zzso and is also relevant to assessment of contrast agents with a zzso signature in high resolution zzso
