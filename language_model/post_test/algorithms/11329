Based on the life cycle cost zzso approach, this paper presents an integral mathematical model and particle swarm zzso zzso zzso for the heating system planning zzso zzso The proposed mathematical model zzso the cost of heating system as the objective for a given life cycle zzso For the zzso of zzso problem, the general particle swarm zzso zzso was zzso An actual case study was calculated to check its feasibility in practical zzso The results show that the improved particle swarm zzso zzso zzso can more preferably solve the zzso problem than zzso zzso Moreover, the results also present the potential to provide useful information when making decisions in the practical planning zzso zzso it is believed that if this approach is applied correctly and in combination with other zzso it can become a powerful and effective zzso tool for zzso zzso
