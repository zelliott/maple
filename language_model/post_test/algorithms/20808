Most of the zzso used in organ transplantation are characterized by a narrow therapeutic index, zzso zzso is associated with increased risk of rejection episodes and zzso may exacerbate drug-related zzso zzso to zzso the potential to allow individualized dosing of zzso agents to zzso their therapeutic actions while minimizing adverse zzso Most of the studies have focused on zzso of genes involved in drug metabolism and distribution, but as of now, only zzso and zzso P 450 zzso zzso appear to have sufficiently large influence to have zzso in guiding drug zzso This may reflect the fact that available information from other zzso derives almost exclusively from retrospective observations or from studies with important zzso zzso Active investigations aimed at identifying zzso zzso of gene zzso for the zzso targets are now zzso Recent studies have demonstrated that also donor zzso may play a significant role in zzso drug zzso and zzso As one of the main future tasks, it is mandatory to develop mathematical models able to incorporate multiple gene zzso with zzso data and other critical information, providing zzso able to zzso the best zzso therapy for each patient before zzso
