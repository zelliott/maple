We present a mathematical model for the zzso of a porous scaffold following zzso in zzso The model is given as a set of coupled zzso ordinary differential equations zzso which describe the evolution in time of the amounts of the different tissue constituents inside the zzso zzso analyses reveal how the extent of scaffold zzso changes as a function of the zzso zzso For example, it is shown how the loss of seeded cells arising from slow zzso of vascular tissue can be overcome using a zzso strategy consisting of seeding the scaffold with vascular zzso Using certain assumptions it is shown how the system can be simplified to one which is partially zzso and for which some analysis is zzso Limited comparison is also given of the model solutions with experimental data from the chick zzso membrane zzso zzso
