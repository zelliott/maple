To compare zzso the zzso power of the zzso zzso and zzso in terms of absolute and relative zzso using Shannon's zzso 

zzso and zzso data completed by a sample of the general adult US population (N zzso zzso were zzso Five dimensions allowed head-to-head comparison of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Shannon's index and Shannon's zzso index were used to assess absolute and relative zzso both by dimension and by instrument as a zzso 

Absolute zzso was highest for zzso with the largest differences in zzso and zzso Relative zzso was highest for zzso with the largest differences in zzso and zzso Absolute zzso by instrument was consistently highest for zzso and lowest for zzso and relative zzso was highest for zzso and lowest for zzso 

Performance in terms of absolute and relative zzso of the common dimensions of the three instruments varies over zzso Several dimensions are zzso zzso zzso seems too crude with only 3 levels, and the level descriptions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso could be zzso In absence of a formal measure, Shannon's zzso provide useful measures for assessing zzso power of utility zzso
