Recent interest in reconstruction of the upper limb following zzso zzso injuries has focused on the restoration of zzso following complete zzso of the zzso zzso 

Double free muscle transfer was performed in patients who had complete zzso of the zzso zzso After initial exploration of the zzso zzso and (if zzso repair of the fifth cervical nerve zzso the first free muscle, used to restore elbow zzso and finger extension, is transferred and zzso by the spinal accessory zzso The second free muscle, transferred to restore finger zzso is zzso by the fifth and sixth zzso zzso The motor branch of the zzso zzso is zzso by the third and fourth zzso nerves to restore elbow zzso Hand sensibility is restored by zzso of the sensory zzso of the zzso nerves to the median nerve or the zzso nerve component of the zzso zzso Secondary zzso procedures, such as zzso of the zzso joint of the zzso shoulder zzso and zzso of the transferred muscle and the zzso zzso may be required to improve the functional zzso 

The early results were evaluated in zzso patients who had had reconstruction with use of the double free muscle zzso Twenty-six of these patients were followed for at least zzso months zzso zzso zzso zzso after the second free muscle transfer, and they were assessed with regard to the long-term outcome as zzso zzso zzso or zzso elbow zzso was restored in zzso zzso percent) of the zzso patients and satisfactory zzso (more than 30 degrees of total active motion of the zzso in zzso (65 zzso Fourteen patients (54 percent) could position the hand in space, zzso simultaneous zzso of the elbow, while moving the fingers at least 30 degrees and could use the reconstructed hand for activities requiring the use of two hands, such as holding a bottle while opening a cap and lifting a heavy zzso The results were analyzed to identify factors affecting the zzso 

The double free muscle procedure can provide reliable and useful zzso function for patients with complete zzso of the zzso zzso
