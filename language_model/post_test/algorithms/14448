Travel zzso introduced by Coleman and Sharp in 2006, is a physical interpretation of molecular depth, a term frequently used to describe the shape of a molecular active site or binding zzso Travel zzso can be seen as the physical distance a zzso zzso would have to travel from a point of the surface, zzso the zzso Surface zzso to its convex zzso zzso zzso providing an zzso of the Travel zzso are based on a regular sampling of the zzso volume and the use of the zzso shortest path zzso Since Travel zzso is only defined on the molecular surface, this zzso approach is characterized by a large zzso complexity due to the processing of unnecessary samples lying inside or outside the zzso In this paper, we propose a zzso approach that restricts the processing to data defined on the zzso This zzso significantly reduces the complexity of Travel zzso zzso and makes possible the analysis of large zzso surface shape description with high zzso Experimental results show that compared to existing methods, the proposed zzso achieves accurate zzso with considerably reduced processing zzso
