We assessed what MR imaging parameters affected ringing artifacts during the zzso phase of zzso zzso dynamic magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

We tested various zzso including imaging zzso choice of either sequential or elliptical zzso zzso zzso scanning time, and contrast injection rate using new simulation software on a personal computer and visually evaluated clinical MR images zzso using a 4-point scale to assess ringing zzso 

The simulation study revealed that square zzso short scanning time, slow injection rate, and sequential view ordering effectively reduced ringing artifacts, findings confirmed in clinical practice using zzso zzso MR zzso zzso fewer artifacts resulted using a slow injection rate zzso and using square zzso in the zzso zzso portal zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Choice of square zzso slower injection rate, shorter scanning time, and sequential view ordering could reduce ringing zzso
