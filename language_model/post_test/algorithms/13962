The severity of the initial neurological deficit is a critical zzso of outcome after acute zzso zzso outcome studies are generally limited by a lack of quantitative data relating to this initial stroke zzso We evaluated the zzso and reliability of measuring initial stroke severity zzso with the Canadian Neurological zzso zzso 

The zzso was used to zzso score the initial neurological deficit in a series of patients with acute zzso stroke zzso zzso zzso An zzso was devised for applying the zzso zzso on the basis of information in the patient's hospital discharge zzso Those dictating the discharge zzso were not aware of the study, and the retrospective scoring was performed without reference to other zzso The level of agreement between the prospective and retrospective scores zzso and both zzso and zzso reliability for the retrospective scores were zzso 

zzso was high between retrospective and prospective scores zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso between two sets of retrospective scores obtained by one zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and between retrospective scores obtained by different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso statistics zzso zzso for zzso versus zzso scored items varied from almost perfect zzso w zzso zzso for level of consciousness and zzso to substantial zzso w zzso zzso for zzso and moderate zzso w zzso zzso to zzso for facial zzso zzso arm, zzso arm, zzso leg, and zzso leg zzso Using the retrospective algorithm, there was almost perfect zzso and zzso reliability for each of the individual zzso items zzso w zzso zzso to zzso 

These data show that retrospective scoring of initial stroke severity using an zzso based on the zzso is valid and can be reliably performed using information available in hospital discharge zzso
