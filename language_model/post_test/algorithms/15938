zzso neural networks zzso are biologically inspired computer programs designed to simulate the way in which the human brain processes zzso zzso gather their knowledge by detecting the patterns and relationships in data and learn (or are zzso through experience, not from zzso An ANN is formed from hundreds of single units, artificial zzso or processing elements zzso connected with zzso zzso which constitute the neural structure and are zzso in zzso The power of neural zzso comes from connecting zzso in a zzso Each zzso has weighted zzso transfer function and one zzso The behavior of a neural network is determined by the transfer functions of its zzso by the learning rule, and by the architecture zzso The weights are the adjustable parameters and, in that sense, a neural network is a zzso zzso The weighed sum of the zzso constitutes the zzso of the zzso The zzso signal is passed through transfer function to produce a single output of the zzso Transfer function introduces zzso to the zzso During training, the zzso connections are zzso until the error in predictions is minimized and the network reaches the specified level of zzso Once the network is trained and tested it can be given new input information to predict the zzso Many types of neural networks have been designed already and new ones are invented every week but all can be described by the transfer functions of their zzso by the learning rule, and by the connection zzso ANN represents a promising modeling technique, especially for data sets having zzso relationships which are frequently encountered in pharmaceutical zzso In terms of model zzso artificial neural networks require no knowledge of the data source but, since they often contain many weights that must be estimated, they require large training zzso In addition, zzso can combine and incorporate both zzso and experimental data to solve zzso The various applications of zzso can be zzso into zzso or pattern recognition, prediction and zzso zzso zzso networks can be applied in pharmaceutical fields as an alternative to conventional response surface zzso zzso zzso networks represent an alternative to principal component zzso zzso zzso networks are able to reconstruct their patterns when presented with noisy samples and can be used for image zzso The potential applications of ANN methodology in the pharmaceutical sciences range from interpretation of zzso data, drug and dosage form design through zzso to clinical zzso
