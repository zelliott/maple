zzso of zzso zzso of zzso were zzso An zzso was suggested for the calculation of the zzso zzso providing zzso between the number of zzso zzso and the retention time of the zzso zzso zzso separation of zzso The zzso is based on zzso of the results of separation of a test mixture of five zzso varying in length from 10 to 30 zzso It was shown that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso + m zzso leads to the zzso separation of zzso The separation is characterized by two measured zzso the retention time step and the extent of zzso A functional dependence of the measured parameters on two varying parameters of the zzso function zzso and zzso was established zzso A method for calculating the expected retention time of an zzso from its zzso composition was zzso
