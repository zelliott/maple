A new efficient zzso scheme for zzso images containing locally straight edges is zzso This paper is especially focused on zzso zzso coding of zzso shapes for image and video objects, but other images with similar characteristics such as line drawings, layers of digital zzso or zzso maps are also zzso zzso The zzso is not targeted at document images with text, which can be coded efficiently with zzso techniques as in zzso The scheme is based on a local analysis of the digital zzso of the zzso part of the object boundary, which is used in the context definition for zzso zzso Tested on individual images of standard TV resolution zzso shapes and the zzso layers of a digital map, the proposed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso On the zzso shapes, the code lengths are reduced by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso On the map zzso the reductions are zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso is also more efficient on the test material than the state-of-the-art generic zzso image zzso free zzso
