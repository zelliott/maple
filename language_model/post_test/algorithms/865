There has been significant zzso of the technique described by zzso et zzso zzso J zzso zzso Care zzso zzso zzso 1997) in which a zzso enhanced pause zzso related to airways responsiveness is zzso measured by unrestrained zzso zzso zzso this technique, we sought to answer these questions: zzso How do changes in zzso compare with changes in traditional zzso and lung mechanical zzso zzso How do UP parameters perform in two different mouse strains? zzso zzso and control zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso mice were placed in the UP chamber and exposed to doses of zzso zzso while the following parameters were measured at each concentration: zzso time zzso zzso time zzso total time zzso zzso peak zzso pressure, peak zzso pressure, zzso zzso tidal volume zzso zzso zzso and zzso The next day, lung resistance zzso and compliance zzso were zzso measured in the same zzso For the zzso the parameters with the highest magnitude of correlation zzso zzso zzso are (in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso parameters of breathing frequency zzso zzso zzso and zzso parameters related to Vt zzso pressure, zzso zzso zzso parameters zzso zzso zzso and duty cycle parameters zzso had insignificant zzso This ordering is significantly different in zzso mice, in which the parameters with the largest correlations are zzso zzso zzso parameters of breathing frequency, and zzso flow zzso zzso zzso zzso and duty cycle parameters had insignificant zzso These data show that zzso is problematic in the sense that it is strain zzso it behaves very differently in zzso and zzso zzso We suggest that UP parameters largely originate as part of zzso control of breathing zzso rather than in the lung mechanics and conclude that it is inappropriate to use UP parameters in general, and zzso specifically, as substitute variables for invasive mechanical indexes such as zzso
