zzso zzso zzso viruses exist in infected hosts as zzso populations of genetically close zzso known as zzso zzso sequencing zzso allows for zzso a large number of viral sequences from infected patients, presenting a novel opportunity for studying the structure of a viral population and understanding virus evolution, drug resistance and immune zzso zzso reconstruction of genetic composition of zzso viral populations involves assembling the zzso short reads into zzso sequences and zzso zzso of individual viral zzso Although a few approaches were developed for this task, accurate reconstruction of zzso populations remains greatly zzso 

Two new methods, zzso and zzso for reconstruction of the zzso zzso viral zzso and zzso of their zzso were developed, based on zzso zzso zzso zzso was designed for zzso reads obtained from individual zzso zzso and zzso for zzso shotgun zzso While zzso based on covering zzso identifies a minimal set of zzso explaining all observed reads, zzso based on packing zzso engages the zzso number of reads to generate the most probable set of zzso Both methods were evaluated on simulated data in comparison to zzso Bandwidth and zzso previously developed state-of-the-art zzso for zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso and shotgun reads, zzso Both zzso were accurate in zzso of zzso zzso especially from large zzso 

The problem of viral population reconstruction from zzso or shotgun zzso reads was solved using the zzso zzso The two methods, zzso and zzso developed here afford accurate reconstruction of the structure of zzso viral population from zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso are available at zzso zzso and zzso zzso
