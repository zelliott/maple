zzso zzso has become an essential tool in the analysis of zzso association zzso This technique allows investigators to test association at zzso genetic zzso and to combine results across studies that rely on different zzso zzso In addition, zzso is used within long-running studies to zzso zzso produced across generations of zzso Typically, zzso of controls are zzso and cases are zzso on more novel platforms yielding a zzso study that is not matched for zzso zzso In this study, we scrutinize such a situation and validate zzso results by actually zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso We discuss the needed quality controls zzso In doing so, we report a considerable zzso between the results from zzso and zzso data when applying recommended zzso from the zzso These discrepancies appear to be caused by zzso differences between zzso by the process of zzso To avoid false positive results, we recommend that more stringent zzso should be zzso We also advocate reporting the zzso quality measure zzso for the zzso zzso in zzso
