We construct a zzso model for biological zzso in which individuals experience long-range social attraction and short-range zzso For the case of one spatial dimension, we study the steady states zzso and zzso There exist strongly zzso states with compact support and steep edges that zzso to localized biological zzso or zzso These zzso zzso are reached through a dynamic zzso zzso In the limit of large population size, the zzso approach a constant density swarm with abrupt zzso We use energy arguments to understand the zzso selection of clump solutions, and to predict the internal density in the large population zzso The energy result holds in higher dimensions as well, and is demonstrated via zzso simulations in two zzso
