The authors propose the zzso zzso zzso a new, simple, universal method to predict adult zzso The authors calculated zzso and zzso height zzso values and validated their use for height zzso Average height zzso values zzso for boys and girls were calculated by dividing height at skeletal maturity zzso by present height zzso for each age, zzso and height zzso zzso using data published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention zzso The accuracy of the zzso method was compared with the zzso growth charts using zzso growth data from 52 normal zzso No significant differences were noted between predictions made using the zzso growth charts versus the zzso zzso The authors also compared the zzso zzso values with other growth databases from around the world and from different zzso Height zzso were independent of height zzso race, and generation, indicating that the zzso method is zzso
