zzso and recruitment for clinical trials can be costly and zzso zzso trials present additional challenges because enrollment is time sensitive based on length of zzso We hypothesized that using an automated zzso zzso to identify eligible subjects would increase screening efficiency and enrollment and be cost-effective compared to manual review of a daily admission zzso 

Using a zzso design, we compared time spent zzso number of patients screened, enrollment rate, and zzso of each screening method in an zzso diabetes trial conducted at Massachusetts General zzso Manual chart review zzso involved reviewing a daily list of admitted patients to identify eligible zzso The automated zzso zzso method used an zzso to generate a daily list of patients with zzso levels zzso 180 zzso an insulin order, and/or admission diagnosis of diabetes zzso The census generated was then manually screened to confirm eligibility and eliminate patients who met our exclusion zzso We determined rates of screening and enrollment and zzso of each method based on study sample zzso 

Total screening time zzso and zzso decreased from 4 to 2 zzso allowing subjects to be approached earlier in the course of the hospital zzso The average number of patients zzso per day increased from 13 zzso 4 to 30 zzso 16 zzso zzso zzso Rate of enrollment increased from zzso to zzso patients per screening zzso zzso the computer zzso added a fixed cost of zzso to the zzso Based on our screening and enrollment rates, the zzso was zzso after enrolling 12 zzso zzso sample sizes further favored screening with an zzso By contrast, higher recruitment rates favored individual zzso 

Because of the zzso design of this study, it is possible that zzso factors contributed to increased zzso 

Using a computer zzso to identify eligible patients for a clinical trial in the zzso setting increased the number of patients screened and zzso decreased the time required to enroll them, and was less zzso zzso investment in developing a computerized zzso to improve screening may be cost-effective even for relatively small trials, especially when the recruitment rate is expected to be zzso
