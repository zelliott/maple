This paper shows that zzso which are periodic orbits for which the trajectory follows both the attracting and zzso part of a slow zzso can exist for a two-dimensional reduction of the zzso zzso Such zzso are associated with a dramatic change in the properties of the periodic orbit within a very narrow zzso of a control zzso By smoothly connecting stable and unstable zzso in an zzso limit, we predict with great accuracy the zzso value at which the zzso exist for this zzso This illustrates the power of using singular zzso theory to understand the zzso properties of realistic biological zzso
