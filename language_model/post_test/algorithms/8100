The effect of selective zzso on the apparent carbon zzso relaxation is investigated in three fully zzso systems, zzso as a model system and two proteins zzso and zzso It is shown that the zzso relaxation of a selectively excited carbon spin is greatly zzso mainly because of fast zzso This relaxation enhancement allows reducing the time necessary for polarization recovery between two zzso This effect can be exploited either to improve the sensitivity of zzso experiments or to reduce the experimental zzso Using selective carbon zzso combined with fast pulsing on fully zzso zzso a sensitivity improvement of zzso over standard zzso methods is predicted from the measured relaxation zzso
