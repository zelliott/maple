zzso zzso zzso status is a major zzso factor in zzso zzso It is clinically desirable to predict the zzso zzso zzso status from data from the zzso cancer zzso In the study, the zzso zzso zzso status, routine zzso parameters and zzso data were zzso obtained from zzso specimens of invasive zzso zzso The ten zzso age, zzso type, zzso grade, zzso size, skin zzso zzso zzso zzso category, percentage of zzso cells in zzso and zzso of the cell cycle, and zzso index were considered as predictor zzso and the single variable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso or 1 for zzso or zzso was used as an output zzso A zzso zzso zzso analysis, with the zzso zzso zzso as a dependent zzso was used for feature zzso Only zzso zzso and zzso size proved to be significant as independent predictor zzso the other variables were zzso Three zzso with supervised learning rules zzso zzso learning zzso zzso and support zzso zzso were used for the purpose of zzso If any of these zzso was used with the information from all ten input zzso zzso of cases could be correctly predicted, with specificity ranging from 82 to zzso and sensitivity ranging from 60 to zzso If only the two significant input variables were used, zzso zzso and zzso diameter, the prediction accuracy was no zzso Nearly identical results were obtained by two different techniques of zzso zzso against zzso cross zzso It was concluded that: artificial neural networks can be used for risk zzso on the basis of routine data in individual cases of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso size are independent zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
