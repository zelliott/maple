We describe the theory and current development state of the zzso process module of the zzso Research Service Root Zone Water Quality Model, or zzso Several processes which are significant in determining the fate of a zzso application are included together in this module for the first time, including application technique, root zzso zzso zzso soil depth dependence of zzso zzso zzso upward in soil and aging of zzso The zzso module requires a large number of parameters to run (as does the zzso model as a zzso and it is becoming clear that zzso will find most interest and use as part of a zzso in which all data requirements are supplied and the predictions of the system compared with a real (usually zzso data zzso Such a scenario may then be modified to examine the response of the system to changes in zzso It also has significant potential as a technology transfer or teaching zzso providing detailed understanding of a specific zzso system and its potential impacts on the zzso
