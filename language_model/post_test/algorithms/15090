Are there general principles for pattern zzso We examined this question by analyzing the operation of large populations of evolved model central pattern generators zzso for zzso Three populations of model zzso were evolved, containing three, four, or five zzso We identified six general zzso First, locomotion performance increased with the number of zzso Second, the top 10 zzso zzso and zzso zzso could be zzso into zzso zzso an abstract description developed in a companion zzso Third, these zzso zzso were zzso they could be switched between multiple stable output zzso Fourth, the rhythmic pattern generated by a zzso could be understood as a closed chain of successive zzso of one zzso module by zzso A zzso analysis zzso the possible zzso modular zzso zzso one-dimensional zzso were frequently observed and, in some cases, could be assigned specific functional zzso Finally, dynamic zzso zzso in which the modular structure itself changed over one cycle, were frequently zzso The existence of these general principles despite significant zzso in both patterns of connectivity and neural parameters was explained by zzso in the maps from neural parameters to neural dynamics to behavior to zzso An analysis of the zzso properties of the model body was essential for relating neural activity to zzso Our studies of evolved model circuits suggest that, in the absence of other constraints, there is no compelling reason to expect neural circuits to be functionally zzso as the number of zzso zzso zzso idealized model pattern generators may be an effective methodology for gaining insights into the operation of biological pattern zzso
