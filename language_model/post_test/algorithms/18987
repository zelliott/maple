A zzso is an zzso zzso zzso The zzso of two zzso is the zzso of their zzso zzso We study the following problem: Given a set of zzso reconstruct their zzso so that the set of resulting zzso can be mapped onto a perfect zzso zzso zzso The question is motivated by studying population evolution in human zzso and is a zzso of the perfect zzso zzso problem that has received intensive attention zzso Unlike the latter problem, in which the input is zzso zzso here we assume less zzso zzso and so may be more economical to obtain zzso Building on ideas of zzso we show how to solve the problem in zzso time, by a reduction to the graph realization zzso The actual zzso are not uniquely determined by that tree they map onto, and the tree itself may or may not be zzso We show that tree uniqueness implies uniquely determined zzso up to inherent degrees of freedom, and give a sufficient condition for the zzso To actually determine the zzso given the tree, additional information is zzso We show that two or three full zzso suffice to reconstruct all the zzso and present a linear zzso for identifying those zzso
