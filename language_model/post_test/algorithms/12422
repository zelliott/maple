The identification of signatures of positive selection can provide important insights into recent evolutionary history in human zzso Current methods mostly rely on zzso frequency determination or focus on one or a small number of candidate zzso regions per zzso With the availability of large-scale zzso data, efficient approaches for an unbiased whole zzso scan are becoming zzso 

We have developed a new method, the whole zzso long-range zzso test zzso which uses zzso zzso to test for recent positive zzso Adapted from the long-range zzso zzso test, the zzso test uses patterns of linkage zzso zzso to identify regions with extremely low historic zzso Common zzso with significantly longer than expected ranges of zzso given their zzso are identified as putative signatures of recent positive zzso In addition, we have also determined the ancestral zzso of zzso by zzso zzso and gorilla DNA, and have identified zzso where the zzso zzso have risen to extremely high zzso in human zzso termed zzso zzso Combining the zzso test and the flipped zzso determination, the zzso test serves as an unbiased zzso screen for regions under putative selection, and is potentially zzso to the study of other human zzso 

Using zzso and zzso zzso zzso interrogating 116 204 zzso we rapidly identified putative regions of positive selection in three populations zzso zzso zzso and extended these observations to a fourth population, zzso with data obtained from the International zzso zzso We mapped significant regions to zzso zzso While some regions overlap with genes previously suggested to be under positive selection, many of the genes have not been previously implicated in natural selection and offer intriguing possibilities for further zzso
