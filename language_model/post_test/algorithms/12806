zzso zzso an exclusive human zzso is a major cause of mortality due to zzso meningitis and zzso in many developing zzso Three zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso stimulating protein A zzso zzso A zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso elicits zzso zzso response and may enhance the effectiveness of zzso vaccines by acting as protective zzso A very limited data on zzso cell zzso in zzso proteins is zzso zzso in zzso prediction of zzso sequences which may act as helper T zzso zzso in zzso proteins was carried out by zzso web zzso zzso distribution analysis was done by using the population coverage tool of zzso zzso Database to determine the fraction of individuals in various populations expected to respond to a given set of predicted zzso zzso based on zzso zzso zzso Six zzso core zzso two from each zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were predicted to associate with a large number of zzso zzso These six peptides may act as zzso zzso in more than zzso of populations in 8 out of 12 populations zzso The zzso stimulation potential of these predicted peptides containing the core zzso sequences is to be validated by using laboratory experiments for their efficient use as zzso vaccine candidates against zzso zzso zzso zzso
