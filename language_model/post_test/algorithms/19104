zzso zzso in zzso zzso solution can attract each other because of the presence of zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso theory is able to predict attractive interactions if the zzso extended structure (which reflects the presence of zzso zzso of the mobile zzso in the zzso is accounted zzso We demonstrate this for the case of zzso mobile zzso where each zzso consists of two individual charges separated by a fixed zzso zzso theory applied to this zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso leads to an zzso zzso valid for arbitrary rod zzso zzso solutions reveal the existence of a critical rod length above which zzso attraction starts to zzso This zzso attraction is distinct from zzso depletion zzso Analysis of the zzso distribution functions suggests a bridging mechanism of the zzso zzso to hold the two zzso zzso For sufficiently large rod zzso we also observe zzso that is, an zzso of the zzso charges by the diffuse layer of mobile zzso zzso Our results emphasize the importance of the often zzso internal structure that condensing agents such as zzso zzso or zzso segments zzso The results were compared with zzso Carlo zzso
