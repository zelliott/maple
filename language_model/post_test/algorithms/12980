zzso infection is associated with complex immune and zzso responses in the zzso A quantitative understanding of these processes is essential to help inform malaria therapy and for the design of effective zzso In this study, we use a statistical zzso approach to investigate the immune and zzso responses in zzso zzso infections of zzso Three mouse zzso zzso zzso nude mice, and nude mice zzso with zzso taken from zzso zzso were infected with one of two zzso clones zzso or zzso Under a zzso zzso we use an zzso zzso zzso chain zzso Carlo method and fit a set of zzso models to observed data on zzso and red blood cell zzso zzso Model fits are compared using zzso factors and zzso estimates zzso We consider three independent immune zzso clearance of zzso zzso zzso clearance of zzso zzso zzso and clearance of zzso that burst from zzso zzso Our results suggest that the immune response of zzso mice is associated with less destruction of zzso compared to the immune response of nude zzso There is a greater degree of zzso between zzso and zzso clearance than between either mechanism and zzso zzso In all three mouse zzso control of the peak of zzso density is associated with zzso zzso In zzso mice and zzso nude mice, control of the peak is also associated with zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso rather than zzso infection, is the major zzso of zzso dynamics from approximately day 12 zzso During the first 2-3 weeks of zzso infection, zzso clearance of zzso and zzso appears to have a much stronger effect than zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is dependent on mouse zzso and is greater in zzso and zzso zzso Our study highlights the zzso power of statistically rigorous zzso techniques in zzso biological zzso
