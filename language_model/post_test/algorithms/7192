zzso calcium dynamics due to calcium release, zzso and zzso plays a central role in studying zzso zzso zzso in both healthy and defected cardiac zzso In our previous work, partial differential equations zzso had been used to simulate calcium dynamics with realistic zzso extracted from electron microscopic imaging zzso However, the zzso costs of such simulations are very high on a single zzso To alleviate this problem, we have accelerated the zzso simulations of calcium dynamics by using graphics processing units zzso zzso performance and simulation accuracy are compared with those based on a single CPU and another popular parallel computing technique, zzso
