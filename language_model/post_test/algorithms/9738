Water reservoirs are the primary source of freshwater for most cities around the zzso To monitor the dynamic changes in zzso water quality, however, we need an innovative platform that is able to observe the entire zzso with both zzso and zzso zzso is the first commercial satellite dedicated to site surveillance with a zzso sensor placed in a daily revisit orbit (2 m in zzso and 8 m in zzso In this research, we developed two empirical zzso to map the water contents of zzso zzso and suspended zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso These zzso are derived from a total of 53 pairs of zzso and zzso data collected during 14 field campaigns at zzso Reservoir from 2005 to zzso A total of 15 zzso images were selected from all available images of zzso Reservoir taken in 2006 to generate water quality maps of zzso and SS using our new zzso zzso from this study indicate that the zzso and SS zzso can be retrieved from zzso imagery with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso This is the first time that the zzso water quality can be mapped from a zzso satellite image at such a zzso To facilitate the administration of water resources, this research encourages the application of zzso high zzso imagery in identifying areas of poor water quality and monitoring the zzso pattern of zzso zzso
