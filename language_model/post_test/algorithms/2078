We present a zzso scheme to search for the most common zzso composed of a combination of sequence and structure constraints, among a collection of zzso zzso The method uses a simplified version of the zzso zzso for simultaneous folding and alignment of zzso zzso but maintains zzso by constructing zzso alignments from zzso zzso The overall method has similarities to both zzso and zzso but the core zzso assures that the zzso alignments are zzso for both sequence and structure zzso zzso solutions, and comparisons with other approaches, are zzso The solutions include finding consensus structures identical to published zzso
