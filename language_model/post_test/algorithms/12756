The automated monitoring of cell variables in zzso processes is a key technology in modern zzso In this article an innovative zzso tool for monitoring of cell zzso in zzso zzso of a zzso microscope with an automated image analysis software integrated in a zzso sampling zzso zzso This zzso zzso system was zzso by varying the height of the zzso sampling zzso A zzso of the system was performed by zzso the zzso result zzso to known zzso of Baker's zzso It was successfully applied in cell density monitoring of zzso processes of zzso zzso with a good correlation with zzso methods, and further used to monitor 3 parallel zzso This methodology was successfully transferred to zzso zzso cultures and applied to measure the cell zzso of parallel zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
