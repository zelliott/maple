Central retinal artery zzso zzso is an uncommon eye disorder, but one that typically produces severe and irreversible vision loss in the affected zzso The zzso has a dual blood supply, with the retinal circulation zzso the inner layers and the zzso circulation zzso the outer zzso In zzso vision loss results from cell death in the inner retinal layers despite relative sparing of the outer zzso If supplemental oxygen is zzso however, oxygen from the zzso circulation may diffuse in adequate quantity to the inner layers of the zzso to maintain retinal function and restore zzso In some patients this can be achieved with zzso zzso in others, zzso oxygen zzso may be zzso The challenge is to provide the supplemental oxygen early enough after the onset of vision loss to prevent irreversible damage to the zzso In experimental models of complete zzso the zzso time window before permanent retinal damage occurs is just over 90 minutes; in the clinical setting where zzso may be incomplete, return of vision may be achieved even after delays of eight to 24 zzso In patients with a clinical picture of zzso who present within 24 hours of vision loss, supplemental oxygen should be started immediately at the highest possible fraction of inspired oxygen zzso If vision is not quickly zzso emergent zzso should be undertaken if zzso If the patient responds to zzso follow-up treatment with supplemental oxygen should be customized to maintain retinal viability until the zzso retinal artery zzso which typically occurs within the first 72 zzso This paper reviews the pertinent literature on zzso and zzso and provides a treatment zzso
