Double enhancement of spontaneous zzso due to increased zzso density of states at the zzso frequency and the small group zzso of light at the zzso frequency was clearly demonstrated by zzso zzso experiments for zzso zzso composed of zzso and zzso with oxygen vacancies as light zzso zzso zzso profiles given by the weak zzso approximation agreed well with the experimental zzso
