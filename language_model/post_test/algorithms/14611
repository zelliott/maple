We analyze looping of thin charged elastic filaments under applied zzso and end forces, using the solution of linear elasticity theory zzso In application to DNA, we account for its zzso character and charge zzso calculating zzso energies stored in the zzso We argue that the standard theory of zzso persistence is only valid when the zzso radius of zzso and zzso distance are much larger than the zzso screening zzso We predict that larger twist rates are required to trigger looping of charged rods as compared with neutral zzso We then analyze loop shapes formed on charged filaments of finite zzso mimicking DNA looping by proteins with two zzso zzso We find optimal loop shapes at different salt zzso minimizing the sum of DNA elastic, DNA zzso and protein elastic zzso We implement a simple model where zzso zzso do not affect the loop shape directly but can choose the zzso shape from the allowed loop zzso At low salt zzso more open zzso are favored due to enhanced zzso of DNA charges, consistent with the results of computer simulations on formation of DNA zzso by zzso zzso Then, we model the precise geometry of DNA binding by the zzso zzso and explore loop shapes, varying the confined DNA length and protein opening zzso The characteristics of complexes zzso such as the total loop energy, stretching forces required to maintain its shape, and the reduction of zzso energy with zzso of salt, are in good agreement with the outcomes of more elaborate zzso calculations for zzso DNA zzso
