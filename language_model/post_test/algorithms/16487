In this paper the model and simulation of primary zzso and zzso reactions in zzso intact plant leaves is zzso A descriptive zzso has been derived from analyses of variable zzso a zzso and zzso zzso zzso upon zzso with zzso zzso zzso of variable intensity and zzso These analyses have led to definition and zzso of rate equations that describe the sequence of primary linear electron transfer zzso steps in zzso II zzso and of zzso electron transport zzso in zzso The model considers zzso in zzso reaction centers zzso associated with the zzso of the zzso and incorporates in a zzso state the presence of a zzso fraction of zzso zzso that probably is identical with the zzso zzso The zzso induction zzso zzso in the 10 zzso zzso time range considers a zzso zzso a zzso zzso and an zzso phase reflecting the response of the variable zzso to the electric zzso potential generated by the zzso pump zzso by zzso in zzso The zzso phase incorporates the zzso associated with the double reduction of the zzso pair of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and the associated doubling of the variable fluorescence, in agreement with the zzso zzso model zzso of zzso zzso The decline in zzso zzso during the so called zzso in the zzso zzso time range, known as the zzso curve, is shown to be associated with a substantial decrease of zzso zzso zzso from the zzso into the zzso zzso through the zzso of the zzso zzso
