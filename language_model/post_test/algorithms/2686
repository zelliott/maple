We examined zzso statistical properties of zzso zzso signals recorded from intrinsic hand muscles during zzso Our analysis showed that zzso zzso zzso of zzso signals is well described by the zzso distribution clearly distinguished from the zzso zzso zzso This finding indicates that zzso formation cannot be described by a conventional model where the signal is normally distributed because it is composed by zzso of many random zzso We found that the zzso of zzso parameters of zzso duration and response zzso also well described by a zzso zzso zzso the exact mechanism of zzso statistics remains an open question, the results obtained should significantly impact experimental research, theoretical modeling and zzso applications of motor zzso In particular, our results suggest that accounting for zzso distribution of zzso can improve zzso systems that strive to reproduce zzso signals in artificial zzso
