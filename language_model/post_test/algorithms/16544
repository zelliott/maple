The World Health Organization estimates that in sub-Saharan Africa about 4 million zzso patients had started zzso therapy zzso by the end of zzso Loss of patients to follow-up and care is an important problem for treatment zzso in this zzso As mortality is high in these patients compared to patients remaining in care, ART zzso with high rates of loss to follow-up may substantially underestimate mortality of all patients starting zzso 

We developed a zzso to correct mortality estimates for loss to zzso based on the fact that mortality of all patients starting ART in a treatment zzso is a weighted average of mortality among patients lost to follow-up and patients remaining in zzso The zzso gives a correction factor based on the percentage of patients lost to follow-up at a given point in time, and the estimated ratio of mortality between patients lost and not lost to zzso The mortality observed among patients retained in care is then multiplied by the correction factor to obtain an estimate of zzso mortality that takes all deaths into zzso A web calculator directly zzso the corrected, zzso mortality with zzso confidence intervals zzso We applied the method to 11 ART zzso in sub-Saharan zzso Patients retained in care had a mortality at 1 year of zzso to zzso loss to follow-up ranged from zzso to zzso and the correction factor from zzso to zzso The absolute difference between zzso and corrected mortality at 1 year ranged from zzso to zzso and was above zzso in four zzso The largest difference in mortality was in a zzso with zzso of patients lost to follow-up at 1 zzso 

The amount of bias in mortality estimates can be large in ART zzso with substantial loss to zzso zzso should routinely report mortality among patients retained in care and the proportion of patients zzso A simple zzso can then be used to estimate mortality among all patients who started zzso for a range of plausible mortality rates among patients lost to zzso
