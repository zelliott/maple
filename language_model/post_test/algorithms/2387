We consider the problem of interpreting zzso zzso models, such as the zzso zzso model, the zzso model, the stereotype model, and the zzso zzso We present a method to convert zzso zzso zzso into estimates of standardized fitted zzso probability differences and probability zzso We use a zzso approach to estimate standard zzso We then present a small simulation study to compare different zzso for setting confidence limits, and provide an illustration of our approach in an zzso study of drug therapy of zzso
