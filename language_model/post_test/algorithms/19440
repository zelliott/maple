zzso distinct fluorescent proteins zzso have been developed permitting the zzso of several proteins simultaneously in living zzso The zzso zzso of zzso in most cases, zzso making signal separation based on filter technology inefficient and in cases of zzso zzso zzso imaging can overcome these obstacles through a process called linear zzso Given a complex zzso composed of multiple zzso linear zzso can reduce the complex signal to its individual, zzso component zzso zzso imaging with zzso zzso allows the collection of zzso zzso zzso The accuracy of linear zzso under these conditions needs to be zzso 

zzso containing defined zzso of zzso and zzso were used to test the accuracy of linear zzso using spectral images obtained with zzso zzso 

Linear zzso can be accurate when wavelength and zzso reference zzso are provided to the zzso Linear zzso errors can occur due to zzso zzso laser contamination of zzso signals, zzso the presence of zzso zzso poor selection of zzso zzso and zzso failure to background subtract reference zzso 

Linear zzso when judiciously performed, can accurately measure the abundance of zzso and zzso in mixed samples, even when their relative zzso range from zzso
