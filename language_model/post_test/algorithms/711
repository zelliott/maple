A thorough evaluation of some of the most advanced zzso and scoring methods currently available is zzso and guidelines for the choice of an appropriate protocol for zzso and virtual screening are zzso The generation of a large and highly curated test set of zzso relevant zzso complexes with known binding affinities is zzso and three highly regarded zzso programs zzso zzso and zzso are evaluated on the same set with respect to their ability to reproduce zzso binding zzso Glide correctly identified the zzso pose within zzso A in zzso of the cases, versus zzso for GOLD and zzso for zzso In general Glide appears to perform most consistently with respect to diversity of binding sites and zzso flexibility, while the performance of ICM and GOLD is more binding zzso and it is significantly poorer when binding is predominantly driven by zzso zzso The results also show that energy zzso and zzso of the top N poses can be an effective means to overcome some of the limitations of a given zzso zzso The same zzso programs are evaluated in conjunction with three different scoring functions for their ability to discriminate zzso from zzso in virtual zzso The zzso performed on three different systems zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso confirms that the relative performance of different zzso and scoring methods is to some extent binding zzso zzso appears to be an effective scoring function for database zzso with consistent performance across several types of binding sites, while zzso appears to be most useful in zzso demanding sites since it is more forgiving of repulsive zzso Energy zzso of zzso poses can significantly improve the zzso in systems with zzso demanding binding zzso zzso Glide appears to be a safe general choice for zzso while the choice of the best scoring tool remains to a larger extent zzso and should be evaluated on a case-by-case zzso
