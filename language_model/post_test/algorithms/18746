Speech perception consists of a set of zzso that take continuously varying acoustic zzso as input and generate discrete representations that make contact with the zzso representations stored in long-term memory as zzso Because the zzso objects that are recognized by the speech perception enter into subsequent linguistic computation, the format that is used for zzso representation and processing fundamentally zzso the speech zzso zzso zzso theories of speech perception must, at some level, be tightly linked to theories of zzso zzso zzso speech perception must yield representations that smoothly and rapidly interface with stored zzso zzso zzso the perspective of zzso we argue and provide zzso and zzso evidence for the following research zzso First, at the zzso level, speech perception is a zzso resolution process, with zzso analyses occurring zzso on at least two time scales zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso commensurate with zzso and zzso zzso zzso Second, at the zzso level, we suggest that perception proceeds on the basis of internal forward models, or uses an zzso zzso Third, at the zzso level (in the sense of zzso the theory of zzso representation that we adopt is principally informed by zzso research and assumes that words are represented in the mental lexicon in terms of sequences of discrete segments composed of distinctive zzso One important goal of the research zzso is to develop linking hypotheses between putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and those zzso derived from linguistic inquiry, to arrive ultimately at a biologically sensible and theoretically satisfying model of representation and zzso in zzso
