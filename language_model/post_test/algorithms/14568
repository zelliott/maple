A grand challenge in the modeling of biological systems is the identification of key variables which can act as targets for zzso Good intervention targets are the zzso zzso in a system and have significant influence over other zzso in other words, in the context of diseases such as cancer, targeting these variables with treatments and interventions will provide the greatest effects because of their direct and indirect control over other parts of the zzso zzso networks are among the simplest of models, yet they have been shown to adequately model many of the complex dynamics of biological zzso Often ignored in the zzso network model, however, are the so called zzso of zzso As the zzso states alone have been shown to zzso to cellular zzso it is logical to ask which variables are most responsible for triggering a path through a basin to a particular zzso 

This work claims that logic zzso zzso classical circuit zzso of the collections of states in zzso network zzso of attraction reveals key players in the zzso Furthermore, we claim that the key players identified by this method are often excellent targets for intervention given a network modeling a biological system, and more importantly, that the key players identified are not apparent from the zzso states alone, from existing zzso network measures, or from other network zzso We demonstrate these claims with a well-studied zzso cell cycle network and with a zzso network for melanoma, zzso predicted from gene expression zzso
