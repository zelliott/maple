We conducted a zzso zzso evaluation of zzso testing by multiplex zzso in patients with known or suspected zzso tissue diseases zzso We evaluated agreement between multiplex zzso and zzso zzso zzso and assessed the diagnostic utility of zzso zzso 

zzso from zzso patients with suspected zzso seen in rheumatology clinics were collected zzso at 3 zzso care zzso zzso were established according to recognized zzso zzso Tests for zzso were obtained by multiplex zzso and by zzso The results of the multiplex zzso were analyzed using a previously validated zzso algorithm, zzso zzso zzso Support zzso that suggests possible disease associations based on the pattern of results for the zzso 

The median patient age was zzso years; zzso were zzso The most common diagnoses were zzso arthritis in 352 patients and systemic lupus zzso zzso in 332 zzso zzso between multiplex and zzso testing ranged from a high of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for zzso to a low of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for antinuclear zzso The zzso zzso suggested an appropriate disease association in zzso to zzso of patients with zzso The results varied depending on the disease and the zzso zzso 

These results suggest that patterns of zzso detected by multiplex zzso testing, when analyzed by an zzso algorithm, are useful in the evaluation of patients with zzso in situations of high disease zzso Further testing is necessary to determine its utility in settings of low disease zzso
