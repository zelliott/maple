An zzso correction method is developed to control simultaneously two zzso mirrors in a zzso zzso beam cleanup system, where the zzso aberrations could not be compensated by a single zzso zzso zzso parallel zzso decent zzso is chosen as the zzso zzso In this control method, different aberrations are assigned to each zzso mirror according to their different correction zzso The method is proved to be effective by zzso simulations as well as zzso Experimental results showed that the area containing zzso energy of the laser beam in the zzso can reach zzso times zzso zzso
