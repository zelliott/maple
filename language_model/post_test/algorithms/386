In this paper, the automated diagnostic systems trained on diverse and composite features were presented for detection of zzso changes in partial zzso zzso In practical applications of pattern recognition, there are often diverse features extracted from raw data that require zzso zzso of combining multiple zzso with diverse features are viewed as a general problem in various application areas of pattern zzso Two types zzso and partial zzso of zzso beats zzso records from each class) were obtained from the zzso zzso The zzso zzso neural network zzso combined neural network zzso mixture of experts zzso and modified mixture of experts zzso were tested and zzso for their performance on the zzso of the studied zzso signals, which were trained on diverse or composite zzso zzso making was performed in two zzso feature extraction by zzso methods and zzso using the zzso trained on the extracted zzso The present research demonstrated that the zzso trained on the diverse features achieved accuracy rates zzso zzso accuracy is zzso that were higher than that of the other automated diagnostic zzso
