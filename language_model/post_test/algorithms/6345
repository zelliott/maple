Since the discovery of gating zzso zzso have studied the movement of charged groups within channel proteins by changing potential and measuring the resulting zzso zzso The relation of zzso movements of charged groups to the gating current measured in an external circuit, however, is not zzso We report here that a general solution to this problem exists in the form of the zzso zzso For systems with different amounts of atomic detail, we use the zzso to calculate the gating charge produced by movements of protein zzso Even without calculation or zzso the zzso zzso eliminates a class of interpretations of experimental zzso The zzso may also be used at each time step of simulations to zzso external zzso
