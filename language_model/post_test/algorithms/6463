In the diagnosis of prostate cancer digital zzso examination and zzso ultrasound zzso are the most zzso methods for clinical zzso However, both methods are not able to differentiate between benign and zzso findings with a high amount of zzso Nevertheless, zzso is an excellent tool to guide zzso in practically any region of the zzso The most significant problem of visual zzso interpretation is the lack of zzso especially being an inexperienced zzso In order to enhance the diagnostic capabilities of zzso we developed a computerized analysis of the zzso signal information zzso which was validated by the zzso findings of radical zzso The question was asked: Can zzso detect cancer that has been missed by even multiple systematic zzso The entrance criteria was prior negative systematic random zzso regardless of number of biopsy sessions or number of individual biopsy zzso Five zzso zzso zzso were zzso to evaluate the information of the ultrasound zzso The most suspicious regions were marked by zzso and zzso by guiding a needle into that specific zzso In this study 132 with a history of zzso negative systematic random zzso zzso 12 zzso were evaluated by zzso The zzso ranged from zzso zzso with a median of zzso zzso zzso detected in 66 zzso of these 132 patients cancer by targeted zzso In zzso 66 men the median number of negative biopsy sessions were two and a median of 12 biopsy zzso had been zzso From the literature, we would expect a cancer detection rate in this group with systematic zzso zzso of about zzso Only five of the detected zzso showed a zzso zzso zzso of 5, were as 25 had a zzso of 6, 22 a zzso of 7 and 15 a zzso above zzso The results of this prospective clinical trail indicate that zzso is able to identify clinically significant zzso that were missed by even multiple systematic random zzso In addition, the concept of searching for strategies that zzso expertise and refinement of imaging zzso is supported rather than just zzso the number of random zzso zzso 141 zzso in one zzso
