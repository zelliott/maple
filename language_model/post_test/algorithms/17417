Using normal rats and rats with a chronic zzso injury of the zzso nerve zzso model of zzso we investigated the possibility of zzso by statistical tools, the zzso sequences of zzso zzso during different noxious and zzso zzso An analysis was made of both the distribution of the zzso intervals and the zzso density of spike trains, the latter being studied within the framework of zzso universal zzso to allow the identification of different random processes involved in the discharge zzso through the zzso index zzso The statistical analysis shows that the zzso based on the zzso index seems able to discriminate between different noxious stimuli zzso pinching and zzso both in normal and injured zzso Furthermore, comparing normal and injured animals, although the spontaneous zzso and zzso stimuli zzso evoked activities presented different zzso these seem to have the same zzso structure, while the corresponding statistics of the zzso intervals are quite zzso This information might be relevant to the understanding of a code of zzso firing and to the zzso of zzso patterns in acute and chronic noxious zzso
