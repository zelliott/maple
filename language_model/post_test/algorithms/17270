zzso and other zzso zzso zzso block and zzso the zzso zzso zzso To identify structural zzso of the zzso channel that mediate zzso actions, we generated zzso receptors with zzso zzso to zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in the selectivity filter of the zzso We demonstrate that zzso of the three critical zzso in this domain zzso affects block by zzso and both zzso and block by zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the N site of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in the N and N + 1 sites zzso and zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso reduced affinity for zzso The zzso zzso showed markedly reduced zzso by zzso with little or no change in zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed markedly reduced zzso zzso and affinity for zzso at its block zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors showed somewhat enhanced zzso block, while the zzso zzso double zzso exhibited significantly more enhanced zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso critical to zzso zzso and zzso block of zzso channels are also critical to block by zzso and zzso To examine the interaction of zzso and zzso within the channel, we performed competition zzso zzso appeared to compete with zzso for binding to the zzso however, blocks by zzso and by zzso were not zzso The findings suggest that zzso can bind to a site in the external zzso of the channel to impede zzso zzso but allow zzso zzso
