zzso principal component analysis zzso for the analysis and monitoring of batch processes has recently been zzso Although zzso has found wide applications in batch process monitoring, it assumes that future batches behave in the same way as those used for model zzso In this study, a new monitoring algorithm, zzso zzso zzso is zzso The method overcomes the problem of changing process conditions by updating the zzso structure zzso A historical set of operational data of a zzso batch process was divided into local blocks in such a way that the variables from one phase of a batch run could be blocked in the corresponding zzso This approach has significant benefits because the zzso variable structure can change for each phase during the batch zzso The zzso zzso model also allows for easier fault detection and isolation by looking at the relationship between blocks and at smaller meaningful block models, and it therefore helps in the diagnosis of the zzso The proposed zzso zzso monitoring method is successfully applied to a sequencing batch reactor for biological wastewater zzso
