A mathematical model is described for the simulation of peak profiles in zzso zone zzso taking wall zzso into zzso It is based on such zzso relations as mass balance zzso zzso rate equations and appropriate boundary zzso The zzso solution of the model is carried out, allowing the depiction of the concentration profile of the sample in the zzso as a result of the dynamics of the processes involved, which depend on a number of input zzso rate constants, zzso zzso column dimensions, field strength zzso Four cases are discussed in detail, namely those with either slow or fast zzso zzso and linear or zzso zzso
