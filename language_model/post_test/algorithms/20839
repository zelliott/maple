We have recently presented a decision support system for interpreting zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we wanted to evaluate the system in a separate hospital from where it was trained and to compare it with a zzso software zzso 

A completely automated method based on neural networks was trained for the interpretation of zzso regarding zzso zzso and zzso using zzso zzso from one zzso Features from each examination describing rest and stress zzso regional and global function were used as zzso to different neural zzso After the training session, the system was evaluated using zzso zzso from another zzso The test images were also processed with the zzso software package Emory zzso zzso zzso The images were interpreted by experienced clinicians at both the training and the test hospital, regarding the presence or absence of zzso zzso and/or zzso and these interpretations were used as gold zzso 

The neural network showed a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso for zzso zzso The specificity for the zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso measured at the same zzso The neural network sensitivity for zzso zzso was zzso and the specificity zzso The corresponding specificity for the zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A decision support system based on neural networks presents interpretations more similar to experienced clinicians compared to a conventional automated zzso software zzso This study shows the feasibility of zzso the expertise of experienced clinicians to less experienced physicians by the use of neural zzso
