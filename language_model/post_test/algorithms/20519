A general model for job shop scheduling is described which applies to static, dynamic and zzso production zzso Next, a zzso Algorithm is presented which zzso the job shop scheduling zzso This zzso is tested in a dynamic environment under different workload zzso zzso a highly efficient decoding procedure is proposed which strongly improves the quality of zzso Finally, this technique is tested for scheduling and zzso in a zzso zzso It is shown by experiment that conventional methods of production control are clearly outperformed at reasonable zzso zzso
