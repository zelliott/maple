Electronic structures of small peptides were calculated zzso zzso with the help of zzso zzso zzso zzso and molecular dynamics that rendered a set of zzso states of the zzso For the structures of these states it was possible to derive atomic polar zzso that allowed us to construct zzso zzso for each of the zzso states with low zzso From the zzso neural networks could be trained to distinguish between the various states and thus be able to generate a larger set of relevant structures and their relation to secondary structures of the zzso The calculations were done both with zzso atoms (up to ten water zzso and without, and hence the neural networks could be used to monitor the influence of the zzso on hydrogen bond zzso The calculations at this stage only involved very short zzso fragments of a few zzso zzso acids but already at this stage they could be compared with reasonable agreements to zzso The neural networks are shown to be good in distinguishing the different zzso of the small zzso zzso especially when in the gas zzso Also the task of predicting protein zzso defined from zzso seems zzso
