High content screening zzso has emerged an important tool for drug discovery because it combines rich zzso of cellular responses in a single zzso zzso of cell cycle analysis into zzso is essential to identify clinically suitable zzso drugs that disrupt the zzso zzso activity of zzso One challenge for integration of cell cycle analysis into zzso is that cells must be chemically synchronized to specific zzso adding experimental complexity to high content zzso To address this issue, we have developed a zzso method that zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso marker and works consistently in different experimental conditions and in zzso zzso Further, the performance of the zzso method is comparable to established machine learning approaches for zzso cell cycle data, indicating the zzso of the features we use in the zzso As such, we suggest the use of zzso analysis and its associated expressive features for integration into zzso zzso
