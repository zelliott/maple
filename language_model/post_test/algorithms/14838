This paper is devoted to the statistical analysis of a zzso model introduced in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A storage model with random release rate for zzso exposure to food zzso zzso zzso zzso 35 zzso zzso zzso zzso for describing the phenomenon of exposure to a certain food zzso In this zzso the zzso evolution of the contamination exposure is entirely determined by the zzso phenomenon due to successive dietary zzso and the zzso governing the elimination process zzso zzso in such a way that the exposure dynamic through time is described as a zzso deterministic zzso zzso Paths of the contamination exposure process are scarcely zzso in practice, therefore intensive computer simulation methods are crucial for zzso the zzso or zzso features of the zzso Here we consider simulation zzso based on consumption and contamination data and investigate how to construct accurate zzso confidence intervals zzso for certain quantities of considerable importance from the epidemiology zzso Special attention is also paid to the problem of computing the probability of certain rare events related to the exposure process path arising in dietary risk analysis using zzso splitting or importance sampling zzso zzso zzso of these statistical methods to a collection of data sets related to dietary zzso mercury contamination are discussed zzso
