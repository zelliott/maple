In clinical applications of magnetic zzso zzso for cancer treatment it is very important to ensure a maximum damage to the tumor while protecting the normal zzso The zzso heating pattern by the zzso distribution in tumor is closely related to the injection zzso In this study we develop an zzso zzso to zzso determine the optimum heating patterns induced by multiple zzso injections in tumor models with irregular zzso The injection site locations, zzso properties of tumor and zzso and local blood zzso rates are used as zzso to the zzso to determine the optimum parameters of the heat sources for all zzso injection zzso The design objective is to elevate the temperature of at least zzso of the tumor above 43 degrees C, and to ensure only less than zzso of the normal tissue is heated to temperatures of 43 degrees C or zzso The efficiency, flexibility and capability of this approach have been demonstrated in a case study of two tumors with simple or complicated zzso An extensive experimental database should be developed in the future to relate the zzso heating pattern parameters found in this study to their appropriate zzso zzso injection amount, and injection zzso We believe that the zzso zzso developed in this study can be used as a zzso for physicians to design an optimal treatment plan in magnetic zzso zzso
