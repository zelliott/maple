Current methodology and software for quantitative trait zzso zzso analyses do not use all available information and are inadequate to deal with the huge amount of zzso analyses to be needed in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We show that a mixed model statistical framework provides a very flexible tool for zzso modeling in a variety of zzso be it a cross between zzso lines, a within population study, or experiments involving a mixture of populations or zzso The software allows zzso and zzso zzso inclusion of zzso genetic value and a batch zzso option suitable for zzso zzso zzso It also allows massive association studies between single zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso 

A software zzso together with a manual and example files, is freely available for research zzso So far, the compiled program is available for zzso systems, the windows version will follow zzso See zzso
