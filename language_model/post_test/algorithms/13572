Modern applications of biological zzso such as zzso screening zzso zzso imaging, and zzso imaging may involve collection of thousands of images in every experiment making efficient zzso techniques zzso zzso zzso zzso when used with biological zzso provide only a moderate zzso ratio, while irreversible techniques obtain better ratios at the cost of removing some information from images and introducing zzso We construct a model of noise, which is a function of signal in the imaging zzso In the next step insignificant intensity levels are discarded using intensity zzso The zzso images, characterized by sparse intensity zzso are coded zzso We evaluate zzso efficiency of combined zzso coding and intensity zzso using single-channel zzso light zzso of several zzso zzso We apply local and global measures of intensity distribution to estimate maximum zzso introduced by the proposed zzso We demonstrate that the zzso provides efficient zzso and does not introduce significant changes to biological zzso The zzso preserves information content of these images and therefore offers better zzso than standard irreversible zzso method zzso
