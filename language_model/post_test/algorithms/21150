zzso zzso free zzso zzso accumulates signal from multiple echoes over several zzso yielding a strong sensitivity to diffusion with short zzso zzso and imaging zzso Although the zzso signal is well characterized for zzso zzso zzso it is unclear how the zzso signal zzso in zzso media such as brain zzso This article presents a more general zzso expression for the zzso signal which zzso zzso and zzso spin displacement probability density zzso This new framework for calculating the zzso signal is used to investigate signal behavior for a single zzso crossing zzso and reflective zzso zzso zzso in the corpus zzso of a fixed brain are shown to be in good agreement with theoretical zzso Further zzso in fixed brain tissue also demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso diffusion weighted spin echo in both zzso and zzso efficiency providing a compelling example of its potential to be used for high resolution diffusion zzso zzso
