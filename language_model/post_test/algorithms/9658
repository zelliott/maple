A partial zzso acquisition scheme has been widely adopted for fast zzso There are two problems associated with the existing zzso First, the majority of the existing techniques zzso the phase information and cannot provide improved phase information over zzso Second, serious artifacts can be observed in reconstruction when the phase changes rapidly because the zzso phase estimate in the image space is prone to zzso To tackle these two problems, a novel and robust method is introduced for partial zzso zzso using zzso zzso In this method, the phase information is implicitly estimated in zzso through data zzso the zzso phase information is applied to recover the zzso zzso data through zzso operation and zzso in zzso In both spin echo and zzso echo imaging experiments, the proposed method consistently produced images with the lowest error level when compared to zzso algorithm, projection onto convex zzso zzso algorithm, and zzso zzso zzso improvements are observed in images with rapid phase zzso Besides the improvement on zzso the phase map of the images reconstructed by the proposed method also has significantly lower error level than conventional zzso
