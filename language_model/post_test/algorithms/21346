Eight zzso and eight normal subjects underwent zzso oral zzso tolerance tests zzso and zzso clamp studies to assess the presence of peripheral and zzso insulin antagonism in zzso Although the mean total zzso area during the zzso was similar in the zzso patients and normal subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the mean insulin area was significantly elevated in the zzso group zzso zzso 136 zzso zzso zzso 122 zzso P less than zzso zzso zzso zzso production was measured during the second hour of a primed zzso zzso A zzso dose zzso clamp study with zzso and zzso zzso zzso was carried out during the next 6 zzso The insulin infusion rate was zzso zzso during the third, fourth, and fifth hours and zzso zzso during the zzso zzso and eighth zzso zzso zzso production and zzso zzso were measured during the final zzso h of each clamp zzso zzso zzso zzso were measured in the initial sample and in the last sample of each clamp zzso The mean equilibrium serum insulin zzso were similar in both groups during the final zzso h of the low (90 zzso 8 zzso 79 zzso 6 zzso and high zzso zzso 11 zzso zzso zzso 15 zzso insulin infusion zzso zzso serum zzso levels were significantly increased in the zzso patients zzso zzso 17 zzso zzso zzso 43 zzso P less than zzso but were suppressed equally in both groups at the end of both clamp zzso The zzso of insulin were similar in the zzso and normal subjects during the low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin infusion zzso zzso production was significantly increased in the zzso patients during the zzso state zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso and remained elevated during the final zzso h of the low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso and high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso insulin infusion zzso zzso insulin action, assessed by zzso sensitivity index, was significantly decreased in the zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso In conclusion, zzso is characterized by 1) zzso after oral zzso zzso 2) increased zzso zzso zzso production, 3) impairment of zzso suppression of zzso zzso production, and 4) antagonism to zzso peripheral zzso zzso
