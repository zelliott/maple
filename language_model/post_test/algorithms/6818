Assessment of protein zzso location is crucial to zzso efforts since zzso information provides a context for a zzso zzso structure, and zzso The work described below is the first to address the zzso zzso of proteins in a zzso comprehensive zzso 

Images for ten different zzso patterns (including all major zzso were collected using zzso zzso The patterns were described using a variety of zzso features, including zzso moments, zzso texture features, and a set of new features developed specifically for this zzso To test the usefulness of these features, they were used to train a neural network zzso The zzso was able to correctly recognize an average of zzso of previously unseen cells showing one of the ten zzso The same zzso was then used to recognize previously unseen sets of zzso prepared cells with zzso zzso 

zzso were implemented using the commercial products zzso zzso and zzso as well as some functions written in zzso The scripts and source code generated for this work are available at zzso
