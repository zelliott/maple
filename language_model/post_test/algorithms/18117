zzso zzso zzso calculations are reported on cage structured zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and low zzso zzso zzso including two zzso families of zzso and zzso zzso The structures and zzso are determined, and we observe that zzso clusters in particular show high stability with respect to the bulk zzso The cluster formation energy is demonstrated to include a constant term that we attribute to the zzso energy and the formation of six zzso zzso The zzso onion double-bubble structure was found to be particularly zzso In contrast, similar or greater stability was found for double and single shell cages for the other zzso The optical zzso zzso have been first zzso by the zzso zzso zzso energies for all compounds, after which we concentrated on zzso where we employed a recently developed Time zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso band gaps do not show a strong and consistent size dependency, in disagreement with the predictions of quantum confinement zzso The density of excited bound states and zzso spectrum have been calculated for four smallest zzso clusters within the first zzso potential zzso zzso The relative stability of different zzso clusters has been further explored by studying principal point defects and their complexes including zzso zzso bond zzso zzso vacancies, zzso and zzso The latter have the lowest energy of zzso
