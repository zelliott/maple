zzso functional sites are key targets for drug design and protein engineering, but their large-scale experimental characterization remains zzso The evolutionary trace zzso is a zzso approach to this problem that has been useful in a variety of case studies, but its zzso scale application is partially hindered because automated retrieval of input sequences from databases often includes some with errors that degrade functional site zzso To recognize and purge these zzso this study introduces a novel and zzso measure of zzso quality called rank information zzso It is shown that zzso decreases in response to errors in zzso zzso or functional zzso zzso an automated procedure to increase zzso by selectively removing sequences improves functional site identification so as to nearly match manually curated traces in zzso and in a test set of 79 diverse zzso Thus we conclude that zzso partially reflects the evolutionary consistency of zzso structure, and zzso In practice, as the size of the zzso continues to grow zzso it provides a novel and zzso measure of zzso quality that increases its accuracy for large-scale automated zzso of protein functional zzso
