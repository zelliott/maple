zzso a physical map of a zzso from a zzso library presents a central zzso problem in zzso Physical map reconstruction in the presence of errors is a problem of high zzso zzso Parallel zzso Carlo methods for a maximum likelihood zzso approach to physical map reconstruction are zzso The zzso procedure zzso zzso descent search for determining the optimal zzso between zzso for a given probe zzso The optimal probe ordering is determined using a simulated zzso Carlo zzso A two-tier zzso strategy is proposed wherein the zzso descent search is zzso at the lower level and the simulated zzso Carlo zzso is simultaneously zzso at the higher zzso Implementation and experimental results on a network of zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso
