The development and testing of a discrete model describing the dynamic process of tissue growth in three-dimensional scaffolds is zzso The model considers populations of cells that execute persistent random walks on the zzso grid, zzso and zzso until they reach zzso To isolate the effect of population dynamics on tissue growth, the model assumes that zzso and growth factor zzso remain constant in space and zzso zzso start either by distributing the seed cells zzso and randomly throughout the scaffold, or from an initial condition designed to simulate the migration and cell proliferation phase of wound zzso zzso with uniform seeding show that cell migration enhances tissue growth by zzso the adverse effects of contact zzso This beneficial effect, however, diminishes and disappears completely for large migration zzso By contrast, simulations with the zzso seeding mode show a continual enhancement of tissue zzso rates with increasing cell migration zzso We conclude that cell zzso parameters and the spatial distribution of seed cells can have profound effects on the dynamics of the process and, consequently, on the pattern and rates of tissue zzso These results can guide the design of experiments for testing the effectiveness of zzso modifications for stimulating tissue zzso
