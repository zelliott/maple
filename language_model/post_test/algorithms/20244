This paper's focus is the stability, zzso and rhythmic movements of a zzso zzso zzso The system is highly zzso in all its physical and zzso zzso The major zzso characteristics of this system are simultaneous zzso of a pair of zzso zzso zzso for control purposes, existence of zzso zzso sensors, and actions of gravity and zzso zzso delays are included in the zzso and zzso neural paths to account for a more accurate representation of the zzso zzso An zzso for zzso of the zzso forces and the feedback signals in the system is zzso It automatically renders positive forces and positive neural zzso The zzso of the forces represents the zzso character of muscular forces, zzso natural muscles can only pull in the direction of zzso The zzso of the neural signals implies these signals can zzso to firing zzso The stability of the system is zzso The role of the zzso in the zzso zzso and feedback signals, and the delays in the feedback zzso in zzso the system, and the consequently zzso zzso are studied by zzso The system is designed to perform stable zzso zzso The effects of the zzso of the input signals, gain of the feedback zzso and the duration of delays in generating zzso zzso zzso at the end of the movement are studied and demonstrated by digital computer zzso
