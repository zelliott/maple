zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso has been successfully employed to extract information about brain tumor zzso such as cell membrane breakdown, cellular zzso and zzso integrity, through its ability to differentiate signals coming from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The additional presence of lipids within zzso of the tumor may indicate cellular membrane breakdown due to cell zzso Another potential source of lipids is subcutaneous fat, which may be excited with zzso zzso zzso volume selection and zzso into the spectral field of view zzso due to the chemical shift artifact and the low bandwidth of the selection zzso The purpose of our study was to employ a zzso method for zzso zzso zzso originating from zzso subcutaneous lipids from the zzso zzso of zzso at zzso using an zzso zzso zzso and sensitivity zzso zzso
