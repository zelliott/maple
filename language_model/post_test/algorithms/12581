Spanish zzso Network zzso includes 22 research groups implied in the biological analysis of the air from 50 observation sites extended over the zzso Peninsula and zzso zzso To offer zzso information for zzso zzso zzso doctors and health authorities is one of zzso zzso One of our objectives is the study of the influence of meteorological variations on the quantity and occurrence of zzso in the zzso Nevertheless, to include only weather parameters is not enough for build accurate zzso Field zzso data, vegetation land cover, topography data and previous zzso data should be included in the zzso Meteorological conditions control the start, zzso intensity and end of the zzso season, but their effect depends on the different types of zzso The biological response of tree zzso is highly differentiated from the zzso zzso Another important point is the adaptation of a given species zzso to different zzso zzso We showed the different zzso variables determining tree flowering in the Mediterranean climate areas and in the Atlantic climate ones of the zzso Peninsula, and the consequences on the development of our forecasting zzso Finally we comment our more recent studies that use zzso zzso as a tool for including all the cited parameters and also space variables as zzso latitude and orientation to zzso
