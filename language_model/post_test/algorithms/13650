zzso zzso interactions play most important and vital role in maintaining the normal zzso functioning of the cell, as it controls many high zzso cellular zzso zzso study of the nature of these interactions has paved the way for understanding the mechanisms behind the biological processes in which they are zzso Earlier in 2000, a systematic zzso of zzso complexes based on the structural analysis of the proteins was proposed at two zzso namely groups and zzso With the advancement in the number and resolution of structures of zzso complexes deposited in the zzso Data Bank, it is important to revisit the existing zzso 

On the basis of the sequence analysis of DNA binding zzso we have built upon the protein zzso two-tier zzso of zzso complexes by adding new members to existing families and making new families and zzso While zzso the new complexes, we also zzso the emergence of new groups and zzso The new group observed was where zzso was seen to interact with zzso There were 34 zzso folds which were observed to be present in the complexes of both old and new zzso whereas 28 folds are present exclusively in the new zzso Some new families noticed were zzso zzso factor, zzso DNA binding zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso zzso zzso zzso binding protein zzso 

Our results suggest that with the increasing number of availability of zzso complexes in zzso Data Bank, the number of families in the zzso increased by approximately three zzso The folds present exclusively in newly classified complexes is suggestive of inclusion of proteins with new function in new zzso the most populated of which are the folds responsible for DNA damage zzso The proposed zzso zzso can be used to perform zzso surveys in the zzso of interest for the presence of zzso zzso Further analysis of these complexes can aid in developing zzso for identifying zzso proteins and their family members from mere sequence zzso
