The present work demonstrates a genetic zzso approach to zzso the effective material parameters of an acoustic zzso The target device is an acoustic zzso index zzso lens in air, which zzso possesses a zzso index of zzso minimized frequency dependence of the material properties, and minimized acoustic zzso zzso zzso this zzso results in complex designs with certain common features, and effective material properties that are better than those present in previous zzso After zzso the zzso unit cell designs to make them suitable for zzso a two-dimensional lens was built and zzso zzso Its performance was in good agreement with zzso Overall, the zzso approach was able to improve the zzso index but at the cost of increased frequency zzso The optimal solutions found by the zzso provide a zzso description of how the material parameters compete with one another and thus describes the level of performance achievable in the zzso zzso
