zzso zzso are commonly used as pharmacological tools and are a popular source of novel compounds with therapeutic and zzso zzso Since zzso peptides are inherently toxic, the host zzso must employ strategies to avoid adverse effects prior to zzso zzso It is partly for this reason that most zzso toxins zzso a protective zzso that upon zzso zzso is excised from the mature zzso In order to identify the mature toxin sequence directly from toxin zzso without resorting to protein sequencing, the zzso zzso site in the toxin precursor must be predicted zzso We evaluated different machine learning strategies zzso zzso machines, hidden zzso model and decision zzso and developed an zzso zzso for prediction of zzso zzso sites in zzso zzso Our strategy uses a support zzso machine zzso framework that combines both local and global sequence zzso Our method is superior or comparable to current tools for prediction of zzso sequences in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso method on an independent test set of known toxin sequences yielded zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso Furthermore, we zzso five novel peptides (not used to train the final zzso from the zzso of the Australian zzso zzso zzso to test the accuracy of the predictor and found zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso zzso Finally, we used the predictor together with zzso information to predict and characterize seven groups of novel toxins from the deeply zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso which revealed structural complexity and innovations in the evolution of the zzso The precursor prediction tool zzso is freely available on zzso zzso a web portal to a comprehensive zzso database of zzso zzso All training data, test data, and scripts used are available from the zzso zzso
