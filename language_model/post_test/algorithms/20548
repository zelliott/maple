The relationship between a zzso zzso and a failure time process can be assessed using the Cox zzso hazards zzso zzso We consider the problem of zzso the parameters in the Cox model when the zzso zzso is measured infrequently and with measurement zzso We assume a repeated measures random effects model for the zzso zzso Estimates of the parameters are obtained by maximizing the joint likelihood for the zzso process and the failure time zzso This approach uses the available information zzso because we use both the zzso and survival data zzso zzso are estimated using the zzso zzso We argue that such a method is superior to zzso methods where one zzso the partial likelihood of the Cox model using the observed zzso zzso It also improves on zzso methods where, in the first stage, empirical zzso estimates of the zzso process are zzso and then used as zzso zzso in a second stage to find the parameters in the Cox model that maximize the partial zzso
