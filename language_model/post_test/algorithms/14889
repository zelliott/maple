zzso of functional sites remains a key event in the course of zzso DNA zzso It is well known that a number of sites have their own specific zzso zzso This zzso the fact that the preference of the zzso zzso combinations at adjacent positions within an analyzed functional site could be zzso for this site zzso zzso zzso resources describing the zzso zzso content of the functional DNA sites and applying the above approach for site recognition are zzso However, they have been poorly developed up to zzso 

To describe the specific zzso content of the functional DNA sites, we introduce the zzso zzso out of which the frequency zzso for a given site could be constructed in addition to a traditional zzso frequency zzso Thus, site recognition accuracy zzso This approach was implemented in the activated zzso database accumulating zzso frequency zzso of the functional DNA zzso We have demonstrated that the zzso error of the functional site recognition decreases if the zzso frequency zzso are added to the zzso frequency zzso commonly zzso 

The zzso database is available on the Web, zzso and the mirror site, zzso zzso
