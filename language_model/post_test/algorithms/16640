Monitoring the effect of zzso drugs on the neural system is a major ongoing challenge for zzso During the past few years, several electroencephalogram zzso methods such as the response zzso zzso as implemented in the zzso zzso zzso have been zzso In this paper, sample zzso is used to zzso the predictability of zzso series, which could provide an index to show the effect of zzso zzso The zzso relation of sample zzso is compared with that of zzso 

zzso data from 21 subjects is collected during the induction of general zzso with zzso The sample zzso is applied to the zzso zzso zzso modeling and prediction probability statistic are used to evaluate the efficiency of sample zzso in comparison with zzso 

Both methods track the gross changes in zzso especially the occurrence of zzso pattern at high doses of zzso However, our method produces faster reaction to zzso in zzso during the induction of zzso as indicated from the zzso and zzso modeled parameters and analysis around the point of loss of zzso Also, sample zzso correlated more closely with zzso zzso concentration than the zzso In addition, our proposed method exhibits greater resistance to noise in the zzso zzso 

The results demonstrate that sample zzso can estimate the zzso drug effect on the zzso more effectively than the commercial zzso index with a stronger noise zzso
