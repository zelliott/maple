It has been proposed that a secure key distribution scheme using correlated random bit sequences can be implemented using common zzso induced synchronization of semiconductor laser zzso In this scheme it is necessary to use laser systems consisting of multiple zzso zzso to be secure against a powerful zzso In this paper, we report the results of an experimental study that demonstrate that the common zzso induced synchronization is possible in zzso semiconductor laser zzso We also show that the correlated random bit sequences generated in the synchronized zzso laser systems can be used to create an zzso secure key between two legitimate zzso
