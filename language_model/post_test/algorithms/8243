The study of zzso long-term correlations in zzso signals is a central topic for advanced neural signal zzso In particular, the existence of long-term correlations in neural signals recorded via zzso array zzso could provide interesting information about changes in zzso zzso In this study we propose a new method for long-term correlation analysis of zzso burst activity based on the zzso alpha slope zzso of the zzso zzso We applied our method to recordings taken from cultured networks of zzso rat cortical zzso We show the effectiveness of the method in analyzing the activity changes as well as the zzso dynamics that take place during the development of such zzso zzso demonstrate that the alpha zzso is able to divide the network development in three zzso zzso showing pronounced variations in the long-term correlation among zzso
