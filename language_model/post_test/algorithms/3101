zzso zzso zzso density functional theory is applied to explore the spin zzso dependence of linear and zzso optical zzso An zzso neutral zzso system, the zzso radical in the zzso zzso quartet zzso and zzso zzso states, is chosen as a model system to illustrate various aspects of the zzso It is found that irrespective of the zzso functional zzso the components of the zzso zzso and first zzso zzso zzso show very different dependency with respect to the zzso with an increasing trend for higher spin zzso This is rationalized by the decrease in zzso and stability of the system with increasing zzso and by the way the interaction between zzso electrons and the external field is zzso by remaining electrons of the zzso The study suggests the zzso of zzso systems for zzso zzso optical properties and for the possibility of spin control for such zzso
