Ward's method is extensively used for zzso chemical structures represented by zzso zzso This paper compares Ward zzso of 14 zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso with those obtained using the zzso zzso method, a zzso of Ward's zzso The clusters resulting from these two methods were evaluated by the extent to which the various zzso were able to group active molecules together, using a novel criterion of zzso zzso Analysis of a total of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso methods, 14 different zzso 5 different fingerprints and 10 different distance zzso demonstrated the general superiority of the zzso zzso The distance zzso first described by zzso performed extremely well in these experiments, and this was also the case when it was used in simulated virtual screening zzso
