zzso is a zzso imaging zzso which has been proved to be a potential evaluation tool to detect the tissue zzso Conventional method for zzso is to estimate the displacement based on zzso technique zzso then strain profile is calculated as the zzso of the zzso The main problem of this method arises from the fact that the zzso between zzso and zzso signals will be decreased because of the zzso zzso It may zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso as an efficient tool to estimate the zzso deformation in image zzso has its potential to achieve the zzso This paper incorporates the idea of image registration into zzso and proposes a radio frequency zzso signal registration strain zzso based on the zzso of a cost function using zzso zzso method with Powell zzso zzso To evaluate the proposed zzso the simulation data with a hard inclusion embedded in the homogeneous background is produced for zzso zzso can obtain the displacement profiles and strain profiles zzso When compared with the zzso based method, zzso presents better zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso normal strain zzso The in zzso experiment of zzso liver with zzso zzso is also zzso The statistic results of zzso and zzso indicate that strain profiles by zzso performs better zzso and target zzso than that by zzso based zzso Though zzso carry a heavier zzso burden than zzso based method, it may be an useful method to obtain zzso strains in zzso
