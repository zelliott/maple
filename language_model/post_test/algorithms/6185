The zzso of few tissue samples on a very large number of genes represents a zzso problem in statistics but a usual one in zzso expression data zzso In fact, the dimension of the feature space (the number of zzso is typically much greater than the number of zzso We consider zzso zzso zzso data, where the expression level is associated to an zzso zzso which represents a qualitative indication of whether or not a transcript is detected within a zzso The zzso zzso is generally not taken in consideration in zzso 

In contrast to frequently used cluster analysis methods to analyze gene expression data, we consider a problem of zzso of zzso and of the variables zzso We adopted zzso formulated by zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso for simultaneous zzso reduction of genes and zzso of zzso trying to identify genes zzso zzso that are able to distinguish between two known different classes of tissue zzso In this respect, we propose a zzso of the approach proposed by zzso et zzso by advising to estimate the distribution of log zzso statistic for testing one versus two component hypothesis in the mixture model for each gene considered individually, using a zzso zzso zzso We compare conditional (on zzso zzso and unconditional analyses performed on zzso described in zzso et zzso We show that the proposed techniques improve the results of zzso of tissue samples with respect to known results on the same benchmark zzso 

The software of zzso and zzso is written in zzso and available in zzso of Factor zzso on zzso while the software of zzso and zzso is available upon request from the zzso
