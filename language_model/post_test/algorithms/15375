We propose a new framework for designing test and query functions for complex structures that vary across a given zzso such as genetic marker zzso The operations we are interested in include equality testing, set operations, zzso unique states, zzso zzso or finding zzso classes under zzso zzso A motivating application is locating zzso classes in zzso zzso zzso which are graph structures in pedigree analysis that change over genetic marker zzso The zzso of these zzso are zzso and identified only by their connecting edges, a constraint easily handled by our zzso The general framework introduced is powerful enough to build a range of testing functions for zzso zzso dynamic zzso and other structures using a minimal set of zzso The theoretical and zzso properties of our approach are analyzed and zzso zzso results on several simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our zzso
