Alternative transcript diversity zzso itself as a prime cause of complexity in higher zzso Recently, transcript diversity studies have suggested that zzso of human genes are alternatively zzso We have used a zzso pattern approach for the zzso analysis of Alternative zzso zzso in chicken, human and zzso zzso involved in zzso are subdivided into distinct and zzso zzso based on the prevalence of the zzso across the zzso Four possible permutations of these two different groups of zzso were zzso as class I zzso class II zzso class III zzso and class IV zzso This zzso zzso the variation in transcript diversity in the three zzso 

In all, zzso chicken AS genes have been compared with zzso human and zzso mouse AS zzso with zzso of chicken genes being alternatively zzso compared to zzso in humans and 57% in zzso To minimize any gene structure bias in the input data, comparative zzso analysis has been carried out on the zzso subset of AS genes for the three zzso zzso analysis suggested that chicken genes show fewer AS events compared to human and zzso An zzso analysis showed that the percentage of AS events in chicken is similar to that of human, which implies that a smaller number of chicken genes show greater transcript zzso Overall, chicken genes were found to have fewer transcripts per gene and shorter zzso than human and mouse zzso 

In chicken, the majority of genes generate only two or three zzso compared to almost eight in human and six in zzso We observed that zzso definition is expressed strongly when compared to zzso definition for chicken zzso based on zzso zzso retention in chicken, compared to zzso in human and zzso zzso patterns with zzso zzso account for zzso of AS chicken zzso genes compared to zzso in human and zzso in zzso providing a novel measure to describe the zzso complexity due to alternative transcript zzso
