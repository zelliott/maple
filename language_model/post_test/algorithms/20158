Spinal zzso causes sympathetic blockade which leads to changes in the local temperature of the skin surface due to zzso 

These changes in skin temperature were used in a newly developed method for zzso the level of zzso A total of 11 patients who were scheduled for surgical procedures of the lower zzso with symmetrical spinal zzso were included in the clinical zzso By means of an electronic digital zzso body temperature measurement device with eight high precision temperature sensors placed on defined zzso patient skin temperature was continuously measured at 2 s intervals and documented before, during and for 45 zzso after spinal zzso zzso a neurological zzso test was carried on at regular intervals every 2 zzso on the defined zzso to calculate the correlation between the effects of analgesia and corresponding changes in skin zzso 

The analyzed correlations showed that there is a minimum of zzso temperature difference before and after spinal zzso especially on the lower zzso zzso knee, zzso of patient zzso The collected data of varying temperature differences were systematically evaluated using statistical software which led to a deeper understanding of the zzso between temperature differences at different zzso These zzso of temperature differences were used to develop a systematic analgesia level measurement zzso The zzso zzso the skin temperature differences at specified zzso to find the accurate level of analgesia and also to find the forward and reverse zzso of zzso The developed mathematical method shows that it is possible to predict the level of analgesia up to an accuracy of zzso after spinal zzso 

zzso it can be concluded that systematic processing of skin temperature data, collected at defined zzso can be used as a promising zzso for predicting surgical zzso The objective is to improve this experimental method with an extended patient population zzso
