The zzso transform is a powerful technique in signal processing and image analysis and it is shown here that zzso analysis of zzso zzso maps has the potential to increase their zzso Like zzso analysis, zzso analysis expresses the image zzso zzso in terms of a set of zzso zzso In the case of the zzso zzso these functions are zzso and zzso and each one contributes to the whole of the zzso In contrast, the zzso functions zzso called zzso can be quite localized and may only contribute to a small part of the zzso This gives control over the amount of detail added to the map as the resolution zzso The mathematical details are outlined and an zzso which achieves a resolution increase from 10 to 7 A using a knowledge of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the observed structure zzso is zzso These zzso are calculated from the electron density of known structures, but it seems likely that the zzso can be predicted, just as zzso zzso are at high zzso The results show that the zzso zzso contain the information necessary to increase the resolution of zzso zzso
