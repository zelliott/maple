Being able to detect reliably functional activity in a population of subjects is crucial in human brain zzso both for the understanding of cognitive functions in normal subjects and for the analysis of patient zzso The usual approach proceeds by zzso brain volumes to a common three-dimensional zzso However, a large part of the data acquired in zzso aims at zzso cortical activity, and methods working on the cortical surface may provide better zzso registration than the standard procedures that process the data in the zzso Nevertheless, few assessments of the performance of zzso zzso versus zzso zzso procedures have been shown so far, mostly because zzso cortical surface maps are not easily zzso In this paper we present a systematic comparison of zzso versus zzso zzso zzso procedures, by using zzso and zzso statistics assessed by zzso in random effects zzso and zzso analyses zzso We consider different schemes to perform meaningful comparisons between zzso statistical maps in the volume and on the cortical zzso We find that zzso zzso statistical analyses are generally more sensitive than their zzso counterpart, in the sense that they detect slightly denser networks of regions when performing zzso zzso this effect is less clear for zzso zzso and is reduced by zzso zzso zzso also increases the reliability of the zzso zzso
