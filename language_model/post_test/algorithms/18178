The ultimate product of an zzso experiment is often a decision on which biological hypothesis or model best explains the observed zzso We outline a paradigm designed for comparison of different models, which we refer to as spike train zzso A key ingredient of this paradigm is a prediction quality valuation that estimates how close a predicted conditional intensity function is to an actual observed spike zzso Although a valuation based on log likelihood zzso is most natural, it has various complications in this zzso We propose that a zzso valuation zzso can be used as an alternative to zzso Q shares some important theoretical properties with zzso including consistency, and the two valuations perform similarly on simulated and experimental zzso Moreover, Q is more robust than zzso and zzso with Q can dramatically improve zzso zzso We illustrate the utility of Q for comparing models of peer zzso where it can be zzso directly from zzso Although Q does not have a straightforward zzso zzso Q is essentially given by zzso zzso
