As the rate of functional zzso sequence discovery zzso zzso techniques for reliable structural determination are becoming crucial for revealing the essential features of these zzso in a timely zzso zzso predictions of zzso secondary structure quickly generate reasonable models but suffer from several zzso including overly simplified models and incomplete knowledge of significant zzso Similar problems limit the accuracy of predictions for other zzso zzso including DNA and zzso zzso acid zzso The work presented here demonstrates that incorporating zzso data from simple nuclear magnetic resonance zzso experiments into a dynamic folding zzso greatly reduces the potential folding space of a given zzso and therefore increases the confidence and accuracy of zzso This procedure has been packaged into an zzso prediction of secondary structure zzso zzso that can produce zzso as well as zzso secondary zzso The method reveals a probable zzso in the part of the coding region of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso that zzso zzso DNA zzso during zzso into the zzso
