To determine whether computer-based analysis can detect features zzso of zzso zzso development in zzso normal zzso 

A systematic zzso image analysis method weighted neighbor distances using a compound hierarchy of zzso representing zzso zzso was used to analyze pairs of zzso knee zzso zzso zzso were all scored as normal zzso zzso grade 0, and on follow-up approximately 20 years later either developed zzso zzso as zzso zzso or remained zzso 

The zzso method predicted whether a knee would change from zzso grade 0 to grade 3 with zzso accuracy zzso and to grade 2 with zzso accuracy zzso Although a large part of the zzso signal comes from the image tiles that contained the joint, the region adjacent to the zzso spines provided the strongest zzso zzso 

zzso features zzso using a zzso image analysis method can predict the future development of zzso knee zzso
