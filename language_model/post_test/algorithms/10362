We are interested in detecting genetic zzso that influence transition between discrete stages of a disease progression process, such as the natural history of progression to cervical cancer with the following four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exposed, zzso persistent infection with zzso zzso zzso cervical zzso zzso grades 2 or 3 zzso and zzso cervical zzso Standard statistical tests derived from the zzso odds model or zzso zzso model can be used to study this type of zzso zzso But these methods are either too sensitive to the proportion odds assumption or fail to take advantage of the restriction on the zzso space for the genetic zzso Two alternative tests, the maximum score test zzso and the zzso zzso combination test zzso are proposed with the aim of striking a balance between efficiency and zzso A simulation study demonstrates that zzso and zzso have the most robust performance among all considered tests under various realistic zzso As a demonstration, we applied the considered tests to a genetic association study of cervical zzso
