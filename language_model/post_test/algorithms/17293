zzso a newly developed zzso system that zzso a genetic zzso for learning, was compared with zzso analysis, zzso regression, zzso cluster analysis, a zzso zzso generator and a random bit climber zzso zzso The methods were evaluated in the diagnosis of female urinary zzso in terms of prediction accuracy of zzso on the basis of patient zzso The best methods were zzso analysis, zzso regression, zzso and zzso Practically no statistically significant differences existed between the prediction accuracy of these zzso zzso We consider that zzso systems zzso and zzso are preferable for automatic construction of medical decision zzso because they can cope with missing data values directly and can present a zzso in a comprehensible zzso zzso performed nearly as well as zzso The results are in agreement with the results of earlier research, indicating that genetic zzso are a competitive method for constructing zzso from medical zzso
