This paper presents a novel system for image matching in optical zzso The proposed zzso system approaches the challenge of matching images in a complex scene by incorporating multiple zzso and a decision zzso zzso are presented for Crohn's disease zzso matching in capsule zzso with a zzso consisting of five independent zzso We compare the performance of six different types of decision zzso zzso show that the zzso of the zzso system containing all five zzso is zzso greater than the performance of using the best zzso only, with a maximum zzso of zzso The zzso of the method is validated using simulated data generated by controlled zzso of the zzso We also demonstrate how the addition of simulated data to the training set can be used to augment the performance of the zzso by up to zzso
