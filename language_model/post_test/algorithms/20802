We have developed an independent zzso for the prediction of electronic portal imaging device zzso zzso The zzso uses a set of images zzso zzso closed zzso zzso zzso various fence and modified sweeping gap zzso to separately characterize the primary and zzso contributions to zzso zzso It also characterizes the relevant zzso properties of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scatter zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tongue and groove zzso Lorenz et zzso zzso zzso zzso 52, zzso zzso The primary radiation is modeled with a single zzso distribution defined at the target position, while the zzso radiation is modeled with a triple zzso distribution defined downstream of the zzso The distances between the target and the zzso source, zzso and zzso are model zzso The scatter associated with the zzso is implicit in the zzso Open beam images are predicted to within zzso of the maximum value across the zzso Other zzso test patterns and zzso radiation therapy zzso are predicted to within zzso of the maximum zzso The presented method was applied to the zzso zzso zzso but is designed to work with any zzso detector with sufficient spatial zzso
