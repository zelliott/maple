We evaluated the X-ray digital linear zzso reconstruction processing method for metal artifact zzso A zzso X-ray digital linear zzso instrument was used to image a hip zzso zzso caused by zzso features in hip zzso were observed in digital linear zzso reconstruction due to the few projections and narrow angular range typically employed in zzso zzso We developed artifact reduction methods based on a modified zzso and Logan reconstruction filter kernel realized by taking into account additional weighing by direct current zzso components in frequency domain zzso zzso leads to an increase in the ratio of zzso components in an zzso The effectiveness of the method in enhancing the visibility of a prosthetic case was zzso in terms of removal of zzso zzso The potential of artifact reduction processing for digital linear zzso in the evaluation of hip zzso was zzso A modified zzso and Logan reconstruction filter kernel causes artifact reduction and improved the quality of images affected by metal zzso Future investigations will study the ability of digital linear zzso to zzso the spatial relationship between the metallic components of these devices as well as the ability of the technique to identify zzso changes of diagnostic zzso
