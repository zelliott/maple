The automation of zzso of zzso structures in the brain is an active research zzso We have zzso evaluated four novel methods of fully automated zzso of zzso structures using zzso spatial overlap and zzso zzso Two methods are zzso - zzso fusion and zzso zzso and zzso zzso using a brain zzso zzso and two incorporate statistical models of shape and appearance - profile active appearance models zzso and zzso appearance models zzso Each method was applied to the zzso of 18 zzso structures in zzso subjects from a diverse pool varying in age, disease, sex and image acquisition zzso Our results showed that all four methods perform on par with recently published zzso zzso performed better than the others according to all three classes of zzso In summary over all structures, the ranking by the zzso zzso was zzso zzso joint zzso and zzso The zzso distance ranked the methods as zzso joint zzso and zzso zzso whilst percentage absolute zzso difference ranked them as joint zzso and zzso joint zzso and zzso Furthermore, as we had four methods of performing zzso we investigated whether the results obtained by each method were more similar to each other than to the manual zzso using zzso zzso zzso the zzso Index was close to 1 for most subjects zzso zzso indicating better agreement of each method with the gold standard than with the other zzso However, zzso of cases zzso zzso and nucleus zzso had values outside 3 standard zzso of the zzso
