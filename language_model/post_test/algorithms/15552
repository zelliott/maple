zzso of unknown origin zzso is defined as a temperature higher than zzso degrees C on several occasions and lasting longer than 3 weeks, with a diagnosis that remains uncertain after 1 week of zzso 

A systematic review was performed to develop evidence-based recommendations for the diagnostic zzso of zzso zzso database was searched (January 1966 to December zzso to identify articles related to zzso Articles were included if the patient population met the criteria for zzso and they addressed the natural history, zzso or spectrum of disease or evaluated a diagnostic test in zzso The quality of retrieved articles was rated as zzso zzso or zzso and sensitivity, zzso and diagnostic yield of tests were zzso zzso were made in accordance with the strength of zzso 

The prevalence of zzso in hospitalized patients is reported to be zzso Eleven studies indicate that the spectrum of disease includes zzso zzso zzso infections zzso inflammatory diseases zzso and zzso zzso Deep vein zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the elderly zzso were important zzso Four good natural history studies indicate that most patients with zzso zzso recover spontaneously zzso One zzso study suggested a high specificity zzso for the diagnosis of zzso in zzso by applying the Duke zzso One zzso study showed that zzso zzso scanning of the abdomen had a diagnostic yield of zzso Ten studies of nuclear imaging revealed that zzso was the most promising zzso showing a high specificity zzso albeit low sensitivity zzso (2 zzso zzso Two zzso studies showed liver biopsy to have a high diagnostic yield zzso but with risk of harm zzso zzso zzso bone zzso cultures showed a low diagnostic yield of zzso to zzso (2 zzso zzso 

Diagnosis of zzso may be assisted by the Duke criteria for zzso zzso zzso scan of the abdomen, nuclear scanning with a zzso zzso and liver biopsy zzso to good zzso zzso bone zzso cultures are not zzso
