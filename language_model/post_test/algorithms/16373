During the development of automated zzso methods to detect minute compositional changes in fuels, it became apparent that peak selection through the spectral zzso of gas zzso zzso zzso data is limited by the complexity and noise levels inherent in the zzso Specifically, current techniques are not capable of detecting minute, chemically relevant compositional differences with sufficient zzso zzso an alternative peak selection strategy was developed based on spectral interpretation through zzso parallel factor analysis zzso It will be shown that this strategy zzso the zzso peak selection strategy as well as two control zzso zzso application of the zzso method to detect minute chemical changes produced during zzso growth in four different zzso diesel fuels will be zzso
