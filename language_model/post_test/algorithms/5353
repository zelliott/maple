zzso patterns have been found in various zzso zzso The zzso zzso release system in single cardiac cells is unique for highly discrete reaction zzso each giving rise to a zzso spark upon zzso We zzso the spiral zzso waves in isolated cardiac cells and zzso studied the effect of system zzso on spiral patterns using a two-dimensional zzso zzso We found that under certain conditions, the system was able to display multiple stable patterns of spiral waves, each exhibiting different periods and distinct routines of spiral zzso Transition between these different patterns could be triggered by an internal fluctuation in the form of a single zzso zzso
