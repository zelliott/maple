An zzso study to assess the value of a model for the automatic detection and characterization of heart rate zzso changes during zzso in severe zzso 

Heart rate changes were monitored in 10 patients with 104 seizures, mostly zzso and zzso to assess the value of various zzso for the detection of zzso based on heart zzso zzso monitoring served as the golden zzso Two zzso were zzso First, a zzso zzso was used to characterize the heart rate zzso A second zzso based on a moving median filter was developed for automatic detection of the heart rate change zzso For varying model parameters the sensitivity zzso and positive zzso values zzso were zzso 

Changes in heart rate were found in 8 of the 10 patients and 50 of 104 zzso zzso of heart rate changes could be zzso characterized and were found to be stereotype for each individual zzso Large differences of the zzso pattern were in some cases due to a zzso at seizure onset that was followed by a significant zzso zzso In two out of three patients with more than 10 zzso a zzso of at least 50% yielded a zzso above zzso 

Heart rate patterns can be accurately characterized with a new developed zzso zzso Heart rate changes can also be used for automatic detection of zzso in patients with severe zzso if the model parameters are chosen according to zzso characteristics of the zzso
