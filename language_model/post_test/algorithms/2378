zzso optical zzso is an imaging technique zzso spatial maps of zzso and scattering zzso are derived from the characteristics of multiply scattered light transmitted through the zzso The system described here used four zzso light sources and zzso of the intensity and phase zzso to each zzso at 16 or 20 detectors on the surface of a 10 zzso diameter zzso An zzso zzso zzso was used to estimate the zzso and scattering zzso at each zzso in a 17 zzso 17 array minimizing the difference between measured and calculated values of the intensity and phase at the measurement zzso Forward calculations of the intensity and phase were based on a zzso zzso solution of the frequency domain diffusion zzso zzso simulations were used to examine the resolution, contrast, and accuracy of the reconstructions as well as the effects of measurement noise, systematic uncertainties in zzso location, and accuracy of the initial estimates for the optical zzso Experimental tests also confirmed that the system could identify and locate both scattering and absorbing zzso in a zzso zzso
