A very simple strategy is proposed to extract carbon zzso information along with the classic knowledge of zzso zzso in zzso experiments without affecting the sensitivity ratios of the original pulse zzso These new zzso zzso experiments prove to be highly helpful for complete zzso and zzso resonance assignment and also for automated and easy spin system characterization of samples at natural zzso using a single zzso zzso
