Mechanical zzso of the cell under different modes of stress and deformation is essential to its survival and zzso Under tension, mechanical rigidity is provided by the zzso zzso with increasing stress, this network zzso providing increased resistance to zzso However, a cell must also resist zzso which will inevitably occur whenever cell volume is decreased during such biologically important processes as zzso and zzso Under zzso individual filaments can zzso thereby reducing the zzso and weakening the zzso zzso However, the zzso space is crowded with zzso and zzso that can resist zzso A simple picture describing their behavior is that of zzso zzso zzso exhibit a sharp increase in zzso with increasing volume zzso ultimately undergoing a glass transition and becoming a zzso We investigate the consequences of these 2 competing effects and show that as a cell is compressed by zzso stress it becomes progressively more zzso Although this stiffening behavior depends somewhat on cell type, starting conditions, molecular motors, and zzso contributions, its dependence on solid volume fraction is exponential in every zzso This universal behavior suggests that zzso weakening of the network is overwhelmed by zzso stiffening of the zzso We also show that zzso dramatically slows zzso relaxation zzso The increase in zzso combined with the slowing of relaxation zzso is reminiscent of a glass transition of zzso suspensions, but only when comprised of zzso zzso Our work provides a means to probe the physical nature of the zzso under zzso and leads to results that are universal across cell zzso
