The zzso lung scan is evolving into an alternative diagnostic test for patients who cannot tolerate contrast zzso zzso zzso It is likely that this shift in patient population will result in a larger proportion of patients with abnormal chest zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether a computer based scan analysis could assist clinical interpretation in this zzso difficult zzso 

zzso zzso zzso images were obtained from 118 patients with normal chest zzso and 144 patients with abnormal zzso who underwent pulmonary zzso within 3 days of the zzso zzso zzso neural networks zzso were created using only objective zzso zzso to diagnose the presence of pulmonary zzso The ANN predictions were compared with clinical scan interpretations and with the results of zzso 

In both patients with normal and with abnormal chest zzso the ANN based method performed comparably to the clinical interpretation of zzso An average of the clinical and ANN estimates of the likelihood of embolism was more accurate than was either method zzso 

zzso zzso scan analysis performs comparably to clinical interpretation for patients with abnormal chest zzso The different zzso perspective of the digital method improves test performance when used in conjunction with standard clinical zzso This can improve the chances of reaching a diagnosis for patients who lack diagnostic alternatives to the zzso zzso
