Data mining is based on data files which usually contain errors in the form of missing zzso This paper focuses on a zzso framework for the development of an automated data zzso model based on artificial neural zzso Fifteen real and simulated data sets are exposed to a zzso experiment, based on the random generation of missing zzso These data set sizes range from 47 to zzso zzso A zzso experiment was performed for each data set where the probability of missing value was set to zzso Several zzso and learning zzso for the zzso zzso are tested and compared with three classic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The obtained results, considering different performance measures, not only suggest this approach improves the quality of a database with missing values, but also the best results are clearly obtained using the zzso zzso model in data sets with zzso zzso Three learning rules zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and a small number of hidden zzso are zzso
