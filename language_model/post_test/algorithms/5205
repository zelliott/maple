zzso walking has been found to diminish the statistical persistence intrinsic to the stride zzso time series of human zzso Since treadmill walking zzso possesses a similar form of external zzso we proposed to study the disruptions in the natural zzso rhythms of gait during zzso zzso walking is a widespread zzso zzso however, its effect on an zzso stride dynamics is not well zzso To better zzso potential effects, we tested the hypothesis that zzso without zzso would diminish the statistical persistence in an zzso stride zzso time zzso The zzso zzso zzso was employed in this study as a measure of the statistical persistence of the stride zzso time zzso Sixteen zzso young adults zzso age: zzso zzso were instructed to walk at a self-selected comfortable pace for 15 zzso in three different conditions in a zzso order: zzso zzso walking, zzso zzso without holding a zzso zzso and zzso zzso while holding a front zzso zzso The alpha did not differ significantly between the zzso and zzso conditions zzso However, the alpha of the Rail condition zzso differed significantly from both the zzso zzso zzso and zzso conditions zzso zzso In contrast, stride zzso zzso did not change between walking conditions zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso does not diminish the intrinsic stride dynamics of human zzso
