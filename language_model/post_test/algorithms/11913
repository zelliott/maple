zzso A zzso tissue distribution zzso was extensively studied after single zzso zzso and zzso zzso doses (via zzso zzso zzso to zzso Drug zzso in blood and various zzso were measured using a specific zzso Based on total blood concentration data alone, zzso systemic zzso appeared essentially zzso However, after taking the zzso zzso blood cell binding into account, multiple zzso factors were zzso zzso clearance at 30 zzso was about half the value at the two lower zzso zzso distribution was also zzso with evidence of zzso binding in many zzso In general, blood binding zzso zzso constant zzso zzso zzso 18 zzso occurred at a lower dose zzso than zzso of tissue binding zzso zzso zzso such that the volume of distribution at steady state first increased as the dose increased from zzso to 6 zzso and then decreased as the dose increased to 30 zzso zzso binding was further investigated by various zzso zzso Some zzso showed a zzso zzso zzso zzso plot of the tissue data at steady state, with high zzso zzso In other zzso zzso binding characteristics were observed with the zzso values of the zzso site in the same range as the zzso reported for the binding of zzso with zzso the putative zzso zzso tissue binding may therefore influence not only the zzso but also the efficacy of zzso
