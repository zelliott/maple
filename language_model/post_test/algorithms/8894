zzso sequencing technologies provide a powerful tool for studying zzso evolution during progression of advanced diseases such as zzso Although many recent studies have employed new sequencing technologies to detect zzso across zzso genetically related tumors, current methods do not exploit available zzso information to improve the accuracy of their zzso zzso Here, we present a novel zzso that uses zzso zzso variations zzso in zzso related tissue samples as lineage markers for zzso tree zzso Our method then zzso the zzso zzso to improve the accuracy of zzso zzso Experimental analyses demonstrate that our method achieves up to zzso improvement for zzso zzso calling of zzso related samples over the accuracy of zzso zzso zzso the state-of-the-art zzso zzso zzso
