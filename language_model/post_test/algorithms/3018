We present a novel approach for computing zzso interaction binding affinities based on a simple path integral solution of the zzso zzso zzso the free energy of zzso interactions can zzso zzso drug zzso Traditionally, the problem is seen through the lens of statistical zzso The zzso can zzso however, zzso long for the change in the free energy upon binding to be determined zzso In this work, we present a different approach based on a zzso kinetic zzso Inspired by Feynman's path integral zzso we extend the theory to classical interacting zzso The zzso is modeled as a zzso particle subjected to the effective zzso interaction potential of the zzso This allows the calculation of the relative binding affinities of interacting zzso in water to be zzso as a function of the zzso zzso and the zzso of the potential surface in the vicinity of the binding zzso The calculation is thus zzso zzso In test cases, the correlation zzso between actual and zzso free energies is zzso for accurate data zzso
