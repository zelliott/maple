In order to examine the pathology in patients with zzso sleep zzso syndrome zzso the zzso properties of respiratory movement and zzso variations during resting zzso with eyes closed was zzso Recording of the respiratory movement using zzso zzso was performed on 14 patients with zzso and 13 control subjects for 2 h in the zzso position during zzso To calculate the correlation dimension zzso for respiratory movement, an zzso proposed by zzso and zzso was zzso The zzso of zzso variations were zzso To calculate zzso and zzso variations, two different segments were selected zzso s zzso The value of zzso for respiratory movement in patients with zzso was significantly greater than that in control zzso In the case of zzso or zzso zzso of zzso for respiratory movement, the sensitivity and specificity of detecting the presence of zzso was zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of zzso variations, only the zzso of variation of zzso time for respiratory movement in patients with zzso was significantly greater than that in the control zzso In conclusion, the zzso of correlation dimensions for respiratory movement with a brief period during zzso may be a useful index for identifying patients with zzso sleep zzso zzso
