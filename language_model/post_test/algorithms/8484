zzso zzso zzso are zzso signals typically buried in relatively large background zzso To extract the zzso more effectively from noise, we had previously developed an approach using an zzso signal zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso requires a proper reference input signal for its optimal zzso zzso and moving zzso were formerly used with good zzso In this paper, we present a new method to provide even more effective reference zzso for the zzso Specifically, a zzso zzso basis function neural network zzso was used to zzso raw zzso signals before serving as the reference zzso Since the zzso has built-in zzso zzso functions that enable it to closely fit any function zzso the output of zzso can effectively track the signal variations of zzso zzso confirmed the superior performance of zzso with zzso over the previous zzso
