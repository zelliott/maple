zzso zzso zzso zzso is a recent imaging method that allows zzso zzso imaging through zzso and zzso Over the past 18 years, zzso has been successfully used in disease diagnosis, biomedical research, material zzso and many other zzso As zzso is a recent imaging method, until now surgeons have limited experience using zzso In addition, the number of images obtained from the imaging device is too large, so we need an automated method to analyze zzso We propose a novel method for automated zzso of zzso images based on local features and earth zzso distance zzso We evaluated our zzso using an zzso image set which contains two kinds of skin images, normal skin and zzso zzso Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which achieved zzso accuracy of zzso for an zzso scheme and zzso for an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso much higher than the previous zzso Our approach is especially suitable for zzso images and could be applied to a wide range of zzso zzso
