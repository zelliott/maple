Performance of the linear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the simple zzso index, and ST segment depression alone for the identification of zzso severe coronary obstruction was examined in relation to the definition of the extent of disease and the presence or absence of zzso during treadmill exercise using the Cornell protocol in zzso zzso zzso Whether severe disease was defined by zzso zzso by zzso scores zzso at 35 or at 48, or by Duke jeopardy scores exceeding 6, the zzso to zzso sensitivities of an zzso slope criterion of zzso zzso were each significantly higher than the corresponding zzso to zzso sensitivities of 150 zzso of ST segment depression closely matched zzso The zzso slope was significantly more sensitive than a simple zzso index criterion of zzso zzso for detection of high zzso scores, but despite consistently intermediate performance trends, in no case did sensitivity of the simple zzso index criterion significantly exceed that of ST depression zzso Each method performed better and with comparable sensitivity in patients not receiving zzso In contrast, the zzso to zzso sensitivities of the zzso slope for identification of severe disease were significantly higher than the zzso to zzso sensitivities of ST depression in patients taking zzso zzso however, simple heart rate adjustment using the zzso index had intermediate performance that in no case was significantly more sensitive than ST segment depression zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
