zzso zzso or family trees, are typically constructed by an expensive process of examining zzso records to determine which pairs of individuals are parent and zzso New methods to automate this process take as input genetic data from a set of extant individuals and reconstruct ancestral zzso There is a great need to evaluate the quality of these methods by comparing the estimated pedigree to the true zzso In this article, we consider two main pedigree comparison zzso The first is the pedigree zzso problem, for which we present a zzso zzso for zzso zzso The second is the pedigree edit distance problem, for which we present zzso several zzso that are fast and exact in various special cases, and zzso a general, zzso zzso zzso In the negative direction, we first prove that the pedigree zzso problem is as hard as the general graph zzso problem, and that the zzso zzso problem is zzso We then show that the pedigree edit distance problem is zzso in general and zzso on zzso zzso We use simulated zzso to compare our zzso zzso to each other as well as to a zzso zzso that always finds an optimal zzso
