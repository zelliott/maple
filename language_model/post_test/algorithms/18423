We have developed and evaluated a new optical motion capture approach that is suitable for a wide range of studies in zzso and motor zzso Based on the zzso search zzso of zzso zzso zzso it zzso a zzso body model that includes joint angle constraints to reconstruct posture from an arbitrary number of zzso Rather than tracking marker zzso in time, the zzso zzso an error function that compares predicted model projections to the recorded zzso Thus, each zzso is analyzed independently from other zzso enabling the system to recover from incorrectly analyzed zzso The system works with standard computer and video zzso Its accuracy is evaluated using videos of animated locust leg movements, recorded by two zzso zzso The resulting joint angle zzso errors range between zzso degrees and zzso degrees, limited by the zzso resolution of the digital zzso zzso reconstruction is possible even from a single zzso In a real experimental application, stick insect walking sequences are analyzed with leg joint angle zzso between zzso degrees and zzso zzso This robust and accurate performance is reached in spite of marker zzso and zzso simply by exploiting the natural constraints imposed by a zzso chain and a known experimental zzso
