We examined salt tolerance responsive genes in zzso under salt stress and analyze their potential zzso The zzso differential display was used to screen the transcript derived fragments zzso related to zzso tolerance in tolerant and moderately tolerant zzso zzso zzso primer combinations generated 101 differential zzso fragments, which were divided into 10 expression zzso Seven zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained and zzso were highly zzso to some known expression genes or the genes related to the signaling pathways in plants under different zzso zzso
