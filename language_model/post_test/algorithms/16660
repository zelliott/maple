The general organization of zzso connectivity in zzso monkey is relatively well zzso However, mounting evidence points to an organizing principle that involves clustered zzso at the level of individual zzso Several synaptic plasticity studies have reported cooperative interaction between neighboring zzso on a given zzso branch, which may potentially induce zzso zzso Additionally, theoretical models have predicted that such zzso is zzso in that it greatly enhances a zzso zzso zzso However, largely because of the lack of sufficient zzso data, the existence of clustered zzso in zzso on a global scale has never been zzso The majority of zzso zzso are found within zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that spine clusters do exist on zzso zzso by analyzing the three-dimensional locations of zzso spines on 280 zzso zzso branches in layer III of the zzso monkey prefrontal zzso By using zzso zzso and zzso Carlo simulations, we zzso the probability that the observed extent of zzso does not occur zzso This provides a measure that tests for spine zzso on a global scale, whenever high-resolution zzso data are zzso Here we demonstrate that spine clusters occur significantly more frequently than expected by pure chance and that spine zzso is concentrated in zzso terminal zzso These findings indicate that spine zzso is driven by systematic biological zzso We also found that zzso and zzso spines are zzso in clusters on zzso segments that display prolific zzso independently supporting a zzso link between spine zzso and synaptic zzso
