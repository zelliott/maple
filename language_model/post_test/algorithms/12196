A simple procedure has been introduced for calculating solid and liquid zzso of formation of zzso energetic zzso This model assumes that the heat of formation of a zzso compound of composition zzso can be expressed as a new correlation which depends on zzso composition and various structural and special functional group zzso zzso phase zzso of formation predicted using the method described zzso and complicated quantum mechanical zzso zzso Rice, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (2002) zzso have a root mean square zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso for 19 well-known organic zzso zzso zzso zzso of formation for 29 zzso zzso energetic compounds have a zzso zzso from experiment of zzso zzso The results show that the present method gives comparable prediction respect to the other methods such as complex quantum mechanical zzso
