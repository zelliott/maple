The use of zzso analyses for characterizing zzso optical zzso systems is studied here, and the simple model of the zzso zzso as an isolated imaging element is shown to be defective in certain zzso These defects arise due to neglected interactions between the zzso and the zzso varying shadow masks that are normally used as scattering objects for imaging, and which are held in zzso proximity to the zzso An extended model is proposed that improves the accuracy of the zzso analysis, without adding significant complexity, by zzso the reflections from the shadow mask by those from a uniform metal zzso zzso obtained using both forms of the transfer zzso model are compared to finite element models and two example zzso one with a silver zzso and the other with three silver zzso are zzso The modified transfer zzso model gives much better agreement in both zzso
