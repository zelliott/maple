By building kinetic models of biological networks one may advance the development of new modeling approaches while gaining insights into the zzso We focus here on building a zzso kinetic model for the zzso growth of zzso zzso virus zzso a well-studied virus that encodes five zzso The essential network of zzso reactions creates challenges to zzso simulation zzso to zzso delayed reactions associated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso production of large numbers of intermediate proteins by translation, and zzso the presence of highly zzso zzso that rapidly zzso in their zzso zzso We address these issues by developing a hybrid zzso of the model that combines a delayed zzso simulation zzso zzso with zzso equations to simulate the reactions that produce species in high zzso Further, we employ a zzso approximation zzso to overcome the zzso burden of small time steps caused by highly zzso zzso The simulation is able to capture zzso observed patterns of viral gene zzso Moreover, the simulation suggests that early levels of a zzso species, zzso L zzso play a key role in determining the production level of zzso zzso zzso and proteins within an infected zzso Ultimately, these results suggest that zzso gene expression contribute to the distribution of virus progeny yields from infected zzso
