It was shown that zzso of a zzso solution (5 zzso zzso zzso with electrons makes zzso assemble to zzso The response of the system was monitored by the zzso laser zzso The assembly under these conditions occurs without zzso zzso zzso and zzso At 730 (the first zzso and 365 zzso (the second zzso a rise in signal intensity occurs during the first zzso zzso followed by the onset of zzso assembly to zzso which was registered by the methods of zzso and electron zzso zzso this effect can be explained by the appearance of hydrated electrons in the zzso zzso zzso zzso electrons are mostly in a zzso zzso state, which can be considered as an ensemble of zzso of the zzso zzso The interaction of zzso with the weak internal zzso field of zzso zzso due to zzso effects, to a zzso rise in the intensity of the zzso field of the zzso shell of initially zzso zzso zzso Finally, the increased field makes separate zzso chains zzso to zzso The effect observed is identical to the action of zzso on the zzso site of zzso which transfers it to a slightly zzso zzso zzso
