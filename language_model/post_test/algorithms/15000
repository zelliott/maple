The simple zzso function used in the zzso of the traditional minimal principle and the related zzso zzso is here replaced by a function of exponential type and its expected value and zzso are zzso These lead to the corresponding exponential minimal principle and its associated zzso zzso zzso Recent applications of the exponential function to several protein structures within the zzso framework suggest that this function zzso in general, to significant improvements in the success rate zzso of trial structures yielding zzso of the zzso zzso However, only in space group zzso is it presently possible to assign optimal values a zzso for the zzso zzso
