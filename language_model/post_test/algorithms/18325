zzso for selecting and computing arbitrary image sections for displaying zzso and zzso information for three-dimensional treatment planning are zzso zzso of the desired plane may be made by defining a plane that is perpendicular to an existing image section (called the base zzso and passing through a line on the base zzso zzso the zzso structures displayed zzso in three dimensions as a series of contours that can be rotated and translated may be used to define an arbitrary plane for image zzso The viewing screen is considered to be the plane of zzso As a typical three-dimensional image of 30 to 60 sections requires considerable computer storage (on the order of 25 zzso a reconstruction zzso may need extensive memory space or CPU and disk zzso zzso Of the schemes zzso we believe the following is the most zzso One pair of images is read from the disk at a time in sequence and zzso of the rows of the cutting plane with the box formed by the consecutive images are zzso Pixel values of all points between the given images are zzso by zzso Special cases, such as the cutting plane being parallel to or zzso with an existing image, must be considered zzso
