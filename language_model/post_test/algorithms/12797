zzso zzso zzso are assessed by evaluating blind predictions performed during zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso experiment on critical assessment of predicted interactions zzso We evaluated the ability of these zzso to sample zzso poses and to single out specific association modes in 14 targets, representing 11 distinct protein zzso These complexes play important biological roles in zzso zzso zzso signal processing, and zzso zzso and zzso One target involved zzso interactions not previously considered in zzso several others were zzso or featured multiple zzso between the same protein zzso For most targets, predictions started from the zzso determined structures of the free zzso zzso or from models built from known structures of related or similar zzso To succeed they therefore needed to account for zzso changes and model zzso In total, 64 groups and 12 zzso submitted zzso predictions of which zzso were zzso zzso our assessment reveals that zzso of the groups, more than ever before, produced acceptable models or better for at least one target, with many groups submitting multiple zzso and zzso models for two to six zzso zzso groups including four zzso participated in the scoring experiment with zzso evaluated zzso zzso predictions also show signs of progress evidenced from the large proportion of correct models zzso But singling out the best models remains a challenge, which also adversely affects the ability to correctly rank zzso zzso With the increased interest in translating abstract protein interaction networks into realistic models of protein zzso the growing zzso community is actively developing more efficient and reliable zzso and scoring methods for everyone to zzso
