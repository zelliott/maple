Models of ancestral gene order reconstruction have progressively integrated different evolutionary patterns and processes such as unequal gene content, gene zzso and implicitly sequence evolution via zzso gene zzso These models have so far ignored lateral gene transfer, even though in zzso organisms it can have an important zzso effect, and can be a rich source of information on the function of genes through the detection of transfers of clusters of zzso 

We report an zzso together with its zzso zzso that reconstructs ancestral zzso organization based on zzso gene trees which zzso information on sequence evolution, gene zzso duplication, loss, and lateral zzso zzso zzso in zzso time on the number of zzso zzso as the number of gains and zzso of zzso between pairs of zzso We apply zzso to zzso gene families from 36 zzso zzso 

zzso is able to reconstruct zzso in 35 ancestral bacterial zzso with a thousand gene families in a few hours, and detects clusters of zzso zzso zzso may also be used with any relationship between genes instead of zzso to reconstruct ancestral zzso functions or zzso
