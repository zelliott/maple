Though powerful and easy to use, applications of the zzso element method are not as widespread as zzso or zzso models due in part to their relative zzso Although reviews that focus primarily on the mathematical development of the method have appeared in the literature, a systematic review of applications of the method is not zzso An overview of the general types of applications of zzso elements in ground water modeling is provided in this zzso While not fully zzso the applications described here cover areas where the method has been historically applied zzso two-dimensional zzso models, analyses of ground zzso water interaction, quick analyses and screening models, zzso protection zzso as well as more recent applications zzso sensitivity zzso zzso effective zzso and zzso in highly zzso zzso The review of applications also illustrates areas where more method development is needed zzso and transient zzso
