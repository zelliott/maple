We present a completely automatic zzso for zzso and tracking the articulated motion of humans using image sequences obtained from multiple zzso A detailed articulated human body model composed of zzso rigid segments that allows both translation and rotation at zzso is zzso zzso data of the subject obtained from the images is segmented into the different articulated chains using zzso zzso The segmented chains are registered in a subset of the frames using a zzso registration technique and subsequently used to zzso the pose in the zzso A zzso registration method is proposed to identify the partially segmented or zzso articulated chains in the remaining frames in the zzso The proposed tracker uses motion cues such as zzso displacement as well as zzso and 3-D shape cues such as zzso motion zzso and skeleton zzso The tracking zzso consists of a predictor that uses motion cues and a zzso that uses shape zzso The use of complementary cues in the tracking zzso the twin problems of drift and convergence to local zzso The use of multiple cameras also allows us to deal with the problems due to zzso and zzso zzso We present tracking results on sequences with different kinds of motion to illustrate the effectiveness of our zzso The pose of the subject is correctly tracked for the duration of the sequence as can be verified by zzso
