This work presents an extensive study on zzso Carlo radiation transport simulation and zzso zzso zzso for zzso mixed radiation fields zzso and zzso occurring in nuclear zzso The feasibility of these methods is investigated for radiation fields at various locations of the Portuguese Research zzso zzso The performance of the approaches developed in this work is compared with zzso techniques already existing at zzso The zzso Carlo zzso code was used for a detailed zzso of the reactor core, the fast zzso beam and the zzso column of zzso zzso using these models allow to reproduce the energy and spatial zzso of the zzso field very well zzso better than zzso In the case of the zzso field, the agreement improves with decreasing intensity of the component related to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso detectors zzso with low zzso sensitivity are able to determine zzso dose and dose profiles with high spatial zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso with increased zzso sensitivity show a remarkable loss of sensitivity and a high zzso in high-intensity fields zzso their application at nuclear zzso
