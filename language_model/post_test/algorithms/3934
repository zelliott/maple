The goal of training is to produce learning for a range of activities that are typically more general than the training task zzso Despite a century of research, predicting the scope of learning from the content of training has proven extremely difficult, with the same task producing narrowly focused learning strategies in some cases and broadly zzso learning strategies in zzso Here we test the hypothesis that human subjects will prefer a decision strategy that zzso performance and reduces uncertainty given the demands of the training task and that the strategy chosen will then predict the extent to which learning is zzso To test this hypothesis, we trained subjects on a moving dot zzso task that makes distinct predictions for two types of learning zzso a narrow zzso strategy that learns an zzso mapping for training zzso and a general zzso strategy that zzso zzso default zzso model for a class of zzso When the number of distinct training zzso is low, we predict better performance for the mapping strategy, but as the number increases, a zzso model is increasingly zzso zzso with predictions, subject extrapolations for test zzso were consistent with using a mapping strategy when trained on a small number of training zzso and a zzso model when trained on a larger zzso The general framework developed here can thus be useful both in interpreting previous patterns of zzso versus zzso learning, as well as in building future training zzso with certain desired zzso
