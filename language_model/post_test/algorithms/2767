The diagnostic approach in zzso with suspected deep vein zzso zzso of the lower limbs includes zzso measurement zzso zzso zzso is not a diagnostic value for zzso However, a normal value contributes to ruling out zzso We do not know the best method to determine zzso zzso we have analyzed the clinical utility of three quantitative zzso to determine zzso in zzso with suspected zzso 

zzso zzso with suspected zzso of the lower limbs who were referred to the zzso medical consultation were enrolled in the zzso We used a diagnostic zzso that included determining the zzso clinical probability zzso zzso zzso zzso level using three different quantitative methods zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso diagnosis was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso of the lower zzso We analyzed the zzso between the three zzso methods to zzso zzso and the zzso 

A total of zzso patients zzso age 60 years, zzso zzso with suspected zzso of the lower limbs were zzso The zzso zzso confirmed the diagnosis of zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso treatment was not performed in patients in whom zzso was ruled out, and no zzso event occurred during the 3 months of zzso The best zzso test results were between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso demonstrated elevated sensibility and a negative zzso zzso zzso zzso was the best zzso method for the zzso of patients with low clinical zzso 

The zzso zzso method to determine zzso rules out zzso in patients with low clinical zzso
