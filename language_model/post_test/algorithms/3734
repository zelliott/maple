Arc zzso plays an important role in the process of graphics recognition from scanned zzso The zzso arc zzso contest shows there is a lot of room for improvement in this zzso This paper proposes a zzso arc zzso method based on our previous seeded circular tracking zzso which largely depends on the zzso zzso The zzso zzso paradigm can handle zzso with large zzso zzso We describe new approaches for arc seed zzso arc zzso and arc zzso making the proposed method self-contained and more zzso Moreover, this paper also brings major improvement to the dynamic adjustment zzso of circular tracking to make it more zzso A systematic performance evaluation of the proposed method has been conducted using the third-party evaluation tool and test images obtained from the zzso arc zzso zzso The overall performance over various arc angles, arc zzso line zzso noises, zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been zzso The experimental results and time complexity analyses on real scanned images are also reported and compared with other zzso The evaluation result demonstrates the stable performance and the significant improvement on processing large zzso of the zzso zzso
