zzso along with its zzso and zzso provides a general framework that zzso most traditional zzso reduction zzso From this zzso we propose a new zzso learning technique called zzso locally linear embedding zzso in which the local geometric properties within each class are preserved according to the locally linear embedding zzso zzso and the zzso between different classes is enforced by maximizing margins between point pairs on different zzso To deal with the zzso problem in visual recognition with zzso zzso the linear version of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is directly proposed through the zzso zzso Moreover, we propose its zzso version, zzso zzso of zzso for the zzso problem with zzso zzso zzso Based on zzso a procedure for gait recognition is zzso We conduct comprehensive experiments on both gait and face recognition, and observe that: 1) zzso along its zzso and zzso zzso the related versions of linear zzso analysis, and zzso demonstrates greater effectiveness than the zzso of zzso 2) zzso based on zzso representations are generally superior to linear zzso when dealing with zzso zzso zzso and 3) for human gait recognition, zzso generally zzso higher accuracy than state-of-the-art gait recognition zzso on the standard University of South Florida gait zzso
