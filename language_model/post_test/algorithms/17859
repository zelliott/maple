The zzso zzso is a component of many important pharmaceuticals including zzso and zzso agents and is commonly zzso in the production of modern zzso materials with novel zzso and electronic zzso zzso zzso are generally produced via the zzso of the respective zzso zzso In this work, density functional theory calculations are used to model the reaction zzso of zzso zzso over zzso The geometry of each of the intermediate surface species has been determined and how each structure interacts with the metal surface zzso The reaction energies and barriers of each of the elementary surface reactions have also been zzso and a detailed analysis of the energetic trends zzso Our calculations have shown that the surface zzso remain fixed to the surface via the aromatic ring in a manner similar to that of zzso Moreover, the zzso ring becomes progressively more zzso with the zzso of each subsequent hydrogen zzso Analysis of the reaction energy profile has revealed that the trend in reaction barriers is determined by the two factors: zzso the strength of the zzso zzso bond and zzso the subsequent gain in energy due to the geometric relaxation of the zzso zzso
