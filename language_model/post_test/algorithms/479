zzso binding to G zzso receptors is a complex process that involves sequential zzso zzso changes, zzso zzso and possibly zzso zzso zzso zzso events at zzso zzso receptors are usually interpreted from zzso binding studies in terms of zzso zzso zzso zzso We report here, using a combination of zzso approaches, on the molecular mechanisms for zzso binding to enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso zzso zzso receptors in living zzso Real time monitoring, under zzso conditions, of the strong zzso energy transfer signal zzso by this interaction permitted a fine kinetic description of the binding zzso zzso zzso zzso allowed us to identify discrete zzso lifetime species and to follow their zzso upon zzso zzso Fluorescence correlation zzso with zzso brightness analysis, showed that zzso zzso zzso receptors predominate as zzso in the absence of zzso and zzso upon zzso zzso Finally, all these experimental data could be zzso zzso into a three-step zzso with four identified zzso zzso zzso Fast zzso binding to a peripheral zzso site zzso a sequence of zzso changes that allows the zzso to access to inner regions of the protein and drives zzso complexes toward a high affinity zzso zzso
