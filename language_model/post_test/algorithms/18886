The behavior of zzso chains modeling zzso zzso such as DNA and zzso in confined spaces was explored by zzso zzso Carlo zzso The persistence length zzso mean zzso distance zzso mean radius of zzso zzso and the size ratio zzso were zzso for chains in zzso zzso and zzso It was found that the intrinsic persistence length of a free chain zzso on confinement substantial zzso into the apparent persistence zzso The qualitative differences were found in trends of the apparent persistence lengths between zzso and zzso on one side and spheres on the other zzso The quantities zzso zzso zzso and zzso display similar zzso upon squeezing the chains in zzso The above quantities change zzso with confinement in zzso and zzso whereas they drop smoothly with decreasing radius of a zzso For zzso of a chain in a cylinder, two regimes corresponding to strong and moderate zzso were found and compared to experiments and predictions of the blob and zzso zzso In a zzso zzso the zzso chain structure with a hole in the center was detected under strong zzso The scattering form factor zzso zzso for zzso confined chains revealed three regimes of behavior in a slit and a cylinder that matched up well with the zzso zzso The complex form of the function zzso zzso for a sphere was interpreted as a sign of the zzso zzso A reasonable agreement was found between the simulations and zzso of DNA and zzso zzso confined in zzso and zzso channels and zzso zzso pertaining to the changes of the persistence zzso chain zzso and zzso structure zzso
