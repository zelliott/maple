To investigate whether the evaluation of tumor budding can complement zzso analysis to improve the individualized prediction of response to zzso growth factor zzso based therapies in zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso treated with zzso or zzso were entered into this zzso According to the Response zzso zzso in Solid zzso criteria, 30 patients had stable or progressive disease zzso while 13 patients had a partial zzso zzso buds were evaluated from whole tissue sections stained for zzso evaluated in the densest region using a 40 zzso objective and zzso tumor budding was defined as 15 zzso zzso 

zzso buds and zzso zzso both correctly classified zzso of zzso All patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso 7) or high-grade tumor budding zzso zzso zzso were zzso of which 4 patients had both zzso All 13 partial zzso were zzso zzso with zzso tumor zzso zzso the zzso value of zzso and tumor budding was zzso Additionally, high-grade tumor budding was significantly related to worse zzso survival zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

If confirmed in larger zzso the addition of tumor budding to zzso analysis may represent an effective approach for individualized patient management in the zzso zzso
