Active stereo vision is a method of zzso surface scanning involving the projecting and capturing of a series of light patterns where depth is derived from zzso between the observed and projected zzso In contrast, passive stereo vision reveals depth through zzso between zzso images from two or more zzso By employing a zzso active stereo vision systems find zzso between two or more cameras, without zzso independent of object zzso In this paper, we present a hybrid zzso reconstruction framework that supplements projected pattern correspondence matching with texture zzso The proposed scheme consists of using projected pattern data to derive initial zzso across cameras and then using texture data to eliminate zzso zzso zzso data are then used to estimate error models from which zzso divergence refinement is applied to reduce zzso zzso Using only a small number of patterns, the presented approach reduces measurement errors versus traditional structured light and phase matching zzso while being insensitive to gamma zzso projector zzso and secondary zzso Experimental results demonstrate these advantages in terms of enhanced zzso reconstruction performance in the presence of noise, deterministic zzso and conditions of texture and depth zzso
