Three digital signal processing zzso named zzso zzso and zzso were compared with regard to user preference and performance when a zzso digital zzso hearing aid was zzso All three zzso provided individual frequency shaping via a zzso zzso zzso was used in a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso used wide dynamic range zzso zzso in the zzso channel, whereas zzso used zzso zzso In the zzso channel, zzso used a slow acting automatic volume control, whereas zzso and zzso used zzso zzso The subjects had access to a manual volume control when using the zzso or zzso zzso 

The study included 13 hearing aid users with symmetrical zzso zzso In a 1 zzso long blind field test, the zzso zzso was compared with the preferred zzso from an earlier study, zzso or zzso A data zzso function was included for objective recording of the total time each zzso was used and how the volume controls were zzso The preference was based on the time used for each zzso and from zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso for speech was tested, and sound quality ratings were obtained through a zzso 

Of the 13 subjects, six preferred the zzso fitting and another four preferred the zzso zzso Two subjects preferred the zzso fitting and one had equal preference for zzso and zzso The results from the questionnaire showed that the preferred fittings were rated higher concerning overall impression of sound quality and zzso whereas the zzso for the speech test did not show any zzso zzso where zzso could be predicted from auditory dynamic range zzso in the zzso and zzso frequency zzso The mean dynamic range was broader for low and zzso for high zzso for those who preferred the zzso or zzso fitting as compared with those who preferred the zzso zzso The preference between zzso and zzso was predicted by differences in the zzso range, with the zzso dynamic range for the zzso preference zzso 

Most subjects preferred the option of having a wide dynamic range zzso zzso in the zzso channel and having the overall gain in the zzso channel zzso either manually zzso or automatically zzso
