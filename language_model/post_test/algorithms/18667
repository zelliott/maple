A number of natural and synthetic zzso have been assessed previously with regard to their effects on the activity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso related to the zzso of cell cycle zzso On the other hand, the zzso system is of major importance in zzso migration phenomena and brain development, and its deregulation is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly zzso Here we show that some natural zzso inhibit the activity of the zzso system in the zzso range, while others are practically zzso Ring zzso and highly zzso zzso were inactive or gave zzso results, and zzso and zzso were the most potent zzso complex zzso within this series, while the common zzso zzso and zzso showed intermediate zzso The reported crystal structure of the zzso complex with its zzso zzso was used for zzso studies, which also led to the identification of the two zzso zzso and zzso as well as the untested zzso derivatives of zzso and zzso and the corresponding zzso zzso as compounds exhibiting a good fit to the active site of the zzso
