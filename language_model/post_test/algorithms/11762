There is a pressing need to align growing set of expressed sequence tags zzso to newly zzso human zzso The problem is, however, complicated by the zzso structure of zzso zzso misread zzso in zzso and millions of zzso sequences in zzso zzso Indeed, to solve this, zzso that use dynamic programming have been proposed, but in reality, these zzso require an enormous amount of processing zzso In an effort to improve the zzso efficiency of these classical zzso zzso we develop software that fully zzso the zzso for allowing the efficient detection of the zzso and zzso of an zzso within a given DNA zzso and zzso the prompt identification of zzso and zzso In addition, high sensitivity and accuracy must be achieved by calculating locations of all spliced sites correctly for more zzso while retaining high zzso zzso This goal is hard to accomplish in practice, zzso to misread zzso in zzso and zzso sequences in the zzso but we present a couple of zzso effective in settling this zzso Experimental results have confirmed that our technique improves the overall zzso time by orders of magnitude compared with common tools such as zzso and zzso and attains high sensitivity and accuracy against zzso of clean and documented genes at the same zzso
