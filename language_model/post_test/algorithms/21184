We present new quantitative zzso imaging zzso zzso metrics for assessing cerebral white matter zzso These metrics extend prior work in this zzso zzso models of cerebral white matter were produced from each zzso zzso zzso The models are a set of zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso data that represent the underlying topography of the cerebral white zzso Nine metrics were calculated in whole brain zzso models and in three zzso zzso fibers and the left and right zzso zzso The metrics included the number of zzso and several other based on the summed length of zzso including some that were weighted by zzso zzso metrics and zzso for estimated zzso zzso We then tested whether patients with zzso zzso vascular disease zzso vascular cognitive impairment or zzso zzso healthy controls zzso differed on the zzso The metrics were significantly lower in the VCI group in whole brain and in zzso fibers but not in the left or right zzso zzso The metrics correlated significantly with cognitive functions known to be impacted by white matter abnormalities zzso processing zzso but not with those more strongly impacted by cortical disease zzso zzso These new metrics help bridge the gap between zzso zzso and zzso zzso methods and provide a potential means for examining group differences in white matter integrity in specific zzso
