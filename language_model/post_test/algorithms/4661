In shotgun zzso tandem mass zzso is used to identify peptides derived from zzso After the peptides are zzso proteins are zzso via a reference database of protein or gene zzso zzso and zzso between protein records in databases make it challenging to assign peptides to proteins that may or may not be in an experimental zzso Here, a probability model is introduced for determining the likelihood that peptides are correctly assigned to zzso This model derives consistent probability estimates for assembled zzso The probability scores make it easier to confidently identify proteins in complex samples and to accurately estimate zzso zzso The zzso based on this model is robust in creating protein zzso from peptides from bovine protein standards, zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso It also eliminates the side effects of zzso and zzso from the reference databases by employing a new concept of zzso grouping and by zzso distinguishing distinct peptides from unique records and shared peptides from zzso zzso The software that runs the algorithm, called zzso provides a tool to help analyze the data based on a zzso knowledge about the zzso The software operates efficiently and quickly compared to other software zzso
