The underlying principle governing the natural phenomena of life is one of the critical issues receiving due importance in recent zzso A key feature of the zzso architecture is the vitality of the most connected zzso zzso The major objective of this article was to analyze the zzso and zzso interaction networks of zzso zzso by considering the architectural patterns and the consequence of removal of hubs on the zzso zzso of the two interaction zzso Analysis showed that both interaction networks follow a zzso model, establishing the fact that most real world networks, from varied situations, conform to the small world zzso The average path length showed a zzso and a zzso increase zzso from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso for the zzso and zzso interaction networks, respectively, due to the deletion of zzso On the contrary, the arbitrary elimination of zzso did not show any remarkable disparity in the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso interaction networks zzso path zzso zzso and zzso zzso This zzso behavior for the two cases underscores the significance of the most linked zzso to the natural zzso of the zzso
