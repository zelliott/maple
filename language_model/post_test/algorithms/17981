zzso zzso changes in vascular tone and oxygen consumption result in a dynamic evolution of blood flow, volume, and zzso zzso zzso techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, optical imaging, and zzso provide indirect measures of the zzso vascular dynamics driving the blood zzso Models connecting changes in vascular tone and oxygen consumption to observed changes in the blood parameters are needed to guide more quantitative zzso interpretation of these functional zzso zzso zzso zzso vascular balloon and zzso models have been developed for this purpose, but the zzso of the complex vascular network into a series of zzso zzso and zzso allows only qualitative zzso We have therefore developed a parallel vascular anatomical network zzso model based on microscopically measurable properties to improve quantitative interpretation of the vascular zzso The model, derived from measured physical properties, predicts baseline blood pressure and oxygen zzso zzso and dynamic responses consistent with zzso Furthermore, the VAN model allows investigation of spatial features of the dynamic vascular and oxygen response to zzso zzso We find that a passive surround negative vascular response zzso zzso is predicted, but that it zzso recently observed surround zzso suggesting that additional active surround zzso is required to explain the experimental zzso
