To identify the presence of zzso deep vein zzso zzso in surgical intensive care unit zzso patients and to avoid unnecessary zzso we reviewed our experience with routine duplex screening for zzso in zzso zzso 

Over a zzso period, all patients who were admitted to an zzso with an anticipated length of stay greater than 36 hours were studied to determine the prevalence of risk factors for zzso zzso zzso zzso factors, zzso and operative data were collected and analyzed with zzso regression, zzso tests and zzso 2 zzso 

There was a zzso prevalence of major zzso in the zzso patients zzso zzso II scores zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and emergent procedures zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso were associated with zzso by zzso zzso Age was significant by zzso zzso An zzso based on the presence of any one of the three risk factors identified zzso II score 12 or zzso emergent zzso or age 65 or zzso could be used to limit screening by zzso while achieving a zzso sensitivity for identification of zzso zzso 

zzso of all three risk factors indicates a very low risk for zzso zzso zzso of zzso patients is indicated because of a high prevalence of zzso zzso Patients who have zzso zzso require active therapy and not zzso zzso and resources may be contained by using the above risk factors as a filter for duplex zzso
