The purpose of our study was to investigate the potential of zzso zzso zzso as novel delivery zzso on the systemic zzso of therapeutic peptides and proteins across different zzso administration zzso The zzso feasibility of zzso and zzso zzso was used for zzso zzso zzso and zzso as novel zzso therapy, in addition to zzso zzso as protein zzso model from zzso and zzso route of administration was evaluated as first time in zzso zzso route is the most feasible for the delivery of therapeutic peptides zzso with zzso whereas the zzso route appears to be more zzso The absolute zzso zzso zzso values depend on the zzso characters of drugs, zzso character of zzso and site of zzso zzso significantly increased the zzso more than zzso zzso of zzso and zzso as the BA for zzso and zzso administration of zzso was zzso and zzso and for zzso were zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, the BA of zzso zzso with zzso was zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso administration, zzso From these findings, zzso is a promising carrier for zzso delivery of therapeutic peptides and zzso as an alternative to conventional zzso zzso
