Hard red winter wheat zzso zzso zzso zzso plants from zzso selected in the Northern Great Plains of the zzso have less tissue water after exposure to cool autumn temperatures than plants from the Southern Great zzso It is generally assumed that the reduced tissue water content of northern compared to southern zzso is due to an zzso to water zzso by northern plants as a result of the low autumn zzso We zzso that if low temperature zzso water zzso then less soil water would be removed by northern than by zzso zzso This hypothesis was tested by comparing plant water zzso of a northern zzso and a southern zzso zzso in relation to their foliage water content at 2 degrees zzso 

At 2 degrees C foliage water content of zzso plants decreased more rapidly than that of zzso plants, similar to field results in the zzso During 6 zzso foliage water content of zzso plants decreased 20 to zzso of the zzso value, compared to only 5 to zzso by zzso zzso Plant water zzso was about 60 g zzso zzso by zzso plants, while zzso plants maintained plant water zzso in excess of 100 g zzso zzso during the 6 zzso period at 2 degrees zzso When four other northern zzso of equal freeze resistance were zzso foliage water content and plant water zzso change were similar to zzso zzso 

In these zzso zzso zzso foliage water content reduction resulting from cold zzso is not due to zzso to plant water zzso
