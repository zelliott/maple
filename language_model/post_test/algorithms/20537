zzso zzso methods have been shown to have good zzso performance using minimal data points, and are now used widely in clinical zzso This study was designed to compare two zzso zzso zzso methods, zzso and zzso in zzso dosing of zzso 

zzso uses the maximum a zzso zzso zzso zzso which analyses all available serum drug concentration data for individual patients zzso while the prior model remains zzso zzso analyses each data set zzso while continually zzso the individual patient's prior model, allowing zzso zzso to be zzso One hundred consecutive patients who received zzso dosing of zzso were zzso zzso using either of these zzso zzso the alternative dosing method was used to provide comparative zzso The ability of the methods to predict subsequent serum zzso concentration data was assessed in terms of their zzso performance, bias and zzso 

From the 100 patients, 277 serum zzso zzso were zzso zzso patients had serum zzso available from the first dose and 55 from the second zzso zzso was used in 96 zzso There was no significant bias when predicting peak zzso from the prior model using either zzso or zzso The prior model used by zzso did, however, significantly zzso the zzso concentration zzso bias zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso When using the zzso zzso for prediction of the second set of zzso neither method was biased when predicting the peak zzso zzso significantly zzso the zzso concentration zzso bias zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso The prior model used by zzso was more precise at predicting both peak and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating better use of zzso There was no difference between the methods in terms of zzso of the value of volume of distribution, but they differed significantly in the zzso of clearance zzso difference zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

zzso techniques appear to work well with zzso zzso zzso The method of incorporation of individual patient information into the prior model appears to be important in the optimum choice of the first zzso zzso has an advantage in this and in the lack of bias related to predicting low zzso compared with zzso
