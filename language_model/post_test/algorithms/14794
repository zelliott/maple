We overview an approach to providing automated three-dimensional zzso sensing and recognition of biological zzso zzso zzso digital holographic zzso and statistical sampling zzso For zzso data acquisition of biological zzso a coherent beam zzso through the zzso and its zzso and zzso magnified zzso pattern observed by the microscope objective is zzso recorded with an image sensor array zzso with a zzso zzso zzso of the biological zzso from the magnified zzso pattern is accomplished by using the zzso zzso propagation zzso For zzso recognition of the biological zzso a watershed image zzso zzso is applied to automatically remove the unnecessary background parts in the reconstructed holographic zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are developed to the automatically segmented holographic zzso zzso of preliminary experimental results illustrate how the holographic image reconstructed from the zzso digital zzso of biological zzso contains important information for microbial zzso
