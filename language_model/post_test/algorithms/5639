zzso cancer is the most prevalent form of cancer in western zzso An accurate early zzso of prostate cancer, permitting efficient use of modern focal therapies, is currently hampered by a lack of imaging zzso Several methods have aimed at detecting zzso changes associated with prostate cancer with limited success by quantitative imaging of blood zzso zzso we propose zzso diffusion imaging, based on the hypothesis that the complexity of zzso changes is better reflected by diffusion than by zzso zzso zzso of local, zzso diffusion is performed after zzso ultrasound imaging of an zzso injected ultrasound contrast agent zzso zzso dilution zzso are measured with the ultrasound scanner resolution and fitted by a modified local density random walk model, which, being a solution of the zzso diffusion zzso enables the zzso of a local, zzso zzso zzso zzso images obtained from five zzso of four patients were compared with zzso data on a zzso zzso The resulting receiver operating characteristic (curve area zzso zzso was superior to that of any zzso zzso proposed in the zzso zzso diffusion imaging seems therefore to be a promising method for prostate cancer zzso encouraging further research to assess the clinical zzso
