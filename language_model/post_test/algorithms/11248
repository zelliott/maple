A zzso method with spatial constraint is proposed for vessel zzso in retinal zzso The proposed model makes the assumption that the zzso probability of each zzso is dependent on zzso probabilities of their neighboring zzso An energy function is defined for the proposed zzso By applying the modified level set approach to minimize the proposed energy function, we can identify blood vessels in the retinal zzso zzso of the developed method is done on real retinal images which are from the zzso database and the zzso zzso The performance is analyzed and compared to other published methods using a number of measures which include zzso sensitivity, and zzso The proposed approach is proved to be effective on these two zzso The average zzso sensitivity, and specificity on the zzso database are zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and for the zzso database zzso zzso and zzso zzso The performance is better than that of other vessel zzso zzso
