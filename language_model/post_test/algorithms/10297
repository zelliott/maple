zzso An zzso and a computer program for the automatic grading of zzso nerve zzso are proposed and zzso zzso Thirty images of the zzso zzso nerve zzso with different grades of zzso were acquired with a scanning laser zzso microscope in normal and zzso zzso Nerves were automatically traced with an zzso previously developed, and a zzso measure was zzso with the proposed method, based on the number of changes in the zzso sign and on the zzso zzso distance of the curve from the underlying zzso of the nerve zzso These measures were evaluated according to their capability to reproduce the expert zzso of images into three groups of zzso zzso zzso and zzso This zzso was also compared with measures provided by other methods proposed in the literature to evaluate nerve zzso zzso Among all considered methods, the one proposed zzso allows a minimum of zzso errors zzso 2 in 30 zzso and the highest zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, it is the only one that can provide a significant difference zzso zzso zzso between all pairs of zzso zzso zzso The results provided by the proposed system confirmed its ability to perform a clinically significant evaluation of zzso nerve zzso
