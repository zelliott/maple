zzso are appealing materials for the fabrication of zzso optical elements zzso We evaluate the possibilities of zzso zzso to store zzso elements with low spatial zzso We record zzso with different spatial zzso in the material and analyze the material behavior measuring the transmitted and the reflected orders as a function of zzso We study two different compositions for the zzso with and without a zzso The values of zzso efficiency achieved for both compositions make the material suitable to record zzso with long spatial zzso Assuming a zzso profile, we fitted the zzso zzso (up to the eighth zzso to obtain the phase profile of the recorded zzso This analysis shows that it is possible to achieve a phase shift larger than zzso zzso with steep edges in the periodic phase zzso In the case of the zzso in reflection, we have obtained information dealing with the surface profile, which show that it has a smooth shape with an extremely large zzso zzso
