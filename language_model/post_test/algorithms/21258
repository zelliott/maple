The zzso rate zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to soybean zzso and zzso component II of zzso zzso zzso were measured at pH 7, 20 degrees C using a dye laser with a zzso zzso zzso The results were compared to the corresponding parameters for zzso whale zzso and the isolated alpha and beta zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Gibson, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso step for zzso zzso and zzso binding to all five proteins is zzso migration up to the initial zzso state, and the rate of this process determines the overall zzso association rate constant for these zzso In contrast, zzso bond formation limits the overall zzso rate for CO zzso The zzso pockets in zzso and in zzso zzso are approximately 10 times more accessible zzso to zzso zzso than that in zzso whale zzso This difference accounts for the much larger association rate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that are observed for zzso and NO binding to zzso and zzso zzso The rates of zzso migration through zzso are also very large and indicate a very fluid or open zzso structure near the sixth coordination zzso In contrast, there is a marked decrease in the rate of migration up to and away from the sixth coordination position in zzso zzso with increasing zzso zzso These results were also used to interpret previously published rate zzso and quantum yields for the high zzso and low zzso affinity states of human zzso In contrast to the differences between the zzso zzso the differences between the zzso zzso and zzso parameters for R and T state zzso appear to be due to a decrease in the zzso zzso of the zzso iron zzso with little or no change in the accessibility of the zzso zzso
