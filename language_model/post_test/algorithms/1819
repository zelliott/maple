To assess the relative risk of an zzso conversion to wet age-related zzso zzso zzso based primarily on zzso zzso obtained from analysis of digitized zzso 

Four hundred zzso subjects zzso zzso enrolled in the zzso Eye Disease Study zzso I) and 78 subjects zzso zzso from the zzso Treatment of zzso trial zzso were studied zzso zzso size, distribution, zzso area, and zzso in two central zzso regions on baseline zzso images were determined using an image analysis zzso The relative risk for zzso zzso zzso based on zzso area, presence of one or five large zzso zzso and fellow eye status was zzso 

zzso ratios zzso for measured zzso area within the zzso and zzso regions were zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso eyes and zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso eyes zzso zzso zzso In the zzso region, respective zzso for the presence of a large zzso zzso and fellow eye affected were zzso zzso and zzso for zzso eyes and zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso for the zzso region, zzso were zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso and zzso for zzso eyes, zzso 

Total zzso area, presence of large zzso and the presence of zzso were not consistent risk factors for an zzso development of zzso zzso depended on study cohort as well as zzso Having an affected fellow eye was the strongest and most consistent risk factor across all zzso A larger zzso area does not necessarily increase an zzso risk of conversion to zzso
