Human zzso gene zzso zzso zzso channels were expressed in Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells and studied by zzso zzso clamp in the presence of varied zzso zzso zzso and zzso external zzso zzso of external zzso from zzso to 10 zzso resulted in a reduction of zzso zzso current zzso slowed zzso zzso and an increased rate of zzso The zzso of the zzso dependence of zzso was also shifted zzso zzso zzso zzso to more zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso and zzso dependence of channel zzso were hardly affected by increased zzso zzso Neither zzso screening of diffuse membrane surface charges nor open channel block could explain these zzso However, selective changes in the zzso zzso but not zzso zzso account for the effects of zzso on Human zzso gene current zzso and zzso The differential effects of zzso zzso on the zzso and zzso gating indicate that these processes have distinct zzso zzso Thus, zzso appears to directly interact with zzso accessible channel zzso to alter the membrane potential detected by the zzso zzso zzso yet zzso binding to this site is ineffective in zzso the zzso gating zzso
