Recently several minimum free energy zzso folding zzso for predicting the joint structure of two interacting zzso molecules have been zzso Their folding targets are interaction structures, that can be represented as zzso with two zzso drawn zzso on top of each other such that zzso zzso and zzso bonds are zzso and zzso there is no zzso zzso This paper studies joint structures with zzso at least four in which both, interior and exterior zzso are at least two (no isolated zzso The key idea in this paper is to consider a new type of shape, based on which joint structures can be derived via symbolic zzso Our results imply simple zzso formulas for the number of joint structures with surprisingly small exponential growth zzso They are of interest in the context of designing prediction zzso for zzso zzso
