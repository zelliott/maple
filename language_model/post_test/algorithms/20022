To develop a risk score model for zzso and propose an individualized screening protocol for zzso zzso

An zzso risk score model was developed from the derivation cohort zzso zzso and was tested in the validation cohort zzso zzso who underwent screening zzso 

Age, male sex, and smoking were clinical risk factors for zzso The presence of a zzso zzso was a zzso risk factor for zzso We calculated zzso risk scores zzso based on these variables and classified patients as low risk zzso or high risk zzso In the validation zzso the relative risk of zzso was zzso higher in the high-risk group than in the low-risk zzso Our model suggests that zzso should be performed as an initial screening test in patients with a high clinical risk for zzso zzso should be performed initially in patients with low clinical risk for zzso followed by supplementary zzso in those with high zzso risk scores based on both clinical and zzso risk zzso This protocol detected zzso in 22 of 34 zzso patients zzso with little increase in the zzso burden, whereas only 16 of 34 zzso patients zzso would be identified by initial zzso followed by zzso only in cases with zzso zzso

Our zzso risk score model provides an zzso for efficient screening of zzso cancer by zzso and zzso
