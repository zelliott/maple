An enormous amount of sequence data has been generated with the development of new DNA sequencing technologies, which presents great challenges for zzso biology problems such as zzso zzso Although arduous efforts have been made to address this problem, the current methods still cannot efficiently deal with the incoming flood of large-scale zzso In this paper, we propose a flow network model to tackle zzso phasing problem, and explain some classical zzso phasing rules based on this zzso By incorporating the zzso knowledge obtained from these classical rules, we design an zzso zzso based on the flow network zzso zzso the time complexity of our zzso is zzso which is better than that of zzso one of the most efficient zzso zzso After testing the performance of zzso with several simulated data sets, the experimental results show that when applied on large-scale data sets, our zzso is significantly faster than the state-of-the-art zzso zzso zzso also achieves an equal or superior accuracy compared with other zzso
