zzso is a common disabling condition, with high zzso according to twin zzso zzso of familial risks for common zzso of zzso will advance the search for the zzso causes of these conditions and their underlying zzso We aim at defining familial risks for siblings to be hospitalized because of zzso 

A nationwide ad hoc zzso database was constructed by linking the zzso Register on zzso to zzso siblings to the Hospital Discharge Register for data on zzso covering the years zzso zzso risk ratios zzso were calculated for affected sibling pairs by comparing them to those whose siblings had no zzso 

Among a total of zzso hospitalized cases, zzso affected siblings were identified with a familial zzso of zzso the zzso was highest at ages zzso years zzso zzso spasms showed the highest risk for any zzso zzso when a zzso was diagnosed with any zzso When both siblings were diagnosed with a zzso zzso zzso of zzso the zzso were high, zzso zzso for generalized idiopathic zzso zzso for partial zzso zzso for status zzso and zzso for other zzso zzso idiopathic zzso was also associated with grand zzso zzso and other zzso zzso The numbers of cases were small but zzso diagnoses always showing higher zzso compared with zzso zzso 

Within the limits of the present sample size, our results suggest high familial zzso for certain zzso of zzso for which distinct genetic mechanisms may zzso
