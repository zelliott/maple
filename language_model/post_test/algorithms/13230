We present an imaging technique in which the broadband frequency information of zzso zzso zzso is transformed into spatial zzso zzso blazed zzso zzso spread the individual frequency components over a wide and defined spatial range and zzso zzso are employed to focus the individual components onto a one-dimensional zzso zzso the time domain zzso of the zzso waves allows therefore for a direct reconstruction of spatial sample characteristics as the spatial domain information is zzso in the zzso zzso We will demonstrate zzso imaging on selected samples with an improvement in acquisition speed up to two orders of zzso
