Little consideration has been given to the effect of different zzso methods on the zzso of data derived from zzso zzso Previous work has suggested that the significant source of zzso from zzso image analysis is from zzso of local zzso In this study, we used Analysis of zzso zzso models to investigate the effect of methods of zzso on the precision of zzso obtained from replicate zzso zzso We used four different methods of spot zzso zzso fixed circle, zzso and zzso to zzso a total number of 156 zzso spots from 12 zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso model and the zzso of zzso we show that the method of zzso significantly affects the precision of the zzso zzso The zzso method gave the lowest zzso across replicate spots compared to other methods, and had the lowest zzso zzso within zzso This effect on precision was independent of background zzso We show that these findings have zzso practical implications as the zzso in precision between the four methods resulted in different numbers of genes being identified as zzso zzso zzso method is an important source of zzso in zzso data that directly affects precision and the identification of zzso expressed zzso
