We present general zzso solutions for optical coherent control of electromagnetic energy propagation in zzso zzso zzso modes are excited with tightly focused zzso laser zzso that are shaped in zzso phase, and polarization zzso and orientation zzso We zzso the interplay between two main mechanisms which are essential for the control of local zzso First, the zzso and the phase difference of two laser pulse polarization components are used to guide linear flux to a desired spatial zzso Second, zzso zzso of the zzso at the target location is achieved using the remaining free laser pulse zzso to zzso the local spectral zzso The resulting enhancement of zzso signals from this intuitive zzso zzso process is compared to and confirmed by the results of an zzso zzso learning loop in which an evolutionary zzso performs a global zzso Thus, we gain detailed insight into why a certain complex laser pulse shape leads to a particular control zzso This zzso approach may also be useful in a number of other coherent control zzso
