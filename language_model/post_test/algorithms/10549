To develop a zzso scoring system for risk zzso of patients with zzso graft failure zzso undergoing zzso of the liver zzso and improve patient zzso 

zzso of the liver remains controversial because of inferior outcomes compared with the primary zzso liver transplantation zzso and raises concerns of inappropriate zzso of a scarce donor organ zzso Data on risk zzso of zzso patients for long-term survival outcomes are zzso 

We conducted an analysis from our prospective database of zzso adults' zzso between February 1984 and September zzso Mean follow-up was 3 zzso Each independent predictor for zzso failure was assigned risk score zzso points of 1 or 2, zzso to the corresponding zzso estimate under the Cox model: zzso index category zzso 1, zzso zzso zzso zzso II, zzso zzso 1 to 2; zzso III, zzso zzso 3 to 4; and zzso IV, zzso zzso 5 to zzso 

Eight risk factors zzso for zzso after zzso included recipient age greater than 55 years, Model for zzso Liver Disease score greater than 27, history of prior zzso greater than 1, zzso requirement for mechanical zzso serum zzso less than zzso zzso donor age greater than 45 years, zzso requirement of packed red blood cell zzso greater than 30 units, and performance of zzso between 15 and 180 days from the prior zzso zzso zzso survival was significantly higher in zzso I zzso than in zzso II zzso zzso III zzso and zzso IV zzso groups zzso zzso zzso 

This zzso model was highly zzso of long-term outcome after liver zzso in adult zzso This formula provides a practical guide for selection of candidates for zzso of the liver that can lead to improved patient outcomes and optimal zzso of a scarce zzso
