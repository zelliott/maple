I consider the adaptation of a DNA sequence when zzso zzso are drawn randomly from a probability zzso I focus on zzso adaptation in which the population jumps to the best zzso sequence available at each zzso Given a random starting point, I derive the distribution of the number of zzso that occur during zzso walks to a locally optimal zzso I show that the mean walk length is a zzso zzso zzso where e approximately zzso I argue that this result represents a limit on what is possible under any form of zzso No zzso zzso on any fitness landscape can arrive at a local optimum in fewer than a mean of L zzso zzso steps when starting from a random zzso Put differently, evolution must try out at least e zzso sequences during an average bout of zzso
