A mathematical model to predict the fraction of zzso drug released as a function of release time zzso zzso zzso concentration zzso zzso and volume of drug zzso zzso zzso was derived with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as model zzso The model is log zzso zzso zzso log zzso zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso where zzso is the amount of drug released at time zzso zzso is the amount of drug released over a very long time, which zzso in principle to the initial zzso zzso is the number of samples, and r is the correlation zzso The model was validated using zzso and satisfactory results were zzso The model can be used to predict the release fraction of various soluble drugs from zzso zzso having different zzso zzso
