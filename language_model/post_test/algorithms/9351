In this paper, it is argued that perpendicular recording in the most popular current zzso the use of a continuous soft zzso zzso not be the most optimal way to maximize the achievable zzso zzso As a possible solution, patterning of zzso is zzso The purpose of patterning of a zzso is to effectively move the image head closer to the recording media, as compared to the real recording head, and thus increase the net recording field and the field zzso across the thickness of the zzso Various patterning zzso and combinations with recording layers are comparatively zzso It is illustrated that with a patterned zzso the recording and sensitivity fields, responsible for writing and reading information, respectively, could be not only increased by several factors but also localized across the entire thickness of the recording zzso
