A procedure for the extraction of cell and nuclear contours from digital images is zzso The procedure is simple and suitable for efficient zzso in an interactive environment where the user selects a region of interest containing the cell to be zzso zzso is facilitated by zzso where the threshold values are determined by an zzso zzso using the mean square error criteria to cluster the image zzso zzso zzso are detected on the threshold images by employing a zzso zzso filter and the desired contours are selected by considering closed contours in the edge zzso The cell region is first extracted by performing zzso edge detection and zzso extraction on the region of zzso The nuclear region is subsequently extracted by zzso of the zzso within the extracted cell zzso zzso examples are zzso
