This paper presents a new approach to diagnose and zzso early risk in dengue patients using zzso zzso analysis zzso and artificial neural network zzso A total of 223 healthy subjects and zzso hospitalized dengue patients were zzso zzso The dengue risk severity criteria was determined and grouped based on three blood zzso zzso zzso zzso count (less than or equal to 30,000 cells per zzso zzso zzso zzso by more than or equal to zzso and either zzso zzso zzso level zzso by fivefold the normal upper zzso or zzso zzso zzso level zzso by fivefold the normal upper zzso The dengue patients were classified according to their risk groups and the corresponding zzso parameters were subsequently obtained and zzso Four parameters were used for training and testing the ANN which are day of fever, zzso zzso and risk group's zzso Day of fever was defined as the day of fever zzso zzso when the body temperature fell below zzso The blood investigation and the zzso data were taken for 5 zzso The ANN was trained via the zzso descent back propagation with momentum zzso using the zzso transfer function while the zzso error was used as the network's performance zzso The best ANN architecture of zzso (3 zzso 6 zzso in the hidden layer, and 1 zzso learning rate of zzso momentum constant of zzso and iteration rate of 20,000 was pruned using a zzso zzso zzso a weight of zzso enhances the zzso prediction risk zzso accuracy of zzso for high risk and zzso for low risk zzso As a result, the system is able to zzso and diagnose the risk in the dengue patients with an overall prediction accuracy of zzso
