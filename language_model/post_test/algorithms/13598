The method described attempts to remotely identify the shape of an anthropogenic object, such as a wreck of a modern vessel, using zzso data from zzso zzso zzso zzso In the beam domain, the zzso strength values - zzso and zzso corrected - are used to extract a large number of Gray Level zzso zzso zzso features with different input zzso Principal zzso Analysis zzso is applied in order to achieve zzso reduction whilst a zzso zzso clusters as zzso zzso a large number of beams for each zzso After the zzso process, a zzso zzso technique is applied as a filter for possible zzso Finally, the shape of the zzso site is defined from the zzso beams using the zzso method, constructing an output compatible with zzso Information Systems zzso
