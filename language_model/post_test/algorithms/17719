zzso is a zzso distortion caused by the intrusion of breast cancer into surrounding zzso Its existence is an important clue to characterizing zzso zzso Many successful zzso methods have been proposed to detect tumors with zzso Traditional two-dimensional zzso ultrasound cannot easily find zzso because zzso normally appear parallel to the surface of the zzso Recently, three-dimensional zzso ultrasound has been gradually used in clinical applications and it has been proven to be useful in determining the architectural distortion or zzso that surrounds a breast zzso This paper aims to identify zzso from 3-D zzso volume data of a tumor found by a zzso In the proposed method, each zzso slice of volume data is successively extracted and then analyzed as a zzso ultrasound image by the proposed zzso detection zzso First, in each horizontal zzso the modified rotating structuring element zzso operation is used to find the central region in which zzso lines zzso Second, the stick zzso is used to estimate the direction of the edge of each zzso around the central zzso A zzso whose edge points toward the central region is marked as a potential zzso Finally, the marked zzso are collected around the central region and their distribution is analyzed to determine whether zzso is zzso The 3-D test zzso were obtained using the zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso First, the proposed method was tested on 104 zzso typical zzso images zzso by an experienced zzso extracted from 52 3-D zzso zzso Finally, 225 3-D zzso proven zzso were tested to evaluate the zzso zzso are more easily observed in the zzso view than in the other two zzso That is, the 3-D ultrasound is a powerful tool for identifying zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of benign cases and zzso zzso of zzso cases are detected as zzso
