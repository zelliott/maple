Body fat distribution changes are associated with multiple zzso in zzso zzso the assessment of body fat compartments by zzso in animal models is a promising approach to obesity zzso Standard zzso zzso whole body zzso was used here to zzso different effects in the subcutaneous and visceral fat compartments in rats under treatment with an zzso 

Twenty rats on a high caloric diet were investigated by the identical zzso protocol at baseline and after seven zzso Ten rats received a treatment with zzso 10 rats served as vehicle control zzso To zzso assess body fat zzso zzso analysis was used with two zzso zzso zzso graphic analysis zzso was compared with an automated zzso analysis zzso zzso 

At the group level, fat volume differences showed a zzso increase of subcutaneous and visceral fat volumes for the control group, whereas the zzso group showed stable subcutaneous fat volumes and decrease in visceral fat zzso zzso and zzso volume determination showed significant correlations for subcutaneous fat volume zzso zzso visceral fat volume zzso zzso and total fat volume zzso zzso 

It could be demonstrated that computer-based analysis of zzso zzso could be used to zzso assess changes in body fat compartments in rats at the group zzso In detail, it was possible to investigate the effect of zzso separate on the fat compartments in zzso
