The scatter plot is a well known and easily zzso zzso tool to explore relationships between two quantitative zzso For the exploration of relations between multiple zzso zzso of the scatter plot are zzso We present an overview of zzso scatter plots zzso on the following zzso zzso we look at a scatter plot for portraying relations between quantitative variables within one data zzso zzso we discuss a similar plot for the case of qualitative zzso zzso we describe scatter plots for the relationships between two sets of variables where we focus on zzso Finally, we treat plots of the relationships between multiple response and predictor zzso zzso on the zzso of zzso zzso We will present both known and new results, where an important original contribution concerns a procedure for the inclusion of scales for the variables in zzso scatter zzso We provide software for drawing such zzso We illustrate the construction and interpretation of the plots by means of examples on data collected in a zzso research program on taste in zzso
