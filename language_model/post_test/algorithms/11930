To determine whether the effects of ethanol on working memory are zzso by a secondary effect on attention, zzso zzso for ethanol were determined in eight pigeons trained under a zzso zzso zzso zzso in eight pigeons trained under a zzso measure of attention, and in eight pigeons trained under a zzso measure of zzso Ethanol decreased accuracy under the zzso procedure following the three highest doses zzso zzso and 3 zzso Only the highest dose (3 zzso decreased rates of zzso zzso as measured under the zzso zzso was affected only by the two highest doses zzso and 3 zzso The zzso dose caused significant decreases in the probability of a hit and probability of a correct zzso as well as significant increases in the probability of an error of omission and response zzso zzso to the signal decreased following zzso and 3 zzso zzso Under the zzso zzso ethanol caused a peak in false alarms after the zzso dose, decreased the probability of a hit following the zzso and zzso doses, and increased probability of a miss at all zzso zzso to the signal was not zzso A comparison of the zzso zzso for the zzso procedure and the two measures of attention revealed that working memory zzso was decreased by a lower dose than that affecting zzso This suggests that the effects of ethanol on working memory are not zzso by the zzso ability to pay attention to stimulus changes in the zzso
