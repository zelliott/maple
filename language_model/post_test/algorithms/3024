zzso beam zzso zzso zzso has become an extremely useful technique for zzso imaging because it provides clear images of highly contrasted zzso Previous studies evaluating the zzso of this technique in zzso imaging were very encouraging but were only performed in zzso on zzso bone zzso The zzso positioning of the individual zzso after cochlear zzso by means of zzso has not yet been shown in zzso 

We describe a protocol for in zzso zzso imaging of cochlear implants by zzso Moreover, the effective dose was measured and compared with the effective dose used on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by using a zzso 

zzso a protocol for in zzso zzso imaging of cochlear implants by zzso 

zzso provides high-resolution and almost zzso zzso reconstruction images allowing assessment of the precise zzso position of the zzso and zzso of each of the individual zzso The calculated effective dose of the used zzso and zzso acquisitions is 80 zzso for the zzso 3,600 zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso 

These preliminary results suggests that, for in zzso zzso evaluation of cochlear zzso zzso can provide at least the same information as conventional zzso digital zzso and zzso but in a more comfortable and a much more safer zzso
