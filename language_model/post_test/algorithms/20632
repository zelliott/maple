87 patients who consulted our emergency services with symptoms and signs compatible with zzso were zzso Patients who referred zzso zzso and those with a previous history of zzso disease other than uncomplicated zzso urinary tract infection were zzso Patients with a plain abdominal zzso compatible with zzso were zzso Renal US evaluation was performed by the zzso to rule out zzso 

37 zzso of the 87 patients had an abnormal US zzso These patients were evaluated again by US or zzso or both (one zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated in only 5 cases zzso These zzso 5 patients were treated by zzso 

In our series, zzso US evaluation indicated surgical treatment in zzso of patients with clinical features of zzso and a plain abdominal zzso with no evidence of zzso This zzso is likely to be lower in the zzso zzso It is difficult to propose a standard approach in the management of these zzso It may therefore be more reasonable to zzso US and zzso in those patients who do not respond to zzso zzso
