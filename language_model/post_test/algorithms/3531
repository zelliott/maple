The zzso system of zzso incompetent patients is unable to adapt heart rate adequately to the level of zzso A common therapy is the zzso of a zzso that stimulates the heart at a rate derived from a strain related sensor zzso The paper describes a new zzso concept that uses a zzso time zzso in the zzso as a sensor zzso the zzso zzso time zzso Identification experiments with patients delivered the stationary and dynamic zzso of zzso subject to variations in the exercise rate and the pacing zzso Furthermore, it was demonstrated that zzso is zzso by respiratory zzso The new zzso algorithm, which uses the internal model control principle, explicitly takes into account the zzso nature of the underlying zzso The major design objectives were: extended range of the individual heart zzso effective zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso Seven patients undergoing incremental exercise were paced with this zzso zzso The experiments confirmed the suitability of this concept with respect to the design zzso The patients' peak intrinsic heart rate at exercise was 100 zzso zzso When paced with the zzso algorithm, the paced heart rate was 126 zzso zzso The increase was significant zzso zzso zzso 15 to 53 zzso which clearly demonstrated the potential of this concept to restore zzso zzso
