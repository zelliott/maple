Recent advances in high zzso technologies have generated an abundance of biological information, such as gene zzso zzso interaction, and zzso zzso These various types of data capture different aspects of the cellular response to environmental zzso zzso data from different zzso enhances the ability of modeling zzso to predict cellular function more accurately and can lead to a more coherent reconstruction of the underlying regulatory network zzso Different techniques, newly developed and zzso have been applied for the purpose of zzso this information from experimental zzso In this study, we developed a framework to integrate zzso and gene expression profiles for a zzso zzso Specifically, we applied genetic zzso and partial least square analysis to identify important genes relevant to a specific cellular zzso We identified genes 1) whose expression levels zzso predict a zzso function and 2) that play a part in regulating a zzso function and reconstructed their role in the zzso zzso The framework 1) zzso the gene expression data using statistical techniques, 2) selects genes using a genetic zzso and couples them to a partial least squares analysis to predict cellular function, and 3) zzso with the assistance of a literature search, the pathways that regulate cellular function, namely zzso zzso and zzso zzso This provides a framework for identifying cellular pathways that are active as a function of the environment and in turn helps to uncover the interplay between gene and zzso zzso
