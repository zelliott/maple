zzso during various kinds of movement often leads to potentially dangerous incidents of zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether there was evidence to support the theory that movement strategies could be used by individuals to regain stability during an episode of slipping and whether forced sliding from a moving platform accurately simulated the effect of slipping on stability and zzso A zzso zzso model was used to zzso simulate base of support zzso translation and body segment rotation during movement termination in zzso zzso An zzso routine was used to determine region of stability zzso at given zzso locations as the feasible range of horizontal zzso of the center of mass zzso of human subject that can be reduced to zero with respect to the zzso while still allowing the zzso to traverse within the zzso zzso We found some zzso overlap in the region of stability for slipping and zzso zzso This finding supports the theory that movement strategies can be sought for restoring stability and balance even if slipping unexpectedly zzso We also found that forced sliding produces effects on stability that are similar to those of zzso indicated by over 50% overlap in the regions of stability for the two zzso In addition, forced sliding has distinctive effects on stability, including a zzso of the region of stability extended beyond the zzso in the direction of zzso These findings may provide quantifiable guidance for balance training aimed at reducing fall incidents under uncertain floor surface zzso
