The zzso contributions to zzso relaxation rate zzso in protein systems zzso with zzso zzso were zzso As noted by others, the strength of the zzso zzso between water zzso and the zzso zzso radical often appears to be larger than physically reasonable when the relaxation is assumed to be controlled by zzso zzso processes in the vicinity of the spin zzso We examine the effects of the surface in zzso the zzso exploration of the radical region and derive a relaxation model that incorporates zzso dynamics at the zzso zzso However, we find that the local zzso dynamics changes the shape of the relaxation zzso profile but does not necessarily reproduce the zzso relaxation efficiency found by zzso We examine the contributions of long-range zzso zzso between the zzso center and zzso molecules and find that the contributions from these several long range zzso may be competitive with zzso contributions because the correlation time for global rotation of the protein is approximately 1000 times longer than that for the zzso motion of water at the zzso zzso As a result the zzso zzso zzso to rare zzso zzso may be significant for protein systems that accommodate zzso zzso Although the estimate of local diffusion zzso is not seriously compromised because it derives from the zzso frequency zzso these several contributions confound efforts to fit relaxation data zzso with unique zzso
