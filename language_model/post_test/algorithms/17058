zzso Most studies of cortical zzso have focused on the spatial structure of receptive zzso For a more complete functional description of these zzso it is necessary to consider zzso structure in the joint domain of space and zzso We have studied the zzso zzso structure of 233 simple cells recorded from the zzso zzso of adult cats and kittens at 4 and 8 zzso zzso The dual goal of this study is to provide a detailed quantitative description of zzso zzso structure and to compare the zzso time courses of spatial and zzso response zzso zzso zzso zzso profiles have been measured with the use of a reverse correlation method, in which we zzso the zzso between a zzso response and a random sequence of small, briefly presented bright and dark zzso The zzso profiles of some simple cells are zzso zzso meaning that spatial and zzso response characteristics can be zzso Other cells have zzso profiles that are zzso zzso In these cases, a particular spatial location cannot be zzso zzso as belonging to either an on or off zzso However, separate on and off zzso may be clearly distinguished in the joint zzso zzso These zzso are generally zzso along an zzso zzso zzso Our observations show that spatial and zzso aspects of zzso structure mature with clearly different time zzso By 4 zzso zzso the spatial symmetry and zzso of zzso receptive fields have reached zzso The spatial extent (or zzso of these receptive fields is zzso by 8 zzso zzso In contrast, the response zzso and time duration of zzso receptive fields do not mature until well beyond 8 zzso zzso zzso By applying zzso analysis to zzso zzso profiles, we have examined the zzso development of spatial and zzso selectivity in the frequency zzso By 8 zzso zzso spatial frequency tuning has clearly reached zzso On the contrary, zzso frequency selectivity remains markedly immature at 8 zzso We have also examined the joint distribution of optimal spatial and zzso zzso From 4 zzso zzso until 8 zzso zzso the range of optimal spatial zzso increases zzso whereas the range of optimal zzso zzso remains largely zzso From 8 zzso zzso until adulthood, there is a large increase in optimal zzso zzso for cells tuned to low spatial zzso For cells tuned to high spatial zzso the distribution of optimal zzso zzso does not change much beyond 8 zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
