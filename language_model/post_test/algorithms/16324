The zzso procedure in zzso (called zzso zzso is particularly designed for zzso analysis using the zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso zzso The program is sufficiently general to handle very complicated statistical models and arbitrary prior zzso This study introduces the zzso procedure and demonstrates the application of the program to quantitative trait locus zzso zzso A real life zzso mapping experiment in wheat female fertility trait was used as an example for the zzso The fertility trait zzso were described under three different models: zzso the zzso model, zzso the zzso model and zzso the zzso zzso zzso One zzso was identified on the second zzso This zzso appears to control the switch of zzso ability of female plants but does not affect the number of seeds produced once the switch is turned zzso
