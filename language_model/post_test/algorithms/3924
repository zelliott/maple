To develop and evaluate an zzso noise reduction method based on a modified zzso means zzso zzso that is zzso to local noise level of CT images and to implement this method in a time frame consistent with clinical zzso 

A zzso efficient technique for local noise zzso directly from CT images was zzso A forward projection, based on a zzso zzso zzso was used to generate the projection data, with a noise model incorporating the effects of the bowtie filter and automatic exposure zzso The noise propagation from projection data to images was zzso zzso The zzso noise map was validated using repeated scans of a zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso was modified to adapt its zzso strength locally based on this noise zzso The performance of this zzso zzso filter was evaluated in phantom studies in terms of zzso and zzso zzso spatial resolution, noise power spectrum zzso zzso zzso spatial resolution using the American College of zzso zzso accreditation zzso and objective zzso spatial resolution using a zzso zzso model observer zzso zzso processing units zzso zzso of this noise map calculation and the zzso zzso filtering were developed to meet demands of clinical zzso zzso zzso was piloted on lower dose scans in clinical zzso 

The local noise level zzso matches the noise distribution determined from multiple repetitive scans of a zzso demonstrated by small variations in the ratio map between the zzso noise map and the one calculated from repeated zzso The phantom studies demonstrated that the zzso zzso filter can reduce noise substantially without degrading the zzso spatial resolution, as illustrated by zzso transfer function and slice sensitivity profile zzso The zzso results show that zzso zzso zzso preserves the shape and peak frequency of the noise power spectrum better than commercial smoothing zzso and indicate that the spatial resolution at low contrast levels is not significantly zzso Both the zzso evaluation using the zzso phantom and the objective evaluation on a zzso detection task using a zzso model observer demonstrate an improvement on zzso zzso The zzso zzso can process and transfer 300 slice images within 5 zzso On patient data, the zzso zzso zzso provides more effective zzso of CT data throughout a volume than standard zzso and may allow significant lowering of radiation zzso After a two week pilot study of lower dose CT zzso and CT zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso groups elected to proceed with permanent zzso of zzso zzso in their zzso and zzso CT zzso 

This work describes and zzso a zzso efficient technique for noise map zzso directly from CT images, and an zzso zzso filtering based on this noise map, on phantom and patient zzso Both the noise map calculation and the zzso zzso filtering can be performed in times that allow integration with clinical zzso The zzso zzso zzso provides effective zzso of CT data throughout a volume, and may allow significant lowering of radiation zzso
