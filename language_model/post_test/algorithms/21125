In comparison to zzso knowledge about zzso (the combination of zzso present on a single zzso is much more useful for zzso association studies and for making zzso about human evolutionary zzso zzso are typically zzso from population zzso data using zzso zzso zzso sequence data represent a promising resource for constructing zzso spanning hundreds of zzso for an zzso In this article, we propose a zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso algorithm, zzso zzso assembly for single zzso for assembling zzso from zzso DNA fragments that have been mapped to a reference zzso zzso The transitions of the zzso chain are generated using zzso zzso on zzso derived from the zzso zzso We have applied our method to zzso zzso using zzso shotgun sequence data from a recently zzso human zzso The high sequence coverage and presence of mate pairs result in fairly long zzso zzso length zzso 350 zzso Based on comparison of the zzso fragments against the individual zzso we demonstrate that the zzso for this individual zzso using zzso are significantly more accurate than the zzso estimated using a previously proposed greedy zzso and a simple zzso zzso Using zzso from the zzso project, we estimate the switch error rate of the zzso zzso using zzso to be quite low, zzso Our zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso represents a general framework for zzso assembly that can be applied to sequence data generated by other sequencing zzso The code implementing the methods and the phased individual zzso can be downloaded from zzso
