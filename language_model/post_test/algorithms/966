The development and zzso of a zzso potential of mean force designed to reproduce the zzso thermodynamics of small molecules and zzso aimed toward applications in zzso prediction and zzso binding free energy prediction is zzso The model, named zzso is based on a zzso of the Surface zzso Born zzso zzso zzso model using explicit zzso free energy zzso calculations and a newly developed zzso zzso free energy zzso motivated by the results of explicit zzso simulations of the thermodynamics of zzso of zzso The zzso model zzso in addition to the more commonly used zzso accessible surface area term, a component corresponding to the attractive zzso zzso This term is found to be important to improve the accuracy of the model, particularly for zzso and hydrogen bonding zzso The model is zzso against the experimental zzso free energies of a set of small organic zzso The model reproduces the experimental zzso free energies of small organic molecules with an accuracy comparable or superior to similar models employing more zzso demanding zzso and/or a more extensive set of zzso
