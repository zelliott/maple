zzso zzso zzso has been proven an essential technique for imaging the structure of cells beyond the range of the light microscope down to the molecular zzso zzso high-resolution views of biological specimens span more than four orders of magnitude in spatial scale, and, as a consequence, are rather difficult to generate zzso Various techniques have been developed towards generating those views, from increasing the sensor array size to implementing serial zzso and zzso zzso and reconstructions obtained by the latter techniques generate multiple three-dimensional zzso zzso that need to be combined together to provide all the zzso zzso In this work, we show how to implement montages within zzso a zzso reconstruction software zzso This work involves some new application of mathematical concepts related to volume preserving transformations and issues of gauge zzso which are essential problems arising from the nature of the observation in an electron zzso The purpose of zzso is to handle those issues as generally as possible in order to correct for most zzso in the zzso reconstructions and allow for a seamless zzso of zzso zzso
