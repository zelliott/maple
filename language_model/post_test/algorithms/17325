The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of zzso water level on the zzso properties of zzso cellulose zzso and zzso zzso cellulose zzso zzso containing either zzso or zzso were manufactured at different water levels using a zzso mixer and were then zzso The water level ranged from 0 to zzso The zzso were evaluated for size, zzso and true density, zzso flow, zzso zzso and zzso sensitivity index zzso zzso the water level affected the size, increased the zzso density and flow properties of the zzso and decreased the zzso and zzso The zzso for both materials were similar and acceptable at each zzso water level up to zzso They both showed poor zzso at higher water zzso Yield values and zzso revealed that zzso and zzso have similar zzso and that both exhibit a plastic component to the deformation zzso The zzso water level had no statistically significant effect on the zzso or the zzso for zzso or zzso zzso did not offer practical advantages over zzso other than better flow in the powder form, which could be attributed to slightly larger particle size and the presence of silicon dioxide in its zzso
