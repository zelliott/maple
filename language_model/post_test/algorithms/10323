zzso zzso Analysis zzso is a widely used zzso approach to process data generated by zzso zzso and zzso experiments such as gene expression zzso The analysis zzso and summarizes discriminating background information zzso GO zzso for sets of genes identified by experiments zzso a set of zzso expressed zzso a zzso The discovered information is zzso by human experts to find biological interpretations of the zzso However, zzso zzso and tests for overrepresentation only individual zzso terms or groups of similar terms and is limited in its ability to uncover complex phenomena involving relationship between multiple zzso terms from various knowledge zzso Also, zzso assumes that zzso describe the whole object of interest, which makes it difficult to apply it to sets of compound objects zzso sets of zzso zzso and to sets of objects having an internal structure zzso protein zzso 

We propose a novel zzso zzso Concept zzso and zzso Analysis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso logic reasoning with statistical zzso to uncover more complex phenomena captured by the zzso We evaluate our approach on large-scale zzso from several zzso experiments and on a clustered zzso genetic interaction network using different biological knowledge zzso The discovered interpretations have lower zzso than the interpretations found by zzso are highly zzso in nature, and include analysis of quantitative and structured information present in the knowledge zzso The results suggest that zzso can boost effectiveness of the processing of zzso zzso
