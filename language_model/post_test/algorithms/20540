The first resonance zzso scattering observation of the zzso zzso region zzso 40 up to 12 zzso of DNA motions is zzso Since the concentration of the studied DNA solution was very low (1 zzso the zzso features reflect internal zzso of the zzso The decomposition of the zzso into zzso clearly indicate three zzso DNA modes: the corresponding zzso are located at the zzso 16, 19, and 23 zzso 1) zzso This result is in agreement with our zzso model of the zzso zzso DNA dynamics zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 13, zzso zzso The fit of the experimental zzso to the theory, using the zzso zzso approach, allowed us to make some conclusions about the model force zzso which could be found by independent zzso energy zzso zzso positions of five zzso DNA peaks, predicted by the model, are zzso
