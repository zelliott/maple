In this paper, we consider the problem of in-depth document zzso In particular, we propose a novel document analysis method, named zzso zzso semantic analysis zzso which enables us to mine local information efficiently from a document with respect to term associations and spatial zzso zzso works by first zzso each document into paragraphs and building a term affinity zzso which represents the frequency of term zzso in a zzso We then conduct a zzso principal component analysis to achieve an optimal semantic zzso This analysis involves finding the leading zzso of the sample zzso zzso of a training set to characterize the lower zzso semantic zzso A hybrid document similarity measure is designed to further improve the performance of this zzso Our zzso is examined in two document zzso retrieval and zzso Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed technique zzso current zzso with respect to accuracy and zzso zzso
