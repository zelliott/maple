In this paper, we propose a large deformation zzso metric mapping zzso to align multiple zzso diffusion weighted imaging zzso data, specifically acquired via hybrid diffusion imaging zzso zzso as zzso We adopt the work given in zzso et zzso zzso and represent the zzso diffusion signal with the zzso zzso orientation reconstruction zzso signal zzso The zzso framework provides the representation of zzso in the zzso and thus reduces memory zzso In addition, since the zzso signal basis is zzso the zzso norm that zzso the differences in zzso signals of any two zzso zzso can be easily zzso as the sum of the squared differences in the zzso expansion zzso In this work, we show that the zzso of the zzso signal due to spatial transformation can be easily defined on the zzso signal zzso We incorporate the zzso signal basis into the zzso framework and derive the zzso descent zzso for zzso with explicit orientation zzso Using real zzso zzso we show that it is important to consider the variation of zzso zzso due to a small change in zzso transformation in the zzso zzso
