Using the zzso zzso zzso crystal zzso method in its linear combination of atomic zzso form, the energy band structure of the four zzso stacks and those of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were calculated both in the absence and presence of their surrounding water zzso For these zzso zzso double zzso basis set was zzso To facilitate the interpretation of the results, the calculations were supplemented by the calculations of the six narrow bands above the zzso band of zzso zzso with zzso Further, the zzso chain as well as the water structures around zzso zzso and zzso respectively, were zzso Three important features have emerged from these zzso zzso The zzso or zzso bands in the fundamental gap are all close to the corresponding zzso zzso zzso The very broad zzso band zzso zzso of the zzso stack is split off to seven narrow bands in the case of zzso zzso (both without and with water) showing that in the energy range of the originally zzso zzso band, states belonging to the sugar, to zzso to zzso and to water mix with the zzso zzso zzso It is apparent that at the zzso with water in three cases the zzso bands are very similar zzso because it has a very narrow zzso band, does not fall into this zzso We have supplemented these calculations by the zzso of correlation effects on the band structures of the base stacks by solving the inverse Dyson equation in its diagonal approximation taken for the zzso the zzso many body zzso theory zzso In all cases the too large fundamental gap decreased by 2-3 zzso In most cases the zzso of the zzso and zzso bands, respectively, decreased (but not in all zzso This unusual behavior is most probably due to the rather large complexity of the zzso From all this emerges the following picture for the charge transport in zzso There is a possibility in short segments of the DNA zzso of a zzso zzso of holes through the zzso base stacks of DNA combined with hopping (and in a lesser degree with zzso The motivation of this large scale zzso was that recently in zzso zzso they have performed high resolution zzso zzso experiments on the structure of the zzso The 8 zzso in them are wrapped around by a DNA zzso of 147 base pairs in the DNA B zzso The most recent investigations have shown that between the DNA zzso zzso from its zzso zzso zzso there is a charge transfer to the positively charged side chains zzso of all zzso and zzso of the zzso at 120 sites of the zzso This would cause a hole zzso in DNA and an electronic one in the zzso
