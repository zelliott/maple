The zzso zzso zzso expression system offers the unique opportunity to zzso express many proteins simultaneously and to control the expression level for every protein zzso By using the expression of fusion zzso of zzso of the green zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso with zzso and zzso zzso and measuring the respective zzso intensity ratios zzso of the expressed proteins by zzso laser scan zzso we were able to measure the amount of each of the individual zzso zzso At equal amounts of injected zzso zzso zzso and zzso we found that approximately zzso zzso zzso per 1 zzso zzso appeared at the surface of the zzso suggesting the coexistence of zzso zzso complexes with zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, when the ratio of injected zzso is increased in zzso of zzso the zzso zzso changes accordingly zzso at a zzso ratio of zzso zzso the zzso zzso is shifted towards a protein complex with zzso zzso zzso In zzso the amount of zzso protein appearing at the surface gets greatly reduced, supporting previous studies that showed that the zzso zzso needs assembly with zzso for surface zzso By using a genetically zzso marker for the zzso zzso zzso we were able to show that the zzso zzso in regions of the zzso which are located directly below the plasma zzso closely resembles that observed directly at the zzso Generally, our study reveals that the zzso zzso of zzso channels in the zzso zzso zzso expression system depends to a great extent on the zzso ratio of the different zzso zzso
