zzso models predict that males should allocate more zzso in zzso where the immediate risk of zzso competition is zzso It has therefore often been argued that males should invest less zzso in zzso with virgin females compared with zzso with already zzso zzso However, with relatively zzso zzso high zzso competition risk will zzso with high zzso competition intensity leading to more unpredictable conditions, as high competition intensity should zzso smaller zzso With the use of a genetic algorithm, we found that males should allocate more zzso in zzso with virgin females when female mating frequency is relatively high, whereas low zzso rates will select for higher effort in zzso with zzso zzso At higher zzso rates, first male zzso zzso zzso larger zzso in zzso with virgin females and second male zzso zzso the zzso These results shed some light on several findings that have been difficult to explain zzso by the zzso developed theory on zzso zzso
