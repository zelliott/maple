This paper investigates zzso for real valued evolutionary zzso on linear fitness zzso We identify the zzso zzso log zzso as a key quantity to understand strategy zzso Knowing the bias of zzso zzso and selection on log zzso is sufficient to explain zzso and strategy behavior in many cases, even from previously reported results on zzso and/or noisy fitness zzso On a linear fitness function, if intermediate zzso is applied on the object zzso the zzso best and the zzso worst individual have the same zzso zzso the correlation between fitness and zzso zzso is zzso Assuming additionally that zzso due to zzso and zzso are zzso then zzso zzso zzso if and only if zzso zzso zzso given zzso zzso zzso zzso show the relevance of the given zzso
