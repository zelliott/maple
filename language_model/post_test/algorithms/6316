Gene expression profiling zzso diagnostic and zzso assessment in zzso but has not yet been applied to zzso zzso We hypothesized that gene expression zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrating that gene expression profiling by clinical parameters is feasible in zzso 

zzso zzso zzso of 48 zzso samples from Johns Hopkins Hospital zzso and the University of Minnesota zzso obtained zzso at transplantation or left zzso assist device zzso placement zzso zzso zzso after zzso support zzso zzso and zzso from newly diagnosed patients zzso zzso were analyzed with prediction analysis of zzso A training set was used to develop the profile and test sets to validate the accuracy of the zzso An zzso prediction profile developed in zzso zzso samples was tested in independent samples from both zzso and zzso with zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity in zzso samples and zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity in both zzso and biopsy zzso The overall sensitivity was zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and specificity was zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso over 210 random partitions of zzso samples into training and test zzso Age, zzso and zzso differences did not affect the zzso accuracy in zzso zzso Select gene expression was confirmed with quantitative zzso chain zzso 

Gene expression profiling accurately predicts zzso zzso is zzso to samples from separate institutions, is specific to disease stage, and is unaffected by differences in clinical zzso This strongly supports ongoing efforts to incorporate expression zzso zzso in determining prognosis and response to therapy in heart zzso
