zzso is an important disease, the impacts of which on vision have been shown to have implications for patients' zzso quality of life zzso The primary aim of this study is to estimate a mapping zzso to predict zzso and zzso utility values based on the zzso measure, the zzso Visual zzso zzso zzso as well as the clinical measures of visual function, that is, integrated visual field, visual zzso and contrast zzso 

zzso least squares zzso zzso and censored least absolute zzso were compared using data taken from the zzso Eye Hospital in London, to assess mapping functions to predict the zzso and zzso from the zzso and tests of visual zzso These models were compared using root mean square error zzso zzso and mean absolute error zzso 

zzso was the best-performing model of the three zzso as this produced the lowest zzso and zzso and the highest zzso 

The models provided initial zzso to convert the zzso to the zzso and zzso Further analysis would be needed to validate the models or zzso
