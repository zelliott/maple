zzso selection of entries from sequence databases with respect to a related functional description, zzso with respect to a common cellular zzso or contributing to the same zzso function, is a difficult zzso Automatic semantic analysis of zzso is not only hampered by incomplete functional zzso A major problem is that zzso are written in a rich, zzso language and are meant for reading by a human zzso This person can extract from the text considerably more information than is immediately apparent due to his extended biological background knowledge and logical zzso 

A technique of automated zzso evaluation based on a combination of zzso analysis and the usage of biological rule libraries has been zzso The proposed zzso generates new functional zzso from the zzso of a given entry using the semantic units of the zzso as zzso for implications executed in accordance with the rule zzso 

The zzso of a software system, the zzso program, is described and the results of its application to sequence attribute assignment and sequence selection problems, such as cellular zzso and sequence domain zzso of zzso entries, are zzso The current software version assigns useful zzso zzso zzso to approximately zzso of all zzso zzso As shown by zzso examples, the combination of sequence and zzso analysis is a powerful approach for the detection of mutual zzso zzso 

zzso for the cellular zzso assignment can be viewed at the zzso zzso zzso
