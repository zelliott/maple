The authors measured the noise and zzso from face-to-face zzso zzso pairs, as well as the noise from zzso zzso placed on the human body surface, in the frequency band from zzso zzso to 500 zzso which zzso to high-resolution zzso zzso zzso noise and zzso zzso were measured simultaneously to compare zzso noise with the zzso noise from the real part of zzso zzso The results show that zzso noise depends on zzso area, zzso zzso the patient, and the placement zzso In the frequency band from zzso zzso to 500 zzso zzso zzso noise is typically less than 1 zzso for zzso placed face-to-face and ranges from 1 zzso to 15 zzso for zzso on the body zzso The noise spectral density increases at low zzso as zzso and it is always higher than the zzso noise from the real part of the zzso zzso There is a high correlation between zzso zzso offset zzso and zzso zzso Thus, offset zzso zzso allow identification of noise from zzso zzso
