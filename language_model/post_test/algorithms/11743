We perform zzso rendering of a zzso mesh at a high speed, independent of its face count, using a zzso structured data representation that avoids edge gap effects from small zzso zzso zzso on the virtual zzso position on the mesh give good results in rendering zzso zzso The zzso allows force zzso and smoothing at convex corners and edges by an approach originally developed for graphic zzso
