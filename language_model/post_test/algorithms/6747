To investigate the usefulness of digital zzso examination zzso and zzso zzso zzso for prostate cancer diagnosis and to propose a diagnostic zzso for zzso cancer screening in subjects with zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso or zzso 

Between January 1992 and March 2000, 129 subjects with zzso levels of zzso or less and abnormal findings on zzso or zzso underwent prostate zzso The subjects were divided into four groups according to the zzso zzso 0 to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso The reliability of the zzso and zzso and the zzso features of prostate cancer were investigated among these four zzso 

Of the 129 subjects, 17 zzso patients with prostate cancer were zzso The detection rate was zzso (1 of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso (7 of zzso and zzso (9 of zzso in subjects with zzso levels of less than zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso The proportion of patients with Stage II, III, and IV was zzso zzso and zzso zzso The percentage with zzso scores of 8 to 10 was zzso The detection rate of abnormal findings on zzso and zzso was zzso (13 of zzso and zzso (7 of zzso zzso Adding zzso to zzso in the screening program of subjects with zzso levels of zzso to zzso zzso increased the detection rate of prostate cancer to zzso (4 of zzso 

zzso prostate biopsy should not be undertaken except for highly suspicious zzso findings in subjects with zzso levels less than zzso zzso The additional use of zzso in subjects with zzso levels of zzso to zzso zzso would improve the sensitivity of prostate cancer zzso The diagnostic zzso proposed in the present study is useful as a screening method for prostate cancer in subjects with zzso levels of zzso zzso or zzso
