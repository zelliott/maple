Both qualitative and quantitative analysis in nuclear medicine can be undermined by zzso noise in zzso clinical zzso zzso the conventional smoothing filters are typically used do reduce noise, they also degrade the image zzso zzso block noise reduction zzso is an zzso filtering approach, which attempts to reduce image noise and maintain image resolution and zzso 

Although a degree of automated flexibility is possible using conventional stationary zzso zzso using a total image zzso Metz zzso resolution and contrast is zzso across the zzso zzso zzso filtering has been applied by others in an attempt to maintain structure whilst reducing zzso instead of zzso the whole image, only a subset is used to determine each zzso zzso zzso the new software zzso zzso shares some common components with other zzso zzso zzso it expressly includes the zzso noise model within a simple and robust zzso that can be applied to a diverse range of clinical zzso 

No additional zzso were seen zzso of zzso during evaluation using simulated and clinical zzso Mean zzso error values indicate zzso processing is equivalent to obtaining an zzso image with at least zzso times the number of zzso
