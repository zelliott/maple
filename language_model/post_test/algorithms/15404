The World Health Organization has endorsed the use of molecular methods for the detection of zzso and drug-resistant zzso as a rapid alternative to zzso zzso In South Africa, the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso have been implemented into reference laboratories for diagnosis of zzso and zzso but their costs have not been fully zzso 

We conducted a detailed reference laboratory cost analysis of new rapid molecular zzso zzso and zzso for tuberculosis testing and zzso testing in South Africa, and compared with the costs of conventional approaches involving zzso zzso liquid zzso culture, and zzso drug sensitivity zzso 

From a laboratory perspective, zzso zzso cost zzso and the zzso line probe zzso cost zzso compared to zzso using conventional automated liquid zzso zzso Laboratory costs of zzso and zzso were most influenced by cost of zzso zzso 

At current public sector pricing, zzso zzso and zzso are comparable in cost to zzso culture and conventional drug sensitivity zzso Overall, reference laboratories must balance costs with performance characteristics and the need for rapid zzso
