In this paper, the zzso control approach to networked control systems zzso is extended to the zzso case with the use of a zzso technique for continuous zzso zzso The derived approach can effectively simultaneously deal with zzso zzso data packet zzso and data packet disorder and leads to a novel model for zzso This model offers the designer the freedom of designing different controllers with respect to specific network conditions, which is distinct from previous results and ensues better system zzso By applying switched system theory, the stability criterion for the derived model is zzso which is then used to obtain an linear zzso zzso stabilized controller design method for the zzso control zzso A zzso example is also zzso which illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed zzso control approach by zzso
