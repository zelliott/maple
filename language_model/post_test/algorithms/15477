The consequences of zzso zzso are examined from the standpoint of the neural control system of the heart, a hierarchy of three zzso centers residing in central command, zzso zzso and intrinsic cardiac zzso The basis of the investigation is the premise that while this zzso control system has evolved to deal with zzso zzso circumstances, its response in the event of zzso zzso is unpredictable because the singular circumstances of this event are as yet not part of its evolutionary zzso The results indicate that the harmonious relationship between the three levels of control breaks down, because of a conflict between the priorities that they have evolved to deal zzso Essentially, while the main priority in central command is blood demand, the priority at the zzso and cardiac levels is heart zzso As a result of this breakdown, heart rate becomes less predictable and therefore less reliable as a diagnostic guide as to the traumatic state of the heart, which it is commonly used as such following an zzso zzso On the basis of these results it is proposed that under the singular conditions of zzso zzso a determination of neural control indexes in addition to cardiovascular indexes has the potential of enhancing clinical zzso
