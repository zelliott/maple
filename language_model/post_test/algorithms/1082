In this report, we describe the zzso and application of a fully automated zzso routine using zzso zzso and zzso for clinical zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso zzso By zzso high-resolution 3-D image data and zzso the results to the spatial zzso slices of a zzso examination, the program offers the possibility to easily calculate zzso maps for a large variety of zzso zzso The segmented data are corrected for the individual zzso function, slice and zzso profiles for measurement sequences with selective zzso as well as for the chemical shifts of different zzso The new method was applied to investigate discrete zzso zzso abnormalities in a small sample of schizophrenic patients in comparison to healthy controls (15 patients, 15 zzso Only after correction was the zzso zzso signal significantly lower in patients compared to zzso No differences were found for the corrected signals from the zzso zzso or zzso compounds zzso These results are in good agreement with zzso and previous MR zzso studies of the zzso in schizophrenic zzso
