To describe the dynamics of constantly activated cardiac muscle, we propose that length affects force via both recruitment and distortion of zzso cross zzso This hypothesis was zzso tested for descriptive and zzso zzso zzso cardiac muscle fibers from animals expressing primarily zzso heavy chain zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso were activated with solutions from zzso zzso to zzso zzso fibers were subjected to zzso length zzso zzso rich in frequency content between zzso and 40 zzso In descriptive validation tests, the model was fit to the ensuing force response zzso in the time zzso In fits to 118 records, the model successfully accounted for most of the measured variation in zzso zzso range, zzso zzso zzso When some residual variations in zzso were not accounted for by the model (as at low zzso there was very little zzso zzso between these residual force variations and the applied zzso input function, indicating that something other than zzso was causing the measured variation in zzso With one exception, model parameters were estimated with standard errors on the order of zzso or zzso Thus parameters of the recruitment component of the model could be uniquely separated from parameters of the distortion component of the model and parameters estimated from any given fiber could be considered unique to that zzso In zzso validation tests, we found that recruitment and distortion parameters were positively correlated with independent assessments of the zzso entity they were assumed to zzso The recruitment distortion model was judged to be valid from both descriptive and zzso perspectives and is, therefore, a useful construct for describing and explaining dynamic zzso relationships in constantly activated cardiac zzso
