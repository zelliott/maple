zzso What's known on the zzso and What does the study zzso The exact zzso of zzso injury during zzso zzso procedures is not zzso however, it is an uncommon zzso Also, the optimal treatment zzso is not well delineated and the efficacy of successfully treating minor injuries to the zzso without resorting to zzso is not well described in the zzso zzso This study outlines the rate of zzso injury during a variety of zzso zzso procedures and we outline a treatment zzso that has been successfully employed in the management of these patients, which in all cases, did not lead to zzso An important point is also that multiple zzso zzso measures should be used when a zzso injury is recognized and that a thorough search should ensue when suspicion of an zzso zzso injury exists, as an zzso zzso injury may lead to severe post operative zzso zzso 

zzso To evaluate zzso risk factors for, and management of zzso zzso injury in our zzso patient zzso 

zzso All patients undergoing zzso zzso upper tract procedures at two institutions between January 2001 and April 2006 and January 2000 and December 2008, respectively, were zzso examined for zzso zzso From these patients, those with zzso zzso injuries were selected and zzso zzso zzso factors zzso patients to zzso injury were evaluated and the management plan for each patient was zzso to identify optimal treatment zzso 

zzso Of zzso patients undergoing upper tract zzso zzso surgery, 14 patients zzso sustained zzso injury and underwent zzso surgery, 13 via a zzso zzso zzso In 12 of the 14 patients, the zzso injury was recognized zzso and all were effectively managed zzso with a combination of zzso beam zzso biological zzso agent zzso zzso Deerfield, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and Johnson, Somerville, NJ, zzso none of these patients required zzso or developed any zzso zzso zzso In two patients, the zzso injury was not recognized zzso both patients presented with delayed zzso zzso open zzso in each zzso 

zzso zzso injuries are uncommon during zzso zzso surgery, but when a significant zzso injury occurs, it can be effectively managed zzso using conservative measures, without need for zzso zzso If the zzso injury is not recognized zzso delayed zzso is likely to occur zzso emergent zzso and zzso zzso zzso and accurate zzso diagnosis of zzso injury is critical for achieving a good zzso
