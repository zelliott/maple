Patients presenting to the emergency department zzso currently face zzso delays in initial treatment, and long, costly hospital stays due to zzso initial zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso should focus not only on initial treatment priority, but also on prediction of medical risk and nursing needs to improve zzso decisions and to simplify early discharge zzso Different zzso scores have been proposed, such as the Manchester zzso system zzso Yet, these scores focus only on treatment priority, have zzso performance and lack validation in the Swiss health care zzso Because the zzso will be introduced into clinical routine at the zzso zzso we propose a large prospective cohort study to zzso initial patient zzso Specifically, the aim of this trial is to derive a zzso zzso zzso to better predict zzso treatment zzso zzso medical risk and thus need for zzso zzso zzso zzso care needs of patients at the most zzso time point of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso cohort zzso We will include all consecutive medical patients seeking zzso care into this zzso zzso There will be no zzso except for zzso and zzso zzso Vital signs will be recorded and left over blood samples will be stored for later batch analysis of blood zzso Upon zzso admission, the zzso care discharge score zzso will be zzso zzso zzso physicians will zzso zzso priority based on all available results at the time of zzso discharge to the medical zzso Patients will be zzso daily during the hospital course for medical stability and readiness for discharge from the nurses and if involved social workers zzso To assess zzso data from electronic medical records will be used and all patients will be contacted 30 days after hospital admission to assess vital and functional status, zzso satisfaction with care and quality of life zzso We aim to include between zzso and zzso patients over one year of recruitment to derive the zzso zzso zzso The respective main zzso were defined as zzso initial zzso priority zzso zzso low zzso adjudicated by the attending zzso physician at zzso zzso zzso adverse 30 day outcome zzso or intensive care unit zzso within 30 days following zzso admission to assess patients risk and thus need for zzso treatment and zzso post acute care needs after hospital zzso defined as transfer of patients to a zzso care institution, for early recognition and planning of zzso care zzso Other outcomes are time to first physician zzso time to initiation of adequate medical therapy, time to social worker involvement, length of hospital stay, reasons for discharge delays, patient's satisfaction with care, overall hospital costs and patients care needs after returning zzso 

Using a reliable initial zzso system for zzso initial treatment priority, need for zzso treatment and zzso care needs is an innovative and persuasive approach for a more targeted and efficient management of medical patients in the zzso The proposed interdisciplinary , zzso project has unprecedented potential to improve initial zzso decisions and zzso resource allocation to the zzso patients from admission to zzso The zzso derived in this study will be compared in a later zzso controlled trial against a usual care control group in terms of resource use, length of hospital stay, overall costs and patient's outcomes in terms of zzso zzso quality of life and satisfaction with zzso
