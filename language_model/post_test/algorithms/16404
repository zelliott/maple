zzso sampling is popular in zzso research because of its cost and time zzso In a zzso zzso model, with limited knowledge on the zzso zzso of the point zzso of the zzso zzso a zzso there exists no fixed sample size zzso In this study, we propose a zzso sequential analysis, in which the optimal sample fraction and the required sample size to achieve a predetermined volume of a joint confidence set are estimated in an interim zzso zzso required observations are collected in the second stage according to the estimated optimal sample zzso At the end of the experiment, data from these two stages are combined and analyzed for statistical zzso zzso studies are conducted to justify the proposed zzso procedure and an example is presented for zzso It is found that the proposed zzso procedure performs adequately in the sense that the zzso joint confidence set has a zzso volume and achieves the required coverage zzso Furthermore, the optimal sample zzso among all the selected scenarios are close to zzso zzso the proposed procedure can be simplified by always considering a balance zzso
