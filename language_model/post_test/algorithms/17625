Compare the energy zzso predicted by zzso zzso with that measured by continuous zzso indirect zzso in zzso critically ill children during the early zzso zzso 

zzso clinical zzso 

zzso intensive care unit of a pediatric university zzso 

A total of 43 zzso critically ill children during the first 6 zzso after zzso 

An indirect zzso was used to continuously measure the energy expenditure for 24 zzso 

Clinical data collected were age, zzso actual and ideal weight, zzso and body zzso zzso status was assessed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso of illness was determined by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Index, and zzso zzso zzso zzso Energy expenditure was measured zzso by continuous zzso indirect zzso for 24 zzso zzso Energy zzso zzso was calculated using the zzso zzso zzso Food and zzso Health zzso Nation Union, zzso zzso zzso zzso and Hunter zzso using the actual and ideal zzso zzso and zzso were compared using paired zzso zzso linear correlation zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Mean zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso zzso Most of the zzso equations overestimated zzso in zzso critically ill children during the early zzso zzso zzso and zzso differed significantly zzso except when the zzso and the zzso equations were zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso and zzso was excellent zzso for the zzso zzso Food and zzso Health zzso Nation Union, zzso and zzso zzso The zzso method showed poor zzso the zzso equation was the best predictor of energy expenditure zzso 38 zzso precision, zzso 179 zzso The accuracy in the medical group was higher zzso zzso than in surgical patients zzso zzso 

zzso equations do not accurately predict energy expenditure in zzso critically ill children during the early zzso zzso if available, indirect zzso must be zzso
