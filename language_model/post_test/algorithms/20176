Automatic zzso of zzso for zzso imaging scenarios poses novel challenges to zzso decision systems, which are mostly attributed to the dynamics of the image acquisition zzso Such challenges demand that automatic systems are able to give robust zzso of zzso irrespective of camera zzso zzso and zzso zzso when viewing the inner surface of the gastrointestinal zzso In this paper, we study the zzso properties of zzso filters and propose a novel zzso the zzso zzso features zzso We show that our proposed zzso is zzso to scale, zzso and zzso changes in the zzso We integrate these new features in a zzso framework zzso to zzso images from two complementary zzso imaging scenarios zzso and zzso zzso broadly into three different groups: normal, zzso and zzso zzso show that they compare favorably to using state-of-the-art texture zzso for both imaging zzso
