To present the current understanding of factor V zzso and activated protein C resistance, and to propose a laboratory testing zzso 

Publications on zzso with the terms factor V zzso or activated protein C resistance through mid 2001, as well as publications in the zzso files, were screened for inclusion in this zzso 

Original studies that report a novel finding on testing or clinical features of activated protein C resistance or factor V zzso are zzso Data zzso novel or key findings from the selected studies are zzso 

zzso C and protein S are the integral components of an zzso zzso that limits zzso conversion to zzso through the degradation of factors Va and zzso When factor Va is resistant to degradation by activated protein C, this zzso zzso does not operate properly, and patients have an increased risk for zzso This report describes the protein zzso S pathway, the significance of activated protein C resistance and the factor V zzso zzso and the clinical testing used to detect activated protein C resistance and the factor V zzso zzso A proposed laboratory testing zzso is also zzso 

Factor V zzso is a risk factor for zzso zzso and it is particularly common in white zzso A laboratory testing zzso is zzso
