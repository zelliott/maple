An important class of substances in clinical chemistry are zzso in body zzso which are accessible by zzso zzso without sample treatment using zzso fast and readily automated in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso sensing systems are under development for the determination of blood zzso especially for diabetic patients or for monitoring in intensive care and zzso zzso diffuse zzso zzso of skin was employed allowing a certain tissue volume to be zzso zzso For zzso the partial zzso zzso zzso was used either based on wide spectral intervals or using special spectral variable zzso zzso blood zzso reference zzso were obtained by finger zzso and an automated laboratory method zzso Clear evidence is provided for the physical effect, as zzso by the spectral zzso zzso underlying the individual zzso zzso models, which still require improvements in the methodology in the zzso and zzso concentration zzso In extending the potential of zzso blood zzso by infrared zzso a novel technique is presented for probing the zzso fluid space by using fast spectral zzso zzso of skin zzso The zzso blood spectrum can be derived from zzso zzso of oral zzso by zzso analysis zzso zzso Future applications and prospects for zzso blood zzso are zzso
