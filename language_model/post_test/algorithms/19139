To study the clinically relevant relative zzso effectiveness zzso of zzso treatments with high linear energy transfer zzso radiation and to identify the important factors that might influence the transfer of tolerance and zzso levels from low LET zzso These are important questions in the light of the growing interest for the therapeutic use of radiation with higher LET than electrons or zzso 

The zzso of various zzso schedules was analyzed with theoretical models for radiation effect, and the resulting predictions were compared with the published clinical and experimental data regarding zzso zzso with high LET zzso 

The clinically relevant zzso increased for greater doses per zzso in contrast to the predictions from zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso for zzso zzso appeared to modify more quickly than that for zzso zzso These aspects have quite important clinical zzso because the increased zzso effectiveness reported for this type of radiation would otherwise support the use of zzso Thus, the differential between acute and zzso zzso could put the zzso normal zzso at more risk from high LET zzso however, at the same time, it could increase the therapeutic window for zzso zzso 

The modification of the zzso with the dose per fraction must be carefully taken into consideration when devising zzso treatments with high LET zzso zzso to do so might result in an avalanche of complications that could obscure the potential advantages of the therapeutic use of this type of zzso
