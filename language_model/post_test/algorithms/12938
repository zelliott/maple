The three-dimensional zzso shape measurement using zzso zzso grating is advantageous for the high contrast of zzso This paper presents a method for measuring zzso isolated objects using zzso zzso zzso Two zzso grating with horizontal position difference of one-third of a period and an zzso pattern are zzso The phase distribution of fringe pattern is obtained by zzso analysis zzso The measurement depth and range is enlarged because the third harmonic component and background zzso is eliminated with proposed zzso The fringe order is identified by the zzso zzso Three gray levels are used and the pattern is converted to zzso image with error diffusion zzso The tolerance of zzso pattern is zzso It is suited for zzso optical zzso We also present a measurement system with a modified zzso projector and a high-speed zzso The 3-D surface acquisition speed of 60 frames per second zzso with resolution of 640 zzso zzso points and that of 120 zzso with resolution of 320 zzso 240 points are zzso If the control logic of zzso was modified and a camera with higher speed was zzso the measurement speed would reach thousands zzso This makes it possible to analyze dynamic zzso
