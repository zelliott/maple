The New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services zzso with support from the Agency for zzso Substances and Disease zzso zzso conducted an zzso study of childhood zzso and nervous system zzso that occurred in the period 1979 through 1996 in Dover Township, Ocean County, New zzso The zzso study explored a wide variety of possible risk factors, including environmental zzso zzso and zzso determined that completed human exposure pathways to groundwater zzso occurred in the past through private and community water supplies zzso the water distribution system serving the zzso To investigate this exposure, a model of the water distribution system was developed and zzso through an extensive field zzso The components of this water distribution system, such as number of pipes, number of tanks, and number of supply zzso in the network, changed significantly over a zzso period zzso the time frame established for the zzso zzso Data on the historical management of this system was zzso Thus, it was necessary to investigate alternative ways to reconstruct the operation of the system and test the sensitivity of the system to various alternative zzso Manual reconstruction of the historical water supply to the system in order to provide this sensitivity analysis was time-consuming and zzso zzso given the complexity of the system and the time constraints imposed on the zzso To address these issues, the problem was formulated as an zzso problem, where it was assumed that the water distribution system was operated in an optimum manner at all times to satisfy the constraints in the zzso The solution to the zzso problem provided the historical water supply strategy in a consistent manner for each month of the study zzso The zzso of the selected historical water supply strategy was addressed by the zzso of a second model, which was based on the first zzso Numerous other sensitivity analyses were also conducted using these two zzso Both models are solved using a zzso progressive zzso zzso along with genetic zzso zzso and the zzso water distribution network zzso This process reduced the required solution time and generated a historically consistent water supply strategy for the water distribution zzso
