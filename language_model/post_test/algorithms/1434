This paper describes the applications of an inverse planning zzso zzso to the real clinical problem of prostate zzso The zzso has been designed to zzso zzso zzso taking full account of three-dimensional spatial information of dose inside the zzso The zzso is based on fast simulated zzso utilizing a zzso containing both linear and zzso zzso The linear part of the cost function allows for the zzso of zzso in the zzso computation, which reduces the calculation time by a factor of about zzso It has been applied to zzso zzso zzso for a zzso and a zzso prostate treatment zzso It is shown for the zzso plan that the zzso zzso can zzso and even slightly improve on, the results of an experienced human zzso For the zzso plan, the human planner experienced difficulty finding zzso that gave an acceptable dose zzso It is shown that the zzso zzso can achieve good results in this zzso The outcome of the zzso of the zzso plan prompted an investigation into the best results that could be achieved by an zzso zzso zzso zzso The results of this investigation are presented and it is shown that the limiting factor for zzso therapy of the prostate is the size of the overlap volume between the planning target volume zzso and the zzso Finally, the efficiency and accuracy of fast simulated zzso is compared with that of classical simulated zzso The former was found to be at least 10 times faster for the problem zzso
