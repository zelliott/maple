Several geometric zzso have been applied to estimate left zzso wall volume zzso from two-dimensional zzso but have not been validated in eccentrically zzso zzso These zzso can be fitted to the general formula: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso where zzso and zzso are the outer zzso and inner zzso zzso areas, Lo and Li are the corresponding zzso zzso and k is a zzso The simplifying assumption that Lo and Li are equal yields zzso zzso zzso where zzso zzso zzso - zzso In 20 zzso dogs zzso zzso including 10 with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the relationship between actual zzso zzso zzso and zzso was not significantly different from the line of identity zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso r zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso zzso indicating k was not significantly different from zzso There was no significant difference between predicted and actual zzso over a range of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso The simple zzso product, zzso accurately predicts zzso of both normal and zzso zzso canine left zzso and is thus suitable for serial observations of zzso adaptation to volume zzso
