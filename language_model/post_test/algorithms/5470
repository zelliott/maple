zzso dynamics is a commonly used technique in zzso zzso One key issue of each molecular dynamics simulation is: When does this simulation reach equilibrium zzso A widely used way to determine this is the visual and intuitive inspection of root mean square zzso zzso plots of the zzso Although this technique has been criticized several times, it is still often zzso zzso we present a study proving that this method is not reliable at zzso We conducted a survey with participants from the field in which we illustrated different zzso plots to scientists in the field of molecular zzso These plots were zzso and zzso using a statistical model and different zzso of the zzso We show that there is no mutual consent about the point of zzso The decisions are severely biased by different zzso zzso we conclude that scientists should not discuss the zzso of a molecular dynamics simulation on the basis of a zzso zzso
