zzso equations zzso are concise and zzso mathematical descriptions of population zzso used widely to address spatial problems in applied and theoretical zzso We assessed the potential of zzso zzso to approximate over very large time and space scales the spatial zzso resulting from social behaviors such as swarming and zzso in which populations are subdivided into many groups of variable size, zzso and directional zzso We developed a simple zzso scheme to estimate zzso in zzso zzso from zzso model zzso zzso zzso responses between neighbors within groups zzso and zzso affected how populations zzso zzso and swarming zzso and schooling populations with weak alignment zzso were well zzso by zzso zzso For these behaviors, zzso estimates such as ours could enhance realism and efficiency in zzso models of social zzso zzso populations with strong alignment were poorly zzso because (in contradiction to assumptions underlying the zzso zzso effective diffusion and zzso were not uniquely defined functions of local zzso zzso forms other than zzso are apparently required to approximate strongly aligning zzso
