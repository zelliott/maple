Both a large zzso volume and abnormalities in diffusion zzso imaging are independently associated with a poor prognosis after cerebral zzso zzso we assume that they are zzso This study assessed the associations between zzso volumes and diffusion zzso imaging in patients with a zzso cerebral zzso 

The zzso volumes of 33 patients (age zzso zzso zzso 26 males and 7 zzso were zzso using zzso zzso zzso in the acute phase zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso in the chronic phase zzso at 12 months, with a range of zzso zzso The zzso fractional zzso zzso and mean zzso zzso values were measured at the site of the zzso and selected white matter zzso Neurological tests in both the acute and chronic zzso and zzso zzso were assessed with the zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso therapy zzso zzso 10) were assessed with the zzso U zzso The correlations between the measured parameters were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correction was used to compensate for the zzso error rate in multiple zzso 

Several MD values in the right zzso correlated positively and zzso values zzso with the zzso zzso These correlations included both zzso area and healthy zzso The results of the zzso state examination and the National Institutes of Health Stroke zzso also correlated with the zzso zzso 

A larger zzso volume is associated with more pronounced tissue modifications in the chronic stage as observed with the MD and zzso zzso
