A quantitative zzso for comparing restriction zzso patterns zzso was developed and used to estimate the zzso similarity of 18 zzso of zzso virus of known zzso zzso of this zzso using either zzso or zzso differences between zzso sizes were investigated with regard to their ability to zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to represent zzso the zzso zzso among samples, with 3 dimensions producing the most meaningful zzso The zzso transformation provided more zzso zzso The first dimension differentiated samples zzso separating North American from European zzso The second and third dimensions differentiated zzso with specific gene deletions zzso and zzso zzso from those not having these zzso zzso of zzso were identified that were related either by collection from the same geographic area during a specific time period, or by laboratory intervention to create zzso These methods offer increased precision in the determination of genetic zzso based on zzso and thus offer increased diagnostic accuracy for the determination of sources of zzso
