An zzso was made between zzso point calculations with five commercial computer treatment planning systems used in zzso Sixteen Italian zzso medical physics institutions performed a twofold test, respectively for point and linear sources, zzso actual clinical implants and the results were compared to references zzso The test was designed in order to determine the errors introduced separately by zzso and by implant reconstruction via zzso zzso The results show that for point sources a better accuracy can be achieved than for linear zzso It is also shown that a large variation of results exists between zzso systems and the zzso is larger for linear zzso The zzso procedure adds a large amount of zzso In the whole set of calculation points, the overall percent difference between zzso and reference zzso values is larger than zzso zzso in zzso cases for point and in zzso cases for linear sources, with data input by zzso It seems that relevant errors do occur when computing actual dose rates, resulting in clinically relevant zzso in the calculated absorbed dose and in its relative zzso
