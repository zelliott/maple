The present paper suggests a new zzso for zzso of peak positions in zzso zzso It is shown theoretically and zzso that the new technique yields superior results compared to the currently applied techniques, when the noise level is high and/or the zzso are located close to each zzso Cases are presented where the zzso from the true mass could be mistaken for space charge effect, while the shift is in fact solely due to the shortcomings of the current techniques and can be corrected by applying the zzso zzso In two out of three cases, this technique gave more accurate zzso zzso result compared to the conventional zzso In the third case, where the signal was high compared to the noise, the results were zzso The new technique can be used to achieve better mass accuracy for noisy and not well resolved zzso and to further investigate the features of the space charge zzso
