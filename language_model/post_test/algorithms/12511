zzso zzso pulmonary disease zzso is a major cause of death in the United States, but most persons who have zzso obstruction have never been diagnosed with lung zzso This zzso COPD zzso affects health status, and COPD patients may have increased health care zzso several years before the initial diagnosis of COPD is zzso 

To investigate whether zzso patterns derived from analysis of administrative claims data using a zzso function zzso could be used to identify zzso COPD zzso 

Each patient who had a new diagnosis of COPD during the study period (N zzso zzso was matched to as many as 3 control subjects by age and zzso zzso were assigned an index date that was identical to that of the corresponding case, and then all health care zzso for cases and controls for the 24 months prior to the initial COPD diagnosis was compared using zzso zzso zzso zzso that were significantly associated with COPD were then entered into a zzso function zzso This zzso was then validated using a separate patient zzso 

In the main model, 19 zzso characteristics were significantly associated with zzso zzso although most of the power of the zzso function zzso was concentrated in a few of these zzso The main model was able to identify COPD patients in the validation population of adult subjects aged 40 years and older (N zzso zzso with a sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso even without having information on the history of tobacco use for the majority of the zzso Models developed and tested on only 12 months of zzso data performed zzso 

zzso function zzso based on health care zzso data can be developed that have sufficient positive zzso value to be used as screening tools to identify individuals at risk for having zzso zzso
