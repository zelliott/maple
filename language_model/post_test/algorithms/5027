zzso tools have become an essential part of the tool kit of the molecular zzso and provide techniques for detecting zzso zzso recognizing functional zzso zzso and analyzing the three-dimensional structure for any given protein zzso Although a wealth of structural and functional information is available for a large number of members of the various classes of zzso zzso many more members remain zzso These zzso tools that are freely and easily accessible to the scientific community provide an excellent starting point to predict the structural and functional properties of such partially or fully zzso protein zzso and can lead to elegantly designed experiments to probe the hypothesized zzso This chapter discusses various zzso analysis tools with a focus on protein structure and function zzso
