Video zzso zzso is one of the most commonly used techniques for gaze tracking because it enables zzso eye detection and zzso zzso the eye zzso accuracy and tolerance to user head movements is a common task in the field of gaze zzso thus, a thorough study of how zzso information can improve a gaze tracking system's accuracy and tolerance to user head movements has been carried zzso The analysis is focused on zzso methods and systems with one and two infrared zzso New mapping features are proposed based on the commonly used zzso zzso using different distances as the zzso zzso For this study, an experimental procedure with six users based on a real zzso gaze tracking system was performed, and the results were contrasted with an eye zzso Important conclusions have been obtained in terms of zzso zzso and mapping features, such as the outperformance of the zzso distance as the zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso gaze tracking system was found to have a similar or improved level of accuracy compared to that of the zzso gaze tracking zzso
