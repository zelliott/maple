zzso zzso imaging has been used widely in diffusion magnetic resonance imaging due to the difficulties in correcting zzso phase corruption in zzso zzso zzso zzso has addressed the zzso problem by introducing a two-dimensional zzso zzso correction with online zzso of zzso data to enable acquisition of high-resolution diffusion data with reduced zzso artifact and zzso zzso The primary shortcoming of zzso zzso in its current form is its long acquisition time zzso than similar resolution zzso zzso imaging protocols by approximately the number of zzso zzso which limits the number of diffusion zzso By omitting zzso segments at one side of zzso and using partial zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging times could be zzso In this study, the effects of zzso and projection onto convex sets reconstructions on estimates of the fractional zzso mean zzso and diffusion orientation in fiber tracts and raw zzso and zzso signal are zzso along with zzso ratio zzso It is found that projections onto convex sets reconstruction with zzso segments in a 2 zzso zzso diffusion zzso image acquisition and zzso segments in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso image acquisition provide good zzso relative to the full zzso zzso This allows application of zzso zzso to zzso studies, and clinical stroke and zzso zzso
