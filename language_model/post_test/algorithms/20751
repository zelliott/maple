We study a zzso lattice model describing the dynamics of coexistence of two interacting biological zzso The model zzso the local processes of birth, death, and diffusion of individuals of each species and is grounded on interaction of the zzso zzso The species coexistence can be of two zzso With zzso coupled time zzso of population zzso and without zzso We perform zzso simulations of the model on a square lattice and analyze the zzso behavior of each species by computing the time correlation functions as well as the spectral zzso This analysis provides an appropriate characterization of the different types of zzso It is also used to examine linked population cycles in nature and in zzso
