A first accurate measurement of the complex zzso index in an zzso emulsion is demonstrated, and thereby the average zzso particle size using standard zzso scattering calculations is zzso Our method is based on measurement and modeling of the zzso of a divergent laser beam from the sample zzso In the absence of any definitive reference data for the complex zzso index or particle size in highly zzso zzso zzso we base our claim of accuracy on the fact that our work offers several critically important advantages over previously reported zzso First, our zzso are in zzso in the sense that they do not require any sample zzso thus eliminating dilution zzso Second, our theoretical model does not employ any fitting parameters other than the two quantities we seek to zzso zzso the real and imaginary parts of the zzso index, thus eliminating ambiguities arising from multiple extraneous fitting zzso Third, we fit the entire zzso data curve instead of focusing on only the critical angle region, which is just a small subset of the zzso Finally, despite our use of highly scattering opaque samples, our experiment uniquely zzso a key assumption behind the zzso scattering zzso zzso no multiple scattering zzso Further proof of our zzso zzso is given by the fact that our measured particle size finds good agreement with the value obtained by dynamic light zzso
