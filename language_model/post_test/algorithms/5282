In zzso beam treatments accurate dose calculation of the absorbed dose in the zzso region is of major importance, in particular when the target has superficial extension close to the zzso In most zzso treatment planning systems zzso calculations depend on the experimental zzso introduced by the user in which accuracy might be limited by the type of detector employed to perform zzso To zzso the zzso between zzso calculated and delivered dose in the zzso region, near the skin of a patient, independent zzso Carlo zzso simulations using the zzso code were zzso zzso zzso obtained with zzso simulations were compared with those given by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Algorithm zzso implemented in the commercial zzso zzso 

A zzso phantom was used to approximate the breast zzso of a patient for zzso simulations and the zzso zzso of the absorbed doses were performed for 6 and zzso beams for four different angles of zzso 15 degrees , 30 degrees , 45 degrees and 75 degrees and different field zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso doses along the phantom central axis were obtained with both the zzso zzso and the AAA and compared to those estimated by the zzso zzso Additionally, a breast patient case was calculated with two opposed zzso zzso beams using all the aforementioned zzso and zzso zzso 

For the zzso zzso beam in the phantom case, both the zzso zzso and the AAA tend to underestimate the absorbed dose in the zzso region in comparison to zzso zzso These differences are clinically irrelevant and are included in a zzso zzso This tendency is also confirmed in the breast patient zzso For the zzso beam the zzso zzso zzso the absorbed dose with respect to the zzso In comparison to zzso simulations the zzso zzso tends to underestimate the dose after the first zzso of tissue for larger angles but seems to be in good agreement for smaller zzso In the first zzso of depth instead the zzso tends to overestimate the dose for smaller angles and underestimate it for larger angle of zzso Instead, the AAA zzso absorbed doses with respect to zzso results for all angles of zzso and at all zzso This zzso seems to be due to the electron contamination model, which is not able to provide accurate absorbed doses in the zzso zzso Even for this case the differences are unlikely to be of clinical significance as zzso is not usually used to treat superficial zzso 

The zzso zzso and the AAA implemented in the zzso Eclipse system version zzso both yield equivalent calculations, after the first zzso of zzso of the absorbed dose for zzso zzso beams when a grid size smaller than zzso is zzso When zzso zzso beams are used care should be taken because the results of the AAA are highly dependent on the beam zzso
