This study compared the effect of 2 techniques of zzso zzso and zzso enlargement zzso zzso incision with zzso repair and sheath closure using a zzso zzso gliding resistance and on the zzso of triggering following zone 2 zzso zzso repairs in human zzso zzso 

In zzso gliding resistance and the zzso of triggering were determined in 10 human zzso specimens under 5 progressive conditions: zzso intact, zzso zzso repair (both zzso cut and repaired with the sheath zzso zzso condition 2 plus 50% venting of the zzso zzso zzso zzso condition 2 with venting extended to zzso of zzso zzso and zzso condition 4 plus zzso zzso zzso was determined in the same specimens by 2 zzso zzso that detected force changes in the load cells used to measure gliding zzso 

zzso repair increased gliding resistance from the intact condition by an average of zzso zzso resistance was reduced in conditions 3, 4, and 5 from the repair condition by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso commenced with zzso repair in some zzso and its zzso increased with 50% zzso Further venting reduced zzso but not as effectively as zzso enlargement zzso 

In this zzso study, venting and zzso enlargement reduce gliding resistance by equivalent zzso zzso persisted despite zzso The surgeon should carefully examine zzso repairs for free zzso zzso enlargement might be more effective than venting in reducing the zzso of zzso
