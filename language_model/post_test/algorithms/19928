Large amounts of zzso zzso interaction zzso data have been generated and are available for public zzso From a systems biology perspective, zzso interactions zzso the key mechanisms distinguishing disease and health, and such mechanisms can be uncovered through network zzso An effective network analysis tool should integrate different zzso zzso databases into a comprehensive network format with a zzso platform to identify key functional zzso and the underlying mechanisms of disease and zzso 

zzso zzso seven publicly available zzso databases into a zzso knowledge zzso zzso expansion is achieved by expanding a user supplied zzso list with interactions from its integrated zzso zzso The statistically significant functional zzso are determined by applying a fast zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso Algorithm for zzso The functional zzso can be zzso either separately or together in the context of the whole zzso zzso of zzso information enables enrichment analysis and assessment of the biological function of zzso Three case studies are presented using publicly available disease gene signatures as a basis to discover new zzso for acute zzso systemic lupus zzso and breast zzso The results demonstrated that zzso can not only identify functional zzso and pathways related to the studied diseases, but this information can also be used to zzso novel zzso for future zzso 

zzso is a free zzso network analysis tool that provides a systematic insight into zzso interactions through examining significant functional zzso The identified functional zzso are useful for determining underlying mechanisms of disease and zzso zzso It can be zzso at: zzso
