zzso are folded structures in zzso molecules that perform essential functions as part of cellular zzso machinery and regulatory zzso The prediction of these structures in zzso molecules has important implications in zzso drug zzso It has been shown that the prediction of zzso is an zzso zzso zzso structure prediction zzso based on free energy zzso employ a restricted problem class and dynamic zzso However, these zzso are zzso very expensive, and their accuracy zzso if the input sequence containing the zzso is too zzso zzso methods can be more efficient, but do not guarantee an optimal solution in regards to the minimum free energy zzso We present zzso a new zzso zzso for the detection of zzso in zzso sequences as a preliminary step for structure zzso Our method uses a hybrid sequence matching and free energy zzso approach to perform a screening of the primary zzso We select short sequence fragments as possible candidates that may contain zzso and verify them by using an existing dynamic programming zzso and a minimum weight independent set zzso zzso is significantly more accurate in detecting zzso compared to other common methods as reported in the zzso It is very efficient and therefore a practical zzso especially for long zzso The zzso has been implemented in Python and it also uses zzso code from several other known zzso The code is available from zzso
