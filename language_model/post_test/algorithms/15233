zzso Networks zzso are versatile zzso models zzso to many different biological zzso In biological applications the structure of the network is usually unknown and needs to be zzso from experimental zzso zzso is a fast software zzso of an exact zzso for finding the optimal structure of the network given a number of experimental zzso Its second version, presented in this article, represents a major improvement over the previous zzso The improvements include zzso a zzso learning zzso leading to an order of magnitude zzso in zzso structure learning time; zzso inclusion of an additional scoring function based on mutual information zzso zzso possibility of choosing the resulting network specificity based on statistical criteria and zzso a new module for zzso by zzso including zzso scheme and zzso quality zzso with receiver operator characteristic zzso
