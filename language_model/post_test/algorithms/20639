zzso zzso density is believed to decline in normal zzso To test this hypothesis, we measured the density of zzso zzso receptors in zzso in the zzso of normal living humans by using the zzso zzso This method determines the zzso zzso zzso density in the human brain with an occupying zzso zzso zzso and a zzso (labeled zzso The method was examined zzso and the assumptions underlying the method were shown to be zzso The validation included comparison of the representation of zzso metabolism by zzso liquid zzso and model zzso calculation of the lumped constant zzso from the value of its zzso and comparable zzso partition zzso in zzso and in zzso In error analysis, the method consistently performed as well as the direct zzso zzso at statistical noise levels appropriate for the zzso used in these zzso The method revealed that the density of the zzso receptors that bind zzso in the zzso nucleus of normal humans declined zzso per year after the age of 18 zzso
