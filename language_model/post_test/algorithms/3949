To improve cardiovascular research, there is a growing need for zzso characterization in small zzso We developed a method, zzso zzso zzso for measuring zzso diameter, zzso and zzso media thickness zzso In this study zzso was used to automatically characterize the zzso of premature rabbit zzso Automatic zzso were compared with manual zzso both performed by three zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The variation in the measured diameter, zzso and zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso The zzso correlation zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso The evaluation revealed that it is feasible to use zzso on zzso images of arteries with small dimensions, which makes it a useful tool for zzso characterization in small zzso
