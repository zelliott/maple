The zzso zzso rule, which states that a linear relationship exists between the standard zzso and zzso for simple, zzso liquids and their solutions, has been used to distinguish associated zzso liquids from simple zzso zzso The exact character of the zzso plots depends on the standard states chosen for the zzso and zzso We examine the effects of using number density for both vapor and liquid states for pure liquids, zzso solutions, zzso solutions and solutions in which water is the zzso The utility of zzso plots to detect zzso order is strengthened, and we also find remarkable changes in the modified zzso zzso zzso the points for small, zzso liquids, including water, are pulled below the general zzso line; zzso many solutions containing small, simple zzso have negative zzso of zzso and zzso solutions of water in several organic zzso relevant to studies of proteins and zzso appear zzso
