In this paper a control and zzso procedure for bone zzso simulations was adopted to study the effect of the zzso influence range on the predicted density zzso In order to reach this goal, the zzso network regulating bone zzso process in a zzso bone sample was zzso zzso The assumed zzso zzso bone zzso rule was related to the error signal between the strain energy density and a selected zzso zzso the control parameters and the target were zzso determined minimizing a suitable cost zzso the goal was to minimize the final mass and the energy thus maximizing the zzso The zzso model results show that the developed and adapted zzso structure was consistent with the applied loads and only depended on the external forces, the value of the cost index, the maximum zzso elastic zzso value zzso the maximum density zzso and the value of the energy zzso The zzso phenomenon determined the number and thickness of the zzso which are formed from a uniform distribution of mass density in the considered zzso this number and these thicknesses are controlled by the values assigned to the parameters of the zzso In particular, the zzso zzso distance zzso of the influence range affected the zzso patterns formation, showing an important effect in the zzso capacity of the zzso zzso zzso
