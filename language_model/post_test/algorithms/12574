This paper describes models and zzso for the real-time zzso of foreground from background layers in stereo video zzso Automatic separation of layers from zzso or from stereo alone is known to be zzso Here, color, contrast, and stereo matching information are fused to zzso layers accurately and zzso The first algorithm, zzso Dynamic zzso zzso zzso stereo in an extended zzso space that represents both zzso layers and zzso zzso The zzso likelihood is then fused with a zzso color model that is learned zzso and stereo disparities are obtained by dynamic zzso The second algorithm, zzso zzso Cut zzso does not directly solve zzso Instead, the stereo match likelihood is marginalized over disparities to evaluate foreground and background hypotheses and then fused with a zzso color model like the one used in zzso zzso is solved efficiently by zzso graph zzso Both zzso are evaluated with respect to ground truth data and found to have similar performance, substantially better than either stereo or zzso contrast zzso However, their characteristics with respect to zzso efficiency are rather zzso The zzso are demonstrated in the application of background substitution and shown to give good quality composite video zzso
