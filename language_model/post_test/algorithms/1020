We derive an expectation zzso zzso for zzso training of substitution rate zzso from multiple sequence zzso The zzso can be used to train hidden substitution models, where the structural context of a zzso is treated as a hidden variable that can evolve over zzso We used the zzso to train hidden substitution zzso on protein alignments in the zzso zzso zzso the accuracy of multiple alignment zzso with reference to zzso (a database of structural reference zzso our substitution zzso consistently outperform the zzso series, with the improvement steadily increasing as up to four hidden site classes are zzso We discuss several applications of this zzso in zzso
