zzso delivery is the leading cause of infant mortality in the United zzso Currently, premature delivery cannot be prevented and new treatments are difficult to develop due to the inability to diagnose symptoms prior to zzso zzso zzso zzso is a long period that precedes the active phase of zzso zzso and cervical zzso The changes in the zzso of the zzso during cervical zzso suggest that the zzso zzso should zzso The objective of this study is to use the reference phantom zzso to estimate the zzso zzso in the zzso of pregnant human zzso Prior to applying the zzso to in zzso human data, two homogeneous zzso with known zzso zzso were used to validate the zzso and to find the length and the zzso of the region of interest zzso that achieves the smallest error in the zzso zzso zzso In the phantom data, we found that the errors in the zzso zzso estimates are less than zzso for zzso that contain 40 zzso or more zzso and 30 echo lines or more zzso The reference phantom zzso was then used to obtain zzso maps of the echoes from two human pregnant zzso at different zzso zzso It was observed that the mean of the zzso zzso estimates in the zzso of the patient at a more advanced zzso age is smaller than the mean of the zzso zzso estimates in the zzso of the patient at an earlier zzso age which suggests that zzso zzso decreases with increasing zzso zzso We also observed a large zzso between the zzso zzso estimates in the different regions of the zzso due to the natural variation in tissue zzso across the zzso The preliminary results indicate that the zzso could potentially provide an important diagnostic tool for diagnosing the risk of premature zzso
