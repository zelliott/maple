A method aimed at zzso protein sequences without resorting to zzso alignment is zzso Called zzso zzso Comparisons by zzso zzso it is based on a zzso analysis of the zzso zzso between all the sequences in the zzso The zzso are first simplified by considering only the projections of the zzso segments of similarity onto the zzso From these projections a data zzso is built, in which each column is representative of the comparisons of one given sequence with all the other zzso This data zzso is then transformed into a distance zzso by a zzso analysis, from which the coordinates of the sequences in an zzso zzso space are zzso The sequences are finally classified by a dynamic zzso procedure followed by a search for strong zzso Application of this method to protein families such as the zzso the zzso c and the zzso zzso shows that it is quite effective in zzso zzso that contain even zzso related zzso
