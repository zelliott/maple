zzso may reduce the zzso force holding bubbles to the vessel wall in gas zzso The authors measured bubble zzso force using excised zzso They assessed zzso damage by measuring vessel zzso and with zzso 

zzso injected into zzso resided for 5, 10, or 30 zzso with intact or damaged zzso zzso was with rat serum alone zzso or with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moscow, zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Eugene, zzso zzso zzso across the bubble, bubble zzso and bubble diameter were measured, and zzso force per unit surface area, K zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso was assessed using topical application of zzso and zzso 

With the zzso intact, K was higher in controls than with zzso at 10 and 30 zzso or zzso zzso at 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso With zzso added after air zzso to damage the zzso K was lower zzso zzso zzso at all times for both zzso and zzso zzso With zzso in the zzso before air zzso K was lower at 10 and 30 zzso for zzso and at 10 zzso for zzso zzso than for controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identical among zzso zzso zzso was the same among groups with an intact zzso but was found to be lower in controls after air zzso that followed zzso exposure than in either zzso group zzso zzso zzso 

zzso reduced bubble zzso force and preserved basic zzso structure and zzso function despite attempts to damage the zzso zzso seem to protect the zzso from mechanically induced injury in addition to decreasing bubble zzso zzso
