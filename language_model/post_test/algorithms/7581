Image zzso still remains as a challenge in image processing and pattern recognition when involving complex natural zzso In this paper, we present a new affinity model for spectral zzso based on midlevel zzso In contrast to most existing methods that operate directly on low-level cues, we first zzso the image into zzso images and then integrate the zzso line edge and intensity cue to form the similarity zzso W so that it more accurately describes the similarity between zzso The zzso line edge could avoid strong boundary and represent the true boundary between two zzso while the mean red green blue zzso could describe the intensity of zzso zzso As far as we know, this is a totally new kind of affinity model to represent zzso Based on this model, we use the spectral zzso in the zzso level and then achieve the image zzso in the zzso zzso The experimental results show that the proposed method performs steadily and well on various natural zzso The evaluation comparisons also prove that our method achieves comparable accuracy and significantly performs better than most state-of-the-art zzso
