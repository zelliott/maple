This paper uses a novel zzso controller zzso for the coordination of cooperating zzso wireless sensor networks zzso containing both unattended ground sensors zzso and mobile sensor zzso The zzso sequences the most suitable tasks for each agent and assigns sensor resources according to the current perception of the zzso A zzso zzso makes this zzso particularly useful for zzso where missions change and sensor agents may be added or may zzso zzso have peculiarities that complicate their zzso zzso zzso this paper introduces several new tools for zzso design and operation, including methods for generating the required zzso zzso based on mission planning, methods for zzso the zzso in the event of failed zzso or zzso entering the network, and a novel dynamic priority assignment weighting approach for selecting the most appropriate and useful sensors for a given mission zzso The resulting zzso represents a complete zzso description of the zzso system, which allows a fast programming of zzso zzso a computer simulation analysis, and an efficient zzso The zzso is actually implemented on an experimental zzso zzso zzso Both simulation and experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness and versatility of the developed control zzso
