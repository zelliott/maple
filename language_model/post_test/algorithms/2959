To express the magnitude of contribution of zzso to local tumor control in zzso zzso cervical cancer trials, in terms of the zzso biologically effective dose zzso and to explore the potential of the combined zzso in the treatment of this zzso 

Local control rates of both arms of each study zzso zzso zzso reported from zzso controlled trials zzso on concurrent zzso for cervical cancer were zzso By comparing the two tumor control probabilities zzso from each study, we calculated the zzso log zzso and then expressed it in terms of the number of 2 zzso fraction zzso for a range of tumor volumes and zzso We have compared the contribution of each zzso and made some exploratory calculations on the zzso that might be expected from a combined zzso treatment zzso 

The zzso number of zzso zzso ranges from zzso to zzso depending on zzso Opportunities for clinically zzso improvement by the addition of zzso are only available in tumors with an alpha value in the approximate range of zzso zzso A combined treatment zzso is not expected to improve prognosis in zzso zzso 

The most significant improvements in zzso which may result from the combination of zzso for locally advanced cervical zzso are likely to be limited only to those patients with tumors of relatively zzso zzso
