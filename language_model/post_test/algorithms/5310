We address the issue of how to identify the equations of a largely unknown chaotic system from knowledge about its state zzso The technique can be applied to the zzso of parameters that drift slowly with zzso To accomplish this, we propose an zzso strategy that aims at zzso the unknown real system with another system whose parameters are zzso evolved to zzso on those of the real zzso Our proposed strategy is tested to identify the equations of the Lorenz and the zzso zzso We also consider the effects of measurement noise and of zzso of our fitting model from consistency with the true zzso
