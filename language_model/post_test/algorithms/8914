zzso assessment of zzso zzso through pulse wave zzso zzso analysis is becoming common clinical zzso However, the effects of measurement noise, zzso resolution and similarity of the two zzso used for zzso calculation upon accuracy and zzso are zzso We studied these effects upon zzso estimates given by zzso least squared difference, and zzso zzso We assessed accuracy using zzso generated blood pressure and flow zzso for which the theoretical zzso was known to compare with the zzso zzso We assessed zzso using clinical zzso in 28 human zzso Wave shape similarity was zzso using a cross zzso zzso which decreases with increasing distance between zzso zzso zzso Based on our results, we propose the following criteria to identify the most accurate and least variable zzso given the noise, resolution and zzso of the measured zzso zzso Use zzso when the zzso ratio zzso and/or zzso resolution zzso zzso Otherwise zzso use a least squares zzso method applied to the zzso zzso
