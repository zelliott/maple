A protocol is presented for correcting the effect of zzso zzso in zzso solid-state zzso zzso experiments, thus allowing the recovery of the zzso zzso exchange functions from the zzso dependent buildup of experimental zzso peak zzso The presented protocol also incorporates a zzso procedure to take into account the effect of zzso of a zzso or zzso zzso Experimental zzso buildup zzso are presented for zzso samples where either all or only one in 10 molecules are zzso zzso Good agreement between experiment and zzso zzso simulation (including only zzso zzso chemical zzso is demonstrated for the initial buildup zzso of zzso peak intensity corresponding to an zzso close zzso zzso zzso zzso in the initial zzso buildup are observed between the one in 10 dilute and zzso samples for cases where there is a close zzso zzso proximity in addition to a close zzso zzso zzso For the dilute sample, zzso zzso zzso tended to significantly lower values for long mixing times zzso as compared to the zzso zzso This difference is explained as being due to the dependence of the limiting total zzso on the ratio zzso between the number of zzso that are directly attached to a zzso nucleus and hence contribute significantly to the observed zzso zzso zzso zzso and the total number of zzso spins into the zzso zzso zzso exchange zzso extracted from zzso zzso for the zzso zzso sample exhibit a clear sensitivity to the root sum squared zzso zzso with fast buildup being observed for the shortest zzso distances zzso and zzso yet zzso buildup for the longer zzso distances (up to zzso
