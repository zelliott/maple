By fitting different mathematical T cell proliferation functions to in zzso T cell proliferation data, we studied T cell competition for zzso zzso In our zzso proliferation zzso both the zzso zzso availability and the concentration of T cells were zzso We show that proliferation functions involving T cell competition describe the data significantly better than classical proliferation functions without competition, thus providing direct evidence for T cell competition in zzso Our mathematical approach allowed us to study the nature of T cell competition by comparing different proliferation functions involving zzso direct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resource competition, or zzso resource competition for zzso factors such as growth factors, and access to the surface of zzso cells zzso We show that resource competition is an essential ingredient of T cell zzso To discriminate between zzso and zzso resource competition, the zzso availability was varied in two zzso In a first approach we varied the concentration of zzso displaying equal zzso zzso in a second approach we varied the zzso density on the surface of the zzso while keeping the zzso concentration zzso We found that both resource competition functions described the data equally well when the zzso availability was increased by adding zzso When the zzso concentration was kept constant, the zzso resource competition function yielded the best description of the zzso Our interpretation is that T cells were competing for zzso zzso on the zzso
