In this paper, we consider the problem of heart sounds zzso removal from respiratory sounds zzso and a novel zzso single-channel source extraction zzso is zzso The proposed method is able to extract the underlying pure zzso from the HS corrupted noisy input signals by incorporating the filter banks and zzso matching using zzso zzso For performance evaluation of the presented method, the average power spectral zzso zzso of the input zzso segments without HS have been compared with the zzso of the reconstructed signals over six selected frequency bands from 20 to zzso The proposed method is tested for various types of zzso recordings and found effective by yielding an overall maximum spectral difference of zzso for a frequency range below zzso
