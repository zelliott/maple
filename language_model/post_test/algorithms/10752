An ultrasound technique for imaging objects significantly smaller than the source wavelength is zzso zzso from a focused beam are recorded over an image plane in the acoustic zzso and zzso in the zzso domain to the focal zzso A zzso image recovery method is then used to analyze the zzso spatial frequency spectrum of the signal in an attempt to deduce the location and size of objects in this zzso The physical foundation for the method is rooted in the fact that high spatial zzso introduced by the object in fact affect the lower zzso spatial zzso of the overall zzso The technique achieves this by using a zzso zzso of the ultrasound focus in water, which gives full spectral information about the image zzso A guess is then made regarding the size and location of the object that distorted the field, and this is zzso with the a zzso zzso thus creating a candidate zzso A large number of candidates are generated and the one whose spectrum best matches the zzso image is zzso The method is demonstrated using zzso and zzso wires with a focused zzso ultrasound signal and then a human hair zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso
