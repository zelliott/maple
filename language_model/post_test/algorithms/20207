Because deep zzso zzso is clinically linked with pulmonary embolism and often treated similarly, we sought to assess the usefulness of obtaining bilateral lower zzso zzso zzso when findings on zzso lung scans indicate a low or indeterminate probability of pulmonary zzso zzso of deep zzso zzso would provide a rationale for treating both pulmonary embolism and deep zzso zzso 

Two hundred zzso consecutive patients with suspected pulmonary embolism had zzso lung scans and concurrent bilateral lower zzso zzso zzso 34 also had pulmonary zzso 

In 75 cases, the results of zzso lung scanning indicated an indeterminate probability of pulmonary zzso Evidence of zzso was seen on zzso in 11 of these zzso In the remaining 64, 17 underwent pulmonary zzso and four zzso had pulmonary zzso zzso on lung scans indicated a low probability of pulmonary embolism in 70 of 223 zzso Evidence of zzso was seen on zzso in 11 of these zzso Five of the remaining 59 underwent pulmonary zzso and one zzso had pulmonary zzso According to the 1993 Medicare Fee zzso if all 145 patients whose lung scans were zzso had zzso and only those with normal zzso had pulmonary zzso the professional and hospital charges would be zzso If all 145 had pulmonary zzso without zzso the charges would be zzso 

If zzso lung scans indicate a low or an indeterminate probability of pulmonary embolism and bilateral lower zzso zzso zzso is performed, only those patients with normal zzso findings would need further zzso Thus, zzso zzso of patients could be spared pulmonary zzso and the estimated savings in cost would be zzso
