In this paper, synchronization between two zzso networks, called zzso zzso for zzso is theoretically and zzso zzso First, a sufficient criterion for this outer synchronization between two coupled zzso networks which have the same connection zzso is derived zzso zzso examples are also given and they are in line with the theoretical zzso Additionally, zzso investigations of two coupled networks which have different connection zzso are analyzed as zzso The involved zzso results show that these coupled networks with different connection zzso can reach zzso
