A novel zzso zzso particle solver based on zzso is developed with the intended application of zzso transport in large zzso In such zzso the transport of zzso and red blood cells can be divided into two distinct zzso the bulk flow and the zzso zzso In the bulk flow, the transport can be modeled on a zzso basis as the transport of passive zzso zzso Whereas in the zzso region, specific particle tracking of the zzso is required and zzso forces need to be separately taken into zzso Because of large separation of zzso scales involved in the problem, simulations of red blood cells and zzso are handled zzso In order to take the exchange of zzso between the bulk fluid and the zzso region into account, solutions are communicated through zzso of zzso quantities at the interface between these zzso Because the particle tracking is limited to those zzso lying in the zzso region only, our approach brings considerable zzso to the simulation of zzso circulation in a test geometry of a zzso step, which encompasses many flow features observed in zzso
