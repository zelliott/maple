Breast reconstruction using the zzso zzso and its variations in patients with pre-existing abdominal scars is zzso In our practice, abdominal scars are considered not to be a zzso for such zzso We therefore reviewed our experience and zzso strategies adopted in such patients over a zzso zzso 

Patients with previous abdominal scars undergoing abdominal zzso breast reconstruction performed by a single surgeon (Jan zzso 2006) were zzso reviewed with respect to zzso types, zzso approach, zzso outcomes and zzso zzso 

Thirty patients zzso zzso zzso with pre-existing scars zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso underwent unilateral zzso or bilateral zzso breast reconstruction zzso zzso The zzso design strategies employed included splitting the zzso zzso skewing it to avoid abdominal zzso minimal zzso zzso undermining and selective use of zzso zzso free and zzso zzso zzso There were no free zzso failures zzso except for one zzso zzso zzso failure (one out of zzso One bilateral zzso reconstruction patient developed an abdominal zzso requiring mesh zzso No significant wound zzso or frank abdominal zzso were zzso 

zzso scars are not an absolute zzso to abdominal zzso breast zzso With careful zzso planning and adoption of appropriate zzso strategies, it is possible to achieve satisfactory results comparable to patients without abdominal zzso An zzso approach to the selection of the relevant techniques is zzso
