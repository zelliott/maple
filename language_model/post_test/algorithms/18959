In the present study we characterized 47 food-borne zzso of zzso zzso using zzso sequence typing zzso zzso determined sequences were combined with sequences available in public data banks in order to produce the largest data set zzso zzso analysis was performed on a total of 296 strains for which zzso sequence information is available, and three main zzso II, and zzso the zzso zzso complex were zzso With few exceptions, all food-borne zzso were in group zzso The occurrence of horizontal gene transfer zzso among various strains was analyzed by several statistical methods, providing evidence of widespread lateral gene transfer within zzso zzso We also investigated the occurrence of zzso zzso focusing on their evolutionary history within zzso zzso Several patterns were identified, indicating a pivotal role of zzso in the evolution of zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso is an important element in shaping the population structure of the zzso zzso zzso The results presented here also provide strong evidence of zzso evolution within the zzso zzso zzso
