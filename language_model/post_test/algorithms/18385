The zzso sensor is well known for its capability of detecting optical aberrations from zzso images, normally caused by the atmospheric zzso Since the mid-1990s, this sensor has been adapted to work with zzso zzso to measure aberrations of the human zzso In zzso applications, the image processing is implemented using robust zzso hardware systems, allowing for very high zzso (usually in the range of zzso zzso In zzso instruments, this hardware solution is not proper, for two reasons: first, prices of zzso zzso have to be at more accessible prices and, second, there is no need for zzso frequency zzso zzso in fact, as we will see along the text, recent studies of the dynamics of the zzso aberrations show that zzso systems of very much lower zzso (from 10 to 40 zzso may well eliminate the zzso zzso in the zzso aberrations and allow for zzso limited zzso We have developed an effective zzso for detection of HS patterns using an affordable commercial hardware zzso and easy to implement zzso To our knowledge, this type of information has not been thoroughly disclosed elsewhere, probably due to proprietary zzso
