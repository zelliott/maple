Coral zzso contract when zzso zzso and a wave of contraction travels from the site of stimulation at a constant zzso Models of coral nerve networks were zzso to match one of three different zzso observed zzso To search for model parameters that reproduce the experimental zzso we applied genetic zzso to increasingly more complex models of a coral nerve zzso In a first stage of zzso individual zzso responded with spikes to zzso but not single zzso of zzso In a second stage, we used these zzso as the starting point for the zzso of a two-dimensional nerve zzso This strategy yielded a network with parameters that reproduced the zzso observed spread of zzso
