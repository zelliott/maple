One ultimate goal of zzso network modeling is the rational redesign of zzso networks to zzso the production of certain compounds by cellular zzso Although several zzso zzso techniques have been developed for this purpose, methods for systematic zzso of intervention strategies in zzso zzso networks are still zzso In principle, zzso Cut zzso zzso zzso combinations of reaction or gene deletions that lead to the zzso of a given intervention zzso provide an exhaustive zzso zzso However, their disadvantage is the zzso explosion in larger networks and the requirement to zzso first the elementary modes zzso which itself is zzso in zzso zzso We present zzso a new method for effective zzso of the smallest zzso (with fewest zzso in zzso zzso network zzso For this we combine two approaches, namely zzso the mapping of zzso to zzso in a dual network, and zzso a modified zzso by which shortest zzso can be effectively determined in large zzso In this way, we can identify the smallest zzso by calculating the shortest zzso in the dual zzso zzso application examples demonstrate that our zzso is able to list thousands of the most efficient intervention strategies in zzso networks for various intervention zzso For instance, for the first time we could zzso all synthetic zzso in zzso with combinations of up to 5 zzso We also applied the new zzso zzso to zzso strain designs for zzso synthesis of different products zzso zzso zzso by zzso We found numerous new engineering strategies partially requiring less zzso and guaranteeing higher product yields (even without the assumption of optimal zzso than reported zzso The strength of the presented approach is that smallest intervention strategies can be quickly calculated and screened with neither network size nor the number of required interventions posing major zzso
