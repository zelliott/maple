A major obstacle to the derivation of three-dimensional data from lateral and zzso zzso of the head has been the lack of precision in locating the same landmarks on each of the zzso zzso The method described zzso uses zzso equations based on the geometry of a zzso system to predict the location of a reference point on one film from its location on the zzso This technique, which differs from previously described systems, allows a pair of zzso films to be digitized by an zzso procedure controlled by a personal zzso zzso coordinates of reference points are calculated and stored for subsequent retrieval when they can be used for metric analysis or for the display of simple zzso models of the zzso zzso zzso are provided to aid software zzso
