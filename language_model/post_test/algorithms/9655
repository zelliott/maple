zzso is increasingly used to evaluate cartilage in tissue zzso zzso and animal and patient zzso However, while mean values of MR zzso including zzso zzso zzso transfer rate zzso apparent diffusion zzso zzso and the zzso fixed charge density, correlate with tissue status, the ability to zzso tissue according to these parameters has not been zzso zzso the sensitivity and specificity with which each of these parameters was able to distinguish between normal and zzso and between normal and zzso cartilage zzso were zzso zzso analysis was performed using a training set to determine simple group means to which parameters obtained from a validation set were zzso zzso and apparent diffusion zzso showed the greatest ability to discriminate between normal and zzso zzso Further analysis with zzso zzso which eliminates the need for a zzso identification of sample status, generally performed zzso Use of fuzzy zzso zzso zzso to define zzso likewise did not result in improvement in zzso Finally, an zzso zzso approach in which validation samples were assigned in a zzso fashion to control and zzso groups was zzso reflecting the range of tissue characteristics seen with cartilage zzso
