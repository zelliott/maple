zzso cancer has the highest mortality of all zzso zzso with a five-year survival rate of only zzso or zzso Current imaging techniques are limited in sensitivity and specificity in detecting early stage zzso cancer prior to its widespread zzso New imaging techniques that can provide functional and molecular contrasts are needed to reduce the high mortality of this zzso One such promising technique is zzso zzso We develop a zzso zzso 3-D ultrasound and zzso imaging system based on a zzso acoustic zzso zzso images over a scan range of 80 zzso in zzso and 20 zzso in zzso can be achieved in zzso The system has been used to image normal zzso zzso zzso This is an important step toward better understanding of zzso cancer optical properties obtained with zzso zzso To the best of our knowledge, such data are not available in the zzso We present characterization zzso of the system and compare zzso ultrasound and zzso images of zzso tissue to zzso zzso The results show excellent zzso of ultrasound and zzso zzso Strong optical zzso from zzso especially highly zzso zzso zzso and low zzso from zzso is zzso
