The purpose of this study was to evaluate the zzso zzso zzso approach zzso zzso based on quantitative zzso of the exposure of the zzso zzso and zzso area obtained after each successive step of this zzso 

The complete zzso was reproduced in eight specially prepared zzso heads (a total of 15 zzso The approach was divided into six steps: 1) zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) partial zzso of the zzso zzso (up to the zzso zzso 3) removal of the jugular zzso 4) zzso zzso to the labyrinth and the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso 5) zzso of the lateral mass of zzso with zzso of the zzso zzso and 6) zzso of the remaining portion of the zzso zzso After each successive step, a standard set of zzso was obtained using a zzso zzso zzso The zzso were used to estimate two zzso the size of the exposed zzso area and the size of a spatial cone directed toward the anterior rim of the zzso zzso which depicts the amount of surgical freedom available for manipulation of zzso The initial basic zzso provided exposure of only 21 zzso zzso of the zzso area that was exposed with the full, zzso zzso aggressive zzso zzso Likewise, only 18 zzso zzso of the final surgical freedom was obtained after the basic zzso was zzso Each subsequent step of the approach increased both zzso exposure and surgical zzso The most dramatic increase in zzso exposure was noted after removal of the jugular zzso (71 zzso zzso of final zzso whereas the least improvement in exposure occurred after the final step, which consisted of total zzso zzso 

The complete zzso provides wide and sufficient exposure of the zzso zzso and lower to middle zzso The complete zzso consists of several steps, each of which contributes to increasing zzso exposure and surgical zzso However, the zzso may be limited to the less aggressive steps, while still achieving significant exposure and surgical zzso The choice of complete or basic zzso thus depends on the underlying pathological condition and the degree of exposure required for effective surgical zzso
