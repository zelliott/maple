We have developed a sequence zzso artificial neural network predictor called zzso which zzso zzso as zzso or zzso Our method uses the excellent alignment generation zzso of zzso to identify related sequences and a combination of 31 features assessing sequence conservation and the predicted surface accessibility to produce a single score which can be used to rank zzso based on their potential to cause zzso zzso zzso successfully zzso and neutral zzso In addition, we show that zzso discriminates cancer driver and passenger zzso zzso Our method zzso other state-of-the-art methods on several zzso zzso as well as on cancer zzso zzso zzso and can thus be used to pinpoint and prioritize plausible disease candidates among zzso for further zzso zzso is publicly available as an online tool as well as a web zzso zzso
