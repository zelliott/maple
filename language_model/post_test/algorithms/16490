zzso rapid zzso of patients after discharge could improve quality of treatment and reduce zzso Little is known about clinical zzso of early zzso for acute zzso zzso We developed a strategy to identify and zzso patients with zzso at risk for zzso within 30 days of zzso 

We derived and validated a model in a cohort of patients hospitalized with zzso from June zzso zzso Early zzso was defined as admission to the hospital or zzso in the emergency department within 30 days of zzso The cohort was divided into a derivation cohort zzso June zzso 2007, zzso zzso zzso and a validation cohort zzso January zzso 2009, zzso zzso zzso A weighted scoring system was developed using zzso zzso for the prediction of early zzso zzso was assessed by area under the zzso characteristic zzso curve zzso 

Of the total patients, zzso zzso had early zzso zzso analysis identified the following discharge characteristics as independent risk factors for early zzso gastrointestinal symptoms, eating less than a solid diet, pancreatic zzso treatment with zzso and pain zzso zzso zzso zzso risk scores zzso patients into groups of low, moderate, and high risk for early zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in the derivation cohort and zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in the validation zzso Area under the zzso curve demonstrated an accurate prediction zzso zzso zzso 

We created a scoring system that accurately predicts which patients with zzso have high and low risk of zzso within 30 days of zzso
