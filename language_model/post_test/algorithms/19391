The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso and its zzso form investigated by zzso zzso in an zzso zzso at 10 K, as well as theoretically zzso Two low-energy zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were found in the zzso both exhibiting the zzso zzso around the zzso bond but differing in the arrangement around the zzso zzso The two zzso were zzso upon in zzso broadband zzso zzso zzso zzso 235 zzso yielding zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso type products, which resulted from zzso of the zzso or zzso bond, zzso The zzso of the reactions leading to the formation of zzso and zzso are of first order, with the processes being favored when the zzso is in the zzso zzso Very interestingly, the zzso bond zzso which is unusual for zzso zzso was found to be preferred over the generally favored in zzso zzso bond zzso This behavior is attributed to the presence in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso crossing toward the zzso zzso state and, in this way, favors the zzso bond zzso In addition to the primary zzso leading to formation of zzso and zzso secondary zzso leading to the zzso and zzso of zzso have been also zzso
