The activity of peripheral zzso to generate zzso oxygen species zzso was studied in healthy individuals and patients with zzso zzso The aim was to clarify the relationship between zzso activity, the time elapsed after the onset of disease and stroke zzso The total and zzso production of zzso were evaluated by zzso zzso zzso the plasma zzso activity was zzso When zzso by zzso zzso zzso in patients with stroke zzso of its zzso showed fast zzso The total zzso generation increased over time in all stroke cases zzso However, the zzso zzso generation was found to be greater in patients with severe stroke than in those with mild neurological zzso When zzso by zzso the total zzso zzso capacity zzso of stroke zzso increased over time, but there was no change in the amount of zzso generated zzso In patients with stroke the zzso activity of plasma was zzso We conclude that circulating zzso in patients with zzso stroke are primed for enhanced zzso production by zzso zzso stimulation and for increased zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso The enhanced zzso generation of zzso through zzso zzso stimulation may be considered an zzso stress zzso in cerebral zzso
