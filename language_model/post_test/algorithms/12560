zzso studies of zzso zzso provide zzso insights into their roles in essential biological zzso including cell signaling and cellular zzso This paper presents a novel zzso for zzso structure determination, given the zzso structure, that is both complete, in that it evaluates all possible zzso and zzso in that it evaluates zzso separately for consistency with experimental data and for quality of zzso zzso ensures that the zzso does not miss the native zzso and being zzso enables it to assess the structural precision possible from data zzso Our zzso performs a zzso search in the symmetry zzso space, the space of symmetry axis parameters zzso and zzso defining all possible zzso zzso complexes for a given zzso zzso It eliminates those symmetry axes inconsistent with zzso nuclear zzso effect zzso distance restraints and then identifies zzso representing any consistent, zzso structure to within a zzso similarity zzso For the human zzso zzso in zzso zzso using the structure of one zzso determined from a subset of the experimental zzso data, our zzso identifies a diverse set of complex structures consistent with the nine zzso zzso zzso The distribution of determined structures provides an objective characterization of structural zzso backbone zzso to the previously determined structure ranges from zzso to zzso A, and zzso in backbone atomic coordinates is an average of zzso zzso zzso zzso packing reduces structural diversity to a maximum backbone zzso of zzso A and an average backbone zzso of zzso zzso By comparing data consistency and packing quality under different assumptions of zzso number, our zzso identifies the zzso as the most likely zzso state of zzso demonstrating that it is possible to determine the zzso number directly from zzso zzso Additional tests on a number of zzso from zzso to zzso similarly demonstrate the power of our method to provide unbiased determination and evaluation of zzso complex zzso
