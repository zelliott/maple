The objective of this study was to compare the effect of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and core fabrication technique zzso or zzso on the zzso zzso strength and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso glass zzso In addition, the effect of zzso technique zzso or zzso zzso for zzso zzso on the zzso zzso strength and zzso zzso was zzso 

Five ceramic core materials zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Press, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and three corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were selected for this zzso Each core material group contained three zzso based on the core material thickness and the presence of corresponding zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso core material only zzso zzso zzso zzso core material only zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso group: zzso zzso core with zzso zzso corresponding zzso zzso with a zzso layering technique zzso zzso The zzso group had one additional zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso strengths were compared for each zzso zzso zzso 10) according to zzso standard zzso with zzso and zzso post hoc multiple comparison test zzso zzso The reliability of strength was analyzed with the zzso zzso 

For all core materials, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had significantly lower mean zzso zzso strengths zzso zzso zzso than the other two zzso zzso zzso and zzso For the zzso group, the zzso zzso had significantly lower zzso strength zzso zzso than zzso zzso Nonetheless, both zzso zzso groups showed greater zzso strength than the monolithic zzso and zzso groups, regardless of core thickness and fabrication zzso Comparing fabrication techniques, zzso zzso zzso zzso had similar zzso zzso strength zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso however, zzso zzso groups had significantly higher zzso strength zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso core specimens presented with higher zzso zzso with all selected core zzso For the zzso group, although the zzso zzso zzso exhibited significantly lower zzso strength, it had highest zzso zzso than the zzso zzso 

The present study suggests that zzso zzso onto a ceramic core material diminishes the zzso strength and the reliability of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have lower zzso strength than zzso ones, while fabrication techniques zzso or zzso and zzso thicknesses do not affect the zzso strength of all glass zzso Compared with the zzso zzso technique, the zzso zzso technique exhibited lower zzso strength but increased reliability with a higher zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited greater zzso strength than monolithic zzso and zzso zzso regardless of zzso zzso techniques zzso or zzso zzso
