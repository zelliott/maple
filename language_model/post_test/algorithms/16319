Proper incorporation of protein flexibility for prediction of binding poses and affinities of small compounds has attracted increasing attention recently in zzso drug zzso Various approaches have been proposed to accommodate protein flexibility in the prediction of binding modes and the binding free energy of zzso in an efficient zzso In this review, the significance of incorporating protein flexibility is discussed from the structural zzso point of view, and then various approaches of generating protein zzso zzso as well as their successes and limitations, are introduced and zzso Special emphasis is on how to generate a proper ensemble of zzso for a specific purpose, as well as the zzso efficiency of various zzso Different searching zzso for the prediction of optimal binding poses of zzso which are the core engines of zzso programs, are accounted zzso zzso functions for evaluation of zzso complexes are zzso Two zzso methods of free energy zzso zzso zzso Surface Area zzso and the Linear zzso Energy zzso method, are briefly zzso Finally, we also provide an example for the extension of the conventional zzso zzso zzso for prediction of multiple binding sites and zzso zzso zzso
