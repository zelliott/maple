To obtain clinically useful zzso and zzso data on the distribution of activities in the zzso using a novel type of zzso zzso 

The zzso is divided into 1/4 s zzso An approximation to the spatial distribution of the locally dominant activity in each zzso is represented as a point in a spatial component zzso Points representing epochs dominated by activity from the same source form a zzso The zzso of these clusters represent the global spatial component of each zzso As each spatial component is identified, its corresponding zzso activity is removed from the record, allowing activity from sources with smaller zzso to become dominant in the reduced zzso zzso components are identified in the reduced zzso The method was applied to 40 normal zzso and features were identified, which were common to them zzso The method was also applied to 4 separate records with different forms of focal zzso 

The method successfully separated components from the zzso representing alpha rhythm, eye zzso zzso zzso and zzso In 40 normal zzso the method isolated spatial components that were common to all zzso and in 4 abnormal zzso it achieved a high degree of mutual separation of alpha rhythm, focal zzso focal zzso and focal delta zzso 

The method achieved a high degree of mutual separation of the zzso components and successfully differentiated the zzso due to eye movement, zzso and zzso zzso The clinical implications are zzso
