Regional zzso was measured in seven healthy volunteers with zzso zzso zzso using zzso Regional zzso was measured using zzso The zzso differences of zzso zzso and oxygen together with zzso zzso were also zzso In addition to the loss of zzso a loss of zzso zzso zzso was also zzso A zzso model was applied to the zzso data in the time zzso zzso zzso After correction for the loss of zzso zzso the zzso method gave an average zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso close to the value obtained with the zzso zzso After correction for the loss of zzso only, the zzso method gave zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compatible with zzso zzso obtained with the zzso zzso These results and the time course of the loss of zzso zzso zzso are consistent with the presence of zzso metabolism of zzso that causes an early loss of mainly zzso after a zzso injection of the zzso This implies that zzso measures the rate of zzso zzso rather than the total zzso The experiments using zzso were compared to five analogous experiments using zzso together with zzso as a flow zzso After correction for the loss of zzso the two zzso zzso gave similar global values of zzso and other parameters associated with zzso zzso but with labeling in the zzso position, the loss of zzso was substantially delayed and the contrast between gray and white matter was zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
