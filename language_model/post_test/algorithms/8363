Numerous studies of the zzso effects of basic zzso growth factor zzso in culture, including zzso and adult zzso zzso suggest that the factor plays a ubiquitous and zzso role in zzso In contrast, in zzso zzso is devoid of effects on zzso in mature zzso raising the possibility that zzso exhibits zzso zzso activity in the complex animal zzso To define zzso effects in the zzso a single subcutaneous injection of zzso (20 zzso was administered to zzso day 1 zzso rats, and zzso DNA content was zzso zzso zzso an increase in total DNA throughout adulthood, by zzso at zzso zzso at zzso and zzso at zzso suggesting that zzso increases zzso cell zzso To define mechanisms, zzso zzso was injected at zzso and zzso zzso cells were assessed at zzso there was a twofold increase in zzso cells in the zzso zzso cell layer zzso indicating that zzso enhanced the generation of zzso or zzso from a cohort of zzso Moreover, enhanced zzso and survival led to a zzso increase in absolute zzso zzso number, suggesting that zzso production depends on environmental levels of zzso To evaluate this possibility, zzso mice were zzso zzso DNA content was decreased at all ages examined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and total zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso cell number were decreased by zzso indicating that zzso is necessary for normal zzso zzso We conclude that environmental levels of zzso regulate zzso zzso zzso As adult zzso zzso was unresponsive to zzso manipulation in our previous study zzso zzso Black, zzso & zzso zzso (1999) zzso zzso 19, zzso these observations suggest zzso zzso roles of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso cell zzso
