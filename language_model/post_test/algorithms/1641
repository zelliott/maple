zzso zzso zzso offers a unique perspective of white matter zzso but proper zzso of white matter tracts of interest generally requires the active involvement of an expert zzso The investigators describe the zzso of an automated zzso method requiring no user input and compare its results to those from zzso zzso 

Fourteen healthy volunteers underwent diffusion zzso imaging at 3 zzso Images were registered to a standard template, and zzso seed regions containing tract zzso were transformed into subject space for use in zzso zzso zzso The output was compared to the results of zzso zzso performed on the same zzso 

After the selection of suitable smoothing kernels and zzso the results of automated zzso closely zzso those of zzso zzso The main bodies of the zzso inferior zzso zzso and inferior zzso zzso were depicted equally well by both zzso zzso mainly arose at the periphery of these zzso where zzso uncertainty tends to be zzso 

zzso zzso can be used to depict white matter anatomy without need for user intervention, particularly if the main body of the tract is of greatest zzso
