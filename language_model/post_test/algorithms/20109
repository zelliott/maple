To propose a more accurate method to predict the soft tissue changes after zzso zzso 

The subjects included 69 patients who had undergone surgical correction of Class III zzso zzso by zzso zzso Two zzso methods of forming prediction equations were examined using zzso predictor and 36 soft tissue response zzso the ordinary zzso zzso and the partial zzso zzso zzso After fitting the zzso the bias and a mean absolute prediction error were zzso To evaluate the zzso performance of the prediction zzso a zzso zzso method was zzso 

The zzso zzso method showed significantly better zzso performance than the conventional zzso zzso The bias pattern was more favorable and the absolute prediction accuracy was significantly better with the zzso method than with the zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso method was more satisfactory than the conventional zzso method in accurately predicting the soft tissue profile change after Class III zzso setback zzso
