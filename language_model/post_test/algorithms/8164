We consider the problem of portfolio selection within the classical Markowitz zzso zzso reformulated as a constrained zzso zzso zzso We propose to add to the objective function a penalty zzso to the sum of the absolute values of the portfolio zzso This penalty zzso zzso the zzso problem, encourages sparse portfolios zzso portfolios with only few active zzso and allows accounting for transaction zzso Our approach recovers as special cases the zzso portfolios, but does allow for short positions in limited zzso We implement this methodology on two benchmark data sets constructed by zzso and zzso Using only a modest amount of training data, we construct portfolios whose zzso performance, as measured by Sharpe ratio, is consistently and significantly better than that of the zzso evenly weighted zzso
