zzso sparse redundant representations is an important problem in both applied mathematics and zzso In many applications, this problem must be solved in an energy-efficient zzso Here, we propose a hybrid distributed zzso zzso which zzso this problem on a network of simple zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso perform both zzso steps on analog internal variables and zzso steps via zzso external variables communicated to each zzso Interestingly, the operation is equivalent to a network of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may serve as a model of neural zzso We show that the zzso performance of zzso is on par with existing zzso In the zzso regime, the representation error of zzso zzso with time, zzso as zzso zzso is stable against zzso zzso specifically, the representation error zzso as zzso for zzso white zzso
