A simulation study of transmit ultrasound beams from several zzso zzso is conducted to compare zzso imaging at zzso zzso and 11 zzso zzso harmonic generation and the ability to suppress near field echoes are zzso Each zzso zzso is defined by a chosen zzso and focal depth, and the transmit pressure is estimated to not exceed a mechanical index of zzso The medium resembles homogeneous muscle tissue with zzso elasticity and zzso zzso To improve zzso efficiency, the zzso equation is zzso and all zzso are zzso Previous literature shows that zzso generation is zzso to the square of the transmit pressure, and that zzso zzso with different transmit zzso but equal zzso and focal depth in terms of zzso generate identical zzso fields in terms of zzso zzso verify this for a medium with zzso zzso For zzso zzso zzso are found, and the high frequency subsequently performs worse than the low zzso The results suggest that high zzso are less able to suppress zzso echoes in the presence of a zzso body wall than low zzso
