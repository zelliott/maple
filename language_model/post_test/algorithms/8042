CT zzso zzso shows high sensitivity in detecting zzso zzso but sometimes a bias in the exact zzso of zzso degree occurs, mainly caused by the high linear zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The purpose of this technical study was to evaluate the most appropriate CT window parameters for the assessment of zzso plaques stating which of them can provide the best zzso zzso zzso and zzso results showed the correlation between both zzso and level respectively depending on zzso zzso units zzso value zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso level zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso data indicated that the presence of different zzso degrees did not modify zzso zzso
