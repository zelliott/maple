zzso analysis allows zzso to zzso zzso expression zzso data to uncover previously unknown functional relationships between zzso An observation that a group of genes are zzso across diverse experimental conditions suggests they may play similar roles in the zzso Several thousand expression zzso experiments performed on samples from zzso zzso have entered the public domain and it is now possible to use these data to investigate zzso networks in zzso This chapter explains how to use a Web-based tool zzso to investigate zzso of genes involved in zzso pathways in zzso Using zzso together with zzso zzso and analysis tools, one can easily identify clusters of genes that are zzso with one or more genes of interest, making it possible to identify new players in zzso pathways that are regulated at the level of zzso zzso
