zzso sequencing is rapidly transforming our ability to profile the zzso zzso and zzso states of a zzso In particular, sequencing DNA from the zzso of zzso complexes zzso and zzso DNA zzso can reveal the locations of protein binding sites and zzso zzso These approaches contain numerous biases which may significantly influence the interpretation of the resulting zzso zzso zzso methods for detecting and removing such biases are still zzso Also, zzso zzso still remains an important open zzso This theoretical paper systematically characterizes the biases and properties of zzso data by comparing 62 separate publicly available zzso using rigorous statistical models and signal processing zzso zzso methods for separating zzso signal from background noise, as well as correcting enrichment test statistics for zzso and zzso zzso are zzso Our method effectively separates reads into signal and background components prior to zzso improving the zzso zzso Moreover, most peak zzso currently use a generic zzso model which suffers from low specificity at the sensitivity level requisite for detecting zzso but true, zzso zzso The proposed method of determining a cell zzso zzso model, which accounts for cell zzso zzso is shown to be capable of achieving a lower false discovery rate at a given significance threshold than current zzso
