zzso sequence comparison is widely used for comparing gene regulatory regions and for identifying zzso transferred zzso Recent studies on the power of a widely used zzso comparison statistic zzso and its zzso zzso and zzso showed that their power zzso a limit smaller than 1 as the sequence length tends to zzso under a pattern transfer zzso We develop new zzso statistics based on zzso zzso and zzso by comparing local sequence pairs and then summing over all the local sequence pairs of certain zzso We show that the new statistics are much more powerful than the corresponding statistics and the power tends to 1 as the sequence length tends to zzso under the pattern transfer zzso
