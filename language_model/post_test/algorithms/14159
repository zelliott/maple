In zzso three-dimensional zzso imaging systems, the zzso cells often have the shape of a zzso Proper arrangement of zzso in these zzso cells is important to maximize the quality of zzso 3-D images with a given display zzso The possible number of zzso arrangements in a zzso cell with a zzso dimension is found by considering the number of possible crossings between parallel line families forming the zzso cells, when the slopes of the lines are zzso by the ratio between the number of zzso in the vertical and horizontal zzso To make the zzso cell have a uniquely defined zzso arrangement, its horizontal and vertical dimensions should be equal to the even multiple of the zzso dimension in their corresponding zzso
