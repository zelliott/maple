This paper presents a novel technique to create a computerized zzso with zzso image updates for zzso zzso close reduction and zzso of zzso fracture of zzso With the novel technique, repositioning of bone fragments during close fracture reduction will lead to image updates in each acquired imaging plane, which is equivalent to using several zzso simultaneously from different directions but without any X-ray zzso Its application zzso the whole fracture reduction and zzso procedure when combining with the existing leg length and zzso restoration methods and may result in great reduction of the X-ray radiation to the patient and to the surgical zzso In this paper, we present the approach for achieving such a technique and the experimental results with plastic zzso
