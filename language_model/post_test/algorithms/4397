Knowing the zzso zzso from zzso rivers to pumping zzso is important in the management of alluvial zzso zzso zzso zzso are determined by releasing a zzso pulse into the river and measuring the breakthrough curve in the zzso As an alternative, one may measure signals of a zzso natural zzso in the river and in adjacent zzso and zzso the zzso zzso by zzso zzso this is done by fitting a zzso function such as the solution of the one-dimensional zzso equation to the zzso By choosing a certain zzso it is impossible to determine features of the zzso distribution that do not follow the general shape of the zzso zzso multiple zzso We present a method to determine zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso time zzso zzso of the zzso transfer function is achieved by a zzso approach, in which the transfer function is assumed as a zzso intrinsic random time zzso zzso is enforced by the method of zzso zzso We present an approach to directly zzso the best zzso estimate and to generate sets of plausible zzso We show how the zzso of the transfer function can be estimated from the zzso The approach is applied to zzso zzso taken at River zzso Switzerland, and five zzso in the adjacent zzso but the method can also be applied to other zzso natural zzso such as zzso At our field site, zzso fluctuations appear to be an excellent natural zzso
