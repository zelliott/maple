Movement of individuals promotes colonization of new areas, gene flow among local zzso and has implications for the spread of infectious agents and the control of zzso zzso Wild Norway rats zzso zzso are common in highly zzso areas but surprisingly little is known of their population zzso We sampled individuals from 11 locations within Baltimore, Maryland, to characterize the genetic structure and extent of gene flow between areas within the zzso zzso methods and a zzso tree based on zzso genetic distances supported an zzso division in the inner city, and a third cluster comprised of historically more recent zzso Most individuals zzso zzso were assigned to their area of capture, indicating strong site zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso distance of rats (62 zzso fell within typical alley zzso Several rats were assigned to areas zzso zzso away, indicating some, albeit zzso long-distance movement within the zzso Although individual movement appears to be limited zzso zzso locations up to zzso zzso are comprised of zzso zzso zzso differentiation between identified zzso and high zzso diversity indicate that regular gene flow, either via recruitment or migration, has prevented zzso zzso ecology of zzso zzso in urban areas and zzso characteristics of Norway rats likely counteract many expected effects of isolation or founder zzso An understanding of levels of connectivity of rat populations inhabiting urban areas provides information about the spatial scale at which populations of rats may spread disease, invade new areas, or be eradicated from an existing area without zzso
