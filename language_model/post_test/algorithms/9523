We use displacement zzso zzso field zzso zzso nuclear magnetic resonance to measure zzso components zzso of flow displacement zzso zzso with mean displacement zzso for zzso and zzso flows through rocks and zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso there are finite terms above second order in the zzso expansion of zzso We describe an zzso for an optimal zzso zzso analysis of data, which can be used to obtain the first three zzso moments of a zzso zzso with error zzso The analysis is applied to zzso and zzso flows in rocks and zzso zzso with zzso zzso solution produces a zzso enhancement of the zzso zzso of displacement zzso when compared to flow experiments with zzso
