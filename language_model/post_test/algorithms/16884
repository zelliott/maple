The objective of this study was to develop and validate a novel noise zzso method that can accurately simulate zzso images from existing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The noise zzso method incorporates the effects of the bowtie zzso automatic exposure control, and electronic zzso We validated this tool using both phantom and patient zzso The phantom study compared simulated zzso images with the actually acquired zzso zzso The patient studies included 105 pediatric and 24 adult CT body zzso 

The noise level in the simulated images was within zzso of the actual zzso images in phantom zzso Noise power spectrum also demonstrated excellent zzso For the patient zzso a mean difference of noise level between zzso and zzso was observed for simulated dose levels between zzso and zzso of the original zzso 

An accurate technique for simulating zzso CT images was developed and zzso which can be used to zzso zzso CT zzso
