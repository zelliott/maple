External ultrasound zzso is considered to be a very flexible zzso for heating zzso tumors zzso to its penetration and focusing zzso However, using this flexibility requires that many complicated, interacting decisions be made to obtain optimal zzso This paper presents the feasibility of arranging zzso ultrasound zzso to produce an appropriate heating pattern for a specific treatment, based on the optimal scan parameters obtained from an zzso zzso The variable scan parameters of the heating system zzso are the zzso tilt and rotation angles, focal depth, scan zzso and output zzso zzso After obtaining the optimal scan zzso multiple zzso are systematically arranged according to these scan zzso zzso ultrasound power deposition and temperature distribution for a specific treatment are calculated for this multiple ultrasound zzso zzso A more uniform temperature distribution in the treatment region for a large, highly zzso tumor can be achieved by scanning the system with respect to the central scan axis and/or swinging the zzso zzso and zzso The maximum heating depth of focused ultrasound zzso used in this heating system is also zzso zzso results demonstrate that the optimal arrangement of this zzso ultrasound zzso system is highly promising for heating deep, large, and highly zzso zzso
