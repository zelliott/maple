zzso in zzso zzso networks are known to exhibit synchronized bursting events zzso during which most of the zzso in the system spike within a time window of approximately 100 zzso Such phenomena can be obtained in model networks based on zzso zzso zzso In order to account correctly for the detailed behavior of zzso several modifications have to be implemented in such zzso Random input currents have to be introduced to account for the rising profile of zzso Dynamic thresholds and zzso in the distribution of zzso zzso enable us to describe the profile of activity within the zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso intervals and zzso zzso Thus, we can account for the interesting appearance of Levy zzso in the zzso
