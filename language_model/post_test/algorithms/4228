The zzso zzso system was zzso in a planning study against the zzso zzso system for quality of delivered dose zzso to zzso zzso and assessing the zzso system's capacity for zzso A total of 27 patients with one brain zzso treated on the zzso system, with 3 zzso leaf zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso for zzso with a 5 zzso leaf zzso zzso mounted on an zzso zzso allowing zzso around both the horizontal and vertical zzso The zzso dynamic zzso arc zzso planning included zzso zzso using zzso couch zzso These zzso arcs cannot be reproduced with zzso due to the mechanical limitations of the zzso zzso Alternative class solutions were investigated for the zzso Additionally, to distinguish between the effect of zzso leaf zzso and different beam arrangements on dose zzso the zzso class solutions were also applied for zzso In addition, the added value of zzso zzso was investigated in this zzso Quality of the achieved dose zzso was expressed in the conformity index zzso and zzso index zzso and compared using a paired zzso zzso with statistical significance for zzso zzso zzso For zzso larger than 5 zzso no statistical significant difference in conformity was observed between zzso and zzso but for smaller zzso the dose zzso showed a significantly better conformity for the zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso mainly due to the smaller zzso leaf zzso Using zzso on zzso reduces this conformity difference to zzso zzso The zzso for achieving a zzso around 3, characterizing a sharp dose zzso outside the target volume was 4 zzso for zzso and 7 zzso for zzso using zzso zzso Using zzso zzso this threshold was reduced to 3 zzso for the zzso zzso The smaller zzso and the presence of the zzso fields allow the zzso system to better conform the dose around the zzso and to obtain steeper dose zzso outside the zzso zzso zzso characteristics can be achieved with zzso for zzso larger than 3 zzso and using zzso
