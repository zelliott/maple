Although numerous species are distributed in discrete populations easily zzso by geographical zzso continuous populations are a common feature of plants or marine zzso This is particularly true for soil organisms as their habitat is continuous and their range cannot easily be assessed as they are buried below zzso In the case of organisms for which standard methods such as zzso cannot be used, population zzso provide a straightforward approach to zzso zzso In this study, we have pursued this topic with a zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso potato roots and is indigenous to South zzso Potential barriers to gene flow were identified using the analysis of the zzso ratio against geographical distance and spatial zzso combined with zzso zzso zzso Inside regions, neither genetic differentiation nor isolation by distance zzso occur among fields less than 50 zzso zzso We zzso that the large amount of gene flow revealed by the absence of genetic structure of this zzso could be due to large passive zzso inside an zzso area where zzso zzso has a continuous distribution and is found at high zzso The first evidence of genetic differentiation appeared when a field was separated from others by an area free of farms (where zzso zzso is absent or zzso Among regions, a high genetic structure coupled with an zzso pattern occurs as the consequences of the limitations of passive zzso across deep valleys or high zzso To our knowledge, this is the first study identifying the spatial limit of a population for a plant zzso zzso
