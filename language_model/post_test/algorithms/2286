We present two applications of zzso and related techniques to problems arising in medical zzso Both make considerable use of the edge detection and zzso properties of zzso zzso First we describe simple and effective techniques for image zzso and contrast enhancement based on the zzso edge representation of zzso These techniques are sufficiently flexible to successfully address the varying requirements posed by several different medical imaging zzso in common use zzso Experimental results are presented to illustrate the application of these techniques to various types of medical zzso Next we describe adapted zzso zzso a technique for magnetic resonance zzso One advantage of this technique is that it can be used to efficiently zzso edge features of the object being zzso This has a particular diagnostic application in tracking heart wall thickness during the cardiac cycle, which we present along with some experimental results along this zzso We also present an analysis of the zzso ratios of images formed with this technique, as this is a factor of paramount importance in zzso The fact that zzso schemes tend to concentrate energy near edge features makes the result rather different than that found in standard zzso based zzso We indicate an exciting potential application of our zzso reducing spectral leakage in zzso zzso
