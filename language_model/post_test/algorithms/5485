The goal of the zzso test zzso the zzso zzso is, given two sets of samples, to judge whether the probability zzso behind the samples are the same or zzso In this paper, we propose a novel zzso method of zzso test based on a zzso density ratio zzso Through various experiments, we show that the proposed method overall produces smaller zzso error zzso the probability of judging the two zzso to be the same when they are actually zzso than a state-of-the-art method, with slightly larger zzso error zzso the probability of judging the two zzso to be different when they are actually the zzso
