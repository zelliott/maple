zzso zzso of motion in zzso imaging sequences is critical for improved frame zzso tracking of surgical instruments, and Digital zzso zzso zzso The projection of multiple transparent objects undergoing multiple complicated zzso in zzso onto a single zzso view makes this motion zzso problem quite challenging and ill-suited to existing techniques used in medical image zzso We propose a novel method for jointly zzso the observed image into a set of additive layers each associated with its corresponding smooth zzso zzso which together model the zzso motion observed in the projection images across several zzso A total variation based zzso penalty is used to incorporate the known structure of the input frames for well zzso of the layer separation zzso We present the use of this model for frame zzso and artifact reduction in zzso zzso are included from synthetic and real clinical zzso
