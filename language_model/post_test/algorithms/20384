Motion analysis systems typically introduce noise to the displacement data zzso zzso digital filters have been used to smooth the displacement data in order to obtain smoothed zzso and zzso However, this technique does not yield satisfactory results, especially when dealing with complex zzso motions that occupy the low- and zzso zzso The use of the discrete zzso zzso as an alternative to digital zzso is presented in this zzso The transform passes the original signal through two complementary low- and zzso zzso filters and zzso the signal into an approximation function and a detail zzso Further decomposition of the signal results in transforming the signal into a hierarchy set of zzso approximation and detail zzso A reverse process is employed to perfectly reconstruct the signal zzso zzso back from its approximation and detail zzso The discrete zzso transform was applied to the displacement data recorded by zzso et zzso zzso The smoothed displacement data were twice differentiated and compared to zzso et zzso acceleration data in order to choose the most appropriate filter zzso and decomposition level on the basis of maximizing the percentage of retained energy zzso and minimizing the root mean square error zzso zzso zzso of the fourth order zzso at the second decomposition level showed better results than both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was then used to compress complex displacement data obtained from a noisy zzso generated zzso zzso clearly indicate superiority of this new smoothing approach over traditional zzso
