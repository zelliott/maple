The increased specificity of targeting agents has resulted in an interest in the use of zzso that emit particulate zzso alpha zzso beta particles and zzso zzso The potential advantage of these zzso is the ability to deliver therapeutic doses to individual tumor cells while minimizing the dose to the surrounding normal zzso However, the zzso of these zzso is challenging because the dose must be characterized on a scale that is comparable to the range of these emissions, zzso zzso for beta zzso zzso for alpha zzso and zzso for zzso electrons zzso In this review, each class of particulate zzso is discussed along with the associated zzso techniques unique to calculating dose on these zzso The limitations of these approaches and the factors that hinder the clinical use of small-scale zzso are also zzso
