zzso resonance imaging at zzso fields is a promising imaging method that combines the zzso technique and broadband signal reception by zzso quantum interference device zzso sensors to enable in zzso zzso at zzso magnetic fields similar in strength to the Earth magnetic zzso Despite significant advances in recent years, the potential of zzso zzso for biomedical imaging is limited by its insufficient zzso ratio due to a relatively low sample zzso Dynamic nuclear polarization zzso is a widely used approach that allows polarization enhancement by 2-4 orders of magnitude without an increase in the polarizing field zzso In this work, the first zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso signal detection is zzso The first zzso of zzso zzso zzso at zzso fields are also zzso The experiments were performed at the measurement field of 96 zzso corresponding to zzso frequency of 4 zzso for zzso and 1 zzso for zzso The zzso zzso was carried out at zzso zzso fields using zzso zzso at 120 zzso zzso for imaging included water zzso and a cactus zzso zzso solutions of metabolically relevant sodium zzso zzso zzso and zzso labeled with zzso were used for zzso zzso All the samples were doped with zzso free zzso The zzso zzso enabled nuclear polarization enhancement by factor as large as zzso for zzso and as large as zzso for zzso corresponding to zzso zzso at zzso T and zzso T fields, zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso can be naturally combined with zzso zzso in one system, and that its zzso performance is greatly improved in this zzso They also suggest that zzso zzso can become an efficient tool for in zzso imaging of zzso zzso produced by zzso dissolution zzso
