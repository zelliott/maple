A theoretical model is described for application in zzso tissue characterization using a zzso zzso spectrum analysis zzso This model relates zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso signals to intrinsic physical properties of tissue zzso zzso size, shape, and acoustic zzso The model is zzso to most clinical diagnostic ultrasound zzso Two experiments employing two types of tissue zzso zzso and zzso zzso are conducted using ultrasound with center zzso of 10 and 40 zzso zzso zzso of a zzso phantom with an internal suspension of microscopic glass beads are used to validate the theoretical zzso zzso from in zzso muscle fibers are presented to further zzso the utility of zzso spectrum analysis in zzso tissue zzso
