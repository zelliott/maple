zzso studies of gene expression are essential in biomedical research to understand biological phenomena that evolve in a zzso zzso We introduce a functional zzso model for detecting temporally zzso expressed zzso genes between two experimental conditions for zzso designs, where the gene expression profiles are treated as functional data and modeled by basis function zzso A zzso Carlo zzso zzso was developed for zzso both the zzso parameters and the zzso in the second level of zzso We use a direct zzso probability approach to bound the rate of false discovery at a zzso level and evaluate the methods by simulations and application to zzso zzso gene expression data on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results suggested that the procedure performs better than the zzso zzso in identifying zzso zzso resulting in both higher sensitivity and zzso Genes identified from the zzso zzso zzso data set show clear patterns of changes between the two experimental zzso
