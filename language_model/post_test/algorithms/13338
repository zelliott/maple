In advanced zzso treatments such as intensity modulated radiation therapy zzso and zzso modulated arc therapy zzso zzso of the performance of the zzso zzso zzso is an essential part of the zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this study is to use the existing measurement methods for geometric zzso of the zzso and extend them to more comprehensive evaluation techniques, and to develop dedicated robust zzso to zzso investigate the zzso performance in a fast, accurate, and efficient zzso 

The behavior of leaves was investigated in the zzso mode by the analysis of integrated electronic portal imaging device zzso images acquired during zzso fence tests at fixed zzso angles and arc zzso The zzso was also studied in dynamic mode by the analysis of zzso zzso images of a sliding gap pattern delivered in a variety of conditions including different leaf speeds, deliveries at fixed zzso angles or in arc mode, and changing the direction of leaf zzso The accuracy of the method was tested by detection of the intentionally inserted errors in the delivery zzso 

The zzso developed for the zzso fence analysis was able to find each individual leaf position, gap zzso and leaf bank zzso in addition to the zzso from expected leaf positions with respect to the beam central axis with zzso zzso For the three tested zzso over a period of 5 months, the maximum change in the gap zzso was zzso zzso the maximum zzso from the expected leaf positions was zzso zzso and the zzso zzso was up to zzso The zzso developed for the sliding gap analysis could determine the zzso and zzso of each individual leaf as well as the gap zzso There was a slight decrease in the accuracy of leaf performance with increasing leaf zzso The analysis results were presented through several zzso The accuracy of the method was assessed as zzso zzso for both the gap size and peak position zzso 

This study provides fast, easy, and accurate test methods for routine zzso of the zzso performance and helps in faster zzso of zzso problems in both zzso and zzso zzso
