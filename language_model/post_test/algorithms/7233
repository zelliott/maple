We present a novel method to incorporate prior knowledge into zzso zzso The prior is incorporated into the cost function by maximizing the similarity of the prior to one partition and the zzso to the zzso This simple zzso can also be extended to multiple zzso to allow the modeling of the shape zzso A shape model obtained by zzso on a training set can be easily integrated into the new zzso This is in contrast to other methods that usually incorporate prior knowledge by hard constraints during zzso The zzso problem zzso by spectral relaxation is not zzso but can still be solved zzso We apply this method to biomedical data sets as well as natural images of people from a public database and compare it with other zzso cut based zzso zzso We demonstrate that our method gives promising results and can still give a good zzso even when the prior is not zzso
