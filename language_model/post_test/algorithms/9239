zzso suggest that zzso proteins consist of an zzso signal zzso and 11 zzso segments divided in two groups of 5 and 6, respectively, separated by a large zzso zzso This predicted zzso places the zzso zzso with the same orientation in the plasma zzso Using zzso drug treatment and zzso zzso zzso we have investigated the orientation of the zzso zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso have an zzso orientation in the plasma zzso In addition, these experiments suggest that the zzso are found in close proximity in the mature zzso of the zzso
