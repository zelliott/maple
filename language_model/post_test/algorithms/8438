zzso at hospitals with a fixed annual budget may want to focus surgical services on priority areas to ensure its community receives the best health services zzso However, many hospitals lack the detailed managerial accounting data needed to ensure that such a change does not increase operating zzso The authors used a detailed hospital cost database to investigate by how much a change in allocations of operating room zzso time among surgeons can increase zzso variable zzso 

The authors obtained financial data for all patients who underwent zzso or zzso admit surgery during a zzso Linear programming was used to determine by how much changing the mix of surgeons can increase total variable costs while maintaining the same total hours of OR time for zzso zzso 

zzso OR allocations among surgeons without changing total OR hours allocated will likely increase zzso variable costs by less than zzso If, in addition, intensive care unit hours for zzso surgical cases are not increased, hospital ward occupancy is zzso and implant use is tracked and zzso zzso costs will likely increase by less than zzso These four variables predict zzso of the zzso in total variable zzso 

The authors showed that changing OR allocations among surgeons without changing total OR hours allocated can increase hospital zzso variable costs by up to approximately one zzso Thus, at hospitals with fixed or nearly fixed annual budgets, allocating OR time based on an zzso statistic such as zzso can adversely affect the hospital zzso The OR manager can reduce the potential increase in costs by considering not just OR time, but also the resulting use of hospital beds and zzso
