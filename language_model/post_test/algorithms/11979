zzso therapy from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in patients with implanted zzso zzso is a major zzso We tested the performance of stability zzso from 3 manufacturers for episodes of inappropriate therapy delivered because of zzso and an onset zzso for all episodes of inappropriate therapy caused by zzso 

zzso was classified as caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso from review of stored zzso zzso history, clinical information, and zzso data before study zzso By using 30 to 60 zzso intervals before therapy, sensitivity and specificity for a family of stability values and percentage of onset values were calculated for each manufacturer and receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso 

Of the 217 patients zzso 62 zzso received inappropriate therapy, and 40 had complete zzso information zzso Of the 40 patients, 21 patients received therapy for zzso 19 for zzso and 1 patient for zzso 15 zzso also received appropriate therapy for zzso We analyzed 83 episodes of VT from 18 patients, 94 episodes of zzso from 21 patients, and 56 episodes of ST from 19 zzso zzso in the clinically relevant sensitivity range of zzso was comparable across manufacturers at about zzso An onset value of zzso was associated with zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity for the specific zzso zzso 

zzso therapy is a common problem in zzso cardiac zzso The performance of the stability zzso used to differentiate zzso from VT was less than ideal, though comparable across zzso The onset zzso accurately zzso ST from zzso
