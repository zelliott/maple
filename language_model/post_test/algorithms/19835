This study aimed to develop a translation equation to enable comparison between zzso and zzso zzso zzso counts recorded minute by zzso 

Five males and five females of variable zzso weight, body mass index and age participated in this zzso Participants simultaneously wore an zzso and an zzso zzso for two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were calculated day by day for each subject between the zzso zzso and three different zzso zzso zzso 1) vertical direction, 2) combined zzso and 3) a custom zzso Three conversion zzso suitable for zzso zzso were then calculated from the full data zzso 

The vertical zzso activity counts demonstrated the closest relationship with the zzso with consistent moderate to strong zzso using the zzso zzso in the day by day data zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso and full data set zzso 

The zzso is most sensitive to zzso in the vertical direction, and does not closely correlate with three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso by minute zzso between the zzso and zzso vertical component can be confidently performed between data sets and might allow further synthesis of information between zzso
