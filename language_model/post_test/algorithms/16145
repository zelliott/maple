The problem of zzso zzso arises whenever the data are gathered with several physically different zzso Observations from different zzso are not necessarily aligned in the sense there there is no obvious way to associate or compare them in some common zzso A solution may consist in considering multiple zzso tasks independently for each zzso The main difficulty with such an approach is to guarantee that the zzso zzso are mutually zzso In this letter, we show that zzso zzso can be addressed within a novel zzso zzso mixture zzso These models exploit the explicit transformations that are often available between an zzso zzso space zzso and each of the observation spaces zzso We formulate the problem as a likelihood zzso task and derive the associated zzso zzso zzso The convergence properties of the proposed zzso are thoroughly zzso Several local and global zzso techniques are proposed in order to increase its convergence zzso Two zzso strategies are proposed and zzso A consistent model selection criterion is zzso The zzso and its zzso are tested and evaluated within the task of zzso zzso of several speakers using both auditory and visual zzso
