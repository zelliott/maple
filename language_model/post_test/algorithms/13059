zzso the complex fusion of genetic and environmental zzso zzso profiling (or zzso the study of small molecules involved in zzso zzso is a rapidly expanding zzso zzso A major technique for capturing zzso data is zzso zzso and this yields highly complex profiles that require sophisticated statistical analysis zzso However, experimental data is difficult to control and expensive to zzso Thus data simulation is a productive route to aid zzso zzso 

zzso is a zzso package that has been developed to simulate zzso zzso of complex zzso such as zzso zzso Drawing data from a zzso standard spectral database in conjunction with concentration information input by the user or constructed automatically from the Human zzso zzso zzso is able to create realistic zzso profiles containing large numbers of zzso with a range of zzso zzso Current features include the simulation of two groups zzso and zzso specified by means and standard zzso of zzso for each zzso The software enables addition of spectral noise with a realistic zzso structure at user zzso zzso A crucial feature of the zzso is its ability to simulate both zzso and zzso zzso the analysis of which is fundamental to many techniques in the zzso Further, zzso is able to simulate shifts in zzso peak positions that result from zzso effects such as pH differences which are often observed in zzso zzso zzso and pose serious challenges for statistical zzso 

No other software is currently able to simulate zzso zzso profiles with such complexity and zzso This paper describes the zzso behind zzso and demonstrates how it can be used to simulate realistic zzso zzso profiles with which to develop and test new data analysis zzso zzso is freely available for academic use at zzso
