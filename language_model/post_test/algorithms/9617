zzso in image registration may be a significant source of errors in anatomy mapping as well as dose zzso in zzso It is, therefore, essential to validate the accuracy of image zzso Here, we propose a method to detect areas where zzso modal zzso registration performs well and to distinguish those from areas of the same image, where the registration is likely to be less zzso It is a zzso approach to automatically estimate the uncertainty of the resulting displacement zzso zzso The zzso resulting from the zzso registration are subject to moderate and randomly performed zzso A quantity is proposed to characterize the local sensitivity of the similarity measure to these zzso We demonstrate the statistical dependence between the local image registration error and this quantity by calculating their mutual zzso We show the significance of the statistical dependence with an approach based on random zzso The proposed method has the potential to divide an image into zzso which differ in the magnitude of their average registration zzso
