An approach to protein design is proposed based on the relative zzso and a reduced zzso acid zzso In this approach, the relative zzso is used as a zzso object zzso The method has been tested on a real zzso zzso model zzso and the results are similar to those obtained from other design zzso It can be applied as a uniform frame for both folding and inverse folding of zzso An zzso calculation method of the ensemble average of the contact strength is proposed at the same zzso
