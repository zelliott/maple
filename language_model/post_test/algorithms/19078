Missing zzso data arise in association studies when the zzso zzso zzso on the zzso platform are not zzso zzso when the zzso of interest are not on the platform, or when total sequence variation is determined only on a small fraction of zzso We present a simple and flexible likelihood framework to study zzso associations with such missing zzso zzso Our likelihood makes full use of all available data in zzso studies and reference panels zzso the zzso and it properly accounts for the biased nature of the zzso sampling as well as the uncertainty in zzso unknown zzso The corresponding zzso zzso for genetic effects and zzso interactions are unbiased and statistically zzso We developed fast and stable zzso zzso to calculate the zzso zzso and their zzso and we implemented these zzso in a freely available computer zzso zzso studies demonstrated that the new approach is more powerful than existing methods while providing accurate control of the type I zzso An application to a zzso study on zzso arthritis revealed several zzso that deserve further zzso
