While a zzso size distribution is common within one kind of zzso virus, the size of viral shells varies from one type of virus to zzso In this article, we investigate the physical mechanisms underlying the size selection among zzso zzso In particular, we study the effect of zzso length and zzso and protein zzso on the size of zzso viral zzso in the absence of spontaneous zzso and zzso zzso We find that the coat proteins could well adjust the size of the shell to the size of their zzso which in turn depends on the number of charges on zzso Furthermore, we find that different zzso zzso of proteins and zzso can produce virus particles of various sizes, consistent with in zzso zzso
