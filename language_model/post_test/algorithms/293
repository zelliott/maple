zzso of zzso binding interactions is vital for understanding the zzso reactions that drive cellular zzso Here, we zzso zzso and apply a new procedure to extract information about binding to an immobile zzso from zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that existing methods for analyzing such data by zzso diffusion fits can produce inaccurate estimates of diffusion zzso and bound zzso or even fail altogether to fit zzso binding zzso By analyzing zzso zzso zzso we show that our new model can zzso account for the binding interactions introduced by attaching a DNA binding domain to the zzso domain derived from a zzso zzso factor (the zzso binding protein zzso We find that our zzso estimates are zzso consistent with our zzso recovery after zzso zzso zzso on the same zzso zzso However, due to the fast binding interactions introduced by the DNA binding domain, zzso generates independent estimates for the diffusion constant zzso zzso zzso zzso and the association (2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso (19 zzso 7 zzso rates, whereas zzso produces only a single, but a consistent, estimate, the zzso constant zzso zzso zzso zzso which depends on all three zzso We apply this new zzso method to evaluate the efficacy of a potential zzso drug that zzso DNA binding of zzso in zzso and find that in zzso the drug zzso DNA binding in only a subset of zzso In sum, we provide a straightforward approach to directly measure binding rates from zzso zzso
