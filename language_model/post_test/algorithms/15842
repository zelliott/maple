In planning a complex clinical trial with time to event as the outcome, it is difficult to derive the power of the test statistic zzso In this paper we describe an zzso for generating exemplary data from an alternative hypothesis that can be used to zzso the expected value of a zzso test statistic and its power under that zzso zzso data are zzso computer-generated data that are constructed from a complex zzso process and have desirable characteristics such as zzso moments similar to those of the zzso An zzso for generating exemplary timed events data is presented and its use in evaluating power for the planning of clinical trials zzso These data represent zzso of outcome, data zzso and zzso event zzso A test zzso zzso such as the zzso can be zzso from the zzso It is distributed zzso zzso A, 1), under the alternative hypothesis and its value is used to estimate zzso A and the power of the test for a given trial zzso The results compare favorably to results from zzso methods and zzso Carlo simulations published in the zzso The advantages of the method lie in the degree of flexibility in study design, choice of models that describe the timing of events, and the range of testing methods that can be zzso Although zzso Carlo methods may appear to have similar flexibility, the exemplary zzso is more practical because only one data set need be analyzed and the modifications can be achieved without zzso
