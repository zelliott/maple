zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coupled with modern zzso zzso methods, namely artificial neural networks zzso in two versions zzso and zzso support zzso machines zzso lazy learning zzso and partial least squares zzso regression, is used in this study for the zzso of zzso crystal forms in zzso powder zzso zzso III, and zzso Two spectral regions zzso and zzso were selected and the data were zzso into training and test zzso applying the zzso zzso It was found that all the selected zzso perform better than the zzso zzso zzso mean squared error of prediction zzso from zzso to zzso zzso trained on zzso spectral data, shows best zzso performance zzso zzso zzso but longest zzso (up to 10 zzso Principal component analysis zzso zzso of the input spectral data zzso significantly the zzso zzso zzso at a relatively low cost in precision zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso shows excellent performance in the zzso range zzso zzso zzso but in the zzso range it shows strong dependence on data set structure zzso between zzso and zzso zzso perform comparably well with zzso zzso zzso zzso not showing the long zzso time of zzso zzso zzso and therefore may provide an attractive alternative to zzso
