To establish a new clinical grading scale and objective measurement method to evaluate zzso zzso 

Photographs of zzso injection with variable zzso diseases in zzso eyes were zzso zzso images with zzso by three zzso were classified into a zzso and zzso zzso grading scale, and used as standard zzso Each image was zzso in four ways: the relative magnitude of the zzso component of each zzso zzso zzso two different zzso based on the occupied area by blood vessels zzso zzso with zzso color model and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the presence of blood vessel edges, based on the zzso zzso zzso Area under the receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso were calculated to zzso diagnostic zzso of the four zzso 

The zzso color model, zzso zzso with zzso color model, and zzso zzso showed good correlation with the clinical zzso grading scale (R zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and with the clinical zzso grading scale (R zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso method showed the largest zzso best distinction power zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso multiple comparison zzso and high zzso (R zzso zzso 

zzso zzso showed the best correlation with the zzso and zzso zzso clinical grading scales together with high distinction power and zzso zzso zzso can be a useful for method for assessment of zzso zzso
