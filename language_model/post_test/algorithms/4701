The analysis of periodic or repetitive motions is useful in many applications, such as the recognition and zzso of human and animal zzso zzso methods for the analysis of periodic motions first extract motion zzso using spatial information and then determine if they are zzso These approaches are mostly based on feature matching or spatial zzso which are often zzso zzso or zzso zzso In this paper, we present a new approach, based on the zzso analysis of the video sequence as a zzso Multiple periodic zzso are extracted and their periods are estimated zzso The objects that are moving in a periodic manner are extracted using the spatial domain zzso zzso with synthetic and real sequences display the capabilities of this zzso
