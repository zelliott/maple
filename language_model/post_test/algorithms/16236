The underlying causes of zzso zzso in Davies zzso zzso zzso that are associated with the signs of the zzso interaction are zzso The intensity variations in these zzso zzso patterns are best described as shifts in an apparent baseline intensity that occurs zzso following zzso zzso zzso We have developed an extremely straightforward zzso protocol that is capable of giving the sign of the zzso interaction by probing a single zzso transition, without reference to its partner zzso This technique, zzso zzso zzso and Recovery zzso monitors dynamic shifts in the zzso following zzso at a single zzso frequency zzso zzso zzso rather than observing anomalous zzso intensity differences between the two branches of an zzso zzso These baseline shifts, referred to as dynamic reference levels zzso can be directly tied to the zzso zzso from which that zzso transition zzso The application of this protocol is demonstrated on zzso zzso of a zzso zzso We use the zzso zzso transitions of the S zzso zzso center of the zzso iron zzso zzso zzso zzso to examine the details of the relaxation model using zzso
