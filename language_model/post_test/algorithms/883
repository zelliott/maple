We present a zzso cellular zzso model for the behavior of limb bud zzso zzso cells undergoing zzso zzso This zzso model represents cells by points on a lattice that obey rules motivated by experimental zzso The zzso follow these rules as autonomous agents, interacting with other cells and with the zzso cell activities zzso The rules include random cell motion, production and lateral deposition of a zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso production and release of a zzso growth factor zzso corresponding to zzso that stimulates production of the zzso and another zzso factor zzso that suppresses the activity of the zzso We implemented the cellular zzso on a two-dimensional zzso square lattice to emulate the zzso zzso culture extensively used to study patterning in avian limb bud zzso zzso We identified parameters that produce zzso patterns that zzso in size and distribution, cell zzso in zzso cultures, thus establishing a correspondence between in zzso and in zzso zzso We then studied the in zzso and in zzso zzso cultures zzso We altered the standard in zzso zzso culture by diluting the initial cell density, zzso exposing it to zzso zzso suppressing the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We altered the standard in zzso zzso culture in each case by changing the corresponding zzso In zzso and in zzso experiments agreed zzso We also used the model to test hypotheses for differences in the in zzso patterns of cells derived from chick zzso zzso and zzso We discuss the zzso of this model to limb development in zzso and to other organ zzso
