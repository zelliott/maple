There exist many zzso neural networks for solving zzso zzso In this paper, we present a method for zzso such networks from existing ones by changing connections between computing zzso Although the dynamic systems may become much different, some distinguished properties may be zzso One example is discussed to solve zzso zzso and related zzso problems with mixed linear and zzso zzso A new network is obtained from two classical models by this means, and its performance is comparable to its zzso Thus, an alternative choice for circuits zzso is offered to accomplish such computing zzso
