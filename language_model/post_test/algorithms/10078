In this study, we investigate the zzso of pulmonary zzso zzso zzso Buffalo, zzso occurring at the zzso interface of a zzso finger of air as it zzso and zzso along a small rigid tube (1 zzso inner zzso zzso with a zzso solution of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso This simple experimental model of pulmonary airway reopening is designed to examine how altering the fluid flow field may lower reopening pressures and lead to a reduction in airway wall damage that is associated with the mechanical ventilation of an zzso pulmonary system in airways of the deep lung with depleted zzso and little zzso zzso We analyzed a range of zzso flow scenarios by varying the zzso frequency zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso the zzso flow zzso and the steady flow rate zzso or zzso zzso These experimental studies indicate that a high frequency (1 zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso fast-forward zzso zzso superimposed onto a fast steady flow zzso zzso substantially reduces mean reopening pressures zzso as a consequence of the modified flow field and the commensurate increase in zzso transport and zzso This result suggests that imposing high frequency, low zzso zzso during airway reopening will help to diminish zzso lung zzso
