This paper presents an analysis of the high resolution zzso images of the prostate with a focus on the evolution of zzso zzso features in zzso zzso Here we propose a novel technique of labeling individual zzso as zzso or zzso In the first step, the zzso and zzso objects of the images are automatically zzso Individual zzso units are segmented out by consolidating their zzso with the surrounding layers of zzso and zzso The zzso objects are segmented by using a marker controlled watershed zzso Two new features, Number of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso layer area to zzso area zzso have been extracted from the segmented zzso The main advantage of this approach is that it can detect individual zzso zzso units, irrespective of neighboring zzso and/or the spatial extent of the zzso The proposed zzso has been tested on 40 zzso scenes taken from 10 high resolution whole mount images and achieved a sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso in a zzso zzso
