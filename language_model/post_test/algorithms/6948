We introduce a new data mining method zzso to complex disease zzso Our approach is suited to a broad spectrum of diseases, identifying the noteworthy sharing of combinations of zzso in unrelated affected zzso Furthermore, this approach may be extended to comprise the common types of zzso data, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using a method derived from zzso computer zzso we analyze a data set of unrelated affected individuals chosen from the simulated zzso of problem 2 of the zzso Analysis Workshop zzso We observe that most marker zzso containing a zzso marker for each of six or seven of the zzso zzso yield significant numbers of individuals zzso substantially similar zzso However, initial attempts zzso to the generating zzso to identify the zzso zzso have not been zzso Refining our methods so that such zzso may routinely be found and validated is zzso
