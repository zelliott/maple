This study zzso investigated the impact of integration of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso area zzso zzso on zzso zzso valve replacement zzso zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso geometry of the zzso zzso is important for zzso heart valve zzso zzso 

Patients being evaluated for zzso in 4 centers underwent zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso size selection were based on an zzso zzso zzso with an optimal goal of modest zzso area zzso zzso to zzso zzso patients who underwent zzso with the zzso zzso zzso were compared with consecutive patients without the zzso zzso zzso The primary zzso was the zzso of more than mild zzso zzso zzso and the secondary zzso was the composite of zzso death, zzso zzso zzso and severe zzso 

Of zzso patients, 133 consecutive patients underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group and 133 consecutive patients were in the control zzso More than mild zzso was present in zzso (7 of zzso of the zzso group and in zzso (17 of zzso in the control group zzso zzso zzso The combined secondary zzso occurred in zzso (5 of zzso of the zzso group and in zzso (15 of zzso of the control group zzso zzso zzso driven by the difference of severe zzso 

The zzso of an zzso zzso area zzso zzso for zzso reduces zzso zzso zzso zzso assessment and zzso area zzso should be considered for zzso
