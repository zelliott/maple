zzso knowledge of the zzso of the human brain is required for minimally or zzso surgical zzso On the zzso level, brain tissue is generally characterized using optical zzso which allows zzso zzso features with a wide spectrum of zzso zzso The preparation of the zzso zzso however, often leads to artifacts resulting in imperfect zzso zzso In addition, the generation of zzso data is zzso zzso we propose zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso avoiding preparation artifacts and giving rise to the zzso zzso of features such as gray and white matter on the zzso zzso One can differentiate between white and gray matter without any zzso procedure because of different X-ray zzso zzso At the zzso energy of zzso the white matter exhibits the zzso of zzso zzso zzso the value for the gray matter zzso to zzso zzso The zzso data allow zzso the local strains in the zzso images using registration zzso The deformation of zzso slices compared to the zzso in a zzso registration leads to values of up to zzso Mean deformation values for the zzso slices are determined to about zzso whereas the zzso slices yield slightly higher values than zzso
