We present a new approach to model dose rate effects on cell killing after zzso radiation based on the zzso zzso of DNA double strand breaks zzso within higher order zzso structures of approximately 1-2 zzso size, so called giant zzso The main concept of this approach consists of a distinction of two classes of zzso isolated and clustered zzso characterized by the number of double strand breaks induced in a giant zzso We assume a low zzso and fast component of repair for isolated zzso and a high zzso and slow component of repair for clustered zzso With appropriate rates, the zzso transition between the different zzso classes is expressed in terms of five differential zzso These allow zzso the dynamics involved in the competition of damage induction and repair for arbitrary dose rates and zzso zzso Final cell survival probabilities are zzso with a cell line specific set of three zzso The zzso for isolated zzso the zzso for clustered zzso and the zzso time of isolated zzso By comparison with larger sets of published experimental data it is demonstrated that the model describes the cell line dependent response to treatments using either continuous zzso at a constant dose rate or to split dose zzso zzso Furthermore, an zzso investigation of the zzso concerning single fraction treatments with constant dose rates in the limiting cases of extremely high or low dose rates is zzso The approach is consistent with the zzso model extended by the zzso factor up to the second moment in zzso Finally, it is shown that the model correctly predicts empirical findings about the dose rate dependence of zzso probabilities for deterministic radiation effects like zzso and the bone zzso zzso These findings further support the general concepts on which the approach is zzso
