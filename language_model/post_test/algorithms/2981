Modern developments in zzso zzso zzso enable the observation of a variety of processes exhibited by zzso The dynamic nature of these processes requires the tracking of viruses over time to explore zzso zzso In this work, we developed deterministic and zzso approaches for multiple virus tracking in zzso zzso zzso zzso The deterministic approaches follow a traditional zzso paradigm zzso particle zzso based on either the zzso filter or zzso zzso fitting, as well as motion correspondence based on a global nearest neighbor zzso Our zzso approaches are based on particle zzso We describe approaches based on a mixture of particle filters and based on independent particle zzso For the latter, we have developed a zzso strategy that prevents the problem of filter zzso zzso in cases where objects lie in close zzso A quantitative comparison based on synthetic image sequences is carried out to evaluate the performance of our zzso In total, eight different tracking approaches have been zzso We have also applied these approaches to real zzso images of zzso particles and have compared the tracking results with ground truth obtained from manual zzso It turns out that the zzso approaches based on independent particle filters are superior to the deterministic schemes as well as to the approaches based on a mixture of particle zzso
