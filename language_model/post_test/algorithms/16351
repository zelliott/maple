In this paper, a novel system for automatic confirmation of zzso zzso is zzso The system comprises a miniature zzso sensor and electric wires attached to a rigid zzso Video signals are continuously acquired and processed by the zzso implemented on a zzso The system is based on detection of the zzso image as an anatomical landmark of correct tube positioning and it thus zzso direct visual zzso zzso of the zzso is performed based on zzso zzso using a zzso mixture zzso The performance of the proposed system was initially evaluated using a mannequin zzso A scientific zzso was assembled and used to perform repeated zzso on the model and collect a database of video signals which were processed zzso The videos were zzso by a medical professional into zzso zzso and zzso An accuracy of zzso was achieved in discriminating between the zzso and other anatomical structures including esophagus and zzso As an additional zzso the system was tested using a zzso of 231 video images recorded from five human subjects during zzso The system correctly classified 120 out of 125 zzso images zzso a sensitivity of zzso and 100 out of 106 zzso images zzso a specificity zzso Using a zzso median zzso applied on the zzso zzso results, a zzso accuracy rate was zzso
