To design and evaluate a rapid zzso chain reaction zzso zzso for detecting zzso and performing early screening for selected Class A zzso bacterial zzso 

The authors designed a zzso zzso zzso consisting of an initial broad-based universal detection step, followed by specific pathogen identification targeted for identification of the Class A bacterial zzso zzso A region in the bacterial zzso zzso gene containing a highly variable sequence flanked by clusters of zzso sequences was chosen as the target for the zzso zzso zzso A previously described highly zzso region located within the zzso zzso zzso was selected as the universal probe zzso Integrated DNA Technology, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were designed for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Performance of the zzso was assessed using zzso DNA extracted from the aforementioned zzso organisms zzso or zzso and other common zzso 

The zzso detected the presence of all tested zzso zzso with high zzso zzso The zzso zzso accurately identified organisms down to the closely related species and zzso level, but were unable to discriminate between very close zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

A simple, zzso zzso zzso proved capable of both universal bacterial detection and identification of select Class A bacterial zzso and zzso zzso Although this zzso requires zzso testing for definitive species zzso the method has great potential for use in zzso settings for rapid diagnosis in cases of suspected Category A bacterial zzso zzso
