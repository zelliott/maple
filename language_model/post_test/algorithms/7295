zzso and analyses of clinical trials with a zzso outcome almost invariably rely on the hazard ratio to estimate the treatment effect and zzso therefore, on the zzso hazards zzso However, the results of some recent trials indicate that there is no guarantee that the assumption will zzso Here, we describe the use of the restricted mean survival time as a possible alternative tool in the design and analysis of these zzso 

The restricted mean is a measure of average survival from time 0 to a specified time point, and may be estimated as the area under the survival curve up to that zzso We consider the design of such trials according to a wide range of possible survival zzso in the control and research zzso The zzso are zzso defined as zzso exponential zzso and can be specified through zzso constant hazards and zzso or zzso hazard zzso Such designs can embody zzso or zzso hazards of the treatment zzso 

We demonstrate the use of restricted mean survival time and a test of the difference in restricted means as an alternative measure of treatment zzso We support the approach through the results of simulation studies and in real examples from several cancer zzso We illustrate the required sample size under zzso and zzso zzso also the significance level and power of the proposed zzso zzso are compared with those from the standard approach which zzso the zzso zzso 

We conclude that the hazard ratio cannot be recommended as a general measure of the treatment effect in a zzso controlled trial, nor is it always appropriate when designing a zzso zzso mean survival time may provide a practical way forward and deserves greater zzso
