We propose a zzso approach for representing and zzso zzso structures in medical zzso zzso structures are frequently encountered in biomedical zzso examples are the zzso system, the vascular zzso and the breast zzso zzso We use tree zzso techniques, such as the zzso string zzso and the zzso zzso to obtain a symbolic string representation of the tree's branching zzso the problem of zzso trees is then reduced to string zzso We use the zzso text mining technique to assign a weight of significance to each string term zzso tree zzso zzso zzso searches and zzso neighbor zzso of the trees is performed using the zzso weight zzso and the zzso similarity zzso We applied our approach to characterize the zzso zzso zzso structure in X-ray zzso in order to distinguish among different zzso zzso Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with zzso accuracy reaching up to zzso and also indicate that our method can potentially aid in providing insight to the relationship between branching patterns and function or zzso
