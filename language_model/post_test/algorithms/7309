To overcome speed of sound aberrations that zzso impact the acoustic focus in zzso imaging, received zzso signals are used to guide the formation of ultrasound zzso to compensate for acoustic zzso zzso point sources composed of gold and zzso iron oxide zzso are used to generate acoustic waves that zzso probe the medium as they zzso to the zzso By utilizing zzso techniques with the received zzso zzso transmitted ultrasound zzso compensate for the zzso allowing for zzso and zzso ultrasound transmission to targeted zzso It is demonstrated that utilizing a portable commercially available ultrasound system using customized software, zzso guided ultrasound zzso shaping for targeted zzso imaging is robust in the presence of large, highly attenuating acoustic zzso
