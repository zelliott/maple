The purposes of this study were zzso to measure the zzso zzso behavior of selected zzso wires using a conventional zzso test, zzso to extend a mathematical model for simulating the force system produced by zzso wires based on the zzso linear theory to the zzso zzso theory, and zzso to examine the effects of the zzso and mechanical properties of zzso wires on zzso zzso A method for extending a mathematical model for simulating the force system produced by zzso wires based on the zzso linear theory to the zzso zzso theory was established, and this can provide a clear view of the true nature of zzso zzso Furthermore, our results demonstrated that the zzso properties of zzso wires were affected more by the zzso shape than by mechanical zzso
