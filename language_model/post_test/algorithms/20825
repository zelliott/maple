The association of early knee joint zzso with the need for later reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament has not been extensively zzso 

The grade of knee zzso can be used as an early predictor of the need for later zzso 

zzso study zzso Level of evidence, zzso 

One hundred consecutive patients with an acute zzso verified total anterior cruciate ligament zzso were followed zzso for 15 zzso zzso and zzso tests were performed with the patient under general zzso before zzso After 3 months, the tests were repeated in an ordinary clinical zzso All patients underwent rehabilitation as the first choice of zzso zzso cruciate ligament reconstruction was performed only in cases of significant zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6) at a mean of 4 years after injury zzso 4 zzso zzso After 15 years, 94 patients were available for zzso 

Of the later reconstructed patients zzso zzso zzso zzso had a high-grade zzso test under zzso compared with zzso of the zzso patients zzso zzso 45; P zzso zzso At 3 months, zzso of the zzso patients zzso zzso zzso had a high-grade zzso test compared with zzso of the reconstructed patients zzso zzso 18; P zzso zzso Twenty-five patients displayed a normal zzso test at 3 months, of whom 1 underwent later reconstruction zzso zzso zzso A high-grade zzso test at 3 months was associated with an zzso relative risk for zzso 

A positive zzso test at 3 months after injury in an awake patient is the strongest predictor for the future need for zzso Furthermore, a normal zzso test at 3 months indicates a low risk for reconstruction and is characteristic for zzso
