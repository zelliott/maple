Breast cancer is the leading cause of both zzso and mortality in women zzso For this reason, much research effort has been devoted to develop zzso zzso zzso systems for early detection of the breast zzso on zzso In this paper, we propose a new and novel dictionary zzso underpinning sparse representation based zzso zzso The key idea of the proposed zzso is to improve the zzso in terms of mass margins for the purpose of improving zzso performance in zzso zzso 

The aim of the proposed zzso framework is to construct separate zzso according to the types of mass zzso The underlying idea behind our method is that the separated zzso can enhance the zzso of mass class zzso leading to an improved performance for zzso zzso masses from normal zzso zzso When a mass sample is given for zzso the sparse solutions based on corresponding zzso are separately solved and combined at score zzso zzso have been performed on both database zzso named as Digital Database for zzso zzso zzso and clinical Full Field Digital zzso zzso zzso In our experiments, zzso concentration in the true class zzso and area under the zzso operating characteristic zzso curve zzso were measured for the comparison between the proposed method and a conventional single dictionary based zzso In addition, a support zzso machine zzso was used for comparing our method with zzso zzso extensively used for mass zzso 

Comparing with the conventional single dictionary zzso the proposed approach is able to improve zzso of up to zzso and zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the proposed method is able to improve zzso with zzso and zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso Comparing to zzso zzso the proposed method improves zzso with zzso and zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The proposed dictionary zzso is found to well improve the zzso of zzso resulting in an enhanced zzso zzso Moreover, the results show that the proposed method is better than conventional zzso zzso for zzso breast masses subject to various margins from normal zzso
