A robust automatic phase correction method for Nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso In this work, a new strategy combining zzso zzso with zzso zzso is introduced to correct various zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso a new robust baseline recognition method is proposed for determining the positions of the tail ends of the peaks, and then the preliminary phased zzso are obtained by minimizing the objective function based on the height difference of these tail zzso After the zzso zzso the zzso in the preliminary corrected zzso can be zzso into three zzso positive, negative, and zzso Based on the zzso result, a new custom negative penalty function used in the step of zzso zzso is constructed to avoid the negative peak points in the zzso excluded in the negative zzso and distorted zzso Finally, the fine phased zzso can be obtained by minimizing the custom negative penalty zzso This method is proven to be very robust for it is tolerant to low zzso ratio, large baseline distortion and independent of the starting search points of phasing zzso The experimental results on both zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrate the high efficiency of this automatic zzso
