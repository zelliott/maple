Mobile robots must be able to build their own maps to navigate in unknown zzso zzso a previously proposed method based on the fuzzy ART neural architecture zzso this paper introduces a new online method for learning maps of unknown dynamic zzso For this purpose the new zzso fuzzy zzso resonance theory neural architecture zzso is zzso It extends the zzso zzso neural network with novel mechanisms that provide important dynamic adaptation zzso zzso zzso properties are formulated and zzso A method is proposed for the perception of object zzso and then integrated with zzso The proposed methods are integrated into a navigation zzso With the new navigation architecture the mobile robot is able to navigate in changing worlds, and a degree of zzso is zzso associated to a shortest path planning approach implemented in real-time over the underlying global world zzso Experimental results obtained with a zzso 200 robot are presented demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed zzso
