A detailed analysis of structural and position dependent characteristic features of zzso will give a better understanding of the secondary structure formation in zzso zzso Here we describe an zzso that zzso the geometry of zzso in proteins on the basis of their C alpha atoms zzso The zzso program zzso can extract the zzso from the zzso files and then zzso the overall geometry of each zzso as being zzso curved or zzso in terms of its local structural features, zzso local zzso twist and rise, virtual zzso angle, local zzso origins and zzso angles between successive local zzso zzso Even zzso with large radius of zzso are zzso identified as being linear or zzso The program can also be used to differentiate a zzso zzso and other zzso such as zzso or a zzso (with a single zzso zzso with the help of local zzso zzso In addition to these, the program can also be used to zzso the zzso start and end as well as other types of secondary zzso
