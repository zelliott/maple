zzso recordings in neural tissue contain the action potential zzso of many closely spaced zzso While we can observe the action potential zzso we cannot observe which zzso is the source for which zzso nor how many source zzso are being zzso Current zzso zzso solve this problem by assuming a fixed number of source zzso and assigning the action zzso given this fixed zzso We model the spike zzso as an zzso zzso mixture model and present, as an alternative, a zzso zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso zzso to simultaneously estimate the number of source zzso and to assign each action potential to a zzso We derive this zzso zzso and illustrate its application using simulated three-dimensional data and real zzso feature zzso extracted from zzso recordings of rat zzso zzso zzso In the analysis of the simulated data our zzso finds the correct number of mixture components zzso and zzso the action potential zzso with minimal zzso In the analysis of real data, our zzso identifies clusters closely resembling those previously identified by a zzso zzso zzso zzso Our findings suggest that a zzso zzso zzso could offer a new strategy for designing automated zzso zzso
