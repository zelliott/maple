The zzso of the zzso basic aromatic zzso zzso with zzso were studied as model zzso aimed at zzso understanding of zzso relevant zzso zzso The reaction zzso of the forward and reverse processes zzso formation and zzso were studied under zzso conditions in zzso solutions at 40 degrees C in the pH range zzso in the presence of various zzso The zzso zzso were zzso formed via an zzso zzso that was not present in zzso zzso zzso formation of the zzso was complex and involved the addition of the zzso and zzso to form the zzso followed by the zzso zzso to the zzso The zzso profile was characterized by three zzso distinguishable zzso At lower pH values, the profile was consistent with specific zzso zzso addition of zzso and zzso In the pH range of 4-6 a downward bend was attributable to the change in rate determining step from addition to zzso In the pH region of 2-3 the rate law was described by specific acid zzso and zzso of the zzso form of zzso zzso buffer effects and zzso plots were shown to be consistent with this interpretation of the zzso zzso
