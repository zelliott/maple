An zzso methodology and five accompanying performance measures were developed to zzso assess the performance of the skeleton projection zzso zzso the heart of zzso spatial statistics zzso The performance measures were designed to zzso the accuracy of skeleton projection in its indented task of alleviating any residual zzso that may remain after image zzso A ground truth fractional zzso zzso image was slightly warped using a realistic zzso field that served to model zzso residual zzso of varying zzso Skeleton projection was then used to register the warped zzso image to the ground zzso Performing skeleton projection was found to yield up to 50% better correspondence between the values of zzso compared to zzso despite the fact that less than zzso of zzso zzso was zzso The zzso strategy underlying zzso was zzso as a potential explanation for this high correspondence in the values of zzso at the expense of lesser alignment between zzso zzso zzso
