Following our previous work on optimal modeling of zzso surfaces with zzso zzso we have developed a refined zzso procedure which improves the accuracy of the previous zzso We show that for normal zzso the optimal number of zzso terms usually zzso to the fourth or fifth zzso order expansion of zzso zzso On the other hand, for distorted zzso such as those encountered in zzso or in surgically altered cases, the estimated model was found to be up to three zzso orders higher than for normal zzso
