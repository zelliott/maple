We tested the hypothesis that zzso ventilation zzso with high tidal volumes zzso and zero positive zzso pressure zzso may lead to zzso lung zzso In an isolated, zzso rabbit lung model, VT and zzso were set to avoid lung collapse and zzso in both zzso resulting in a straight zzso zzso curve during constant zzso Animals were zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with VT values as high as before zzso and zero zzso zzso protective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with 50% reduction of VT and maintenance of zzso as before zzso and zzso control group zzso zzso zzso with ventilation of two lungs as before zzso The zzso zzso was associated with significantly smaller degrees of collapse and zzso in the zzso lung zzso zzso zzso Peak zzso pressure values were higher in the zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso and increased progressively throughout the observation period zzso zzso zzso The mean pulmonary artery pressure and lung weight gain values, as well as the concentration of zzso zzso were comparatively higher in the zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso A zzso strategy with VT values as high as those used in the clinical setting and zero zzso leads to zzso lung injury in this model of zzso but this can be minimized with VT and zzso values set to avoid lung zzso and zzso 

zzso ventilation with high tidal volumes and zero positive zzso pressure zzso is zzso in the isolated rabbit lung zzso A zzso strategy with tidal volumes and zzso set to avoid lung zzso and collapse zzso lung injury during zzso ventilation in this zzso
