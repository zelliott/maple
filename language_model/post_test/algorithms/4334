Many zzso and methods in artificial intelligence or machine learning were inspired by human zzso As a mechanism to handle the zzso dilemma in reinforcement learning, the loosely zzso zzso value function that models zzso zzso of humans was proposed zzso et zzso zzso While zzso shows the highest correlation with zzso induction by humans, it has been reported that it effectively works in zzso zzso problems that form the simplest class of tasks representing the zzso However, the scope of application of zzso was limited to the reinforcement learning problems that have K actions with only one state zzso zzso zzso This study proposes zzso learning architecture that can deal with general reinforcement learning tasks with multiple states and delayed zzso We tested the learning performance of the new architecture in zzso robot motion learning, where uncertainty and zzso of the environment is zzso In the test, the help of zzso internal models or functional approximation of the state space were not zzso The simulations showed that while the ordinary zzso agent does not reach zzso motion because of stagnant zzso zzso zzso with low zzso zzso escapes such zzso and acquires zzso It is confirmed that the smaller number of states is, in other words, the more zzso the division of states and the more incomplete the state observation is, the better zzso performs in comparison with zzso We also showed that the high performance of zzso depends comparatively little on zzso tuning and learning zzso This suggests that the proposed method inspired by human zzso works zzso in real zzso
