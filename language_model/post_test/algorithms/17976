To identify the neural constituents responsible for generating polarized light changes, we created zzso resolved movies of zzso action zzso from zzso lobster leg nerves using both reflection and transmission imaging zzso Changes in light polarization are associated with membrane zzso and provide zzso zzso zzso Typically, signals are detected using light transmitted through zzso however, because we eventually would like to apply polarization techniques zzso reflected light is zzso In transmission mode, the optical signal was largest throughout the center of the zzso suggesting that most of the optical signal arose from the inner nerve zzso In reflection mode, polarization changes were largest near the edges, suggesting that most of the optical signal arose from the outer zzso In support of these zzso an optical model of the tissue showed that the outer sheath is more reflective while the inner nerve bundle is more zzso In order to apply these techniques zzso we must consider that brain tissue does not have a regular orientation of processes as in the lobster zzso We tested the effect of zzso cell orientation by tying the nerve in an zzso knot prior to imaging, producing polarization changes that can be zzso even without regular cell zzso
