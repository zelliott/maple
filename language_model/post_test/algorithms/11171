To develop a prediction model for breast cancer based on common zzso findings on screening zzso aiming to reduce reader zzso in assigning zzso 

We zzso reviewed 352 positive screening zzso of women participating in the Dutch screening zzso zzso region, zzso The following zzso findings were assessed by consensus reading of three expert zzso masses and mass density, zzso architectural zzso focal asymmetry and zzso density, and zzso Data on age, diagnostic zzso and final diagnosis were collected from patient zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses were used to build a breast cancer prediction model, presented as a zzso 

Breast cancer was diagnosed in 108 cases zzso The highest positive zzso value zzso was found for zzso masses zzso and the lowest for zzso masses zzso zzso included in the zzso are age, mass, zzso architectural distortion and focal zzso 

With our zzso we developed a tool assisting screening zzso in determining the chance of zzso based on zzso zzso We propose zzso values for assigning zzso in the Dutch zzso based on our zzso which will need to be validated in future zzso These values can easily be adapted for use in other screening zzso 

zzso There is substantial reader zzso in assigning zzso in zzso zzso zzso There are no strict guidelines linking zzso findings to zzso zzso zzso We developed a model zzso predicting the presence of breast zzso zzso Our zzso is based on common findings on positive screening zzso zzso The zzso aims to assist screening zzso in assigning zzso zzso
