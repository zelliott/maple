This paper presents an zzso method for the three-dimensional zzso zzso of MR images assuming a zzso noise zzso zzso the zzso method estimates the zzso signal values using the observed MR data samples within local zzso This is not an efficient procedure to deal with this issue while the zzso MR data zzso includes many similar samples that can be used to improve the zzso zzso To overcome this problem, we model MR data as random fields and establish a zzso way which is capable of choosing the samples not only from a local neighborhood but also from a large portion of the given zzso To follow the similar samples within the MR data, an effective similarity measure based on the local statistical moments of images is zzso The parameters of the proposed filter are automatically chosen from the estimated local zzso zzso To further enhance the zzso performance, a zzso version of the introduced approach is also zzso The proposed filter is compared with related state-of-the-art filters using both synthetic and real MR zzso The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposal in removing the noise and preserving the anatomical structures of MR zzso
