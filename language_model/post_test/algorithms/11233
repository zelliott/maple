zzso the clinical zzso of functional zzso technology is an emerging objective, zzso for diagnostic and treatment zzso We propose a novel zzso spatial zzso framework for predicting follow-up neural activity based on an zzso baseline functional zzso zzso Our approach attempts to overcome some shortcomings of the modeling methods used in other zzso settings, by borrowing strength from the spatial correlations present in the zzso Our proposed methodology is zzso to data from various imaging zzso including functional magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso zzso and we provide an illustration here using zzso zzso zzso data from a study of Alzheimer's disease to predict disease zzso
