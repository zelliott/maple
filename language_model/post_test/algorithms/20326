The long-term efficacy of zzso zzso zzso detection and zzso synchronization are critical safety requirements for the development of an zzso zzso zzso zzso for treatment of zzso 

The long-term efficacy of the Metrix zzso for zzso detection and zzso synchronization was tested in 51 zzso The mean duration of follow-up was zzso days zzso to zzso zzso zzso detection tests were performed zzso times during observed operation with zzso specificity and zzso sensitivity for differentiation between zzso rhythm and zzso zzso episodes and their zzso stored in the device during zzso detection were zzso The positive zzso value of the zzso detection zzso was zzso zzso zzso confidence limit zzso zzso in the zzso zzso A total of 242 435 R waves were analyzed for zzso zzso Of these, zzso were marked for synchronized shock delivery, zzso of zzso rhythm and zzso of zzso R waves, zzso All shock markers were properly synchronized and within the R wave zzso synchronization zzso zzso lower zzso zzso zzso Overall, zzso shocks have been delivered via the zzso with no instance of zzso shock delivery or any episode of zzso The observed zzso risk was zzso with an estimated maximum zzso risk of zzso per shock zzso upper zzso 

The Metrix zzso can appropriately detect zzso with a high specificity and sensitivity and reliably zzso within a suitable R wave for shock delivery to minimize the risk of zzso zzso
