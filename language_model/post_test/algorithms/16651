The aim of this study was to investigate the optimal zzso booster vaccination strategy for The zzso A realistic zzso deterministic model was zzso Assuming a zzso situation and correcting for zzso the model was zzso using notification data from the period zzso Several sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the impact of different assumptions for parameters surrounded by uncertainty zzso duration of protection after natural infection, zzso factors, and transmission zzso The optimal age of an additional booster dose is in the range of zzso years, and zzso of this booster dose will reduce both symptomatic and zzso infections, although the zzso of symptomatic infections in older age groups will zzso The impact of the different assumptions used in the model was in general zzso We conclude that over a wide range of zzso an additional booster dose can reduce the zzso of zzso in the zzso
