The relationship between zzso evoked zzso action zzso and the zzso evoked compound action potential of the auditory nerve is of interest to those attempting to model such responses with zzso zzso It also relates to efforts to exploit the gross zzso that can now be recorded by some zzso cochlear zzso In this paper, we develop a zzso model of the auditory nerve response to single, zzso electrical stimuli based upon the response characteristics obtained from 230 single fibers of 13 zzso These fibers were zzso by brief zzso zzso zzso stimuli delivered by a zzso zzso zzso The data were pooled to obtain an estimate of the distribution of fiber zzso zzso time zzso were modeled using zzso functions and adjusted to account for zzso determined zzso and jitter zzso The zzso nature of zzso zzso functions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso fibers were then summed and zzso with an estimated zzso zzso following the method of Goldstein and zzso zzso This zzso produced zzso compound action zzso which were then compared with zzso obtained zzso zzso of model parameters affecting zzso zzso and relative spread suggest that the most important zzso of the shape of the zzso zzso function is the threshold zzso A model based solely on threshold distribution produces an zzso zzso function similar to one that accounts for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between these two models do occur if the threshold distribution function is compressed significantly, as might be the case in pathological zzso with altered zzso or numbers of nerve zzso
