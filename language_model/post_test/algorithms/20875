In this study, classical molecular dynamics simulations have been carried out on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso approach to understand the role of zzso in the formation and stabilization of zzso zzso has been zzso in the host zzso starting from N terminal to C zzso Various structural parameters have been obtained from the molecular dynamics simulation to understand the tolerance of zzso motif to zzso Depending on the position of zzso in the host zzso it zzso (or zzso the formation of the zzso zzso The substitution of zzso in the zzso zzso at some positions has no effect on the zzso formation zzso It is interesting to observe the coexistence of 3 10 and zzso in the peptides due to the zzso nature of the hydrogen bonding interaction and zzso zzso
