We recently presented a new method for zzso of zzso zzso zzso the first step in the development of an automated method for integrated interpretation of gated zzso zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to validate zzso in the assessment of global and regional function of the left zzso zzso zzso zzso the most widely used software package for zzso of zzso images, was used as reference method for the zzso of ejection fraction zzso and zzso volumes, and visual analysis by an experienced physician was used as reference method for the zzso of regional wall motion and zzso Two different groups of consecutive patients referred for zzso zzso zzso were zzso Global function was evaluated in zzso patients and regional function in 49 other zzso The studies were performed using a zzso zzso 99 zzso zzso A good correlation was found between zzso values from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + 13, r zzso zzso but zzso values were on average 4 zzso points higher than zzso zzso With zzso the segments with normal zzso according to the physician showed significantly higher zzso values (in all parts of the zzso compared to the segments classified as having abnormal zzso In conclusion, this study demonstrates that zzso can be used to zzso global and regional function in zzso zzso This is an important step in our development of an automated method for integrated interpretation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
