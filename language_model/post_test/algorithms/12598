A zzso presenting zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was used as a zzso for the detection of multiple zzso activities within human zzso Using 10 different plasma zzso zzso factor zzso factor zzso factor zzso factor zzso factor zzso zzso activated protein C, zzso and zzso and a zzso zzso zzso library zzso for P zzso all zzso acids except zzso a database was created for zzso the relative activity of each individual zzso signal in human plasma treated with various zzso zzso zzso or zzso Three separate zzso protocols were zzso searching for zzso sensing zzso sequences for a set of 5 zzso and using these zzso to detect zzso signals in zzso ranking the zzso sensing zzso for 10 zzso using local error zzso resulting in a set of zzso which were bundled via weighted averaging into a zzso that had zzso properties not zzso by any individual zzso zzso and treating each zzso map measured for each plasma preparation as a weighted sum of the 10 maps obtained for the 10 zzso zzso using a global error zzso The similarity of the results from these latter two protocols indicated that a small subset of zzso zzso contained the majority of zzso zzso The results were consistent with the state of the zzso cascade expected when treated with the given zzso This method may allow development of future zzso using minimal and zzso zzso These zzso can be applied to real-time diagnostic zzso of complex zzso zzso
