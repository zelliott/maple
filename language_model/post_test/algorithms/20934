We review the application of mathematical modeling to understanding the behavior of populations of zzso zzso The application of zzso mathematical models, in particular generalized zzso models, is discussed along with attempts to incorporate the zzso zzso behavior on the zzso modeling the interaction between different species of bacteria, the interaction of bacteria with their environment, and methods used to obtain zzso verified zzso zzso We zzso briefly to the role of modeling pattern formation in understanding collective behavior within bacterial zzso Various aspects of each model are discussed and areas for possible future research are zzso
