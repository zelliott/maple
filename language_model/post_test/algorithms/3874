zzso aspects of rate zzso pacing are dealt with in the context of the cardiovascular control loop with the cardiac output as the controlling quantity and mean zzso blood pressure as the controlled zzso Different methods proposed or clinically investigated are analyzed with respect to cardiovascular control zzso To qualify as zzso the zzso pacing rate must respond to zzso variables similarly as the zzso zzso To achieve this, the feedback signals, which control the cardiac output and are summarized as the sympathetic and zzso zzso of the heart, are prime candidates as input signals for rate control in the presence of zzso zzso Since only sympathetic tone can serve to increase zzso and thereby stroke volume and cardiac output in the absence of rate support, its meaningful measurement is the key for zzso zzso rate zzso zzso clinically has proved to be a measure of zzso which represents sympathetic tone as it affects central zzso zzso pacing rate adaptation therefore enables restoration of a zzso pacing system utilizing those components of the zzso system that are still zzso
