zzso models provide an attractive approach for studying large neural networks because they can be simulated rapidly and are amenable to mathematical zzso Traditional zzso models assume a simple form in which the dynamics are governed by a single time zzso These models fail to replicate certain dynamic features of populations of zzso zzso especially those involving zzso We present a zzso zzso model derived from an zzso expansion of the zzso equation and apply it to the zzso zzso and exponential zzso zzso Despite being almost as simple as a traditional zzso description, this model can reproduce zzso dynamics due to partial synchronization of the action zzso in a zzso model, and it successfully predicts the transition to spike synchronization in networks of coupled zzso and zzso zzso
