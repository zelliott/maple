Current zzso methods for zzso zzso and mean pulmonary artery pressures zzso in children are cumbersome and have limited zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso zzso with zzso and mean zzso and that this correlation can be used to estimate zzso and mean zzso from zzso flow zzso 

We recorded zzso in 112 patients 30 years or younger zzso for heart failure, heart zzso pulmonary hypertension, or zzso heart zzso We derived the relationship of zzso zzso to zzso and mean zzso We then applied these relations to zzso zzso measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso flow in a subset of 17 patients with pulmonary hypertension to predict mean and zzso zzso and correlated the zzso 

An excellent linear relation was found between zzso zzso and both the zzso and mean zzso measured at cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso The calculated zzso zzso calculated from zzso zzso correlated well with invasive data zzso zzso 13 vs 30 zzso 11 zzso zzso respectively, not zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso and surpassed existing methods that are based on pulmonary zzso for predicting zzso zzso Similarly, mean zzso calculated from zzso zzso flow correlated well with invasive data zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

A strong linear relationship between zzso and zzso zzso allows for easy and accurate zzso zzso of zzso and mean zzso from zzso zzso zzso
