This paper considers the lag synchronization zzso issue of unknown coupled chaotic delayed zzso fuzzy neural networks zzso with noise zzso Separate research work has been published on the stability of fuzzy neural network and zzso issue of unknown coupled chaotic neural networks, as well as its application in secure zzso However, there have not been any studies that integrate the zzso zzso by the achievements from both fields, we explored the benefits of zzso fuzzy logic theories into the study of zzso problems and applied the findings to secure zzso Based on zzso feedback control techniques and suitable zzso zzso several sufficient conditions are developed to guarantee the zzso of coupled chaotic delayed zzso with or without noise zzso The problem studied in this paper is more general in many zzso Various problems studied extensively in the literature can be treated as special cases of the findings of this paper, such as complete synchronization zzso effect of fuzzy logic, and noise zzso This paper presents an illustrative example and uses simulated results of this example to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed zzso zzso This research also demonstrates the effectiveness of application of the proposed zzso feedback scheme in secure communication by comparing chaotic masking with fuzziness with some previous zzso zzso signal with fuzziness is more complex, which makes zzso more difficult due to the added fuzzy zzso
