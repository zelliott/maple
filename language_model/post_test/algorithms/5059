The study of zzso zzso unwinding by zzso is a problem of basic scientific zzso One such example is provided by studies on the zzso C virus zzso zzso zzso using single zzso mechanical zzso zzso currently zzso nearly zzso of the world population and zzso is a protein essential for viral zzso zzso The objective of this study is to model the zzso unwinding mechanism based on previously published data and study its characteristics and their dependence on force, zzso and zzso protein zzso In this work, zzso unwinding by zzso zzso is hypothesized to occur in a series of discrete steps and the steps themselves occurring in accordance with an underlying point zzso A point process driven change point model is employed to model the zzso unwinding zzso The results are in large agreement with findings in previous zzso A gamma distribution based renewal process was found to model well the point process that drives the unwinding zzso The analysis suggests that the periods of constant extension observed during zzso activity can indeed be classified into pauses and zzso and that each depend on the zzso zzso The step size is independent of external factors and seems to have a median value of zzso base zzso The steps themselves are composed of a number of zzso with an average of about 4 zzso per step and an average zzso size of about zzso base zzso An interesting finding zzso to the stepping zzso Our analysis indicates that stepping zzso may be of two zzso a low and a high zzso
