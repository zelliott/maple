Both zzso zzso zzso and zzso drainage zzso may reduce the need for exchange of external zzso drainage zzso and shunt surgery in patients with zzso zzso and severe zzso zzso We investigated the feasibility and safety of zzso followed by early zzso for the treatment of zzso zzso 

This prospective study included patients with spontaneous zzso zzso zzso and severe zzso zzso with acute zzso zzso zzso who received an zzso zzso The treatment zzso started with zzso (4 zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso every 12 zzso until clearance of the third and fourth zzso from zzso zzso zzso was clamped and if clamping was zzso zzso zzso zzso was assumed and zzso zzso zzso was removed if there was neither an increase of zzso pressure nor zzso enlargement on zzso A zzso shunt was indicated if zzso zzso was unsuccessful for zzso zzso zzso was assessed at 90 and 180 days using the modified Rankin zzso 

zzso resulted in fast clearance of the third and fourth zzso zzso zzso However, early zzso removal was only possible in 4 zzso The remaining 28 patients developed zzso zzso zzso In all of these patients, early zzso was capable to replace zzso zzso exchange was not necessary and zzso duration was zzso zzso Only one patient required a zzso zzso At 180 days, 20 zzso patients had a good zzso Rankin zzso 0 to 3) outcome and 5 zzso patients had zzso One patient had zzso zzso zzso 

In patients with secondary zzso zzso and zzso zzso the combined treatment approach of zzso and early zzso is safe and zzso avoids zzso exchange, and may markedly reduce the need for shunt zzso
