zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso signal changes can be separated from background noise by various processing zzso including the well-known zzso zzso However, discriminating signal changes due to zzso brain activities from those due to zzso head motion or other artifacts correlated in time to the task has been little zzso We examine whether three exploratory zzso zzso analyses correctly zzso these possibilities by capturing zzso zzso zzso fluctuation analysis, zzso zzso analysis, and zzso fluctuation analysis zzso We specifically evaluate whether these zzso zzso methods can be effective and reliable in discriminating zzso from zzso zzso is indeed robust for such zzso Brain zzso maps derived by zzso are similar, but not zzso to maps derived by zzso zzso explicitly zzso task timing to extract the signals whereas zzso does not, so these methods reveal somewhat different information from the zzso zzso is better than zzso for distinguishing zzso zzso from zzso artifacts, although a combination of these approaches is superior to either one taken zzso We also present a method for zzso noise levels in zzso data, validated with zzso simulations suggesting that zzso model is effective for simulating zzso zzso zzso further corroborate that zzso is excellent at discriminating signal changes due to zzso brain activities from those due to zzso artifacts, under a range of zzso
