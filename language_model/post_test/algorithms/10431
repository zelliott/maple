zzso zzso or zzso is a commonly used zzso analysis technique in the field of zzso zzso Although routinely referred to as a single technique, zzso in fact encompasses several different methods, both with regard to defining the spatial filters used to reconstruct zzso time series and in terms of the analysis of these time zzso This paper evaluates two alternative methods of spatial filter construction and zzso It demonstrates how zzso different requirements into the design of these filters has an effect on the results zzso The analyses presented demonstrate the potential value of zzso which examine the zzso projections in multiple zzso at a single location by showing that zzso can reconstruct predominantly zzso sources in the case of a zzso forward zzso The accuracy of source reconstruction appears to be more related to depth than source zzso Furthermore, it is shown that using three zzso spatial filters can result in inaccurate zzso time series zzso The paper concludes with brief recommendations regarding reporting zzso zzso in order to help remove ambiguity about the specifics of the techniques which have been zzso
