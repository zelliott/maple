An automated zzso and methodology is presented to identify zzso zzso based on broadband scatter data measured by zzso scan imaging of the zzso A zzso zzso imaging system was used to directly measure the tissue scatter zzso in zzso and the spectrum was used to identify the scattering power, zzso and total zzso zzso zzso tumor and normal samples were characterized using the zzso and subtle changes in the scatter signal were encountered within regions of each zzso Discrimination between normal versus tumor tissue was readily performed using a zzso neighbor zzso zzso A similar approach worked for regions of tumor zzso when statistical zzso of the scattering parameters was included to create additional data zzso This type of automated interpretation methodology can provide a tool for guiding surgical zzso in areas where zzso imaging cannot be realized efficiently by the zzso In addition, the results indicate important design changes for future zzso
