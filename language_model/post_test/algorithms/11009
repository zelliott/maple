A new zzso approach for zzso of zzso and external elastic zzso zzso surface of coronary vessels in gated 20 zzso zzso ultrasound zzso image sequences zzso is zzso The approach consists of a fully automated zzso stage zzso zzso or zzso and a zzso zzso refinement zzso zzso or zzso zzso Both approaches are based on the zzso approach for simultaneous zzso zzso zzso This combination allows the user to efficiently combine general information about zzso image appearance and zzso zzso zzso and therefore deal with frequently occurring issues like zzso zzso signal zzso imaging zzso The automated zzso stage starts with zzso the zzso to automatically define the zzso zzso which is used to transform the zzso task into a zzso graph zzso zzso Following the automated zzso the user can inspect the result and correct local or regional zzso zzso by zzso providing approximate clues regarding the location of the desired surface zzso This expert information is zzso to modify the previously calculated cost functions, locally zzso the underlying modified graph without a need to start the new zzso from zzso zzso of our method was performed on 41 gated 20 zzso zzso data sets for which an zzso independent standard was zzso zzso from the automated stage of the approach zzso the mean and standard zzso of the root mean square area errors for the zzso and external elastic zzso surfaces were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso , zzso Following the refinement stage zzso the root mean square area errors significantly decreased to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for the same surfaces, respectively ( for both zzso The approach is delivering a previously zzso speed of obtaining clinically relevant zzso compared to the current approaches of automated zzso followed by manual zzso
