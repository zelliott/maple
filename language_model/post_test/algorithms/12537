To evaluate a novel zzso zzso zzso projection reconstruction zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso method for identifying potential bypass graft target vessels in patients with Class zzso peripheral vascular zzso 

Twenty patients zzso zzso zzso mean age zzso 58 years, range zzso zzso zzso were recruited from routine zzso zzso All imaging was performed on a zzso T zzso system with fast zzso zzso zzso GE zzso zzso zzso Images were acquired with a novel technique that combined zzso zzso with a zzso acquisition to yield an zzso method with high zzso and spatial zzso The method is called zzso zzso zzso imaging of contrast zzso zzso zzso and qualitative analyses were used to compare two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso and zzso in 13 zzso segments per lower zzso zzso analysis was performed with the zzso zzso zzso 

Fifteen percent zzso of the vessels were scored as missing or zzso with zzso zzso but were scored as diagnostic with zzso Image quality was superior with zzso zzso zzso zzso (on a zzso scale, mean rank zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso produced images with high zzso ratios zzso and high spatial and zzso zzso zzso zzso images were of inferior quality due to moderate spatial resolution, inferior zzso greater zzso artifacts, and absence of zzso zzso 

zzso provides superior zzso assessment of lower limb zzso compared to zzso zzso
