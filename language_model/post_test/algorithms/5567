zzso zzso in proteins are believed to occur in order to preserve the protein functional folding through zzso Their values can be deduced from sequence and/or structural alignments and are indicative of zzso contacts in the protein three-dimensional zzso A correlation among pairs of zzso is routinely evaluated with the zzso correlation zzso and the zzso similarity zzso In literature, there is no justification for the adoption of the zzso instead of other substitution zzso In this paper, we approach the problem of computing the optimal similarity zzso for contact prediction with correlated zzso zzso the similarity zzso that zzso the accuracy of contact prediction with correlated zzso We describe an zzso zzso based on the zzso descent method, for computing the optimal similarity zzso and perform an extensive number of experimental zzso Our tests show that there is a large number of optimal zzso that perform similarly to zzso We also obtain that the upper limit to the accuracy achievable in protein contact prediction is independent of the zzso similarity zzso This suggests that the poor scoring of the correlated zzso approach may be due to the choice of the linear correlation function in evaluating correlated zzso
