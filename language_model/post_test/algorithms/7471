In the field of computer aided medical image analysis, it is often difficult to obtain reliable ground truth for evaluating zzso or supervising statistical learning zzso In this paper we present a new method for training a zzso forest from images zzso by zzso performing experts, while simultaneously evaluating the performance of each zzso Our approach builds upon state-of-the-art zzso zzso forest techniques for medical image zzso and recent methods for the fusion of multiple expert zzso By incorporating the performance evaluation within the training phase, we obtain a novel forest framework for learning from conflicting expert decisions, accounting for both zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrate on a synthetic example that our method allows to retrieve the correct zzso among other incorrectly zzso images, and we present an application to the automatic zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso ultrasound zzso
