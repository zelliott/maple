zzso digital models of 16 different sauropods were used to examine the zzso relationship between metabolism and surface areas of the whole body, the neck, and the tail in an attempt to see if the zzso could have functioned as zzso for the elimination of excess body zzso The sauropod zzso sample ranged in body mass from a zzso zzso juvenile zzso to a 25 zzso adult zzso zzso was assumed to be directly zzso to body mass raised to the zzso power, and estimates of body mass accounted for the presence of lungs and systems of air zzso in the trunk and zzso Surface areas were determined by zzso the model surfaces into zzso and their areas being zzso by zzso zzso It was found that total body surface area was almost zzso with body mass, and that it showed negative zzso when plotted against zzso zzso In contrast, neck area showed positive zzso when plotted against zzso zzso Tail area show negative zzso with respect to zzso zzso The many uncertainties about the biology of zzso and the variety of environmental conditions that different species experienced during the groups 150 million years of existence, make it difficult to be absolutely certain about the function of the neck as a zzso However, the functional combination of the zzso increase of neck area, the systems of air zzso in the neck and zzso the active control of blood flow between the core and surface of the body, changing skin color, and strategic orientation of the neck with respect to wind, make it plausible that the neck could have functioned as a radiator to avoid zzso
