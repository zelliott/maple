zzso zzso is a ubiquitous regulatory scheme for maintaining zzso in living zzso Individual zzso pathways with zzso zzso are stable as long as one zzso step is rate zzso However, pathways are often coupled both by the use of a common zzso and by zzso zzso of their products for cell zzso We show that such a coupled network with zzso zzso may exhibit zzso zzso which arise via a zzso zzso Our results highlight novel evolutionary constraints on the architecture of zzso
