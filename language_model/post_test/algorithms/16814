We found that the accuracy of the phase observation in zzso electron zzso is strongly restricted by time variations of mean intensity and contrast of the zzso A modified method was developed for correcting these zzso Experimental results demonstrated that the modification enabled us to acquire a large number of zzso and as a result, the accuracy of the phase observation has been improved by a factor of zzso
