Recent advances in ecological niche modeling zzso zzso in conjunction with increasing availability of geographic information system zzso data, allow zzso niches to be predicted over broad geographic areas using environmental characteristics associated with point localities for a given zzso zzso the examination of how niches evolve is now possible using a regionally inclusive zzso approach to characterize the environmental requirements of a zzso zzso work that uses this approach has suggested that niche evolution is characterized by conservatism: the more closely related species are, the more similar are their zzso We applied a zzso approach to examine niche evolution during the radiation of Cuban zzso zzso zzso zzso group), which has produced 15 species in zzso We modeled the niche of 11 species within this group using the zzso zzso zzso and examined the evolution of the niche using a zzso based on approximately 1500 base pairs of zzso zzso No general relationship exists between zzso similarity and niche zzso zzso of species pairs indicates some examples in which closely related species display niche conservatism and some in which they exhibit highly divergent zzso In addition, some zzso related species exhibit significant niche zzso Comparisons also revealed a zzso sister species pair in which the niche of one species is zzso zzso and much zzso than, the niche of another closely related zzso
