In this paper, a new zzso control approach is presented for zzso zzso zzso systems with unknown zzso A more general and systematic statistical measure, called zzso is adopted here to characterize the uncertainty of the considered zzso By using the zzso zzso technique, the zzso estimate of the zzso is zzso Then, the improved zzso based controllers are developed for zzso zzso zzso systems by minimizing the zzso of the tracking errors in closed zzso The condition to guarantee the strictly decreasing zzso of tracking error is zzso Moreover, the convergence in the zzso sense has been analyzed for all the weights in the neural zzso Finally, the comparative simulation results are presented to show that the performance of the proposed zzso is superior to that of zzso control zzso
