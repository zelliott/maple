In this paper we propose a framework for detecting health patterns based on zzso sensor sequence similarity and natural language processing zzso In zzso an aging in place facility from Columbia, zzso we deployed 47 sensor networks together with a nursing electronic health record zzso system to provide early illness zzso The proposed framework zzso sensor sequence similarity and zzso on zzso nursing comments to automatically notify the physician when health problems are zzso The reported methodology is inspired by zzso sequence zzso using similarity zzso such as Smith zzso zzso Similarly, for each sensor zzso we associate health concepts extracted from the nursing notes using zzso a zzso tool provided by zzso Medical Language System zzso Since sensor zzso unlike zzso ones, have an associated time dimension we propose a zzso zzso of SW zzso to account for zzso The main challenges presented by our framework are finding the most suitable time sequence similarity and zzso of the retrieved zzso zzso On a pilot zzso from three Tiger Place residents, with a total of zzso sensor days and zzso nursing records, we obtained an average precision of zzso and a recall of zzso
