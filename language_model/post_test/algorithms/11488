A study of the operator contact force influence on the performance of zzso zzso zzso zzso Machines zzso is presented in this zzso After developing a sensor capable of measuring the contact force applied by an operator, a ring gauge has been used to zzso the relationship between the contact force and diameter and form errors measured with the zzso As a result, contact force has been proved as one of the main factors influencing the zzso zzso A probe zzso model based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been also proposed in order to obtain the zzso probe zzso caused by contact zzso This allows measurement correction by comparing them with reference values, specifically, a ring zzso Experimental test results show a significant measurement improvement that zzso diameter zzso Finally, an uncertainty evaluation for the contact force sensor and zzso zzso with and without probe zzso model has been carried out in order to validate the ability of the sensor and the methodology zzso
