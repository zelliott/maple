The Moving zzso type artificial zzso as well as many other artificial hearts uses a motor as its power zzso For zzso of control parameters such as pump rate, pump zzso blood pressure profile and flow form, the precise motor speed control is zzso However, because the zzso device has limited carrying capacity of hardware components in size and number, applying diverse motor control methods are not zzso In addition, the existing zzso zzso motor controller does not show satisfactory zzso A new controller that is sufficiently robust for the changes of load and physical system parameters has been designed and zzso The robust speed controller is based on the sliding mode control method that is zzso to a system of which the ranges of uncertainty in physical parameters are zzso In a mock circulation system test, the actual speed showed good tracking characteristics in respect to the reference zzso Fast follow-up characteristics were also observed under high zzso and speed zzso The speed error, current and power consumption were reduced by about zzso The proposed control technique overcomes the limitations of the zzso zzso and makes important improvements in both performance and zzso
