An approach to zzso zzso the reduced zzso bubble model zzso is developed from the critical phase zzso The phase limit is introduced, extended, and applied within zzso theory proposed by zzso Much is different in the zzso algorithm, on both theoretical and applied sides, with a focus on permissible bubble excesses rather than just dissolved gas zzso something of a departure from traditional zzso Overall, the approach is conservative, with changes in zzso settings zzso zzso Marginal profiles permitted by tables and meters are restricted by the bubble zzso zzso features of the conservative zzso include: zzso reduced zzso time limits from the zzso model zzso zzso short safety stops (or shallow swimming zzso in the zzso feet of sea water zzso zzso zzso ascent and descent rates of 60 zzso or zzso zzso restricted repetitive zzso particularly beyond 100 zzso based on reduced permissible bubble zzso zzso restricted spike zzso zzso based on zzso of additional zzso zzso restricted zzso activity based on zzso of zzso zzso consistent treatment of altitude diving within model zzso zzso zzso linked to zzso theory and zzso zzso to medical reports about the long term effects of breathing zzso gases and shortcomings in dissolved gas models, conservative modeling seems zzso
