Continuous wave electron zzso resonance imaging for in zzso mapping of spin distribution and spectral shape requires rapid data zzso A zzso imaging technique is presented that provides an order of magnitude reduction in acquisition time, compared to zzso zzso zzso The proposed approach assumes that spectral shapes in the sample are zzso by members from a zzso family of zzso A model is developed for the zzso measured with magnetic field zzso zzso defining the spin distribution and spectral shapes are then determined directly from the zzso using maximum a zzso probability zzso The approach does not suffer approximation error from limited sweep zzso of the main magnetic field and explicitly incorporates the zzso in zzso ratio versus strength of magnetic field zzso The processing technique is zzso demonstrated on a one-dimensional phantom containing a zzso spin label with constant zzso Using an zzso zzso zzso spectral shapes and spin distribution are accurately recovered from two projections and a spectral window which is comparable to the maximum zzso of the zzso
