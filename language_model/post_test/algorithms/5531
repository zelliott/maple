This in zzso research verified the possibility of eliminating zzso caused by coffee and red wine in five composite zzso after being submitted to zzso zzso zzso specimens were prepared and immersed in water at zzso for 24 zzso After zzso zzso color was measured in a zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All specimens were submitted to zzso cycling at temperatures of 5 and zzso with a dwell time of 1 minute, for 1,000 cycles in a zzso zzso zzso After zzso zzso the specimens were immersed in water at zzso until 7 days had elapsed from the time the specimens were zzso All specimens were then taken to the zzso for color zzso The specimens were divided into three groups (N zzso zzso distilled water zzso coffee, and red zzso For the zzso process to occur on only one surface, all the sides, except one, of the surfaces were isolated with white zzso The specimens were immersed in one of the solutions at zzso for 14 zzso The specimens were dried and taken to the zzso for color zzso After this, the specimens were submitted to 20 zzso wear three times, and the color was measured after each one of the wear zzso zzso of the color difference was made using zzso zzso According to the methodology used in this research, it was concluded that the zzso caused by coffee and red wine was superficial and one wear of 20 zzso was sufficient to remove the zzso
