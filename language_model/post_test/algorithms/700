A new control strategy has been introduced for operating zzso zzso processes efficiently at high zzso The control system includes a cascade controller embedded into a zzso zzso system based on zzso zzso Three process zzso considered to be the most realistic variables for monitoring of the zzso were selected zzso zzso production rate, and the difference between the actual zzso flow and its zzso The control system examines these variables and varies the organic load by manipulating the zzso zzso Good control performance was achieved during the start-up, during zzso running operations, and during rejection of zzso The main advantages of this control approach can be attributed to its ability to adjust control parameters automatically, both for zzso operation and for rejection of zzso Furthermore, the zzso flow can be tuned automatically according to variations in organic matter in the feed without the characteristics of the zzso being zzso
