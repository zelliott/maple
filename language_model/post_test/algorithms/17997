To evaluate the efficacy and safety of neural vision enhancement technology zzso zzso zzso to improve visual acuity and contrast sensitivity function in eyes with low zzso 

Singapore Eye Research Institute, Singapore, zzso 

This zzso zzso case series comprised 20 Asian adults between 19 and 53 years of age with low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso to zzso D in the worst eye; zzso not exceeding zzso D in either eye; zzso visual acuity zzso zzso or zzso zzso who had zzso zzso The main outcome measures were distance zzso zzso contrast sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

All eyes had improvement in zzso and contrast zzso After treatment, the mean distance zzso improved by a mean of zzso lines on the Early Treatment zzso zzso Study zzso zzso The mean contrast sensitivity improved over a range of spatial zzso on zzso contrast sensitivity chart testing zzso to 18 cycles per zzso zzso data up to 12 months zzso showed that the gains were zzso Treatment did not alter refraction zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso No adverse effects were zzso 

zzso evidence suggests zzso treatment is safe and improves zzso and zzso contrast sensitivity in adult patients with low zzso
