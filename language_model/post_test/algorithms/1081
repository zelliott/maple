Continuous monitoring of dynamic cerebral zzso using a moving correlation index of cerebral zzso pressure and mean middle cerebral artery flow zzso may be useful in patients with severe traumatic brain injury to guide treatment, and has been shown to be of zzso zzso 

To compare an index of dynamic cerebral zzso zzso with an index of zzso cerebral zzso zzso 

zzso was validated in a prospective comparative study against zzso using 83 testing sessions in 17 patients with traumatic brain zzso zzso and zzso were calculated simultaneously during zzso induced blood pressure zzso 

zzso was significantly correlated with zzso (R zzso zzso p zzso zzso Nine patients were found to have failure of cerebral zzso with an zzso value zzso zzso If an zzso value of zzso was used as the cut off point for failure of cerebral zzso this index had zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity for demonstrating failure of zzso compared with the zzso An increase in cerebral blood flow zzso correlated significantly with zzso (R zzso zzso p zzso zzso but not with cerebral zzso pressure (R zzso zzso 

Dynamic and zzso cerebral zzso are significantly correlated in traumatic brain zzso zzso zzso can be monitored zzso zzso and reliably assessed using a moving correlation analysis of cerebral zzso pressure and cerebral blood flow zzso zzso The zzso index can be used to monitor cerebral blood flow zzso It is useful in traumatic brain injury because it does not require any external zzso
