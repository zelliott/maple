A new zzso zzso zzso for identification of alpha satellite zzso and zzso repeat zzso units was introduced and zzso Starting with an initial key zzso we determine the dominant key string and zzso Our zzso zzso was used to scan the recent zzso data for human alpha satellite DNA sequence zzso zzso 277 zzso from the zzso region of zzso zzso The sequence was zzso segmented into one zzso domain zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso provided zzso in terms of alpha zzso The zzso is zzso repeated in 54 copies in the zzso zzso zzso Five insertions and three deletions in the zzso structure associated with a dominant key string were zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso of individual zzso copies from zzso amounts to zzso on the average, while divergence between 16 zzso zzso within each zzso is on the average zzso In the front and back domain, 199 zzso zzso were identified that are not organized in zzso and diverge by zzso
