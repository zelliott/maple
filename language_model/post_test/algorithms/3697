zzso zzso theory is extended to realistic networks of zzso zzso storing in synaptic zzso of randomly chosen stimuli of a given low coding zzso The underlying synaptic zzso is the result of a zzso slow, long-term synaptic plasticity of two-state zzso upon repeated presentation of the fixed set of the stimuli to be zzso The neural populations zzso the zzso description are classified by the number of stimuli to which their zzso are responsive zzso This involves zzso + 1 populations for a network storing p zzso The zzso complexity of the zzso description is then significantly reduced by observing that at low coding levels zzso only a few populations remain zzso the population of mean zzso - zzso and those of zzso of order square root zzso around the zzso The theory is used to produce zzso zzso zzso (the onset of selective delay activity and the rates in its various stationary zzso and to zzso the storage capacity of the network (the zzso number of single items used in training for each of which the network can sustain a persistent, selective activity zzso This is done in various regions of the space of zzso parameters for the zzso and for the learning zzso The capacity is zzso in zzso versus zzso zzso ratio of zzso to depression probability and coding level zzso The zzso results compare well with recordings of delay activity rate zzso in simulations of the underlying microscopic network of 10,000 zzso
