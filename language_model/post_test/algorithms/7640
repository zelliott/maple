zzso zzso time zzso has been used to monitor zzso and guide management of zzso control in patients undergoing cardiac surgery for zzso However, reversal of zzso with zzso is typically zzso based on total zzso zzso zzso adverse effects of zzso are well zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate a zzso reversal strategy based on calculation of the zzso dose based on ACT zzso We present a method using a mathematical formula based on the zzso line zzso To check the formula, we performed a retrospective zzso cohort study of 177 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with zzso bypass zzso The study group of 80 patients was administered the dose of zzso obtained using our formula, and the control group of 97 patients was administered the zzso calculated zzso The ACT returned to normal values in patients who were given doses of zzso that were calculated using our zzso all but two had a final ACT of zzso The application of the formula resulted in a significant reduction in the dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso The formula we present is a valid method for calculating the dose of zzso necessary to neutralize zzso This same method can be used working with a target ACT to adjust the dose of zzso As a result of its zzso it allows application on a daily basis zzso the zzso We believe that the formula we developed can be applied in all those procedures in which it is necessary to zzso patients with zzso and later zzso zzso surgery with or without zzso vascular surgery, procedures of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
