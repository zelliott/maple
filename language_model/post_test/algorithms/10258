In most of the approaches of zzso detection of breast cancer, one of the zzso steps applied to the mammogram is the zzso of zzso muscle, as its presence within the mammogram may adversely affect the outcome of cancer detection zzso Through this study, we propose an efficient automatic method using the watershed transformation for identifying the zzso muscle in zzso zzso view zzso The watershed transformation of the mammogram shows interesting properties that include the appearance of a unique watershed line corresponding to the zzso muscle zzso In addition to this, it is observed that the zzso muscle region is zzso due to the existence of several zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso a suitable merging zzso is proposed to combine the appropriate zzso zzso to obtain the correct zzso muscle zzso A total of 84 zzso from the zzso image analysis database were used to validate this zzso The mean false positive and mean false negative rates, obtained by comparing the results of the proposed approach with zzso zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso respectively, were zzso and zzso A comparison of the results of the proposed method with related state-of-the-art methods shows that the performance of the proposed approach is better than the existing methods in terms of the mean false negative zzso Using zzso distance zzso the comparison of the results of the proposed method with ground truth shows low zzso zzso the mean and standard zzso being zzso zzso zzso zzso
