The ideal zzso zzso technique for zzso calls for zzso dose to the entire zzso including the zzso zzso and zero dose to the zzso Published techniques, most of which use zzso have not accomplished this ideal zzso We describe here a technique that approaches this ideal zzso using electron beam zzso 

zzso calculations were made using a computer program built around a proprietary zzso This program zzso zzso dose distribution for electrons and photons and uses the zzso feasibility method for the inverse problem of beam weighting to achieve the prescribed zzso The zzso has been verified in the zzso region by zzso in a zzso zzso To search for an ideal zzso beam setup, a stylized phantom of an zzso infant was generated with built-in zzso and a phantom of a 5-year-old child was generated from a patient CT zzso 

Of more than 100 different beam zzso tested, two 9 zzso electron beams at zzso angles plus and minus 26 degrees from the zzso nerve axis achieved the best zzso Both fields have a lens block and an zzso between the globe and origin of the zzso zzso When equal doses are given to both fields, the entire extent of the zzso (including zzso zzso received zzso while the lens received zzso or zzso 

The zzso technique here described appears to meet most of the stringent zzso needed to treat zzso It is suitable for a range of ages, from infancy to early childhood zzso
