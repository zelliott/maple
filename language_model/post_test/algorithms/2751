We report the initiation of zzso zzso by a St Jude zzso zzso with a programmed zzso zzso zzso zzso used for minimizing or zzso right zzso zzso This feature zzso the zzso zzso delay periodically to determine if zzso sensed events follow zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were initiated by long extended zzso delays of 300 and 400 zzso The zzso zzso delay consisted of the programmed sensed zzso delay zzso zzso plus the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plus 100 milliseconds imposed by the zzso zzso when it detected loss of zzso zzso
