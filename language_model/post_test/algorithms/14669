zzso It is well established that glaucoma results in a thinning of the inner zzso To investigate whether the outer zzso is also involved, zzso retinal imaging techniques were zzso 

zzso from 10 glaucoma patients zzso years zzso were zzso using three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso optical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso illuminated zzso camera zzso zzso and zzso zzso were examined for any abnormalities in the retinal zzso On some patients, cone density zzso were made from the zzso en face zzso zzso between retinal structure and visual sensitivity were measured by zzso zzso zzso testing made at the corresponding retinal zzso 

All three in zzso imaging zzso revealed evidence of outer retinal changes along with the expected thinning of the inner zzso in zzso eyes with zzso zzso zzso images identified the exact location of structural changes within the cone zzso layer with the zzso en face images showing dark areas in the cone mosaic at the same retinal locations with reduced visual zzso 

zzso in cone density along with expected inner retinal changes were demonstrated in zzso glaucoma patients with zzso zzso
