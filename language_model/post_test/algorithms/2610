zzso ventilation zzso for acute zzso respiratory failure in chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso has been shown to decrease zzso zzso and zzso however, little guidance exists on zzso zzso This study aimed to explore patient outcomes and the process of zzso initiation following the introduction of an zzso 

zzso modified zzso zzso zzso measures were performed during the control period and repeated in the zzso zzso 

Acute secondary care teaching hospital, wherever zzso was commenced zzso and emergency, medical assessment unit, zzso medicine zzso 

Thirty-four patients with COPD and acute zzso respiratory zzso 

An zzso was devised for use when initiating zzso highlighting four aspects of care from the evidence zzso zzso tidal volume, zzso and zzso 

zzso pH value, zzso scale rating of zzso and a staff questionnaire on the process of zzso zzso 

No significant difference was found in changes in pH or zzso zzso However, three of the four aspects of care promoted by the zzso were reported more frequently in the intervention zzso Increased assessment of tidal volume zzso cases in control phase, zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso zzso cases in zzso phase, zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso reached statistical significance zzso zzso exact zzso 

This study presents an zzso to assist the application of zzso and has demonstrated changes in practice following its zzso It is proposed that the zzso is considered for use within services that initiate zzso Further work is required to explore the effects of staff education and the promotion of zzso
