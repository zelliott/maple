zzso of zzso blood flow zzso by means of zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso requires knowledge of the zzso input function zzso which is usually estimated from the left zzso zzso zzso of the contrast agent zzso may occur between the zzso and the tissue of interest, which leads to systematic zzso of the zzso The aim of this study was to simulate the zzso along a simplified coronary artery with different zzso To analyze the zzso in vessels with typical dimensions of coronary zzso simulations were performed using the zzso fluid dynamics zzso zzso were accomplished on straight vessels with integrated zzso of different degrees of area reduction and length as well as two different zzso zzso zzso and an zzso Two boundary conditions were used representing zzso blood flow at rest and under zzso zzso The results under steady boundary conditions show that the zzso is more pronounced in resting condition than during zzso yielding an zzso of the zzso around zzso in the resting state and around zzso under stress zzso At the outlet of the vessel an zzso zzso zzso results in increased zzso whereas an zzso zzso yields a zzso Due to the more severe zzso resting zzso may be more underestimated in quantitative zzso zzso zzso studies compared with zzso under stress zzso In consequence the zzso zzso reserve may be zzso The amount of systematic error depends in a complex way on the shape and degree of zzso
