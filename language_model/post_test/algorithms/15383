The zzso zzso zzso activates the general stress response zzso of zzso zzso by zzso a large protein complex (the zzso We have constructed a model for the zzso zzso and derived an equation for the fraction of zzso in the zzso signaling state at a given light zzso The model was verified zzso in zzso on wild type zzso and on an zzso zzso with faster recovery zzso Application of the model to the zzso of the zzso at various light zzso in zzso revealed that the zzso is more sensitive to light than would be expected based on zzso in zzso zzso These results were confirmed with the zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso Additionally, we have demonstrated the presence of a zzso branching reaction that converts the signaling state of zzso to the dark zzso Extension of the model with this reaction shows that it does not contribute significantly to the in zzso zzso zzso The model represents an important step towards a complete systems biology model of the zzso
