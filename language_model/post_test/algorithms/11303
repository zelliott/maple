zzso assembly is a powerful method of protein structure prediction that builds protein models from a pool of candidate fragments taken from known zzso zzso sampling is subsequently used to refine the zzso The structures are first represented as zzso models and then as zzso models for zzso zzso Many models have to be generated independently due to the zzso nature of the sampling methods used to search for the global minimum in a complex energy zzso In this paper we present zzso a zzso approach which shares information between the generated models and zzso the search towards zzso zzso A distribution over fragments is estimated from a pool of low energy zzso zzso This zzso distribution is used to guide the selection of fragments during the building of models for subsequent rounds of structure zzso The use of an zzso of distribution zzso enabled zzso to reach lower energy levels and to generate a higher percentage of zzso zzso zzso see zzso uses an zzso energy function and produces models with atomic zzso We observed an improvement in zzso blind selection of models on a benchmark of zzso in comparison with the zzso see zzso zzso zzso
