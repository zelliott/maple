Factor analysis is a powerful tool used for the analysis of dynamic zzso One of the major drawbacks of factor analysis of dynamic structures zzso is that the solution is not zzso unique when only zzso constraints are used to determine factors and factor zzso In this paper, a method to correct for ambiguous zzso solutions has been zzso A zzso solution (to within certain zzso zzso is obtained by constructing and minimizing a new objective zzso The most common objective function consists of a least squares term that when minimized with zzso constraints, forces agreement between the applied factor model and the measured zzso In our method, this objective function is modified by adding a term that penalizes multiple components in the images of the factor zzso Due to zzso effects, these factor zzso consist of more than one zzso zzso The technique was tested on computer simulations, an experimental canine cardiac study using zzso and a patient zzso zzso zzso zzso The results show that the technique works well in comparison to the truth in computer simulations and to region of interest zzso zzso in the experimental zzso
