zzso regarding how urgent zzso zzso should be diagnosed and treated exist in recent zzso The approach for early diagnosis is also zzso The purposes of this study were to evaluate the relationship between treatment delay and outcome of small zzso zzso after blunt abdominal trauma and to determine the best assessment plan for the diagnosis of this zzso 

One hundred zzso consecutive patients with small zzso zzso caused by blunt abdominal trauma were zzso zzso The patients were divided into four groups according to the time zzso between injury and zzso Hospital stay, time to resume oral zzso and mortality and morbidity rates were compared between zzso Physical signs, laboratory and zzso zzso findings, and the results of diagnostic zzso zzso were analyzed to find the most sensitive and specific test for early diagnosis of small zzso zzso 

zzso in surgery for more than 24 hours did not significantly increase the mortality with modern method of zzso however, complications increased zzso Hospital stay and time to resume oral intake increased significantly when surgery was delayed for more than 24 zzso zzso tenderness was a common finding, but it was not specific for zzso zzso Only zzso of the zzso zzso scans were diagnostic for zzso zzso 50% of them showed suggestive signs, and zzso were considered as zzso zzso of abdominal signs indicated zzso zzso By using cell count ratio in diagnostic zzso zzso and/or increased zzso zzso activity, presence of particulate matter and/or bacteria in the zzso fluid, all patients with zzso zzso zzso were diagnosed accurately before zzso 

Small zzso zzso has low mortality and complication rates if it is treated earlier than 24 hours after zzso The principle of zzso to the operation zzso for a stable blunt abdominal trauma patients without detailed systemic examination is not zzso The priority of treatment for the small zzso zzso should be lower than the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso provides high sensitivity and specificity rates for the diagnosis of small zzso zzso if a specially designed positive criterion is zzso
