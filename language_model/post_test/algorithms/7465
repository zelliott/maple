Recent work has shown that using Random zzso zzso to vote for the optimal position of model feature points leads to robust and accurate shape model zzso This paper applies zzso zzso as part of a fully automatic shape model matching zzso system to three different zzso zzso problems: the zzso zzso the bones of the knee joint and the zzso of the zzso We investigate why this approach works so well and demonstrate that the performance comes from a combination of three zzso zzso The integration of votes from multiple regions around the model zzso zzso The combination of multiple independent votes from each zzso zzso The use of a coarse to fine zzso We show that each property can improve performance, and that the best performance comes from using all zzso We demonstrate that zzso based on zzso zzso zzso well across application areas, achieving state of the art performance in each of the three zzso zzso This zzso system provides an accurate and zzso way for the zzso of zzso structures in zzso
