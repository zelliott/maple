In cultured rat zzso zzso we have studied the effect of long-term application of zzso or zzso on the surface density of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors located on the zzso decreased the response of zzso zzso The reduction was caused by a decrease in the surface density of zzso zzso In contrast, stimulation of zzso receptors located on the zzso enhanced the surface density of zzso zzso Both effects could be induced by network zzso
