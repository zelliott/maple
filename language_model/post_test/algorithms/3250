Many difficult problems in evolutionary zzso are related to zzso that have weak effects on zzso as the consequences of zzso with large effects are often simple to zzso Current systems biology has accumulated much data on zzso with large effects and can predict the properties of knockout zzso in some zzso However experimental methods are too insensitive to observe small zzso 

Here I propose a novel framework that brings together evolutionary theory and current systems biology approaches in order to zzso small effects of zzso and their zzso interactions in zzso Central to this approach is the definition of fitness zzso that can be zzso in some current systems biology models employing the rigorous zzso that are at the core of much work in zzso systems zzso The framework exploits synergies between the realism of such models and the need to understand real systems in evolutionary zzso This framework can address many longstanding topics in evolutionary biology by defining various zzso of the zzso zzso zzso topics include the distribution of zzso effects on zzso as well as the nature of advantageous zzso zzso and zzso Combining corresponding zzso estimates with population zzso models raises the possibility of testing evolutionary hypotheses at a new level of zzso 

zzso is expected to lead to a more detailed understanding of the fundamental principles of life by combining knowledge about well-known biological systems from several zzso This will benefit both evolutionary theory and current systems zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso effects and zzso is pivotal for drug design, cancer research, responsible genetic engineering in synthetic biology and many other practical zzso
