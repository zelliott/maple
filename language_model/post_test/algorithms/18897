We for the first time applied zzso zzso zzso to the imaging of mineral zzso inside biological composite zzso fish zzso the zzso scale zzso We identified mineral zzso in collagen zzso at different stages of zzso Based on the experimental results and zzso zzso we suggested a dynamic model to account for the nucleation and growth of mineral zzso in the collagen zzso The results obtained from this study not only further our understanding of the complex structure of bone, but also demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso will become an important tool to study biological zzso
