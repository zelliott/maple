To develop a fast and highly automated method for calculating two-dimensional zzso motion and deformation using zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso 

zzso phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging was used to acquire time resolved zzso maps of the zzso zzso motion was calculated by an zzso zzso scheme of low zzso zzso Image zzso was performed using active appearance zzso 

zzso of motion tracking was performed in N zzso 47 subjects using zzso zzso and closely followed zzso Image zzso was validated zzso manual zzso 

The speed and limited user interaction gives the method good potential for use in clinical zzso
