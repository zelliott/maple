An ever-growing number of real-world computer vision applications require zzso zzso zzso or realistic rendering of genuine zzso However, the appearance of real materials dramatically changes with zzso and viewing zzso Thus, the only reliable representation of material visual properties requires capturing of its zzso in as wide range of light and camera position combinations as zzso This is a principle of the recent most advanced texture zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso function that depends on view and zzso directions as well as on zzso texture zzso zzso is typically obtained by measurement of thousands of images covering many combinations of zzso and viewing zzso However, the large size of such zzso has prohibited their practical exploitation in any sensible application until zzso During the last few years, the first zzso zzso zzso zzso and rendering methods have zzso In this paper, we zzso critically survey, and zzso compare such approaches, which were published in this newly arising and important computer vision and graphics zzso
