A common biological zzso reconstruction approach -- as implemented by many automatic biological zzso services (such as the zzso and zzso zzso and the functional zzso of zzso sequences -- starts with the identification of protein functions or families zzso zzso families for the zzso database and the zzso families for the zzso zzso in the query zzso followed by a direct mapping of the identified protein families onto zzso Given a predicted patchwork of individual zzso steps, some metric must be applied in deciding what pathways actually exist in the zzso or zzso represented by the zzso zzso and zzso a complete biological zzso can be identified in a zzso if at least one of the steps associated with the zzso is zzso We report, however, that this zzso mapping approach leads to an inflated estimate of biological zzso and thus zzso the functional diversity of the sample from which the DNA sequences are zzso We developed a zzso approach, called zzso zzso set of zzso for biological zzso reconstructions using protein family predictions, which yields a more conservative, yet more faithful, zzso of the biological pathways for a query zzso zzso identified far fewer pathways for the zzso collected in the zzso database -- as compared to the zzso mapping approach -- eliminating some obviously zzso zzso zzso zzso from applying zzso to several zzso indicate that the common methods used for zzso zzso may significantly overestimate the biological pathways zzso by microbial zzso
