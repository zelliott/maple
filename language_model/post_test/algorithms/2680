Reconstruction of a 3-D face model from a single zzso face image is fundamentally important for face recognition and animation because the 3-D face model is zzso to changes of viewpoint, zzso background zzso and zzso Given a coupled training set that contains pairs of zzso faces and the corresponding 3-D faces, we train a novel coupled zzso basis function network zzso to recover the 3-D face model from a single zzso face zzso The zzso network zzso 1) the intrinsic representations of 3-D face models and those of zzso face zzso 2) zzso between a 3-D face model and its intrinsic representation; and 3) zzso between a zzso face image and its intrinsic zzso Since a particular face can be reconstructed by its nearest neighbors, we can assume that the linear combination zzso for a particular zzso face image reconstruction are identical to those for the corresponding 3-D face model zzso zzso we can reconstruct a 3-D face model by using a single zzso face image based on the zzso zzso zzso experimental results on the zzso database indicate the effectiveness of the proposed zzso network for recovering the 3-D face model from a single zzso face zzso
