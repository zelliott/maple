A zzso experiment was simulated using zzso Carlo methods, to test the hypothesis that quantum limitations lead to an optimum minimum focal spot size below which no further improvement in image quality may be zzso The simulation included a variable X-ray tube focal spot size, patient equivalent water zzso X-ray couch, automatic exposure control, zzso grid and indirect digital zzso zzso A number of zzso were necessary in order to limit the calculation time to 8 days per zzso Four images were produced for each focal spot size and these were scored by eight experienced zzso The zzso zzso were found to improve zzso as focal spot size was reduced, with the best images produced by a point zzso This contradicts the hypothesis of quantum limitation of focal spot zzso We conclude that further work is required on the zzso of focal spot zzso To assist with this, a new definition of system detective quantum efficiency is suggested, that includes the focal spot zzso transfer function, but does not include scattered radiation from the zzso
