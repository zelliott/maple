zzso source zzso based on a zzso zzso is severely zzso because the number of sources is much larger than the number of zzso In particular, this makes the solution strongly affected by sensor zzso A new way to zzso the problem is zzso By using the anatomical basis of zzso zzso (or zzso zzso instead of single zzso the zzso of the inverse solution is greatly reduced without sacrificing the quality of the data zzso The zzso of the resulting solution reduces the surface bias and scatter of the sources zzso compared to the popular zzso zzso where zzso basis is used zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and allows to efficiently reduce the effect of sensor zzso This approach, termed zzso performed well when applied to experimental data zzso zzso of early evoked zzso and showed better zzso precision and solution zzso than the other tested zzso when applied to realistically simulated zzso
