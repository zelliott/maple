An zzso for determining the frequency and propagation time of the gastric slow wave has been designed for integration into a demand gastric pacing zzso The zzso analyses the zzso activity in both the time and frequency zzso and the results are compared to produce a conclusion only when the values are within zzso of each zzso Thus, the probability of inappropriate intervention is reduced, at the expense of unidentified zzso The system is verified by comparing the conclusions produced by the zzso with conclusions from hand analysis of seven canine and one human zzso zzso The zzso correctly identifies the zzso frequency in the zzso portion of the stomach for zzso of the zzso while producing no incorrect zzso zzso propagation times in the zzso are correctly identified for zzso of the zzso with no incorrect zzso
