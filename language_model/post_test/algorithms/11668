zzso is reported to reduce both sympathetic and zzso zzso however, it is not clear whether the changes in heart rate zzso are associated with depth of zzso The purposes of the present study were zzso to evaluate the changes in heart rate zzso at different depths of hypnosis and zzso to compare the effects of zzso on heart rate zzso with that of zzso 

Thirty patients were randomly allocated into the zzso or zzso for induction of zzso The depth of hypnosis was monitored by the zzso Index zzso zzso analysis of heart rate zzso using a zzso method resulted in a characteristic power spectrum with two main regions, a high frequency zzso and a low frequency zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were monitored when the patients were awake and after induction of zzso 

Both zzso and zzso decreased blood pressure in a zzso manner, whereas heart rate showed no significant changes during the study zzso In the zzso group, zzso and zzso decreased with a reduction in the zzso zzso Although zzso decreased after induction of zzso zzso caused no further decrease in zzso in spite of a reduction in the zzso zzso In the zzso group, zzso decreased with a reduction in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso decreased after induction of zzso zzso at zzso however, no further decreases were observed in spite of a reduction in the zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso with zzso decreased blood pressure, zzso and zzso in a zzso manner, indicating that zzso reduces cardiac zzso tone depending on the depth of zzso zzso zzso did not show the zzso decreases in heart rate, blood pressure, zzso and zzso indicating that zzso has little or no effect on cardiac zzso zzso
