zzso network analysis is an important step for the functional understanding of biological zzso In these networks, zzso are made of one or more functional zzso often involved in different zzso zzso Elementary flux mode zzso analysis is a method of choice for the zzso studies of these zzso zzso In this article, we propose to use an zzso approach on networks that zzso available knowledge on zzso We introduce a new method that allows to represent the zzso networks as functional domain networks and provides an application of the zzso for computing elementary flux modes to zzso zzso Any zzso that can be represented using the classical representation can be represented using our functional domain network representation but the zzso feature of functional domain networks allows to highlight new connections in zzso This methodology is applied to the zzso acid cycle zzso zzso of zzso zzso and compared to the classical zzso This new method of analysis of the functional domain network reveals that a specific zzso on the second domain of the zzso zzso zzso component of zzso zzso complex leads to the loss of all zzso Such conclusion was not predictable in the classical zzso
