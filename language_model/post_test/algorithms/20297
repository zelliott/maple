A zzso model is sought to determine whether or not patients suffering from an uncommon form of cancer will zzso Given a set of case zzso we attempt to find the relative weightings of the different variables that are used to describe the zzso Our first innovation is to use a diffusion genetic zzso zzso to find weightings which will give optimal survival zzso The zzso enables a number of criteria to be satisfied zzso making it particularly suitable for model zzso A further innovation is a method of representing synergies between interacting zzso The evolved model correctly predicts zzso of the survivors and zzso of deaths, an improvement over the current zzso More significantly, the method enables a simple model to be evolved, one that produces well-balanced predictions, and one that is relatively easy for clinicians to zzso The method was validated by running it on a training set made up of zzso of the original database and then studying the performance of the generated models on a test set consisting of the remaining zzso of the zzso
