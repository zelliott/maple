zzso theory is one of the most widely used approaches for analysis of zzso zzso of chemical and zzso reaction zzso Some of the interesting qualitative zzso that are analyzed are zzso and zzso (a situation where a system has at least two zzso stable zzso Both phenomena have been identified as central features of many biological and zzso zzso This paper, using the theory of zzso network analysis zzso and notions from zzso zzso presents sufficient conditions for a reaction network to display zzso associated with these zzso The advantage of these conditions is that they impose fewer zzso conditions on model parameters than conditions associated with standard zzso zzso To derive the new conditions, a coordinate transformation will be made that will guarantee the existence of branches of positive zzso in the zzso This is particularly useful in mathematical biology, where only positive variable values are considered to be zzso The first part of the paper will be an extended introduction to zzso and zzso zzso methods which are used in the coordinate transformation and set up of the zzso In the second part of the paper we will focus on the derivation of zzso conditions using zzso and zzso zzso zzso will be derived for three zzso the zzso zzso a simple branching point, both linked to zzso and a simple zzso zzso The latter is linked to zzso zzso The conditions derived are sufficient and they extend earlier results from zzso network analysis as can be found in zzso and Clarke in J zzso zzso zzso zzso Clarke and zzso in J zzso zzso zzso 1993; zzso et zzso in J zzso zzso zzso zzso In these papers some necessary conditions for two of these zzso were zzso A set of examples will illustrate that zzso conditions arising from given sufficient zzso conditions are not more difficult to interpret nor harder to calculate than those arising from necessary zzso zzso Hence an increasing amount of information is gained at no extra zzso zzso The theory can also be used in a second step for a systematic zzso analysis of larger reaction zzso
