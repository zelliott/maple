An automatic method was developed for detecting unintentional sleep zzso The automatic method is based on a zzso zzso zzso with left zzso zzso as zzso An automatic zzso of slow eye movements zzso was developed and used as the main criterion to separate sleep stage 1 zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of sleep stages 1 and 2 was detected by calculating zzso and zzso difference in the zzso zzso zzso band between the two zzso zzso Alpha power 8-12 zzso and beta power zzso zzso were used to determine zzso zzso sleep zzso were studied using data from four separate maintenance of zzso test zzso sessions of zzso zzso The automatic scoring of 30s sleep onset epochs using only zzso was compared to standard visual sleep stage zzso The optimal detection thresholds were derived using data from 114 subjects and then applied to the data from different 114 zzso Cohen's Kappa between the visual and the new automatic scoring system in separating zzso and sleep was substantial zzso with zzso by zzso agreement of zzso The sleep zzso detection sensitivity was zzso and specificity zzso The results are provided with a zzso delay for each 30s zzso The developed method has to be tested in field zzso The advantage of the automatic method is that it could be applied during online recordings using only four zzso zzso zzso zzso
