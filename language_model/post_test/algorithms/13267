Jones zzso optical zzso zzso can fully characterize zzso polarization properties in zzso In this report, we described a simple zzso based zzso of zzso spectral domain Jones zzso optical zzso zzso The Jones zzso reconstruction zzso was described in detail and system zzso was demonstrated with comprehensive zzso In addition to the conventional structural image, the images of zzso optical axis and relative zzso can be obtained from the measured Jones zzso zzso Both in zzso and in zzso image examples were presented to demonstrate the polarization imaging ability of the zzso
