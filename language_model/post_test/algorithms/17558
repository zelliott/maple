The zzso state modeling and the local field modeling provides two fundamental modeling approaches to neural network research, based on which a neural network system can be called either as a zzso neural network model or as a local field neural network zzso These two models are theoretically compared in terms of their trajectory transformation property, equilibrium correspondence property, zzso attractive zzso property, global convergence as well as stability in many different zzso The comparison reveals an important stability zzso property of the two models in the sense that the stability (in any sense) of the zzso model is equivalent to that of a zzso deduced from the local field model when restricted to a specific zzso Such stability zzso property lays a sound theoretical foundation of zzso of a useful, zzso type stability analysis methodology for various neural network zzso
