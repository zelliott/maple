Based on a recent model of paradigm shifts by zzso et zzso we studied zzso opinion dynamics in an infinite population where an infinite number of ideas compete simultaneously with their values publicly zzso We found that a highly innovative society is not characterized by heavy concentration in highly valued ideas: Rather, ideas are more broadly distributed in a more innovative society with faster progress, provided that the rate of adoption is constant, which suggests a positive correlation between innovation and technological zzso Furthermore, the distribution is generally skewed in such a way that the fraction of innovators is substantially smaller than has been believed in conventional zzso theory based on zzso Thus, the typical adoption pattern is predicted to be zzso with slow zzso in the ideal situation, which is compared with empirical data zzso
