A zzso analog sensor front-end is described that reduces the energy required to extract environmental sensing spectral features without using Fast zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso allows selection of only the features needed by the zzso in contrast to the zzso where all zzso must be calculated zzso We also show that the zzso zzso can be easily calculated from the zzso results by a simple zzso The scheme is tailored for zzso parallel analog zzso in an integrated circuit zzso Two different applications are tested with an ideal front-end model and compared to existing studies with the same data zzso zzso from the military vehicle zzso and identification of zzso fault applications shows that the front-end suits a wide range of harmonic signal zzso zzso errors are modeled to evaluate the feasibility of and to set design parameters for an zzso zzso to maintain good zzso zzso Design of a preliminary zzso zzso circuit in a zzso zzso complementary zzso zzso integrated circuit process showed the ability to use online zzso to reduce fabrication errors to a sufficiently low zzso zzso power dissipation is about three orders of magnitude less than similar vehicle zzso systems that use commercially available zzso spectral zzso
