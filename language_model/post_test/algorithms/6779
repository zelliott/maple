To compare the effects of insulin zzso zzso and human regular insulin zzso when given twice daily with zzso insulin on zzso control zzso daily blood zzso profiles and rates of zzso in patients with type 2 diabetes zzso after failure to respond to zzso zzso 

A zzso randomized, zzso parallel study of 148 patients receiving either LP zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blood zzso profiles and zzso zzso were collected at zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso blood zzso levels zzso zzso standard zzso were significantly lower for LP than for zzso at the end point zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, p zzso zzso in both zzso zzso improved from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso rates were similar during the day; however, there was an overnight trend to reduced rates with LP zzso zzso zzso d zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso life assessment showed significant improvement zzso zzso zzso in the zzso worry scale for LP subjects whereas zzso subjects slightly zzso 

With traditional zzso insulin administration zzso LP improves zzso zzso zzso levels, quality of life and overnight zzso rates while delivering an equivalent level of zzso control zzso compared with zzso to zzso patients with type 2 diabetes who require zzso
