The present study was initiated to establish the zzso causes of early onset hearing loss zzso among zzso children between zzso 

The study group consisted of 233 zzso who were first tested with an arrayed primer extension zzso which covers 199 zzso in 7 genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and two zzso genes - zzso zzso zzso From zzso whose zzso of zzso remained unknown, DNA analysis of zzso zzso zzso infection and zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso analysis zzso were zzso 

In 110 zzso cases, the zzso of zzso was genetic and in 5 zzso zzso zzso infection was zzso We found zzso with clinical significance in zzso zzso children, zzso and in 2 zzso genes (2 patients, zzso A single zzso in zzso gene was detected in 5 zzso zzso and was considered zzso In 4 zzso a zzso zzso change in the zzso gene was zzso We did not find any instances of zzso for this zzso zzso in the zzso zzso identified in 4 zzso zzso regions with the loss of one zzso In 2 of them we were able to conclude that the found abnormalities are definitely zzso zzso and zzso zzso but the zzso of 2 other findings zzso and zzso zzso remained zzso 

This practical diagnostic zzso confirmed the zzso of early onset zzso for 115 zzso patients zzso This zzso may be generalized to other populations for clinical zzso
