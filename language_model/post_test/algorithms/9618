This paper proposes a new distortion model for strong zzso problems in echo zzso imaging zzso Fast imaging sequences in magnetic resonance imaging zzso such as zzso are very important in applications where zzso resolution or short total acquisition time is zzso Unfortunately, fast imaging sequences are very sensitive to variations in the zzso of the main magnetic zzso The zzso leads to geometrical zzso and intensity changes in the image reconstructed via fast zzso zzso Also, under strong zzso the accelerated zzso zzso may overly zzso signals coming from regions with higher zzso zzso Moreover, coarse zzso schemes for the zzso are not able to cope with this problem, producing zzso artifacts when large zzso variations zzso Most of the existing models do not attempt to solve this zzso In this paper, we propose a modification of the discrete distortion model to incorporate the effects of the zzso zzso and to minimize the zzso zzso As a result, these problems are significantly zzso zzso experiments are shown to demonstrate the achieved zzso Also, the performance of the new model is evaluated for zzso phase, least squares method zzso zzso using zzso zzso and zzso methods zzso a total variation zzso
