This paper presents two new zzso zzso for the reconstruction of three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso is one that first sorts the 3-D data into an ordinary two-dimensional zzso data set containing one zzso for each zzso slice to be zzso the 3-D image is then recovered by applying to each slice a zzso reconstruction method such as zzso This approach allows a significant zzso of 3-D zzso which is particularly useful for applications involving dynamic acquisitions or zzso zzso The first new zzso is obtained by zzso an exact zzso inversion zzso The second algorithm, called the zzso zzso zzso zzso is approximate but allows an efficient zzso based on taking zzso zzso zzso of the zzso This second zzso was implemented and applied to data acquired with the new generation of PET systems and also to simulated data for a scanner with an 18 degrees zzso zzso The reconstructed images were compared to those obtained with the 3-D zzso zzso zzso which is the standard zzso 3-D zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso provides a reliable alternative to zzso while at the same time achieving an order of magnitude reduction in processing zzso
