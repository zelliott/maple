DNA zzso experiments have provided vast amounts of data which can be used for zzso gene zzso However, most methods for predicting functional associations between genes from expression data are not suited to simultaneous analysis of multiple zzso and a comprehensive resource of zzso predictions is currently zzso Here, we present an interactive web resource of gene associations predicted by applying a novel zzso to all expression data in the Stanford zzso zzso The underlying zzso database currently contains more than 200 zzso zzso gene associations in 12 different species sampled from a broad zzso zzso The resource allows every association to be inspected visually and can be zzso at zzso
