In this paper we present a novel zzso approach for fractional zzso of white matter tracts and simultaneous zzso of a zzso diffusion zzso Our model consists of several white matter zzso each with a corresponding weight and zzso compartment in each zzso By incorporating a prior that assumes the zzso fields inside each tract are zzso zzso we are able to reliably estimate multiple zzso compartments in fiber crossing regions, even with low angular zzso imaging zzso Our model zzso the diffusion compartment associated with each zzso which reduces the effects of partial zzso and achieves more reliable statistics of diffusion zzso We test our method on synthetic data with known ground truth and show that we can recover the correct volume zzso and zzso zzso We also demonstrate that the proposed method results in improved zzso and diffusion measurement statistics on real data in the presence of crossing tracts and partial zzso
