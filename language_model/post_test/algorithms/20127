The first aim of the project was to evaluate the benefits of the determination of human zzso protein 4 zzso and the risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso index for primary detection of zzso cancer in a population of Czech zzso The second aim was to study the advantages zzso cancer zzso 125 zzso and zzso index for distinguishing between benign and zzso zzso zzso of the age distribution of zzso cancer, we focused on zzso zzso 

Our group of patients consisted of 256 zzso 21 with zzso cancer and 235 with benign zzso zzso All diagnoses were zzso zzso We determined the serum levels of zzso and zzso and calculated the zzso index for zzso zzso zzso levels of the zzso were measured using an Architect zzso zzso zzso samples were collected prior to surgery or any other form of treatment and the results of the two groups of patients were compared zzso zzso zzso 

There was a significant difference in the serum levels for all parameters studied between the groups of patients with zzso and those with benign diagnoses zzso test, zzso When all parameters were evaluated at zzso zzso the zzso zzso was 112 zzso at a sensitivity of zzso a positive zzso value zzso of zzso a negative zzso value zzso of zzso and an area under the curve zzso of zzso The zzso zzso was 81 zzso at a sensitivity of zzso a zzso of zzso a zzso of zzso and an zzso of zzso zzso index had a zzso zzso at a sensitivity of zzso a zzso of zzso a zzso of zzso and an zzso of zzso The highest diagnostic efficiency was achieved by the zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso along with zzso and zzso index calculation is a suitable method for the improvement of the primary detection of zzso zzso This approach also improves the differential diagnostic possibilities for distinguishing between zzso and benign zzso
