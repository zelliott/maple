We model the role played by the zzso zzso zzso in the generation of voluntary zzso eye zzso The zzso model explicitly represents key zzso like the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso the two zzso zzso and Superior zzso The model is cast within the zzso Learning zzso zzso with the zzso representing the zzso difference error, the zzso serving as the critic, and the indirect zzso playing the role of the zzso Performance of the model is evaluated on a set of tasks such as feature and conjunction searches, directional selectivity and a successive zzso zzso zzso phenomena such as independence of search time on number of zzso in feature search and linear increase in search time with number of zzso in conjunction search are zzso It is also seen that zzso reaction times are longer and search efficiency is impaired on diminished zzso contribution, which corroborates with reported data obtained from Parkinson's Disease zzso zzso
