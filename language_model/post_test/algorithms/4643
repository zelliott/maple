The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of a differentiation of zzso from other materials and of different body zzso using dual energy zzso Ten patients were scanned on a zzso Definition zzso zzso CT zzso Siemens, zzso zzso system in dual energy mode at tube zzso of 140 and 80 zzso and a ratio of zzso between tube zzso zzso CT zzso Index ranged between 7 and 8 zzso remaining markedly below reference dose values for the respective body zzso Image zzso with zzso decomposition was applied to differentiate zzso or collagen from other zzso The results showed that a differentiation and depiction of contrast material distribution is possible in the brain, the zzso the liver and the zzso with or without the underlying tissue of the zzso In zzso bone structures can be removed from the zzso to ease the evaluation of the zzso The differentiation of collagen makes it possible to depict zzso and zzso zzso energy CT offers a more specific tissue characterization in CT and can improve the assessment of vascular zzso Further studies are required to draw conclusions on the diagnostic value of the individual zzso
