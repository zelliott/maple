A three-dimensional boundary element model of the human eye is developed to investigate the zzso effects of eye tumor on the zzso temperature zzso The human eye is modeled as zzso several regions which have different zzso zzso The tumor is one of these zzso The zzso effects of the tumor are simulated by taking it to have a very high zzso heat generation and blood zzso zzso Inside the zzso the steady state temperature is governed by the zzso zzso zzso Elsewhere, in normal zzso of the eye, the temperature zzso the zzso zzso To zzso the temperature on the zzso surface, the surface boundary of each region is divided into triangular zzso
