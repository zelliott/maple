In this paper, we propose and test a new zzso zzso to simultaneously estimate the zzso motion zzso fields and the zzso images for a complete cardiac cycle in gated cardiac zzso zzso We model the zzso as an elastic material whose motion does not generate large amounts of zzso As a result, our method is based on minimizing an objective function consisting of the negative zzso of a maximum likelihood image reconstruction term, the standard zzso model of strain energy, and an image matching term that ensures a measure of agreement of zzso between zzso zzso are obtained using data for the zzso zzso zzso zzso The data models realistic noise levels in a typical gated zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that our simultaneous zzso produces images with improved spatial resolution characteristics and noise properties compared with those obtained from zzso zzso maximum likelihood zzso The simulations also demonstrate improved motion estimates over motion zzso using independently reconstructed zzso
