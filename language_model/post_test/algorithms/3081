Recently, the distribution of dental zzso has been shown to be zzso and precise prediction models cannot be obtained using all the zzso We applied a balancing technique to obtain more appropriate and robust models, and compared their accuracy with that of the conventional zzso The data were obtained from annual oral zzso for schoolchildren conducted in zzso Five hundred children were followed from ages 5 to 8, and the three-year follow-up data were zzso The variables used were zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso saliva volume, zzso zzso zzso zzso and frequency of consumption of sweet snacks and zzso Initially, conventional models were constructed by zzso zzso analysis, neural network (a kind of prediction zzso and decision zzso Next, the balancing technique was zzso To construct new models, we randomly sampled the same number of subjects with and without new dental zzso By repeated zzso 10 models were constructed for each zzso Application of the balancing technique resulted in the most robust model, with zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity obtained by C zzso zzso For data with a skewed distribution, the balancing method could be one of the important techniques for obtaining a suitable and robust prediction model for dental zzso
