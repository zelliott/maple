We have enhanced genetic zzso and zzso Carlo methods for simulation of protein folding by introducing zzso zzso in zzso zzso A local move consists of changes in backbone zzso angles in a sequential window while the positions of all atoms outside the window remain zzso We find three advantages of local zzso zzso For some energy functions, protein zzso of lower energy are zzso zzso these low energy zzso are found in fewer zzso and zzso the simulations are less sensitive to the details of the zzso zzso To distinguish the effectiveness of local move zzso from the complexity of the energy function, we have used several different energy zzso These energy functions include the Profile score zzso et zzso Science zzso 1991), the zzso energy function used by Bowie and Eisenberg 1994 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso two energy terms developed as suggested by zzso and zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Besides these energy functions we have used three energy functions that include knowledge of the native zzso the zzso from the native structure, the distance zzso error, and an energy term based on the distance between different zzso types called zzso In some of these simulations the main advantage of local moves is the reduced dependence on the details of the zzso zzso In other simulations, local moves are superior to other zzso as structures with lower energy are zzso
