Despite overall improvements in outcomes of patients with diffuse large B cell zzso zzso zzso of patients develop relapsed or zzso zzso For patients with zzso zzso disease, or zzso disease following zzso zzso zzso zzso the prognosis is poor, with no consensus on the optimal zzso Currently, zzso to the graft vs zzso effect, zzso zzso zzso cell transplantation zzso is the only potentially zzso option for such zzso In addition, many patients who are considered today for zzso actually have a low likelihood of zzso For example, a patient with prior zzso exposure who relapses within 1 year of diagnosis and has a zzso zzso International zzso Index of 2 or 3 at zzso has a zzso chance of being cured by zzso It is possible that such patients may be better served with an zzso Unfortunately, in many cases, zzso zzso is limited by patient age, zzso performance status and zzso zzso Recent attempts to improve the efficacy of zzso such as incorporating zzso into the conditioning regimen, have not resulted in improved zzso However, incorporation of novel agents such as zzso zzso zzso as maintenance therapy after zzso show zzso zzso in zzso zzso patients can result in a zzso zzso rate at 3 years, in part due to a graft vs zzso zzso While zzso conditioning is increasingly being used, certain patients may benefit from zzso zzso We present an zzso intended to discriminate which relapsed and zzso zzso patients are most likely to benefit from zzso vs zzso New approaches, using novel agents that target the molecular zzso in zzso will be an essential component of moving the field zzso Lastly, we propose a prospective zzso study as the only feasible mechanism to define the optimal position of zzso in the overall treatment strategy for zzso It is hoped that this review will promote the development of prospective zzso efforts to determine whether such patients do, in fact, benefit from earlier and/or more effective zzso of zzso
