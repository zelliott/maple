Hollow zzso zzso membrane zzso were applied in continuous mode for equilibrium sampling through zzso zzso of polar organic zzso zzso compounds zzso zzso and zzso served as model substances and zzso was tuned towards the measurement of freely dissolved zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso were constructed using zzso zzso zzso module length and low packing density in order to zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso into the zzso zzso Such custom made devices were tested and compared to commercially available zzso The former zzso performed best for continuous zzso The custom made zzso provided zzso equilibrium within zzso zzso and enrichment that was in general agreement with calculated distribution ratios between zzso and zzso In experiments during which sample concentration was changed, zzso response time to decreased sample concentration was around 30 zzso for custom built zzso In the presence of commercial zzso zzso zzso showed lower zzso enrichment, which is due to a decrease in zzso Continuous zzso may be automated and is suggested for use in online determination of zzso of pollutants and studies on zzso of zzso Future studies should include zzso of the membrane liquid and factors regarding the residence time of the zzso solution in the zzso zzso zzso aspects of zzso should also be included, as natural zzso can be zzso zzso could be correlated to zzso properties that have previously been shown to influence zzso such as zzso zzso acid content and molecular zzso
