Fast zzso zzso imaging techniques are very sensitive to the relative phase between the 90 degrees zzso zzso pulse and the 180 degrees zzso zzso zzso In this paper, it is demonstrated that a phase shift can be created between the zzso and zzso zzso in such a manner that the received signal is divided into two components of distinctly different phase zzso The nature of these two components is zzso It is demonstrated that zzso artifacts will occur when images are reconstructed from this received zzso The zzso is shown to be object zzso A correction technique is presented which zzso the phase errors among different echoes based on zzso from a single echo train acquired without phase zzso zzso The results in both phantom and human studies show that this method is capable of reducing the zzso artifact in thin slice zzso zzso
