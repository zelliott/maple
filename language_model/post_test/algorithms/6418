zzso aberrations are large-scale illegitimate zzso of the zzso They are indicative of DNA damage and zzso about damage processing zzso Despite extensive investigations over many years, the mechanisms underlying aberration formation remain zzso New experimental zzso such as multiplex fluorescent in zzso zzso zzso allow zzso zzso of zzso and are promising for zzso aberration formation zzso Recently observed zzso aberration patterns are so complex that computer and zzso methods are needed for their full zzso An important part of the analysis is zzso a zzso zzso process into zzso A cycle of order zzso characterized formally by the zzso graph with zzso zzso indicates that zzso zzso breaks take part in a single zzso zzso We here describe zzso for computing cycle structures from zzso observed or zzso zzso aberration zzso We show that analyzing cycles zzso can distinguish between different aberration formation zzso In particular, we show that zzso mechanisms do not generate the large number of complex zzso involving zzso cycles, observed in zzso human zzso
