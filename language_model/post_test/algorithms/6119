zzso random fields are of interest in various areas of image processing since they fit certain types of natural patterns and zzso Current treatments of zzso in continuous two-dimensional zzso space use a definition that is a direct extension of the one-dimensional definition, which requires zzso of the statistics of a random process to time zzso Current zzso zzso approaches do not consider zzso but, instead, are based on ad hoc zzso such as zzso continuous random zzso In this paper, we show that the current statistical zzso definition in continuous space is restrictive and provide an alternative, more general zzso We also provide a zzso for zzso statistical zzso that relies on a new zzso operator for discrete zzso Within the new zzso it is possible to zzso a wider class of zzso zzso random fields and texture zzso
