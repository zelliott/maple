The present study is a prospective evaluation of immediate zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso staging for gastric cancer in a series of 100 patients observed at two major Italian hospitals from April 1995 through September zzso 

After a complete zzso zzso all zzso patients underwent zzso immediately prior to an eventual surgical zzso zzso was considered as the gold standard for the evaluation of the zzso 

zzso detected 21 zzso zzso cases out of zzso As regards locally advanced tumors, zzso showed a sensibility of zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso significantly higher than zzso staging zzso and zzso zzso p zzso zzso In this series zzso staging altered clinical staging in zzso of zzso 

This procedure plays two crucial roles in the zzso evaluation of advanced gastric zzso It makes it possible to avoid unnecessary surgical exploration in zzso cases and, to date, it represents the most reliable and economic tool for the selection of locally advanced tumors in the light of zzso zzso
