To evaluate the zzso results and accuracy of zzso lens zzso power calculation formulas in eyes with zzso 

Department of zzso zzso University Hospital, Tokyo, zzso 

The accuracy of zzso power calculated using the zzso zzso II, zzso zzso zzso and zzso Q formulas was evaluated in six eyes with zzso lengths less than zzso zzso 

zzso measurement of refraction showed a tendency toward zzso compared with the refraction predicted by each zzso The best predicted refraction was calculated using the zzso zzso The tendency for zzso zzso was related to the zzso zzso particularly in eyes with a shorter zzso zzso However, there was no relationship between the zzso power of the cornea and the error in the predicted refraction by the zzso zzso Two eyes with an zzso power of zzso zzso zzso had severe zzso 

zzso formulas were more accurate than empirical ones in eyes with zzso The severe zzso in the two eyes with a zzso D zzso indicates that such patients require a higher zzso zzso
