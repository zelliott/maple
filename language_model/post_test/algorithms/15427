zzso display zzso play an important role in vision zzso The time delay due to data transmission from eye tracker to monitor may lead to a zzso between the gaze direction and image manipulation during eye movements, and therefore compromise the zzso We present a method to reduce this zzso by using a compressed exponential function to model the zzso of zzso eye zzso Our zzso was evaluated using experimental data from zzso zzso ranging from zzso to zzso which were collected with an zzso 1000 and a zzso Image zzso eye zzso The model fits eye displacement with a high agreement zzso zzso zzso When assuming a zzso time zzso prediction of zzso zzso zzso using our model could reduce the zzso by zzso to zzso with the zzso tracker and zzso to zzso with the zzso tracker for zzso larger than zzso Because a certain number of samples are required for model fitting, the prediction did not offer improvement for most small zzso and the early stages of large zzso zzso was also performed for a simulated zzso zzso display using the prerecorded zzso zzso With zzso the percentage of zzso larger than zzso dropped from zzso to zzso for zzso and zzso to zzso for zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso may help create more accurate zzso zzso
