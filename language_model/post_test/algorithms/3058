Using the data from zzso Data Bank the correlations of primary and secondary structures of proteins were zzso The correlation values of the zzso acids and the eight secondary structure types were zzso where the position of the zzso acid and the position in sequence with the particular secondary structure differ at most zzso The zzso describing these results indicate that correlations are significant at distances between -9 and zzso The results show that the zzso on zzso or zzso atoms of zzso acid play major role in their preference for particular secondary structure at the same position in the zzso while the polarity of zzso acid has significant influence on zzso and strands at some distance in the zzso The zzso corresponding to polar zzso acids are noticeably zzso The zzso point out the zzso of zzso in the zzso the zzso acids with similar zzso have similar local folding zzso
