Here we report a modified zzso zzso zzso zzso pulse sequence to measure diffusion zzso This approach incorporates zzso combined with zzso filtering into a standard zzso zzso Doing this eliminates much of the disadvantages from the combination of diffusion zzso and zzso selection intervals and allows for facile modification of the diffusion pulse sequence with flexibility of the time period between zzso zzso The new diffusion pulse sequence is demonstrated using an zzso zzso and an zzso protein in a mixture with a protein of similar zzso
