This correspondence studies stability analysis and stabilization for zzso zzso and zzso fuzzy systems with state zzso First, a new fuzzy zzso functional zzso is constructed to derive a zzso stability condition for zzso fuzzy zzso Then, a zzso stabilization approach based on a zzso distributed compensation scheme is provided for zzso fuzzy zzso Both state feedback and zzso control cases are zzso The proposed stability and stabilization conditions are represented in terms of linear zzso zzso zzso which can be solved efficiently by using existing zzso zzso zzso Finally, two zzso examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed zzso
