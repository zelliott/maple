The brain is dependent on zzso as a primary energy zzso but is capable of utilizing zzso such as zzso and zzso as occurs with zzso zzso or chronic feeding of a zzso zzso The relationship between changes in cerebral zzso rates of zzso zzso and degree or duration of zzso remains zzso To investigate if zzso decreases with chronic zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso zzso was applied in zzso young adult rats fed 3 weeks of either standard or zzso zzso zzso zzso rates of zzso zzso per zzso was determined in the cerebral zzso and zzso using zzso zzso The average zzso significantly decreased in the cerebral zzso zzso versus zzso and zzso zzso versus zzso with increased plasma zzso bodies in the zzso rats compared with standard diet zzso The reduction of zzso in both brain regions zzso zzso by zzso for each zzso increase of total plasma zzso bodies zzso to zzso Together with our zzso these data revealed that the degree and duration of zzso has a major role in determining the corresponding change in zzso with zzso
