A zzso system was designed to control the knee joint to move in accordance with the desired trajectory of movement through stimulation of zzso zzso This control system consisted of a neural controller and a fixed zzso zzso zzso feedback zzso which was designated as a zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso neural network was used and trained as an inverse model of the functional electrical stimulation zzso zzso leg system for direct zzso zzso The training signals for neural network learning were obtained from zzso using a zzso filtered random sequence to reveal the plant zzso The zzso method was used to zzso the neural connection zzso The zzso zzso descent zzso was then used to modify these connection weights so as to minimize the errors between the desired zzso and the network zzso The knee joint angle was controlled with only small zzso along the desired trajectory with the aid of the neural zzso In addition, the zzso feedback controller was zzso to compensate for the residual tracking errors caused by disturbances and modeling zzso This control strategy was evaluated on one zzso and one zzso zzso The zzso controller showed promise as a position controller of knee joint angle with zzso zzso
