In the last two decades, two related categories of problems have been studied independently in image restoration zzso zzso and zzso A closer look at these problems reveals the relation between them, and, as conventional color digital cameras suffer from both zzso resolution and zzso it is reasonable to address them in a unified zzso In this paper, we propose a fast and robust hybrid method of zzso and zzso based on a maximum a zzso zzso technique by minimizing a zzso cost zzso The zzso norm is used for measuring the difference between the projected estimate of the high-resolution image and each zzso image, removing zzso in the data and errors due to possibly inaccurate motion zzso zzso zzso is used for zzso zzso the zzso zzso resulting in sharp edges and forcing zzso along the edges and not across zzso zzso zzso zzso is used to smooth the zzso zzso Finally, an additional zzso term is used to force similar edge location and orientation in different color zzso We show that the zzso of the total cost function is relatively easy and zzso Experimental results on synthetic and real data sets confirm the effectiveness of our zzso
