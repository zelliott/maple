A zzso zzso zzso prediction method for robust video coding is zzso zzso methods from the conventional literature, the proposed approach uses the expected reconstructed distortion after transmission, instead of the displaced frame difference in motion zzso Initially, the zzso reconstructed distortion is estimated through zzso zzso zzso zzso Then the total bit rate for zzso zzso is predicted using a suitable rate distortion zzso The results are fed into the zzso zzso at the zzso to perform motion zzso Here, the zzso automatically finds an zzso motion compensated prediction by zzso the best zzso between coding efficiency and zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso is applied again to estimate the zzso zzso This process uses previously selected zzso motion zzso and their corresponding reference zzso It also considers zzso zzso computer simulations in zzso channel environments were conducted to assess the performance of the proposed zzso zzso results for both single and multiple reference frames settings are zzso A comparative evaluation using other conventional techniques from the literature was also zzso Furthermore, the effects of zzso between the actual channel packet loss rate and the one assumed at the zzso side have been evaluated and reported in this zzso
