The rapid zzso of data on zzso single zzso zzso zzso also called zzso should allow us to further our understanding of the underlying zzso zzso Here, we use complex networks to study the role of an zzso acid in both local and global structures and determine the extent to which zzso and zzso zzso differ in terms of their interactions to other zzso 

We found that zzso can be well characterized by network zzso zzso zzso are probably zzso when they occur at a site with a high zzso value and/or high degree value in a protein structure zzso We also discovered that study of the neighboring zzso around a zzso site can help to determine whether the zzso is zzso or zzso We compiled a zzso from the zzso zzso pages and constructed a model to predict zzso zzso based on the random forest zzso The values of total accuracy and zzso were zzso and zzso respectively, as determined by zzso zzso With an independent zzso our model achieved a total accuracy of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso 

The satisfactory performance suggests that network zzso features can be used as zzso measures to determine the importance of a site on a zzso and this approach can complement existing methods for prediction of zzso zzso Moreover, the use of this method in zzso studies would help to determine the underlying linkage between zzso and diseases through extensive investigation of mutual interactions between zzso
