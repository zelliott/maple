We have investigated the interaction of zzso in the active site of the zzso zzso from rabbit lung by monitoring the concurrent effects of two zzso on zzso zzso A strong zzso is found in the binding of zzso (an analog of the zzso zzso portion of preferred zzso and zzso (a zinc zzso Analysis of the zzso data with the zzso plot yields an unusually low value of zzso for the interaction constant zzso This result indicates that each of the above zzso stimulates the binding of the other by about zzso Similar but often less pronounced zzso is observed for other zinc zzso and with some other zzso zzso zzso These specific structural requirements suggest that the above effect is associated with an zzso mechanism which brings the important zinc atom into a zzso optimal state only in the presence of certain preferred zzso
