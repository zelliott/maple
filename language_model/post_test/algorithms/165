We study the problem of identifying shape classes in point zzso These clouds contain sampled points along contours and are corrupted by clutter and observation zzso Taking an zzso approach, we simulate zzso zzso of sampled contours using models learned from training data to evaluate the given test zzso To facilitate simulations, we develop statistical models for sources of zzso zzso 1) shape variations within classes, 2) zzso in sampling continuous curves, 3) pose and scale zzso 4) observation noise, and 5) points introduced by zzso The zzso in sampling closed zzso into finite points is represented by positive zzso of a unit zzso We derive probability models on these functions using their zzso forms and the zzso zzso Using a zzso Carlo approach, we simulate zzso from a joint prior on the zzso space and compare them to the data using a likelihood zzso Average zzso of simulated zzso lead to estimates of zzso probabilities of different classes and, zzso zzso zzso
