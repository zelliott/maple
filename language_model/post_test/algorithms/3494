Three components of zzso anatomy zzso are reviewed in this zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso that is, for any given coordinate system representations of two zzso computing the zzso transformation from one to the zzso zzso the zzso of empirical probability laws of anatomical variation between zzso and zzso the construction of zzso regarding zzso disease zzso CA zzso zzso zzso field information obtained from zzso maps to assess anatomical zzso and facilitate the detection and zzso of abnormalities of brain structure in subjects with zzso zzso zzso structures are divided into two zzso zzso zzso matter zzso volumes enclosed by a single zzso cortical mantle zzso distinct portions of the cerebral cortical mantle layered between the white matter zzso and zzso fluid zzso Because of fundamental differences in the geometry of these two types of structures, zzso zzso zzso brain mapping zzso and zzso zzso metric matching zzso were developed for the study of zzso structures and labeled cortical mantle distance mapping zzso was developed for the study of cortical mantle zzso Studies of zzso disorders using CA usually require the testing of hypothesized group differences with relatively small numbers of subjects per zzso zzso that increase the power for testing such hypotheses include methods to zzso the shapes of individual structures, relationships between the shapes of related structures zzso zzso and changes of shapes over zzso Promising preliminary studies employing these approaches to studies of subjects with schizophrenia and very mild to mild Alzheimer's disease zzso are zzso
