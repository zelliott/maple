To build an early warning score zzso based exclusively on routinely undertaken laboratory tests that might provide early discrimination of zzso death and could be easily implemented on zzso 

Using a database of combined zzso and zzso results for zzso discharged adult patients for whom the admission specialty was Medicine, we used decision tree zzso analysis to generate a laboratory decision tree early warning score zzso for each zzso zzso was developed for a single set zzso zzso and validated in 22 other discrete sets each of three months long zzso zzso zzso zzso range of zzso to zzso by testing its ability to discriminate zzso death using the area under the zzso characteristic zzso zzso 

The data generated slightly different models for male and female zzso The ranges of zzso values zzso zzso for zzso with zzso death as the outcome for the validation sets zzso were: zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso patients combined, zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This study provides evidence that the results of commonly measured laboratory tests collected soon after hospital admission can be represented in a simple, zzso zzso zzso to discriminate zzso zzso We zzso that, with appropriate zzso it might be possible to extend the use of zzso throughout the patient's hospital zzso
