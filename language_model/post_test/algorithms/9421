The deployment of a vascular zzso aims to increase zzso diameter for the restoration of blood flow, but the accompanied zzso in the mechanical environment possibly affect the long-term zzso of these zzso The primary aim of this investigation was to develop an zzso to zzso zzso design, allowing for consideration of competing solid mechanical concerns zzso stress, zzso gain, and zzso zzso zzso element modeling zzso was used to estimate artery wall stress and zzso zzso from which single zzso zzso were derived expressing stress, zzso gain, and zzso artery wall zzso An zzso scheme was developed using zzso zzso elements that sought to minimize the sum of these zzso with weighting zzso zzso the weighting zzso results in zzso designs that prioritize one output over zzso The accuracy of the zzso was confirmed by evaluating the resulting zzso of the zzso zzso using zzso The capacity of the zzso zzso to identify optimal zzso and their resulting mechanical measures was retained over a wide range of weighting zzso The variety of zzso designs identified provides general guidelines that have potential clinical use zzso zzso zzso
