Various alternative spectral zzso methods are examined and compared in order to assess their possible application for real-time analysis of zzso ultrasound zzso zzso Specifically, five general frequency domain models are zzso including the zzso the general zzso moving average zzso model which has the zzso zzso and moving average zzso models as special cases, and zzso maximum likelihood spectral zzso A zzso stationary zzso signal with a known theoretical spectrum was used as the reference test zzso and white noise was added to enable various zzso conditions to be zzso The performance of each method representative of each spectral model was assessed using both qualitative and quantitative schemes that convey information related to the bias and zzso of the spectral zzso Three integrated performance zzso were implemented for quantitative zzso The relative zzso complexity for each zzso was also zzso Our results indicate that both the zzso and zzso value zzso models of orders zzso and zzso respectively, show good agreement with the theoretical spectrum, and yield estimates with zzso considerably less than the Fast zzso zzso zzso zzso results obtained with these methods using a clinical, zzso zzso signal supports these zzso
