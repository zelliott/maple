A high-resolution study of breast tissue motion during cardiac zzso and zzso is zzso An experimental system was designed to achieve a zzso resolution on the order of 1 zzso with high spatial zzso The peak zzso of tissue motion estimated during cardiac zzso ranged from zzso zzso to zzso zzso among the subjects zzso It is shown that motion due to the cardiac cycle is less significant when the subject is positioned on the side rather than zzso The mean tissue zzso among subjects in the zzso position is zzso zzso and drops to zzso zzso for the side position, with a corresponding spatial displacement of zzso zzso dropping to zzso zzso The zzso profiles indicate that 100 zzso is required for the entire zzso zzso process to zzso zzso using a prone biopsy table show the almost complete elimination of tissue motion due to cardiac zzso suggesting that the use of the table eliminates this motion, thus allowing for high-resolution blood zzso zzso Features resulting from respiratory motion are also zzso We found this motion to be of a much longer time zzso and of a much higher zzso with zzso as high as 29 zzso The implications of the study on the high-resolution zzso of blood zzso and high-resolution breast imaging are zzso
