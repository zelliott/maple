zzso zzso is emerging with enormous potential as a medical imaging zzso for effective discrimination of pathological changes in soft zzso It maps the tissue elasticity or strain due to a mechanical deformation applied to zzso The strain image most often calculated from the zzso of the local displacement field is highly noisy because of the zzso effect mainly due to unstable zzso scanning and/or irregular tissue zzso consequently, improving the zzso of the strain image is still a challenging problem in this zzso In this paper, a novel approach using the zzso weighted zzso is presented for direct zzso of the zzso zzso strain for high quality strain zzso Like other zzso domain reported schemes, the proposed method exploits the fact that the zzso zzso echo signal is a zzso and shifted replica of the zzso zzso echo zzso However, the elegance of our technique is that it directly zzso the mean strain without explicitly using any post filter and/or previous local zzso estimates as is usually done in the conventional zzso It is implemented in the zzso zzso transform domain through a zzso weighted zzso zzso spectrum zzso zzso As the local tissue strain is expected to maintain continuity with its neighbors, we show here that the mean strain at the zzso window can be directly zzso from the common stretching factor that zzso a cost function derived from the zzso weighted windowed zzso and zzso zzso echo segments in both the lateral and zzso zzso The performance of our zzso is verified for up to zzso applied strain using simulation and experimental phantom data and the results reveal that the zzso of the strain image can be significantly improved compared to other reported zzso in the zzso The efficacy of the zzso is also tested with in zzso breast data known to have zzso or benign masses from zzso
