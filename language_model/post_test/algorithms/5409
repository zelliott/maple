zzso is a fast and lightweight software to trim adapters and low quality regions in reads from ultra zzso next-generation sequencing zzso It also can reliably identify zzso and assign the reads to the original zzso Based on a modified Myers's zzso dynamic programming algorithm, zzso can handle zzso in adapters and zzso It removes low quality regions and trims off adapters at both or either end of the zzso A typical trimming of zzso reads with two sets of adapter pairs can be done in about a minute with a small memory zzso zzso is a versatile zzso tool that can be used as the first step in virtually all next-generation sequence analysis zzso The program is available at zzso
