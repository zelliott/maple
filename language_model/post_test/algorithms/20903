To determine if selective zzso use of early zzso continuous positive airway pressure zzso at birth with a low threshold for early zzso treatment, reduces the need for zzso in very zzso infants in the first days after zzso 

Two zzso of very zzso infants zzso or zzso 32 weeks, born at the zzso University Medical Center in the Netherlands, were compared zzso before zzso and after zzso introducing selective zzso and use of early zzso A zzso or zzso zzso was used as criterion for zzso zzso outcome measure was zzso zzso 72 h of zzso zzso zzso zzso was a secondary zzso 

The rate of zzso in the delivery room zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and within 72 h of age zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso was lower following the change in zzso Early zzso was, in zzso increasingly used as primary treatment zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso with higher maximum zzso levels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso There was no change in zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

Avoiding zzso by using early zzso while maintaining a zzso for zzso treatment decreased the need for zzso
