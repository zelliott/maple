In this article acoustic scattering by a random rough interface that separates a fluid incident medium from an underlying uniform scattering zzso either fluid or elastic solid, in cases for which the Bragg scale lies within the zzso tail of the zzso spectrum is dealt zzso The physical foundation is an inherently zzso local zzso zzso A fully zzso zzso is developed for the scattering strength, together with a robust zzso zzso that allows a wide range of spectral zzso zzso The practical result for ocean acoustics is a significantly improved description of the interface component of sea floor zzso zzso are presented to demonstrate the advantage of this approach over zzso theory, and to illustrate its dependence on frequency and environmental parameters as well as its operation in zzso zzso
