The identification of nonsense syllables in quiet and in three types of background zzso cafeteria and single female zzso was measured using four hearing aid zzso zzso differing in attack and release time constants, and using linear zzso The speech level was always 65 zzso zzso The zzso zzso which were implemented in a zzso zzso zzso hearing aid, were: zzso zzso zzso attack time was 8 zzso and the release time was 32 zzso for all 20 zzso zzso zzso attack and release times decreased from 500 zzso for low zzso to about zzso for high zzso zzso zzso attack and release times increased from about zzso for low zzso to 500 zzso for high zzso and zzso zzso + zzso very zzso gain control signal was combined with a zzso gain control zzso for each channel in a zzso zzso zzso stimuli were presented zzso via a zzso headphone mounted over the hearing zzso The linear condition did not use the zzso zzso instead, the signal was digitally filtered to implement the Cambridge formula prior to delivery via the zzso Five subjects with moderate zzso hearing loss were tested in a zzso order across zzso In quiet, performance was best for linear amplification and worst for the slow + fast zzso In the presence of background sounds, the highest scores were obtained with the zzso Cambridge formula implemented via zzso a supplementary experiment suggested that this was due to the greater zzso gain resulting from the use of this zzso No significant differences were found between scores for the different zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso of speech at a fixed level, presented in background sounds, is not markedly affected by rather substantial variations of the time zzso in a zzso zzso zzso
