In zzso identification of zzso cartilage degradation could positively impact disease progression in zzso but to date remains a zzso The primary goal of this study was to develop an infrared fiber-optic probe zzso zzso method using partial least squares zzso to zzso determine the degree of cartilage zzso zzso human zzso zzso (N zzso zzso were obtained during knee replacement surgery and analyzed by zzso zzso data were collected from multiple regions of each zzso and the cartilage graded according to the Collins Visual zzso zzso of 0, 1, 2, or zzso These grades zzso to cartilage zzso that displayed normal, swelling or softening, zzso slight zzso and deeper zzso or serious zzso zzso The model focused on detecting early cartilage degradation and therefore zzso data from grades 0, 1, and zzso The best zzso zzso zzso the spectral range zzso zzso and independent validation of the model utilizing 206 zzso to create a model and 105 independent test zzso resulted in a correlation between the predicted and actual Collins grade of zzso zzso zzso with a standard error of prediction of zzso with a zzso rank of 15 zzso zzso A preliminary zzso zzso that zzso a zzso technique to investigate the possibility of correlation with zzso tissue grade zzso zzso from 18 zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso using only eight zzso factors, a very encouraging zzso Thus, the groundwork for use of zzso zzso determination of early cartilage degradation has been zzso
