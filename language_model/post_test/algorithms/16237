zzso with two diffusion weightings applied in direct succession in a single zzso so-called double- or zzso zzso zzso experiments at short mixing times, have been shown to be a promising tool to estimate cell or compartment sizes, zzso in living zzso The basic theory for such experiments predicts that the signal zzso for parallel and zzso wave zzso zzso differ by a factor of three for small wave zzso This seems to be surprising because in standard, zzso experiments the polarity of the diffusion weighting has no influence on the signal zzso Thus, the question how this difference can be understood more pictorially is often zzso In this rather educational zzso the phase evolution during a zzso experiment for simple zzso zzso diffusion between zzso zzso planes oriented perpendicular to the wave zzso is considered zzso and demonstrates how the signal difference zzso Considering the populations of the phase zzso zzso the factor of three between the signal zzso which is predicted by the theory can be zzso Furthermore, the intermediate signal zzso for zzso wave zzso zzso can be derived when investigating diffusion in a zzso Thus, the presented zzso zzso approach may help to understand the signal zzso observed in zzso experiments at short mixing zzso
