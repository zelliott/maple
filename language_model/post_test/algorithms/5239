Nowadays, thanks to the increasing CPU power the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso is rapidly imposing also in the industrial risk assessment area, replacing integral models when particular situations, such as those involving complex zzso or large obstacles, are zzso Nevertheless, commercial zzso codes usually do not provide specific turbulence model for simulating atmospheric zzso effects, which are accounted of by the integral models through the well-known zzso zzso In this work, a new approach able to take account of atmospheric features in zzso simulations has been developed and validated by comparison with available experimental zzso
