In infectious disease zzso statistical methods are an indispensable component for the automated detection of outbreaks in routinely collected surveillance zzso So far, methodology in this area has been largely of zzso nature and has increasingly been taking inspiration from statistical process zzso The present work is concerned with strengthening zzso thinking in this zzso We extend the widely used approach of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to a modern zzso framework within a time series decomposition zzso This approach zzso a direct calculation of the decision-making threshold while taking all sources of uncertainty in both prediction and zzso into zzso More importantly, with the methodology it is now also possible to integrate zzso zzso zzso weather influence, into the outbreak zzso Model zzso is performed using fast and efficient integrated zzso zzso zzso enabling the use of this method in routine surveillance at public health zzso Performance of the zzso was investigated by comparing simulations with existing methods as well as by zzso the time series of notified zzso cases in Germany for the years zzso which include absolute humidity as a zzso zzso Altogether, a flexible and modern surveillance zzso is presented with an zzso available through the R package zzso
