An analysis of the zzso Imaging Analysis Contest zzso data is presented using spatial zzso zzso This technique allows the image to be filtered zzso according to the data itself, rather than relying on a predetermined zzso This zzso filtering leads to better zzso of the parameters and contrasts in terms of mean squared zzso It will be shown that by introducing a slight bias into the zzso a large reduction in the zzso can be zzso leading to better overall mean squared error zzso As no single filter needs to be zzso results containing many scales of information can be zzso In the zzso data, it is shown that both small-scale and large-scale zzso more zzso effects zzso The combination of small- and large-scale effects detected in the zzso data would be easy to miss using conventional single filter zzso
