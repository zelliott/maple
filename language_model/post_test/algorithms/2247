The nature of the zzso of zzso for zzso and zzso weights by sex, zzso zzso and dam breed zzso was zzso Data consisted of records for weaning zzso zzso zzso and yearling zzso zzso zzso weights of progeny from zzso and zzso zzso respectively, from 22 breeds that have been evaluated in the zzso zzso zzso Program at the zzso Meat Animal Research Center, Clay Center, zzso zzso were zzso to zzso and Angus zzso Each trait was analyzed zzso Three studies were undertaken separately to investigate zzso due to the different factors zzso zzso zzso sex, or dam zzso Only data from seven zzso breeds were used to study the factor zzso zzso but all data zzso zzso zzso were used to study the factors sex and dam zzso In each study, three zzso and dam models with records of animals of the four sex zzso dam breed combinations considered different traits and with the same model zzso but zzso structures for random effects zzso zzso and zzso of increasing zzso were zzso First, zzso across zzso were assumed zzso Second, correlations and zzso of zzso zzso were assumed equal but zzso zzso differed by zzso zzso sex, or dam breed as zzso Third, zzso and zzso were different for each zzso of the factor under zzso zzso components were estimated by zzso zzso Models for each trait and each factor were compared through likelihood ratio zzso For both traits, zzso differed zzso zzso zzso in scale, but not as zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso breed and sex zzso zzso were not different zzso zzso zzso by dam breed zzso either in scale or as zzso of zzso zzso Estimates of correlations among genetic effects on weights of calves from different zzso breed zzso were at least zzso Across all sex, zzso zzso and dam breed zzso pooled estimates of zzso and dam zzso as zzso of zzso zzso were, respectively, zzso and zzso for weaning weight and zzso and zzso for yearling zzso The conclusion is that the assumption of equal zzso zzso among zzso breeds and between sexes may not be appropriate in genetic zzso
