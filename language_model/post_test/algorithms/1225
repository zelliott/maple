In the present study, spontaneous zzso behavior has been analyzed in freely standing multiple sclerosis zzso patients, exhibiting no clinically zzso abnormalities of zzso zzso This population has been compared with two other groups, healthy people and zzso zzso This latter group represents a situation where the central nervous system zzso zzso is precisely localized in one anatomical site and no zzso disorders are zzso zzso it has an opposite anatomical character with respect to the zzso at a zzso zzso The hypothesis underlying the modeling study is the presence of a controller block working in a feedback posture control zzso This controller block receives the body sway as zzso and produces the corresponding ankle zzso stabilizing the body, the latter being modeled as an zzso zzso The zzso damage, caused by zzso is supposed to be reflected in some zzso change in the structure of the controller of the posture control zzso The identification of the controller has been performed by means of a zzso zzso procedure which employed as input zzso data recorded by means of a zzso zzso zzso zzso findings show a structural changes of the model of the controller block in the posture control zzso This result may suggest the presence of an zzso reorganization of the posture control zzso Some speculation is finally made on the black-box approach in comparison with traditional zzso to arrive at zzso a progression path for zzso zzso
