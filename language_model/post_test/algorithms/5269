Prevention of diabetes and coronary heart disease zzso is possible but identification of zzso patients for targeting interventions is a challenge in primary zzso 

We analyzed electronic health record zzso data for zzso patients from 12 primary care zzso We defined patients with risk factor zzso using zzso syndrome zzso characteristics defined by zzso zzso if missing, we used surrogate zzso and validated this approach by directly measuring risk factors in a subset of 154 zzso For subjects with at least 3 of 5 zzso criteria measured at baseline zzso we defined 3 zzso No zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 3 zzso We examined new diabetes and zzso zzso and resource zzso over the subsequent zzso period zzso using zzso zzso models to compare outcomes by zzso zzso 

After excluding patients with zzso at zzso zzso patients were eligible for zzso zzso zzso had zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity for directly measured zzso Diabetes zzso was zzso in No zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso adjusted OR zzso vs No zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso for zzso adjusted OR zzso zzso zzso zzso and resource zzso increased across categories zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso were similar analyzing individuals with all five criteria not missing, or defining zzso as zzso 2 criteria zzso 

zzso factor zzso in zzso data identifies primary care patients at increased risk for new diabetes, zzso and higher resource zzso
