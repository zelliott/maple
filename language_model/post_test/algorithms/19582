The simulation of response of a new passive area zzso for measuring ambient dose equivalent zzso for photons has been performed using the zzso Carlo code zzso and zzso determined responses of zzso and zzso zzso zzso detectors for zzso X-ray zzso from 20 to 300 zzso and for zzso and zzso gamma zzso Relative zzso efficiency for both types of zzso determined in experiments with bare detectors and similar zzso Carlo simulations, compared zzso with prediction of zzso models for proposed zzso target sizes in the range of zzso zzso The concluding zzso experiment showed small zzso between measured and simulated zzso energy response values in the range of a few zzso
