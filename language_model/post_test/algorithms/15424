zzso was investigated using a combination of quantum chemical calculations and molecular beam zzso transform zzso zzso The substance is present in coffee, roasted zzso and zzso The zzso spectrum was recorded under molecular beam conditions in the frequency range from 9 to 14 zzso We report on the two main zzso of zzso for which highly accurate zzso zzso and zzso distortion zzso were zzso No zzso due to internal rotation of the zzso group could be observed in the zzso zzso This is in agreement with the theoretical predictions of the barrier zzso which have been determined to be more than 1000 zzso at the zzso level of zzso In addition to the most abundant zzso of the main zzso also the zzso was zzso which occurs with a natural abundance of about zzso Using the experimental zzso constants, different quantum chemical calculations were validated for the two observed zzso To complete the theoretical investigation of zzso different transition states were zzso to understand the zzso conversion between the two zzso at the zzso zzso The transition states were zzso using the zzso zzso
