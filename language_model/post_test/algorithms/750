The zzso Program is intended to examine typical zzso regimens used in the treatment of common zzso pathogens and the likelihood of these regimens attaining appropriate zzso exposure in different parts of the zzso A zzso zzso Carlo simulation was used to estimate zzso target zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso against zzso coli, zzso pneumoniae, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Standard dosing regimens from North America were zzso zzso zzso zzso was derived from existing healthy volunteer data, and zzso data came from the 2002 zzso zzso zzso displayed the lowest target zzso against all bacterial species (41 to zzso for zzso zzso 53 to 59% for zzso zzso and 80 to zzso for the zzso zzso the dose to 400 zzso every 8 h did not significantly increase target zzso against zzso zzso target zzso were similar to that of zzso against all zzso Higher doses of both compounds were needed to achieve better target zzso against zzso zzso Overall, zzso zzso and zzso attained the highest probabilities of zzso against the zzso (99 to zzso The zzso appear to be the most useful agents against zzso zzso zzso to zzso and these agents, along with higher doses of any of the zzso would be the most appropriate choices for empirical therapy for zzso zzso zzso Given the lack of agreement between percent zzso and probability of target zzso for certain zzso regimens, a methodology employing zzso zzso analyses may be a more useful tool for zzso the zzso compounds and dosing regimens in the clinical setting of initial empirical zzso
