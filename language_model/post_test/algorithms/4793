We study the excitable zzso cellular zzso model on zzso zzso We obtain zzso expressions for no external stimulus the zzso zzso It is found that the curves, the average activity F versus the external stimulus rate zzso can be fitted by a Hill function, but not exactly, there exists a relation F approximately zzso for the zzso response, where the zzso zzso alpha ranges from zzso in the zzso regime to zzso at zzso At the critical point, the range is zzso but not zzso We also calculate the average activity zzso and the dynamic range zzso for zzso with given connectivity zzso It is interesting that zzso with larger connectivity have larger optimal range, which could be applied in biological experiments to reveal the network zzso
