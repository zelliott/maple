The best-known Shaker zzso of zzso with a novel gating zzso zzso differs from the zzso zzso channel by a point zzso in the fifth zzso segment zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and causes a decrease in the apparent zzso dependence of zzso A kinetic study of zzso revealed that changes in the zzso rate could account for the altered gating behavior zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but the presence of intact fast zzso precluded observation of the closing zzso and steady state zzso We studied the zzso zzso zzso in zzso channels in which fast zzso zzso was removed, directly confirming this zzso Replacement of other zzso in zzso did not result in substantial zzso in zzso zzso At position zzso zzso and zzso zzso like zzso produce currents with decreased apparent zzso dependence of the open probability and of the zzso rates, as well as accelerated zzso of opening and zzso A zzso zzso is the exception among zzso zzso with the zzso channels having a steep zzso dependence of opening and slow closing zzso The analysis of zzso delay in channel zzso and of gating current zzso indicates that zzso and zzso zzso channels possess a form of zzso in the gating mechanism that the zzso channels zzso The zzso and zzso zzso entering the open state gives rise to slow zzso of the OFF gating zzso In zzso rapid gating charge return persists after channels open, confirming that this zzso zzso stabilization of the open zzso We present a kinetic model that can account for these properties by zzso that the four zzso independently undergo two sequential zzso transitions each, followed by a final concerted opening zzso These channels differ primarily in the final concerted transition, which is biased in favor of the open state in zzso and the wild type, and in the opposite direction in zzso These results are consistent with an zzso scheme zzso bulky aromatic or zzso side chains at position 401 in zzso zzso stabilize the open state, possibly by interacting with zzso in other zzso
