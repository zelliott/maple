The diffusion of zzso and its binding to the zzso site of the zzso zzso complex in the course of zzso electron transport was studied by following the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso after previous zzso of the zzso electron zzso The data resulting from these experiments were matched with a simulation of electron transport using zzso Carlo zzso The simulation was able to account for the experimental zzso Two different extreme cases of reaction mechanism at the zzso site were zzso a diffusion limited zzso mechanism and a zzso limited tight binding zzso Assuming a tight binding mechanism led to best matches due to the high protein density in zzso The varied parameters resulted in values well within the range of published zzso The results zzso the importance of structural characteristics of zzso in models of electron zzso
