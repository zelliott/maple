The square root of a zzso spectrum, which offers high spectral resolution along both dimensions requiring only few zzso zzso zzso yields in good approximation the idealized zzso zzso spectrum provided that the amount of zzso exchanged between spins is relatively zzso When this condition is zzso zzso zzso and zzso peak volumes may zzso A zzso method is presented that produces a modified zzso spectrum with zzso volumes that closely match their zzso zzso zzso The method is demonstrated for zzso zzso with variable mixing zzso
