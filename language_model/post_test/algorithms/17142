With advances in research techniques involving molecular biology, the need for precision in the determination of surface area is even greater than zzso This study sets out to determine the most accurate zzso constant, zzso for a commonly used weight range of experimental zzso The importance of a narrow weight range is appreciated and zzso data is presented from a series of adolescent rats that allow a new k value to be zzso The figures presented here represent the largest number of animals, of a commonly used rat strain, in the most widely used weight range yet zzso zzso were removed from 16 zzso male zzso rats after cervical zzso For each animal total body surface area zzso was determined zzso along with zzso areas on the zzso and zzso zzso Entering the zzso measured data along with the zzso weight into the zzso formula, a k value was obtained for each zzso Surface areas were then calculated for each animal using the mean zzso zzso and compared against figures obtained by using historical values for the zzso zzso Using the new k value a method is described for the accurate determination of total body surface area and zzso surface areas, in experimental rats of a specific weight zzso
