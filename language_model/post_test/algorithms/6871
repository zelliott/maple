zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso required for randomly dumped packed tower design were gathered from the literature to generate a working database zzso zzso zzso relevant to water and air pollution abatement zzso The cross-examination of two important correlations predicting zzso zzso was achieved through this database zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Some limitations regarding either the level of accuracy or the application range came to light with this zzso zzso neural network zzso modeling is then proposed allowing all four zzso zzso zzso A single ANN correlation was built to predict the zzso gas (or zzso film Sherwood number zzso as a function of six zzso groups, zzso the liquid Reynolds zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso numbers, the gas (or zzso Schmidt number zzso the zzso zzso zzso and a zzso number zzso Using the ANN correlation and the zzso theory, a reconciliation procedure was further implemented resulting in better predictions of the gas (or zzso overall zzso zzso zzso The resulting correlation yielded an absolute average relative error of zzso and a standard zzso of zzso based on whole database while the ANN predictions remain in accordance with the physical evidence reported in the zzso
