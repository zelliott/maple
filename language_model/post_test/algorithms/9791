To describe a system for measurement of the zzso zzso zzso angle zzso zzso zzso fracture with the use of new imaging software which allows zzso and three zzso zzso reconstruction of zzso zzso imaging and communications in zzso zzso 

This case involved a 20-year-old patient with bilateral zzso zzso zzso Following initial clinical examination, CT scans of both zzso were zzso zzso the zzso zzso were uploaded to the new software zzso Following zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso angles were zzso 

zzso zzso was described and assessed in two ways by referring to the intersection of the zzso zzso plane and zzso a line drawn between the center of the zzso head and zzso neck, zzso a line drawn between the centers of the zzso head and greater zzso Using these zzso values for zzso zzso were found to be, respectively, 20 degrees at the right fracture site and 19 degrees on the left site, and 33 degrees zzso 

The investigators describe in this current technical report the use of new imaging software which enables the calculation of zzso zzso following reduction of virtual fracture fragments which are created from standard zzso zzso We believe that this zzso reconstruction method of measuring the zzso angle can be integrated into a regular treatment zzso and may potentially zzso clinical zzso
