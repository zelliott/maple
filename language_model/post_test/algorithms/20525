The increasing size of protein sequence databases is straining methods of sequence analysis, even as the increased information offers opportunities for sophisticated analyses of protein structure, function, and zzso Here we describe a method that uses artificial zzso zzso to build models of families of protein zzso These models can be used to search protein sequence databases for remote zzso The zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso software package identifies motif patterns in a protein family, and these motifs are combined into a hidden zzso model zzso for use as a database searching zzso zzso is sensitive and accurate, as well as automated and zzso making it suitable for the analysis of large zzso We demonstrate zzso on a family of zzso that includes zzso 11 zzso and 17 zzso zzso and their zzso in the short chain alcohol zzso zzso We chose this zzso because it is large and zzso diverse, providing a good test of the sensitivity and selectivity of zzso on a protein family of biological zzso Indeed, zzso identifies at least 350 members of this family in zzso and clearly separates these sequences from zzso zzso We also show how the zzso motif output can be used for zzso zzso
