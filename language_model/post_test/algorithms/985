zzso zzso of zzso chestnut and zzso leaves in a wide range of zzso content and composition was investigated to devise a zzso technique for total zzso zzso content zzso in higher plant zzso zzso zzso in the range 510 to 550 zzso was found to be closely related to the total zzso content in zzso The sensitivity of zzso zzso to Car content was zzso in a spectral range around 510 zzso however, zzso zzso also affect zzso in this spectral zzso To remove the zzso effect on the zzso zzso at 510 zzso a zzso zzso at either 550 or 700 zzso was used, which was zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso of Car content in leaves were devised and zzso zzso in three spectral bands, zzso zzso either zzso zzso or zzso zzso and the near infrared range above 750 zzso are sufficient to estimate total Car content in plant leaves zzso with a root mean square error of less than zzso zzso
