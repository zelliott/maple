In recent years there has been a trend of leaving the strict molecular clock in order to zzso dating of zzso and other evolutionary zzso zzso modeling of substitution rates and divergence times makes zzso of zzso prior zzso for branch lengths zzso Models with zzso zzso on tree branching and zzso or zzso substitution rates among lineages have been proposed, enabling simultaneous zzso of substitution rates and divergence zzso This problem has, however, mainly been zzso in the zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso zzso an approach requiring zzso times of hours or days when applied to large zzso 

We demonstrate that a zzso maximum a zzso zzso adaptation of the zzso scheme results in considerable gain in zzso zzso We demonstrate also that a novel dynamic programming zzso zzso for branch length zzso useful both in the zzso and in the zzso setting, further reduces zzso zzso For the problem of zzso rates and times parameters on a fixed tree, we perform simulations, comparisons between zzso and zzso on a plant zzso gene zzso and dating analysis on an animal zzso zzso showing that our methodology enables efficient, highly accurate analysis of very large zzso zzso requiring a zzso time of several days with zzso can with our zzso zzso be accurately zzso in less than a zzso From the results of our example zzso we conclude that our methodology generally avoids getting trapped early in local zzso For the cases where this nevertheless can be a problem, for instance when we in addition to the parameters also zzso the tree zzso we show that the problem can be evaded by using a zzso like zzso method in which we zzso tree swaps early in the zzso while zzso our focus towards rate and time zzso changes later zzso 

Our contribution leaves the field open for fast and accurate dating analysis of zzso sequence zzso Modeling branch zzso rates and divergence times separately allows us to include zzso zzso on the times without the assumption of a molecular zzso The methodology is easily adapted to take data from fossil records into account and it can be used together with a broad range of rate and substitution zzso
