A large number of zzso zzso zzso zzso have been found in human zzso but there is poor knowledge on the relationship between the zzso and zzso of these zzso Human zzso cassette (ABC) zzso are able to transport a number of important zzso including zzso and zzso zzso This study aimed to predict the zzso impact of zzso of human ABC zzso zzso and the predicted results were further validated by reported zzso data from zzso zzso and clinical genetic zzso One thousand and six hundred zzso zzso were found from 49 human ABC zzso zzso Using the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in ABC zzso genes were predicted to have an impact on protein zzso The prediction accuracy was up to zzso when compared with known zzso data from in zzso and in zzso zzso There was a significant zzso between the prediction results using zzso and zzso Of zzso predicted as zzso the prediction scores by zzso and zzso were significantly related to the number of zzso with known zzso confirmed by experimental and human zzso The zzso acid substitution zzso are supposed to be the zzso basis of increased zzso to certain diseases with zzso or complex zzso altered drug resistance and altered drug clearance and zzso zzso the zzso consequence of zzso using zzso zzso may provide a better understanding of genetic differences in zzso to diseases and drug zzso The prediction of zzso in human ABC zzso genes would be useful hints for further zzso zzso
