A novel method is presented for predicting the common secondary structures and alignment of two zzso zzso sequences by sampling the zzso zzso space, zzso the joint space of their alignments and common secondary zzso The structural alignment space is sampled according to a zzso distribution based on a zzso energy change that combines base pairing probabilities from a zzso model and alignment probabilities from a hidden zzso zzso By virtue of the implicit comparative analysis between the two zzso the method offers an improvement over single sequence sampling of the zzso zzso A cluster analysis shows that the samples obtained from joint sampling of the structural alignment space cluster more closely than samples generated by the single sequence zzso On average, the representative zzso structure and alignment of the most populated cluster in the sample of structures and alignments generated by joint sampling are more accurate than single sequence sampling and alignment based on sequence alone, zzso The zzso zzso structure that is closest to the known structure among all the zzso is, on average, more accurate than structure predictions of other zzso Additionally, cluster analysis zzso on average, a few zzso whose zzso can be presented as alternative zzso The source code for the proposed method can be downloaded at zzso
