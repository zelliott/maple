Conventional spectral analysis methods use a fast zzso transform zzso on consecutive or overlapping windowed data zzso For zzso ultrasound signals, this approach suffers from an inadequate frequency resolution due to the time segment duration and the zzso characteristics of the zzso zzso or zzso zzso can give significant improvements in the zzso resolution at the expense of a higher zzso zzso This work describes an approach which zzso in real-time a zzso spectral zzso method using genetic zzso zzso in order to find the optimum set of parameters for the zzso filter that zzso the error zzso The aim is to reduce the zzso complexity of the conventional zzso by using the simplicity associated to zzso and exploiting its parallel zzso This will allow the zzso of higher order zzso increasing the spectrum resolution, and opening a greater scope for using more complex zzso
