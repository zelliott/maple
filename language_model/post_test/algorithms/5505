Biological motor control provides highly effective solutions to difficult control problems in spite of the complexity of the plant and the significant delays in sensory zzso Such delays are expected to lead to non trivial stability issues and lack of zzso of control zzso However, such difficulties are not observed in biological systems under normal operating zzso Based on early suggestions in the control literature, a possible solution to this conundrum has been the suggestion that the motor system contains within itself a forward model of the plant zzso the zzso which allows the system to zzso and predict the effect of applying a control zzso In this work, we formally define the notion of a forward model for deterministic control problems, and provide simple conditions that imply its existence for tasks involving delayed feedback zzso As opposed to previous work which dealt mostly with linear plants and zzso cost functions, our results apply to rather generic control systems, showing that any controller zzso or zzso which zzso a set of tasks, must contain within itself a forward plant zzso We suggest that our results provide strong theoretical support for the necessity of forward models in many delayed control problems, zzso that they are not only useful, but rather, mandatory, under general zzso
