We have studied the whispering gallery mode zzso zzso of zzso zzso pillars containing zzso quantum zzso High quality factor zzso are observed from a wide range of pillars with diameters from zzso to 50 zzso zzso zzso with zzso thresholds and high zzso approaching unity is observed under optical pumping in a 4 zzso diameter zzso zzso splitting is observed in zzso from pillars with diameters of 5 zzso 20 zzso and 50 zzso develop a model in which the mode splitting in the larger pillars is caused by resonant scattering from the quantum dots zzso The model explains why zzso are observed in all of the larger pillars and that the splitting decreases with increasing zzso zzso simulations by zzso confirm that the model is zzso This mechanism of splitting should be general for all circular resonant structures containing quantum dots such as zzso rings, zzso and zzso
