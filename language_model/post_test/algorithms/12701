A standard zzso approach to zzso and drug target discovery consists of placing putative zzso in the context of a network of biological zzso followed by different zzso zzso The latter is typically done based on network structural zzso Here, an alternative analysis approach in which the networks are analyzed on a zzso zzso space is zzso Such information is extracted from zzso functional zzso We present zzso a zzso zzso for zzso similarity assessment in biological zzso
