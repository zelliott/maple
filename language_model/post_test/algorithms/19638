Independent checking of beam monitor units is an essential step in the preparation of any zzso zzso The present work describes a simple model for calculating a point dose from an arbitrary number of zzso zzso fields, typical of beam segments used for zzso 

zzso and scatter dose contributions were separated using a zzso exponential fit to measured beam data, from which differential scatter is zzso A total of 60 zzso patient plans for a zzso prostate class solution were investigated to validate the zzso 

The average difference between the zzso prediction and direct measurement of reference dose was found to be zzso zzso from zzso to zzso with a standard zzso of zzso This compares well with the observed average difference between treatment planning system prediction and direct measurement of zzso zzso zzso 

The model is shown to provide a reliable and accurate independent check of planning system monitor units for the prostate zzso plans zzso Implementation of the model could significantly reduce the time needed for point dose zzso of zzso plans currently performed by direct zzso
