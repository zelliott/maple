zzso optical zzso zzso zzso is a zzso high-resolution imaging technique able to zzso the inner wall of the coronary arteries and implanted devices in zzso with an zzso resolution below 20 zzso zzso is being used in several clinical trials aiming to zzso the vessel response to zzso zzso over zzso However, zzso analysis is currently performed manually and corresponding images taken at different time points are matched through a very zzso and zzso zzso We present an automated method for the spatial registration of zzso zzso zzso zzso are segmented through consecutive images and three-dimensional models of the zzso are created for both zzso to be zzso The two models are initially roughly registered through an automatic zzso procedure and an zzso closest point zzso is subsequently applied for a more precise zzso To correct for zzso zzso zzso zzso and other potential acquisition artifacts, the registration is zzso refined on a local zzso The zzso was first validated by using an in zzso experimental setup based on a zzso gel zzso zzso zzso an in zzso validation was obtained by exploiting stable vessel zzso The mean registration error in zzso was zzso to be zzso zzso in the zzso axis and zzso mean rotation zzso In zzso validation resulted in zzso zzso in the zzso axis and zzso rotation zzso These results indicate that the proposed methodology can be used for automatic registration of in zzso zzso zzso Such a tool will be indispensable for larger studies on vessel healing zzso and reaction to zzso zzso As such, it will be valuable in testing the performance of new generations of zzso devices and new therapeutic zzso
