We think of cluster analysis as class zzso That is, we assume that there is an unknown mapping called zzso structure that assigns a class label to each zzso and the goal of cluster analysis is to estimate this zzso structure, that is, to estimate the number of clusters and cluster zzso In traditional cluster analysis, it is assumed that such unknown mapping is zzso However, since the observations may cluster in more than one way depending on the variables used, it is natural to permit the existence of more than one zzso zzso This generalized zzso problem of zzso multiple zzso structures is the focus of this zzso We propose an zzso for finding multiple zzso structures of observations which involves zzso both variables and zzso The number of zzso structures is determined by the number of variable zzso The zzso measure for zzso variables is based on zzso zzso The observations are clustered using weighted distances with weights determined by the clusters of the zzso The motivating application is to gene expression zzso
