zzso is usually controlled by either zzso or zzso zzso The first approach is simple and zzso but it is not practical for controlling many zzso The second approach, although less zzso may provide a more efficient means for controlling many zzso but its ability to control zzso depends on the appropriateness of the chosen zzso zzso methods based on a zzso zzso score or a propensity score combine the favorable characteristics of both methods and may be better suited for controlling many zzso However, the resulting strata are defined by zzso of a zzso model, and, therefore, may possess little intrinsic zzso The authors propose the principle of zzso zzso to control efficiently a number of zzso in cohort studies while retaining the intuitive appeal and general framework of zzso The proposed method resembles a propensity score analysis but does not use a zzso model to define the zzso Instead, strata are defined by the categories of only a subset of the original potential zzso The authors also demonstrate how our proposed method can be implemented by an application of zzso and zzso trees zzso zzso zzso as outlined by zzso et zzso zzso and zzso zzso Belmont, zzso zzso zzso Computer simulations and an actual example suggest that the proposed method is a potentially simpler alternative to the standard propensity score zzso zzso recommendations on how the proposed method can be improved are also zzso
