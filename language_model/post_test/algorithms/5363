zzso analysis depends on the reconstruction of complete cell zzso zzso reconstruction of neural zzso or zzso using volume electron zzso requires dense zzso of all cells, which leads even experts to make zzso zzso Currently, reconstruction speed rather than acquisition speed limits the determination of neural wiring zzso We developed a method for fast and reliable reconstruction of densely labeled data zzso Our approach, based on manually zzso each zzso zzso (multiple zzso with a zzso software tool called zzso is zzso faster than volume zzso Errors are detected and eliminated by a zzso consensus procedure zzso which uses a statistical model of how true zzso connectivity is transformed into zzso zzso zzso also estimates the reliability of consensus zzso zzso zzso of difficult locations promises a rather steep increase of reliability as a function of the average skeleton zzso and thus the nearly zzso analysis of large zzso zzso
