zzso is the most common zzso childhood zzso zzso zzso of all childhood cancer zzso In an initial study, we used zzso zzso zzso to zzso gene expression in 68 primary zzso and compared different data mining approaches for prediction of early zzso Here, we performed zzso of the data including prolonged follow-up and applied support zzso machine zzso zzso and outer zzso strategies to improve reliability of expression profiling based zzso zzso of outcome prediction was significantly improved by the use of innovative zzso zzso on the updated zzso In addition, zzso a zzso zzso approach, was used to predict survival times for the individual patient based on expression profiling zzso zzso reliably predicted zzso survival, given a zzso time of three zzso zzso expression of genes used by zzso to predict patient outcome was validated in an independent cohort of 117 zzso In conclusion, we show here for the first time that zzso of zzso data using improved methodology, state-of-the-art performance tests and updated follow-up data improves prognosis zzso and may further improve risk zzso of individual zzso
