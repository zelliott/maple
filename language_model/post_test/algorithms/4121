Heart rate zzso zzso may reflect various zzso zzso In particular, variation of zzso peak zzso zzso of zzso appears regularly zzso in deeper levels of zzso and less regular in lighter levels of zzso We proposed a new index, zzso ratio zzso to zzso this feature and investigated its potential to estimate depth of zzso 

Thirty-one female patients were enrolled in this prospective zzso The zzso pattern transition of zzso was zzso by the zzso power spectrum and zzso by zzso The prediction of zzso events, including skin zzso first reaction of motor movement during emergence period, loss of consciousness zzso and return of consciousness zzso by zzso were evaluated by serial prediction probability zzso ) zzso the ability to predict the decrease of zzso zzso concentration was also zzso The results were compared with zzso Index zzso 

zzso zzso first reaction zzso zzso zzso ahead, earlier than zzso and significantly better than zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso although its correlation was inferior to zzso while zzso zzso had no such zzso zzso indicated zzso and zzso zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso provides complementary information to zzso regarding the differential effects of zzso on the brain, especially the zzso motor zzso
