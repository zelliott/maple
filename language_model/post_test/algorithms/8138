Five new zzso and a zzso learning zzso show that noise can benefit threshold neural signal detection by reducing the probability of detection zzso The first zzso gives a necessary and sufficient condition for such a noise benefit when a threshold zzso performs discrete zzso signal detection in the presence of additive zzso zzso The zzso allows the user to find the optimal noise probability density for several zzso noise types that include generalized zzso zzso The second zzso gives a zzso condition for more general threshold signal detection when the signals have continuous probability zzso The third and fourth zzso reduce this noise benefit to a zzso comparison of signal probability zzso at the detection threshold when the signal zzso are continuously zzso and when the noise is zzso and comes from a scale zzso The fifth zzso shows how collective noise benefits can occur in a parallel array of threshold zzso even when an individual threshold zzso does not itself produce a noise zzso The zzso zzso learning zzso can find the optimal noise value for noise probability zzso that do not have a closed zzso
