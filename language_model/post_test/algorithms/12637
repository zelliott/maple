This study clarified whether zzso fluctuation analysis zzso can evaluate how to advance the loss of complexity from impaired zzso tolerance zzso through mild diabetes zzso zzso to overt zzso 

Continuous zzso monitoring zzso was done during a zzso zzso for 59 subjects from multiple zzso zzso were divided according to zzso data into those with impaired zzso tolerance zzso zzso zzso zzso mild zzso zzso zzso zzso and overt zzso zzso zzso zzso The short-term zzso and long-term zzso range zzso by zzso were compared among the three zzso 

The value of zzso within zzso was significantly lower in the zzso group than in either of the other two groups zzso zzso mild zzso zzso overt zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso within zzso differed significantly among the three groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso within zzso was significantly higher in overt zzso than in either of the other two groups but did not change between zzso and mild zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All short-term zzso decreased gradually but significantly as the window widened in all groups zzso The zzso over zzso was significantly higher in overt zzso but was unchanged in zzso and mild zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso over zzso did not differ among the three zzso 

Progressive loss of complexity in the zzso profile occurred from the short-term range and spread to the long-term range zzso with the progression of the zzso zzso
