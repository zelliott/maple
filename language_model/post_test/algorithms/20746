zzso studies of electrical double layers typically consider the response of zzso conductors to the field of uniform zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Many such analyses predict apparent anomalies of differential zzso C , including zzso and negative zzso To clarify zzso regarding these predictions, we critically zzso some theoretical approaches dealing with the admissible sign of C zzso We examine the zzso origin and stress its relation to the artificiality of zzso We show that calculations based on zzso can illuminate the nature of zzso and phase transitions under the physically zzso conditions of potential control, where applied zzso zzso rather than zzso is zzso For zzso we discuss the physical nature of the zzso zzso negative integral zzso predicted by some recent zzso We also show that zzso anomalies can explain some zzso observed features of zzso zzso
