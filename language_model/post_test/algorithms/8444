zzso zzso zzso of a single site in the zzso zzso of rats and monkeys for 2-6 h increases the number of zzso responsive to the skin region corresponding to the zzso receptive field zzso with very little effect on the position and size of the zzso zzso and the response evoked at the zzso site by tactile zzso Large changes in zzso topography are also observed following several weeks of repetitive stimulation of a restricted skin region during tactile frequency discrimination training in zzso It has been suggested that these changes in zzso topography are caused by competitive learning in zzso zzso This paper analyses the possible role of lateral zzso synaptic plasticity in producing cortical plasticity after zzso and peripheral conditioning in adult zzso The zzso zzso zzso and lateral zzso synaptic plasticity rules are used to model zzso changes after zzso and peripheral zzso The zzso model produces zzso topographical changes similar to those observed zzso It is shown that lateral zzso zzso plasticity is sufficient to model zzso changes and increase in position discrimination after peripheral zzso Several novel and testable predictions are made based on the zzso zzso
