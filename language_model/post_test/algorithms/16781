zzso zzso and scoring using the internal coordinate mechanics software zzso was zzso for zzso binding mode prediction against the 85 zzso structures in the modified zzso data zzso The ICM virtual zzso screening was tested against the 40 zzso target benchmarks and zzso zzso zzso The zzso accuracy was evaluated for the top 1 and top 3 scoring poses at each zzso binding site with near native zzso below zzso zzso found in 91 and zzso of the predictions, zzso The virtual zzso screening using single rigid pocket zzso provided the median area under the zzso zzso equal to zzso with zzso true zzso recovered at zzso false positive zzso zzso improvements up to zzso zzso and zzso were achieved following our best practices for flexible pocket refinement and out-of-pocket binding zzso The virtual screening can be further improved by considering multiple zzso of the zzso
