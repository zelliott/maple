To investigate the possible use of electrical zzso zzso zzso in monitoring focal cerebral zzso in a rabbit zzso 

A model of focal cerebral zzso was established in eight New Zealand rabbits using a zzso method without zzso zzso cerebral zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso zzso variation was measured using 16 zzso placed in a circle on the zzso zzso images were obtained using a zzso zzso reconstruction zzso The average zzso value zzso of the zzso region on zzso images was calculated to zzso relative zzso zzso A symmetry index was calculated to evaluate the relative difference in zzso between the two sides of the zzso 

zzso images and zzso zzso showed that zzso changes caused by cerebral zzso increased zzso with zzso zzso A difference in zzso was found between zzso taken before and after zzso zzso 

zzso cerebral zzso can be monitored by zzso in the proposed animal zzso The results are sufficiently encouraging that the authors plan to extend this study to humans, after further technical zzso
