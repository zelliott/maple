This study was undertaken to assess the zzso usefulness of zzso bone density, as measured by zzso zzso zzso and the zzso implant stability measures of zzso zzso zzso zzso values zzso and resonance frequency analysis zzso implant stability zzso zzso toward developing an zzso for successful immediate zzso zzso exposure, or zzso of dental zzso 

zzso presenting patients requesting immediate loading in areas other than the anterior zzso were analyzed zzso The implants were either immediately zzso left exposed, or submerged on the basis of zzso CT bone density and zzso primary stability zzso All implants surviving the traditional healing period were verified for zzso 

zzso patients were analyzed zzso and they received 58 zzso Seven implants failed, for a survival rate of zzso zzso stability zzso at zzso were correlated with one another and with zzso CT bone zzso zzso mean bone density for surviving implants was greatest for immediately loaded implants zzso zzso zzso lower for exposed implants zzso zzso 29), and lowest zzso zzso zzso for submerged zzso Bone density was significantly different between submerged implants that failed and those that zzso Mean IT for successful implants was higher than for those that zzso Mean zzso were lower zzso zzso for successful versus failed zzso although this difference was significant only for submerged zzso 

In this group of patients, objective measures of bone density by CT, zzso zzso and zzso correlated with each other and therefore may provide a useful zzso for making clinical implant loading zzso Of the technologies applied in this group of patients, zzso was the most reliable predictor at implant placement of failure to zzso
