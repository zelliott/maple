As the costs associated with clinical research and new drug development increase, it is incumbent upon us to develop alternative research zzso A new Computer zzso zzso program identifies zzso evidence with the potential to generate a hypothesis that is most likely to be clinically confirmed regarding the cause of a disease or the questions being zzso The objective of this study was to demonstrate whether computer zzso can be used to guide scientific research in solving important biomedical zzso The establishment of zzso as an alternative research methodology has the potential to accelerate the translation of basic science findings into clinical zzso The specific aim of this study was to develop a zzso hypothesis related to the controversial issue debating which zzso imaging technology is most suitable for diagnostic purposes prior to the placement of oral zzso This hypothesis was then zzso in retrospect, with a known opinion established following a recent literature review on this zzso In his review of the literature, zzso zzso suggests that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the diagnostic imaging zzso of choice prior to implant zzso To compare the zzso hypothesis with zzso zzso opinion, we subjected 34 relevant papers to zzso zzso The output consisted of clusters of important statements, phrases, and thought processes from the given zzso rated with the greatest potential to generate testable zzso Both zzso output and zzso zzso indicated that CT scanning is the diagnostic imaging zzso of choice prior to implant zzso Although the ultimate utility of zzso is dependent on the successful testing of its derived hypothesis, this preliminary retrospective study suggests that zzso might be useful in guiding scientific zzso
