Portable blood gas zzso and monitor devices are increasingly being used to direct zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the zzso of treatment zzso between portable and laboratory blood gas zzso used in guiding zzso zzso zzso 

Using National Institutes of Health Acute Respiratory zzso zzso network zzso management guidelines to manage patient care, zzso taken from the zzso zzso M pulse zzso zzso the zzso zzso CO2 zzso zzso and the zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared with the recommended treatment from paired laboratory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Four hundred zzso zzso adult intensive care unit patients were studied zzso Except for the zzso zzso zzso zzso correlation zzso between portable and laboratory zzso were high zzso zzso or zzso zzso Testing for zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were deemed zzso surrogates to paired zzso zzso Testing for the limits of agreement found only the zzso to be an acceptable surrogate zzso The measure of treatment agreement between the portable and paired laboratory blood gas zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Only the zzso and the zzso achieved the zzso or zzso treatment agreement threshold to be considered as acceptable surrogates to laboratory zzso 

: The zzso and zzso were portable device zzso acceptable as surrogates to standard clinical laboratory blood gas zzso in guiding zzso zzso zzso The zzso of treatment zzso based on standardized decisions and measurement thresholds of a zzso provides a simple method for assessing clinical zzso of surrogate zzso
