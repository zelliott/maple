Although several methods for generating the zzso of a colon from CT zzso scans have been proposed, in general they are time-consuming and do not take into account that the images of the colon may be of zzso quality, with collapsed regions, and stool within the zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso or wall, which is often used as a basis for zzso of a zzso is not always precisely zzso In this study, we have developed an zzso for zzso of a colon zzso that is fast compared to the zzso zzso presented in the reviewed literature, and that relies little on a complete colon segments zzso The proposed zzso first extracts local zzso in a distance map of a segmented zzso zzso The zzso are considered to be zzso in a set of zzso and are zzso linked together, based on a set of connection criteria, giving a minimum distance spanning zzso The connection criteria are zzso from the distance from object boundary, the zzso distance between zzso and the zzso values on the zzso between pairs of zzso After the last zzso redundant branches are removed and end segments are recovered for each remaining zzso A subset of the initial zzso is used for distinguishing between the colon and zzso zzso segments among the set of zzso giving the final zzso zzso A phantom study showed that, with respect to phantom variations, the zzso achieved nearly constant zzso time zzso zzso except for the most extreme setting zzso zzso The zzso successfully found all, or most of, the zzso zzso - zzso zzso from optimum varied with colon diameter zzso zzso By use of 40 CT zzso scans, the computer-generated zzso were compared with the zzso generated by three zzso The similarity was measured based on percent coverage and average zzso The computer-generated zzso when compared with zzso zzso had approximately the same displacement as when the zzso zzso were compared among each other zzso zzso versus zzso zzso The coverage of the computer-generated zzso was slightly less than that of the zzso zzso zzso versus zzso The 40 zzso were, on average, zzso in zzso seconds, including zzso time for the distance zzso with an Intel zzso 800 zzso computer, as compared with zzso seconds or more zzso zzso time for the distance transform zzso per zzso as reported in other zzso
