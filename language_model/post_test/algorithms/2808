Expert landmark zzso are widely reported for evaluating zzso image registration zzso spatial zzso In this report, we present a framework for objective evaluation of zzso spatial accuracy using large sets of zzso landmark point zzso Large samples zzso of pulmonary landmark point pairs were manually generated for five zzso Estimates of zzso and zzso variation were determined from repeated zzso Comparative evaluation of zzso spatial accuracy was performed for two zzso a zzso optical flow zzso and a zzso moving zzso zzso The uncertainty of spatial error estimates was found to be zzso zzso to the square root of the number of landmark point pairs and directly zzso to the standard zzso of the spatial zzso Using the statistical properties of this data, we performed sample size calculations to estimate the average spatial accuracy of each zzso with zzso confidence intervals within a zzso zzso zzso For the optical flow and moving zzso zzso the required sample sizes were zzso and 36, zzso Comparative evaluation based on fewer than the required validation landmarks results in zzso of the relative spatial zzso This study demonstrates that landmark pairs can be used to assess zzso spatial accuracy within a narrow uncertainty zzso
