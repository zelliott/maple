zzso and zzso have zzso and multiple operation patterns depending on the zzso zzso temperatures, the activity of zzso and other zzso In this paper, an integrated framework of zzso modeling and process monitoring methods is developed for a complex biological zzso The proposed method is based on modeling by fuzzy partial least squares zzso and on process monitoring by a statistical decomposition, which is suitable for predicting and supervising a zzso biological zzso Case studies in the zzso process and industrial biological plant show that the proposed method can give superior prediction and monitoring performance in complex biological plants compared to other linear and zzso methods, since it can effectively capture the zzso zzso relationship within the zzso This gives us the integrated framework that is able to both model and monitor the zzso zzso zzso
