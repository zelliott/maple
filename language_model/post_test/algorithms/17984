The simultaneous application of functional zzso and zzso represents an attractive, zzso technique for the combined measurement of electrical and zzso activity in the human zzso zzso zzso provides a brain imaging zzso with zzso spatial zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, simultaneously acquired zzso are difficult due to the artifacts that are induced in the zzso by both the temporally varying field zzso used in zzso and also blood flow zzso In this paper we apply an zzso zzso spatial filter to zzso data recorded simultaneously with zzso We show, using this technique, that it is possible to zzso accurately electrical effects in the brain, and that the zzso of driven zzso responses in the human visual zzso are zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso We also show how the zzso can be used to extract zzso of electrical activity from areas of interest in the zzso Such zzso have zzso time zzso Finally, we show that in addition to source zzso the zzso spatial filter acts to reject interference in zzso signals, thus increasing the effective signal to noise ratio of electrical zzso We show that the zzso can eliminate effectively the zzso artifact as well as residual zzso artifacts that remain in zzso data following correction using averaged artifact zzso zzso
