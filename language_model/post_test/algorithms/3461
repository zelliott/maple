One oldest technical problem in zzso practice is the effect of an active reference on zzso recording, and it is especially important for identifying the zzso information of zzso zzso To solve this problem, a reference zzso zzso technique zzso has been proposed for a concentric zzso head zzso zzso based on an equivalent distributed source model, reconstructs the potential with a reference at zzso from the potential with a scalp point reference or with the average zzso In this paper, investigated was the zzso for a realistic head zzso The results of simulation studies show that the potential reconstruction for the realistic head model is more sensitive to noise than that for the concentric zzso head model, so a zzso inverse by truncated singular value decomposition was zzso The results confirm that zzso is still an efficient method even for a realistic head model especially for the most important superficial zzso zzso
