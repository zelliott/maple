The onset of zzso zzso zzso has been associated with steep action potential duration zzso in both clinical and zzso zzso Recently, detailed clinical zzso properties in cardiac patients were reported showing a substantial degree of zzso in zzso slopes at the zzso of the zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of zzso zzso properties in a three-dimensional model of the zzso using these clinically measured zzso zzso We used a realistic model of the human zzso including detailed descriptions of cell zzso zzso zzso and fiber direction zzso We extended this model by mapping the clinically observed zzso zzso data to our zzso representation using a zzso zzso zzso properties were then fitted by regionally varying parameters of the zzso zzso We studied the effects of zzso zzso on the organization of zzso by analyzing filaments and the zzso of zzso zzso We found that the number of filaments and the zzso periods were both dependent on the extent of zzso An increased level of zzso leads to a greater number of filaments and a broader distribution of zzso zzso thereby increasing the complexity and dynamics of zzso zzso zzso may play an important role in providing a zzso for cardiac zzso
