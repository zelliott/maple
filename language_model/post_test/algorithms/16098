In this paper, we present some original theoretical aspects of a fast zzso association measure based on the work of zzso The features of this new zzso V zzso applied to zzso are also shown using simulated time zzso A comparative study with other well-known association measures available in the literature of zzso is zzso V was found to be twice as fast and more robust to zzso than the classical zzso ratio zzso and more than 100 times faster than the zzso zzso zzso zzso presenting similar behavior in the presence of zzso simulated zzso This new measure is very fast and zzso It is appropriate to deal with zzso relations presenting usually a sharp peak in the association function enabling a high degree of selectivity for zzso zzso It seems to constitute an improvement over linear methods of association which is faster and more robust to the existing zzso It can be used as an alternative to more complex zzso association measures when zzso speed is an important zzso
