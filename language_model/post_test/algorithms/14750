Due to the battery resource constraints, saving energy is a critical issue in wireless sensor networks, particularly in large sensor zzso One possible solution is to deploy multiple sink zzso zzso Another possible solution is to employ an zzso zzso hierarchy zzso zzso In this paper, we propose a multiple sink cluster wireless sensor networks scheme which combines the two solutions, and propose an efficient transmission power control scheme for a zzso cluster zzso protocol in multiple sink wireless sensor networks, zzso as zzso It is a distributed, zzso zzso zzso system, and the sensor zzso do not require knowledge of the global network and their zzso All sinks effectively work out a representative view of a monitored region, after which power control is employed to zzso network zzso The simulations demonstrate the advantages of our new zzso
