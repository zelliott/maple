In zzso and well zzso zzso images, the phase of the complex image often varies zzso in both the zzso and zzso zzso Thus, in principle, it is possible to display an image in zzso zzso However, manually determining the two zzso and one zzso phase parameters needed to display an zzso image is a formidable zzso In this paper, the zzso calculations needed to automatically determine these parameters are zzso and the calculations are illustrated using zzso zzso
