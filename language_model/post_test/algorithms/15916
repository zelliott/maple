The collagen network in skin is largely responsible for the zzso mechanical zzso response of zzso We zzso that the zzso response of collagen is governed by the zzso of zzso zzso We show that a zzso model derived from the statistical mechanics of zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso collagen network in skin, captures the mechanical response of zzso A connection between the zzso meaningful parameters of network molecular chain density and free length of collagen fibers and the zzso significant parameters of initial zzso and limiting stretch is thus zzso The relevant zzso law is shown to have zzso capabilities related to skin zzso by replicating in zzso and in zzso experimental zzso From finite element simulations, this modeling approach predicts that the collagen network in zzso scars is more dense and the constituent collagen fibers have shorter free lengths than in healthy zzso Additionally, the model is shown to predict that as rat skin ages, collagen network density increases and fiber free length zzso The importance of knowledge of the in zzso stress state for analyzing skin response and zzso zzso laws is also zzso
