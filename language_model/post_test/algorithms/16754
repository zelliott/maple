The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of zzso angle zzso zzso compared to zzso beam geometry for two inverse treatment planning systems zzso by zzso the information obtained from a range of treatment zzso 

The comparison was based on treatment plans generated for four different head and neck zzso cancer cases using two inverse treatment planning systems zzso zzso zzso representing dynamic zzso intensity modulated zzso zzso and zzso zzso representing segmented zzso zzso The patient cases were selected on the criterion of representing different degrees of overlap between the planning target volume zzso and the investigated organ at risk, the zzso zzso zzso For each case, a number of zzso zzso plans were generated in order to investigate the zzso between the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso or the decrease in dose zzso zzso to the zzso as a function of the mean absorbed dose to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

For the Eclipse system, zzso had a clear advantage for the cases with smallest overlap zzso 1 and zzso The set of data points, representing the underlying zzso generated with and without using zzso were, however, not as clearly separated for the cases with larger overlap zzso 3 and zzso With the zzso system, the difference was less pronounced for all zzso The Eclipse zzso displays the most zzso zzso for all zzso zzso 

We have found differences in the effectiveness of zzso as compared to zzso beam zzso in terms of handling conflicting zzso for two commercial inverse zzso A comparison, based on a range of treatment plans, as developed in this study, is likely to improve the understanding of conflicting zzso and might apply to other thorough comparison zzso
