To study the zzso properties of zzso networks, in zzso studies based on zzso zzso have become a viable tool for zzso Although in constant progress, a challenging task still remains in this zzso the development of an efficient spike sorting zzso that allows an accurate signal analysis at the zzso zzso Most sorting zzso currently available only extract a specific feature type, such as the principal components or zzso zzso of the measured spike signals in order to separate different spike shapes generated by different zzso However, due to the great variety in the obtained spike shapes, the derivation of an optimal feature set is still a very complex issue that current zzso struggle zzso To address this problem, we propose a novel zzso that zzso extracts a variety of geometric, zzso and principal zzso features and zzso automatically derives a feature zzso most suitable for sorting an individual set of spike zzso Thus, there is a new approach that evaluates the probability distribution of the obtained spike features and consequently determines the candidates most suitable for the actual spike zzso These candidates can be formed into an individually adjusted set of spike features, allowing a separation of the various shapes present in the obtained zzso signal by a subsequent expectation zzso zzso zzso Test results with simulated data files and data obtained from chick embryonic zzso cultured on zzso zzso showed an excellent zzso result, indicating the superior performance of the described zzso zzso
