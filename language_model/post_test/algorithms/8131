This study introduces a zzso zzso neural network zzso as an integrated zzso system, in which the features and parameters of an evolving zzso neural network are zzso together with the use of a zzso evolutionary zzso We propose here a novel zzso method that uses different representations to explore the two search zzso A zzso representation for zzso feature zzso and a continuous representation for evolving appropriate zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The properties and characteristics of the improved framework are studied on two different synthetic benchmark zzso zzso are compared to traditional methods, namely a zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso A previously used real world ecological zzso on invasive species establishment prediction is revisited and new results are obtained and analyzed by an ecological zzso The proposed method results in a much faster convergence to an optimal solution (or a close to it), in a better zzso and in a more zzso set of features zzso
