Treatment plans are usually zzso zzso and evaluated based on the total zzso dose distribution, motivating a total zzso dose zzso The purpose of this study was to develop a zzso zzso method using an electronic portal imaging device zzso into a simple zzso method that provides zzso dose zzso In the new method, the dose is reconstructed within the patient volume in multiple planes parallel to the zzso for each zzso zzso By summing the zzso dose zzso of all beams, the zzso dose distribution for the total treatment fraction is zzso The zzso uses patient contours from the planning CT scan but does not include tissue zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso method was tested for zzso zzso of a zzso a zzso and a zzso cancer zzso Planned and in zzso dose zzso were within zzso at the dose prescription zzso Within the 50% zzso surface of the prescribed dose, at least zzso of points were in agreement, evaluated with a zzso gamma method with criteria of zzso of the prescribed dose and zzso zzso Full zzso dose reconstruction on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso grid and zzso gamma evaluation took less than 15 zzso for one fraction on a standard zzso The method allows in zzso determination of zzso zzso parameters that are common in clinical zzso The authors conclude that their zzso zzso method is an accurate and fast tool for in zzso dose zzso of zzso plans in zzso Their approach is independent of the treatment planning system and provides a practical safety net for zzso
