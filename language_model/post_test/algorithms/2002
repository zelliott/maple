zzso of brain zzso transport zzso in zzso at zzso typically does not allow distinguishing apparent maximum transport rate zzso from cerebral consumption zzso Using a zzso zzso model of zzso zzso we show that simultaneous dynamic measurement of brain and plasma zzso zzso provide enough information for independent and reliable determination of the two zzso In addition, although dynamic zzso zzso can be described with a zzso zzso model, which is implicit to the large zzso constant zzso relative to zzso brain zzso content, we found that the apparent affinity constant zzso was better determined with the zzso zzso model of zzso transport than with any of the other models zzso Furthermore, we confirmed the utility of the present method to determine zzso transport and consumption by zzso the zzso of both zzso transport and consumption by zzso conditions that modify cerebral zzso In particular, deep zzso zzso caused a significant reduction of both zzso and cerebral zzso rate for zzso zzso In conclusion, dynamic measurement of brain zzso in zzso in function of plasma zzso allows robust determination of both zzso zzso and consumption zzso
