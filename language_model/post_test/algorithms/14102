zzso and zzso contributions to the zzso interaction between zzso zzso zzso modeled as zzso plates in water, have been calculated using molecular dynamics simulations in the zzso zzso ensemble with free energy zzso zzso We find the stabilizing contribution to the free energy of association zzso pair zzso to be the favorable zzso part, the zzso contribution being highly zzso The zzso barrier is dominated by the zzso zzso contribution, despite a fairly large favorable zzso zzso The zzso contributions, incorporating the zzso zzso terms, largely determine the stability of the zzso separated zzso We decompose the zzso into a direct zzso term, the zzso zzso and the remainder that contains zzso work as well as contributions due to zzso zzso The zzso contribution due to changes in zzso interactions arising from zzso reorganization around the zzso molecules is shown to have major contribution in the zzso induced zzso zzso
