We report a methodology for comparing and combining dose information from external beam zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso components of prostate cancer treatment using the biological effective dose zzso On a zzso zzso prostate cancer patient treated with zzso and zzso rate zzso zzso a zzso dose distribution was calculated for each of the zzso and zzso portions of zzso For each component of treatment, the zzso was calculated on a point-by-point basis to produce a zzso zzso These individual zzso zzso could then be summed for combined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were produced and compared for various combinations of zzso and zzso Transformation to zzso enabled zzso of the relative contribution of each zzso to the prostate dose, as the relative weighting of zzso and zzso was zzso The zzso of the prostate and zzso demonstrated dramatically increased zzso with the introduction of even a small component of zzso However, increasing the zzso portion relative to the zzso component resulted in lower dose to the surrounding normal structures, as evidenced by the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso rate zzso conventional dose zzso were successfully transformed to the common zzso of zzso zzso for comparison and for merging prostate cancer radiation treatment zzso The results of this analysis can assist physicians in zzso determining the best combination and weighting of radiation treatment zzso for individual zzso
