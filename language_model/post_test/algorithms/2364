A new method has been developed for measuring the volume flow rate of blood flowing through large vessels or zzso tracts of the zzso In this article we describe the principle of a method that can reduce the dependence of the zzso angle of flow measurement by setting the sample points along a line to which every ultrasound beam is zzso To evaluate the accuracy of this method, flow phantom experiments were made for both steady and zzso zzso The volume flow rate measured by this method agrees well with that observed by an ultrasound zzso zzso zzso zzso when the vessel diameter is large zzso zzso However, this method zzso by zzso when the vessel diameter is small (8 zzso To make this method zzso to small vessels, an improvement in the lateral resolution of zzso measurement is zzso It has been concluded that this method can be used to measure the cardiac output or volume flow rates in large zzso
