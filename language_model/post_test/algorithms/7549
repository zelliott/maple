zzso is a fundamental interaction whose concept and effects applied to data zzso become a novel data zzso zzso The simple principle of data gravitation zzso zzso is to zzso data samples by comparing the gravitation between different zzso However, the calculation of gravitation is not a trivial problem due to the different relevance of data attributes for distance computation, the presence of noisy or irrelevant zzso and the class imbalance zzso This paper presents a zzso zzso zzso which improves previous gravitation models and overcomes some of their zzso The proposed algorithm, called zzso employs a zzso of weights to describe the importance of each attribute in the zzso of each class, which is used to weight the distance between data zzso It improves the zzso performance by considering both global and local data information, especially in decision zzso The proposal is evaluated and compared to other well-known zzso zzso techniques, on 35 standard and 44 zzso data zzso The results obtained from these experiments show the great performance of the proposed gravitation model, and they are validated using several zzso statistical zzso
