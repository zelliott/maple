A zzso filter was designed for and tested with a room temperature electron beam zzso source zzso zzso charge state zzso up to the charge state zzso were resolved as well as the zzso of krypton using zzso of different zzso The complete setup consisting of an zzso and a zzso filter has a length of less than 1 m substituting a complete classical zzso zzso The zzso filter is equipped with removable permanent zzso Hence total beam current zzso are possible via simple removal of the permanent zzso In dependence on the needs of resolution a weak zzso zzso or a strong zzso zzso magnets setup can be zzso In this paper the principle of operation and the design of the zzso filter meeting the requirements of an zzso are briefly zzso The first zzso beam extraction and separation experiments with a zzso zzso are zzso
