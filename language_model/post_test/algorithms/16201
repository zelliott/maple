This paper introduces a novel method to score how well proposed fused image quality measures zzso indicate the effectiveness of humans to detect targets in fused zzso The human detection performance is measured via human perception zzso A good zzso should relate to perception results in a zzso zzso The method zzso a new diffuse prior zzso likelihood ratio zzso to facilitate the comparison of the zzso hypothesis that the intrinsic human detection performance is related to the zzso via a zzso function against the zzso hypothesis that the detection and image quality relationship is zzso The paper discusses many interesting properties of the zzso and demonstrates the effectiveness of the zzso test via zzso Carlo zzso Finally, the zzso is used to score zzso with test cases considering over 35 scenes and various image fusion zzso
