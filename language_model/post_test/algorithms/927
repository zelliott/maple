The zzso zzso is a rate modulated zzso that uses the evoked zzso zzso as an indicator to determine its optimal pacing zzso Despite the generally favorable clinical results with this form of zzso some flaws in the system have been reported, such as the frequently observed rather slow initial response of the pacing rate to physical exercise, and the phenomenon of zzso of the heart zzso These problems can be attributed to the rate zzso zzso used in the current zzso zzso Recently, in a zzso of the relationship between evoked zzso zzso and pacing rate, a zzso relationship between these parameters has been zzso As a result, a new zzso has been developed for the next generation of the zzso zzso Before this new zzso was implemented in new zzso devices, it was evaluated in a zzso clinical investigation, with emphasis on the initial response of the pacing rate to zzso This study was carried out by means of special software in the programmer of the zzso zzso By employing real-time zzso zzso it was possible to submit the study population, consisting of 37 patients with implanted zzso zzso of the current generation, to identical exercise zzso Comparing these exercise tests, it appears that a considerable gain in speed of response to exercise can be achieved by using the same sensor with a faster zzso zzso rate zzso zzso
