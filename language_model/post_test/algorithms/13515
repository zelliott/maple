We report on the construction of a zzso plane imaging system attached to a cell zzso By illuminating particle suspensions with a zzso beam from an inexpensive zzso laser, zzso resolved scattering patterns are zzso by the phone's zzso zzso these patterns with zzso theory results in predictions of size zzso of the particles in zzso Despite using consumer grade electronics, we extracted size zzso of sphere suspensions with better than 20 zzso accuracy in determining the mean zzso We also show results from milk, zzso and blood zzso Performing these zzso on a portable device presents opportunities for zzso of food quality, process monitoring, and medical zzso
