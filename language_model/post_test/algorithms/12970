zzso peripheral zzso zzso have become important in vision zzso These zzso are influenced by the shape and position of the peripherally observed entrance zzso A long-held assumption is that its apparent shape is elliptical and is zzso centered in its zzso Our three-dimensional model shows that as viewing angle increases, the entrance zzso moves forward, tilts and zzso towards the zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso size zzso and exhibits zzso zzso zzso its shape is zzso and its geometric zzso departs from the optical zzso These findings may have implications on the accuracy of peripheral zzso zzso
