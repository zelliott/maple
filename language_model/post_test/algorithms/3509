When fuzzy production rules are used to approximate reasoning, interaction exists among rules that have the same zzso Due to this interaction, the weighted average model frequently used in approximate reasoning does not work well in many real-world zzso In order to model and handle this interaction, this paper proposes to use a zzso zzso set function to replace the weights assigned to rules having the same zzso and to draw the reasoning conclusion based on an integral with respect to the zzso zzso set function, rather than on the weighted average zzso zzso interaction in fuzzy production rule reasoning in this way can lead to a good understanding of the rules base and an improvement of reasoning zzso This paper also investigates how to determine from data the zzso set function that cannot be specified by a domain zzso
