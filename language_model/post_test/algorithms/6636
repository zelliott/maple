In the treatment of zzso zzso zzso zzso supplementary zzso zzso dissection zzso is not well zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the significance of the cervical compartments in the zzso spread of zzso and the impact of modified radical neck dissection zzso as an additional surgical procedure to zzso zzso From 1999 to 2002, zzso of the central compartment zzso zzso was performed in 39 zzso Among this group, additional zzso of the zzso compartment zzso zzso and the zzso compartment zzso zzso was performed in 29 and 15 patients respectively, who met the selection zzso The mean number of zzso zzso was 11 zzso in compartment A, 23 zzso in compartment B, and 22 zzso in compartment zzso zzso findings revealed zzso invasion of compartment A in 25 patients zzso of A and B in 20 patients zzso and of A, B, and C in 13 patients zzso From the 25 patients with zzso in compartment A, zzso (20 zzso already had zzso in compartment B and zzso (13 zzso had zzso in all three zzso All patients free of zzso zzso in compartment A were also zzso free in both lateral zzso zzso zzso scanning zzso in zzso patients showed no zzso at zzso zzso of the cervical anatomy in compartments seems to be a useful zzso for clarifying the zzso spread of zzso Patients having zzso without zzso in compartment A are almost certainly disease free at the time of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the central compartment appears to be a valuable indicator of zzso invasion of the lateral compartment and a strong indication for performance of a unilateral or bilateral zzso to complete the surgical removal of zzso
