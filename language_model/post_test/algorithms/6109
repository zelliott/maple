The transmission of zzso images over wireless channels is examined using reorganization of the compressed images into zzso zzso zzso The zzso consists of zzso and zzso codes which are zzso using an zzso zzso The generation of the stream to be transmitted is performed directly using compressed zzso zzso The resulting scheme is tested for the transmission of compressed zzso images over wireless channels and is shown to outperform other zzso which were recently proposed for the wireless transmission of zzso
