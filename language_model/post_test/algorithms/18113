We try to zzso the zzso formation in a zzso zzso zzso The system under study consists of soft sphere magnetic zzso particles confined to a thin fluid zzso The positions of the particles are constrained to a zzso zzso whereas the particle magnetic zzso moments are not fixed to the body systems, and are free to rotate in 3 dimensions, hence forming in what we call a zzso zzso Using a combination of zzso density functional theory and molecular dynamics zzso simulations, we find that for the studied range of parameters the majority of zzso might be divided into two zzso chains and zzso Their sizes and area zzso are strongly influenced by the geometrical zzso We show that for zzso systems the excluded area effects play one of the most important parts in the zzso zzso The simulation technique and the theoretical model put forward in the present paper agree zzso with the results of recent in zzso observations of the zzso observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2006, 96, zzso
