We introduce the spectral analysis of zzso zzso a method for detecting and evaluating possible zzso in experimental data zzso zzso of arbitrary zzso zzso determines whether a given empirical distribution contains a periodic zzso We also propose a system of zzso mixture zzso to model a zzso consisting of a smooth background together with zzso at periodic zzso with each peak corresponding to a fixed number of zzso added zzso This mixture distribution model allows us to estimate the parameters of the data and to test the statistical significance of the estimated zzso The analysis is applied to the length distribution of zzso zzso
