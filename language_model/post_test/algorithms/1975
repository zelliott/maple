Noise and zzso are fundamental to biology because they derive from the nature of zzso zzso zzso motions of molecules translate into randomness in the sequence and timing of zzso which leads to zzso zzso zzso in zzso and protein levels even in zzso populations of genetically identical zzso This is a quantitative zzso that has important functional zzso including persistence in bacterial zzso challenged with zzso and zzso in the response of cancer cells to zzso In this chapter, we present the modeling of such zzso cellular behaviors using the zzso of jump zzso zzso whose probability zzso evolve according to the chemical master equation zzso We also discuss the techniques used to solve the zzso These include kinetic zzso Carlo simulations techniques such as the zzso simulation zzso zzso and method closure techniques such as the linear noise approximation zzso
