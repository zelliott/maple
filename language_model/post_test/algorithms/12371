zzso is one of the most disabling symptoms in patients with many movement disorders including Parkinson's disease zzso and essential zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso itself as a zzso fluctuation of the firing zzso We describe a frequency tracking method based on the extended Kalman zzso zzso to estimate the instantaneous zzso frequency zzso exhibited in zzso spike trains detected from neural zzso zzso results demonstrate that the zzso frequency tracker can estimate the zzso accurately, even though the signal of interest is not zzso and the noise is not zzso The zzso frequency tracker can obtain a zzso mean squared error zzso as low as zzso and performs much better than the conventional approach based on the zzso zzso
