zzso of the structural information in zzso images recorded on film or zzso camera requires a precise knowledge of the electron microscope parameters that affect image features such as zzso and zzso zzso must be determined in order to combine data from different images in a three-dimensional reconstruction and to accurately scale reconstructions for fitting with atomic resolution zzso A method is described for zzso the absolute zzso of an electron zzso of a zzso zzso using horse zzso zzso as a zzso zzso is a widely available protein complex of known structure that may be included with the zzso of interest and zzso under conditions identical to those used for imaging other biological specimens by zzso The sum of the structure factor zzso of images of zzso zzso particles shows three low resolution zzso to zzso that arise from the hollow ball structure of zzso zzso of peak positions of the experimental zzso with structure factor zzso of an atomic model of zzso determined by X-ray zzso provides a scale factor for zzso the absolute zzso of the zzso We compare the zzso estimate using zzso to that obtained with tobacco mosaic virus, another common zzso standard for zzso We verify the precision of the method by acquiring images with a systematic variation of zzso
