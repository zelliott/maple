This work was designed to identify the maximum time zzso of image acquisition by zzso for monitoring the zzso of a dosage form such as a zzso zzso statistical parameters to describe this process were zzso including a statistical procedure for group comparisons of such zzso zzso was employed in seven healthy male volunteers, who swallowed a light and a dense zzso each 12 zzso in diameter, formulated to contain different zzso to allow zzso Images were taken zzso at zzso intervals to provide images of each tablet in zzso spacing until zzso of both zzso was zzso In selecting images, it was also possible to simulate image acquisition intervals of 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 zzso The values derived are discrete random zzso The maximum time zzso between image acquisitions that permitted reliable results to be obtained was found to be 3 zzso for light and 2 zzso for dense zzso Consideration of the zzso of a tablet as a zzso random event provided a suitable statistical approach to the analysis of such data, giving a median and an zzso zzso While the commonly applied method, which is based on zzso procedures zzso zzso means and standard zzso failed to detect a difference in the zzso times of the two types of zzso the use of zzso statistics zzso zzso provided a clear distinction between them in this zzso The assessment of gastric zzso by zzso studies can be improved by using short image intervals and application of appropriate statistical zzso
