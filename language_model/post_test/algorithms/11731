An electronic nose zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an array of zzso zzso carbon black composite sensors has been used to identify six species of bacteria responsible for eye infections when present at a range of zzso in saline zzso Readings were taken from the zzso of the samples by manually introducing the portable zzso system into a sterile glass containing a fixed volume of bacteria in zzso zzso data were a very complex mixture of different chemical zzso 

Linear Principal zzso Analysis zzso method was able to zzso four classes of bacteria out of six classes though in reality other two classes were not better evident from zzso analysis and we got zzso zzso accuracy from zzso An innovative data zzso approach was investigated for these bacteria data by combining the zzso scatter plot, zzso C Means zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using these three data zzso zzso simultaneously better zzso of six eye bacteria classes were zzso Then three supervised zzso namely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso network zzso and zzso basis function network zzso were used to zzso the six bacteria zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso zzso network gave zzso accuracy for bacteria zzso which was best zzso A comparative evaluation of the zzso was conducted for this zzso The best results suggest that we are able to predict six classes of bacteria with up to zzso accuracy with the application of the zzso zzso 

This type of bacteria data analysis and feature extraction is very zzso But we can conclude that this combined use of three zzso methods can solve the feature extraction problem with very complex data and enhance the performance of zzso zzso
