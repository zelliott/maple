zzso microbial zzso that can mimic natural systems have the potential to become a powerful biotechnology for various zzso One highly desirable feature of these zzso is that they can be precisely zzso In this work we designed a zzso symbiotic circuit that enables continuous tuning of the growth rate and composition of a synthetic zzso We implemented our general design through the zzso of zzso and zzso by two zzso coli zzso By regulating the expression of genes related to the export or production of these zzso zzso we were able to tune the zzso exchanges and achieve a wide range of growth rates and strain zzso In addition, by zzso the relationship of zzso zzso zzso zzso we were able to zzso the zzso for zzso attributes with the proper addition of inducing zzso This zzso zzso circuit or its zzso can be applied to more complex systems where precise tuning of the consortium would facilitate the zzso of specific zzso such as increasing the overall efficiency of microbial production of zzso or zzso
