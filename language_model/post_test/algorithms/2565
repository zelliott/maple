zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso and zzso zzso has been proposed to be a potential target in the treatment of zzso Based on the crystal structures of this zzso molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the zzso changes of zzso induced by zzso zzso The results show that the presence of zzso in the binding domain restricts the motions and zzso zzso of zzso There are two zzso zzso zzso and zzso playing important roles for the binding of zzso while another loop zzso zzso is responsible for the binding of zzso The zzso and twisting motions of two zzso are closely related to the zzso changes of zzso induced by zzso
