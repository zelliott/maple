In this paper we present a general strategy designed to study the occurrence frequency zzso of zzso in DNA coding segments and to deal with the problem of detecting possible patterns of zzso compositional zzso and zzso zzso specific tendencies or peculiar zzso in the zzso of the effective occurrence zzso of zzso with respect to what can be a zzso expected, is of the greatest importance in zzso zzso between expected and actual zzso may in fact suggest or confirm the existence of specific biological mechanisms related to zzso Similarly, a marked zzso in the occurrence frequency of an zzso may suggest that it belongs to the class of so-called zzso signal zzso zzso The approach we have elaborated is innovative in various zzso zzso the analysis of the zzso data is carried out in the light of the observation that the distribution of the four zzso along the coding regions of the zzso is biased by the existence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso numbers found by counting the zzso of the various zzso sequences are appropriately corrected for the many kinds of mistakes and redundancies present in the available genetic Data zzso A zzso significant further improvement of our approach over the existing searching strategies is represented by the fact that, in order to decide whether or not the zzso zzso value of the occurrence frequency of a given zzso is within statistical expectations, a measure of the strength of the selective pressure, having acted on it in the course of the evolution, is assigned to the zzso in a way that takes into account both the value of the zzso occurrence frequency of the sequence and the magnitude of the probability that this number might be the result of statistical zzso If the strength of the selective pressure evaluated in this fashion turns out to be sufficiently large, the corresponding sequence will be considered to have an occurrence frequency beyond expectations and, zzso to be statistically and biologically zzso
