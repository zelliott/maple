Recent experiments have shown that zzso zzso can provide robust control signals for a zzso interface zzso Strategies that attempt to adapt a zzso control zzso by learning from past trials often assume that the subject is attending to each training zzso Likewise, automatic disabling of movement control would be desirable during resting periods when random brain fluctuations might cause unintended movements of a zzso To this end, our goal was to identify zzso differences that arise between periods of active zzso use and zzso 

We examined spectral differences in zzso zzso zzso signals recorded from zzso primates when rest periods were zzso between blocks of an active zzso control zzso 

zzso analyses demonstrated that these states can be zzso accurately on both a zzso and real-time basis, and this zzso remains robust over a period of zzso In addition, high gamma zzso showed greater zzso with desired movement direction, while lower frequency components demonstrated greater zzso differences between task and rest zzso suggesting possible specialized zzso roles for these zzso 

The results presented here provide valuable insight into the zzso of zzso control as well as important considerations toward the design of an zzso zzso zzso
