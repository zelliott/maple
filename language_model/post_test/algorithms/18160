zzso flow zzso is naturally dependent on feature zzso To extract flow features, often zzso properties of the flow data are used such as the zzso or zzso properties, implicitly describing the flow features in terms of their inherent flow characteristics zzso zzso flow and zzso zzso In this paper we present recent research which leads to the (not really zzso conclusion that feature extraction zzso need to be extended to a zzso analysis framework (in terms of time zzso when dealing with unsteady flow zzso zzso we present two extensions of the parallel zzso based vortex extraction criteria to the zzso domain and show the improvements of zzso flow zzso in comparison to the steady versions of this extraction zzso both in the context of a high-resolution zzso zzso a simulation specifically designed to evaluate our new approach, as well as for a real-world zzso from a concrete zzso
