The utility of quantitative zzso zzso zzso in clinical routine for diagnosing zzso pneumonia zzso in zzso zzso patients is zzso We zzso zzso zzso fluid with real-time quantitative zzso zzso zzso in 71 cases with definitive zzso defined by positive zzso zzso tests and in zzso randomly selected patients with acute lung zzso In those patients, possible zzso cases were identified by using a novel zzso zzso probability zzso and chart zzso zzso performance was compared with IF testing, clinical judgment and the zzso probability zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values zzso zzso had a positive zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso for diagnosing definitive zzso zzso values of between 1 and 1,450 zzso were associated with both zzso and zzso thus, a zzso between the two conditions could not be identified and diagnosis of zzso in this setting relied on IF and clinical zzso Clinical zzso could be ruled out in zzso of 153 patients with negative zzso zzso zzso zzso is useful for diagnosing zzso and is complementary to zzso zzso values of zzso zzso allow reliable diagnosis, whereas negative zzso results virtually exclude zzso Intermediate values require additional clinical assessment and IF zzso On the basis of our data and for economic and logistical limitations, we propose a clinical zzso in which IF remains the preferred first test in most cases, followed by zzso in those patients with a negative IF and strong clinical suspicion for zzso
