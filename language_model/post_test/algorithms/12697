The rapidly increasing set of zzso zzso highlights the importance of identifying the zzso blocks in multiple and/or highly duplicated zzso Most zzso block reconstruction zzso use genes shared over all zzso to construct the zzso blocks for multiple zzso However, the number of genes shared among all zzso quickly decreases with the increase in the number of zzso 

We propose the zzso and zzso In Multiple zzso zzso zzso to address this bottleneck and apply it to analyzing zzso zzso of zzso plant and zzso zzso We further combine zzso block generation with zzso analysis to reconstruct the ancestral zzso zzso zzso
