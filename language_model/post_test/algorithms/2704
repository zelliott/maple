The development of a totally subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso system requires a new approach for zzso zzso To evaluate zzso discrimination of one such system, the zzso versus zzso zzso zzso Testing zzso study was designed as a zzso zzso trial comparing simulated sensing performances of the zzso system with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

At zzso zzso induced zzso and zzso zzso were recorded simultaneously in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso superior zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Recorded signals of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 50) with zzso rates zzso zzso from 64 patients were used to compare detection performance of the zzso system with zzso systems from 3 zzso zzso detection of zzso zzso was assessed with devices programmed in zzso zzso zzso 170 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 240 zzso zzso zzso zzso 170 zzso zzso specificity performance for zzso zzso was compared to zzso and zzso devices in a zzso zzso 

zzso detection of zzso zzso for subcutaneous and TV devices in zzso and zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso was significantly better for the zzso system compared to 2 of 3 TV systems, as well as the composite of TV devices zzso vs zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso detection is excellent for all zzso systems zzso however, specificity of zzso zzso discrimination by the zzso system is better than discrimination by 2 of 3 TV zzso
