zzso machine learning and soft computing techniques has provided many opportunities for researchers to establish new zzso methods in different areas of zzso The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of two types of intelligent learning methods, artificial neural networks and zzso systems, in order to estimate breeding values zzso of Iranian dairy zzso Initially, the breeding values of zzso zzso cows for milk and fat yield were estimated using conventional best linear unbiased prediction zzso with an animal zzso Once that was established, a zzso zzso was used to build ANN to predict breeding values from the performance data of selection zzso zzso fuzzy logic was used to form an zzso a hybrid intelligent system that was implemented via a local linear model tree zzso For milk yield the correlations between zzso and zzso predicted by the ANN and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso correlations for fat yield were zzso and zzso zzso zzso between zzso predictions of zzso for milk and fat yield when predicted simultaneously by ANN were zzso and zzso respectively, whereas corresponding correlations with reference zzso for zzso zzso were zzso and zzso respectively, for milk and fat zzso
