It is shown that the use of an zzso embedding with a kinetic energy operator expressed in zzso internal coordinates becomes feasible and straightforward to implement for arbitrary molecular compositions and internal coordinates if the operator is defined zzso over a zzso variable zzso zzso The zzso proposed zzso the transformation method of zzso and zzso to maintain the zzso zzso zzso In order to demonstrate the zzso and flexibility of our approach the zzso zzso zzso is considered and the corresponding zzso energy levels and wave functions are zzso using kinetic energy operators with three different zzso Two of them fulfill the zzso conditions corresponding to a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso reference structure and the third one is a zzso zzso The zzso energy levels are, of course, zzso and the structure of the three different zzso representations are analyzed in terms of the rigid zzso functions for a zzso zzso The possible advantages of one frame representation over another are discussed concerning the interpretation of the zzso states in terms of the traditional rigid zzso zzso
