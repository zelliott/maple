Fluorescence correlation zzso zzso is an increasingly important tool for determining low zzso and dynamics of molecules in zzso zzso zzso transitions give rise to fast blinking effects, which are accounted for by including an exponential term in the fitting of the zzso function zzso In such cases, zzso zzso effects also modify the zzso and shape of the remaining parts of the zzso We review studies of zzso and zzso effects in zzso and present a simple procedure to obtain more accurate results of particle zzso and zzso dynamics in experiments where zzso zzso are zzso or where moderate laser powers approaching zzso levels are used, for example, to acquire sufficient zzso numbers when observation times are zzso The procedure involves use of a modified function for zzso the zzso but there are no additional fitting zzso Instead, a simple zzso of the total zzso count rate as a function of relative laser power is fit to a zzso and the zzso components of this fit, together with the relative laser power used for the zzso zzso are used to specify the magnitude of additional terms in the fitting zzso zzso Carlo simulations and experiments using Alexa zzso and quantum dots, with continuous and zzso laser zzso demonstrate the application of the modified fitting procedure with first order correction terms, in the regime where zzso in the zzso due to zzso and detector dead time are small compared to those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
