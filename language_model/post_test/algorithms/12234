This paper proposes a joint maximum likelihood and zzso methodology for zzso zzso mixture zzso In zzso zzso the zzso of parameters are zzso characterized by zzso In the case of zzso zzso the zzso of parameters are considered as zzso for the mean, zzso for the zzso and zzso for the mixing zzso The learning task consists of zzso the zzso characterizing these zzso The integration in the zzso space is zzso using an zzso zzso methodology entitled zzso zzso zzso This paper introduces a zzso zzso procedure for the training zzso In the first stage, zzso of parameters resulting from successive runs of the zzso zzso are zzso Afterward, zzso zzso are applied to find appropriate initial values for the zzso The proposed zzso provides faster zzso more accurate zzso estimates, and better zzso for the zzso training zzso The proposed methodology is applied in blind signal detection and in color image zzso
