zzso zzso channels zzso play an essential role in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso We previously found that zzso zzso zzso current density was zzso by the zzso of protein zzso zzso and/or zzso whereas surface zzso zzso zzso current density was increased by the zzso of zzso and/or zzso activity in failing zzso zzso of mice chronically treated with zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we examined the possible involvement of zzso zzso G proteins zzso in these abnormalities by chronically zzso zzso toxin zzso to zzso mice zzso + zzso zzso Compared with zzso mice, zzso + zzso mice exhibited significantly higher fractional zzso of the left zzso The expression level of zzso proteins was not altered by the treatment of mice with zzso and/or zzso zzso + zzso zzso had normal zzso and SS zzso current zzso because they had higher and lower availability and/or open probability of zzso and SS zzso than zzso zzso zzso A selective zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso current zzso in zzso + zzso zzso A selective zzso zzso zzso did not affect SS or zzso current density in control or zzso + zzso zzso but significantly increased zzso but not SS zzso current density in zzso zzso These results indicate that chronic zzso zzso of zzso in zzso decreases zzso zzso zzso activity by zzso zzso and increases zzso SS zzso activity by zzso zzso without modulating zzso in heart zzso
