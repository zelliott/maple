Relative zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are important parameters in the study of dental zzso but current methods of measuring these zzso are time consuming and prone to zzso We investigate the use of zzso zzso for measuring relative zzso of these two bacterial species in solid zzso To our knowledge, this is the first time zzso zzso has been used to analyze bacterial zzso rather than to identify the species of a pure zzso zzso of the two zzso species in various ratios are measured for 200 s using a zzso zzso zzso zzso correlations with bacterial content were identified via partial zzso zzso The relative zzso of zzso zzso in subsequent samples are predicted with a root mean squared error below zzso In clinical plaque samples, this sort of accuracy would enable discrimination between normal and dangerously elevated levels of zzso zzso zzso with and without zzso proteins are predicted with equal zzso This result shows the potential of zzso zzso for analyzing mixed populations of bacteria, such as those that occur in oral zzso
