The ability of zzso zzso to zzso the zzso zzso was zzso Two zzso series, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso alcohols zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used at zzso 3 critical zzso concentration zzso and 6 zzso The rate of zzso of a sufficient quantity of zzso (for zzso in zzso solution containing the zzso of zzso zzso was zzso The experimental data were fitted to a zzso kinetic zzso The rate constant, zzso concentration and enhancement factor were estimated for each zzso zzso The effect of zzso structure, zzso zzso zzso structure and its zzso properties on the effectiveness of zzso was zzso In terms of zzso zzso the zzso zzso of each zzso series can be ranked as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The more zzso zzso series was proved more efficient in zzso zzso than zzso zzso The enhancement factor values ranged from zzso to zzso at 3 zzso and zzso to zzso at 6 zzso The results will be used mainly for zzso zzso since the extent of zzso is a critical zzso
