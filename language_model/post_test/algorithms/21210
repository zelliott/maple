Recent studies have extensively examined the large-scale genetic zzso in the human zzso known as zzso variations zzso and the zzso of zzso in normal individuals, along with their functional importance, has been increasingly zzso However, the absence of a method to accurately zzso zzso or zzso within a zzso region from zzso experimental data zzso the finer analyses of zzso properties and applications to zzso zzso Here we developed an zzso to zzso complex zzso within a zzso region by using data obtained from zzso experimental zzso We applied this zzso to experimental data and estimated the population zzso of zzso that can yield information on both sequences and numbers of DNA zzso These results suggested that the analysis of such complex zzso is essential for accurately detecting genetic differences within a zzso region between population zzso
