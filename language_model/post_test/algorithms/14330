Cancer is, at the cellular level, a genetic disease and acquired gene zzso play a zzso role in the initiation of the zzso process either by zzso zzso or creating hybrid zzso We constructed a network by combining the zzso and 3' parts of all presently known gene zzso in human zzso and here we show that the observed network is fragmented and that the organization of the genes demonstrates a zzso network zzso with a power law degree distribution meeting the requirements of zzso approximately zzso that is, zzso to the zzso found in naturally occurring networks such as the Internet and social or ecological zzso The results hence indicate that the complex system of zzso interacting genes leading to zzso is governed by a universal zzso
