zzso is a zzso zzso with activity against a wide range of zzso zzso We used the zzso zzso thigh model to characterize the zzso of zzso zzso mice were rendered zzso with zzso and the thigh muscles of the mice were infected with strains of zzso zzso zzso pneumoniae, and zzso zzso Animals were treated by subcutaneous injection of zzso at doses of zzso to 400 zzso of body zzso divided into one, two, four, or eight doses over 24 zzso zzso exhibited linear zzso with an area under the zzso curve zzso from time zero to zzso of zzso and a zzso of zzso to zzso zzso The level of protein binding was zzso Free zzso exhibited zzso killing and produced in zzso zzso effects zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to determine which zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso was important for efficacy by using free drug zzso The peak zzso zzso ratio and zzso zzso ratio were the zzso and zzso parameters that best correlated with in zzso efficacy zzso zzso 83 to zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the zzso ratio, whereas zzso zzso 47 to 50% for the time that the concentration was greater than the zzso against standard strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso ratios required for a zzso effect ranged from 12 to 36 for zzso pneumoniae, 59 to 94 for zzso zzso and zzso to zzso for zzso zzso The zzso ratios needed for a zzso effect ranged from 75 to 237 for zzso pneumoniae, 388 to zzso for zzso zzso and zzso to zzso for zzso zzso The free zzso zzso needed to average from one to two times the zzso over 24 h to produce a zzso effect and two to four times the zzso over 24 h to produce greater than zzso zzso The long zzso and potent zzso activity make zzso an attractive option for the treatment of infections caused by zzso zzso
