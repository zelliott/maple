The objective of the present study was to zzso and use a bovine liver complementary DNA zzso zzso to profile zzso gene expressions in the liver of cow throughout zzso A zzso library was prepared from liver total zzso collected from cows during zzso cycle and pregnancy, and from fetuses at different stages of zzso The zzso clones were compiled and zzso by basic local alignment search tool zzso and spotted onto glass zzso The zzso liver array represented zzso zzso Of which, zzso were known genes while zzso sequences had matches with sequences found in expressed sequence tags zzso In addition, zzso unknown sequences were found and these sequences may possibly be identified as candidates for novel bovine zzso For gene expression profiling studies, total zzso from zzso of cows slaughtered on days 19, zzso zzso zzso and 245 of pregnancy zzso zzso was separately reverse transcribed and labeled with either zzso zzso dye zzso or zzso The test samples were individually compared with liver total zzso collected from zzso cycling cows zzso zzso after reverse zzso and labeling with the opposite dye following a zzso zzso zzso After zzso image zzso and zzso genes that showed either more than zzso zzso induction or repression were selected for further zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a clear induction of most liver genes on days zzso of zzso zzso maps zzso identified groups of genes whose differential expression patterns were similar across zzso In conclusion, we described fabrication of a bovine liver zzso zzso and zzso for the first time, differential expression patterns of a large number of zzso liver genes in parallel throughout pregnancy in the zzso
