Psychological theories of memory zzso that when people recall a past event, they not only recover the features of the event itself, but also recover information associated with other events that occurred nearby in zzso The events surrounding a target event, and the thoughts they evoke, may be considered to represent a context for the target event, helping to distinguish that event from similar events experienced at different zzso The ability to reinstate this contextual information during memory search has been considered a hallmark of zzso or zzso zzso We sought to determine whether context zzso may be observed in electrical signals recorded from the human brain during episodic zzso zzso zzso recordings taken as 69 zzso patients studied and recalled lists of words, we uncovered a neural signature of context zzso Upon recalling a studied item, we found that the recorded patterns of brain activity were not only similar to the patterns observed when the item was zzso but were also similar to the patterns observed during study of neighboring list items, with similarity decreasing reliably with zzso zzso The degree to which individual patients displayed this neural signature of context zzso was correlated with their tendency to recall neighboring list items zzso These effects were particularly strong in zzso lobe zzso Our findings show that recalling a past event evokes a neural signature of the zzso context in which the event occurred, thus pointing to a neural basis for episodic zzso
