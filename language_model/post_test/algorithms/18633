We present a simple statistical zzso model for budding of viral zzso at the cell zzso The membrane is modeled as a flexible zzso zzso embedding zzso zzso zzso which serve to anchor and thus wrap the membrane around the viral zzso The free energy of a single bud is expressed as a sum of the zzso energy of its membrane coat, the zzso zzso zzso energy, and the line energy associated with the zzso zzso all depending on the extent of wrapping zzso bud zzso and density of spikes in the curved zzso This zzso is incorporated into a simple free energy functional for the zzso system, allowing for different spike zzso and hence zzso in the curved zzso and zzso membrane regions, as well as for the zzso zzso of the zzso bud zzso The equilibrium spike zzso in the zzso curved and zzso membrane regions are calculated as a function of the membrane zzso energy and the zzso zzso energy, for different spike and zzso zzso in the membrane plane, as well as for several values of the zzso rim zzso We show that complete budding (full wrapping of zzso can only take place if the zzso energy exceeds a certain, critical, zzso free zzso Whenever budding takes place, the spike density in the mature zzso is zzso zzso all spike zzso sites are zzso The rim energy plays an important role in determining the size distribution of zzso The fraction of fully wrapped buds increases as this energy increases, resulting eventually in an all-or-nothing zzso zzso zzso at the plasma membrane are either fully enveloped or completely naked (just touching the zzso We also find that at low zzso all zzso arriving at the membrane get tightly and fully zzso Beyond a certain zzso corresponding approximately to a zzso zzso ratio, newly arriving zzso cannot be fully zzso zzso the budding yield zzso
