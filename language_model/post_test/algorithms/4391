The nearest zzso zzso zzso method has been successfully applied in many zzso zzso zzso The zzso uses zzso zzso as prototypes for each class and identifies zzso of genes that best characterize each zzso zzso is then made to the nearest zzso zzso The zzso is very easy to implement and very easy to zzso however, it has zzso 

We show that the zzso method can be interpreted in the framework of zzso zzso Based on that, we consider two new methods, zzso zzso penalized zzso zzso and zzso zzso penalized zzso zzso with two different penalty functions for zzso zzso which improve over the zzso Unlike the zzso penalty used in zzso the penalty terms that we consider make use of the fact that parameters belonging to one gene should be treated as a natural zzso zzso results indicate that the two new methods tend to remove irrelevant genes more effectively and provide better zzso results than the zzso zzso 

R code for the zzso and the zzso zzso are available from authors upon zzso
