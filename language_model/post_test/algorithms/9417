Analysis of zzso or zzso zzso is of particular importance for revealing the molecular mechanisms of complex human zzso Multiple zzso each of which has a moderate effect, might interact and produce a complex zzso zzso In this paper, we present a novel method of zzso analysis, utilizing multiple zzso zzso residing in different zzso zzso zzso models can then be derived from the zzso to indicate the zzso of a person to a zzso zzso zzso The simulation results showed that the prediction accuracy of this method is dependent on the zzso rate of the underlying zzso The zzso cost, on the other hand, is dependent on the number of zzso regions involved for the complex zzso zzso
