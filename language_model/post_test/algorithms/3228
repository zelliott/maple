To investigate the potential application of contrast zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso as compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for characterization of focal liver zzso 

Institutional review board approval and informed patient consent were zzso One hundred zzso patients with focal liver zzso zzso zzso zzso 33 zzso 23 zzso and six focal zzso zzso zzso were examined at zzso US enhanced with a zzso zzso contrast agent and at zzso zzso zzso CT were zzso zzso Two readers blindly reviewed the zzso images and zzso reconstructed with both zzso and classified the depicted zzso according to diagnostic criteria based on their experience and published zzso zzso zzso positive zzso value zzso area under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso zzso agreement, and zzso agreement were zzso 

Readers 1 and 2 had zzso US and CT findings for 115 zzso and 116 zzso of the 139 zzso respectively, with moderate to excellent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There were no significant differences between the two zzso zzso was zzso or greater with both zzso specificity was zzso or greater with zzso US and zzso or greater with zzso CT, the zzso was zzso or greater with both zzso and the zzso was at least zzso with US and at least zzso with zzso zzso agreement was good to excellent zzso zzso or zzso zzso with both zzso 

zzso zzso US potentially can be used to characterize focal liver zzso
