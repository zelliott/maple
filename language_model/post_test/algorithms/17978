In the literature on zzso during working memory zzso the role of alpha power zzso zzso during zzso retention has remained zzso We recorded zzso while 18 subjects retained sets of consonants in memory for 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso determines memory zzso zzso power zzso zzso increased with workload in all subjects in middle frontal zzso Using zzso the increase in zzso could be attributed to one component whose generators were localized by zzso in the zzso frontal zzso Alpha power in zzso zzso zzso showed a mean increase during retention as compared to zzso fixation zzso zzso zzso On an individual basis, alpha power increased with workload in 9 subjects zzso zzso and decreased in 9 subjects zzso zzso The alpha increased in upper alpha for the zzso group zzso zzso zzso and decreased in lower alpha for the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso representations show high alpha power early during retention for the zzso group and high alpha power late during retention for the zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso contrast for the zzso group in the zzso and for the zzso group in the zzso In subjects with zzso alpha increase in the zzso may reflect zzso maintenance or active zzso of zzso zzso In subjects with zzso alpha decrease in the zzso may reflect release of zzso associated with zzso zzso Thus, alpha zzso characterizes two aspects of processing in the same zzso zzso
