A simple, zzso zzso method is developed to detect respiratory zzso in relationship to swallows without the direct measurement of zzso In 21 healthy subjects zzso zzso breath sounds are recorded at the trachea and at five different recording locations at the chest wall, with simultaneous recording of zzso by a zzso The chest signal with the greatest zzso power difference zzso zzso is either in the zzso line in the second zzso on the left or third zzso on the zzso Using the zzso zzso on the chest wall and the zzso zzso a phase detection zzso is developed and achieves zzso accuracy in the zzso of respiratory zzso without using the measured zzso zzso Thus, zzso monitoring breaths and swallows holds promise as a zzso and reliable assessment tool in the study of swallowing zzso
