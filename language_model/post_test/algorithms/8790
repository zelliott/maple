We propose a navigation system for zzso zzso valve zzso that employs a magnetic tracking system zzso along with a dynamic zzso model and zzso ultrasound zzso zzso This work is motivated by the desire of our zzso and cardiac surgical colleagues to minimize or eliminate the use of radiation in the zzso suite or operating zzso The dynamic 3-D zzso model is constructed from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that is animated in zzso with the real time zzso input of patient, and then zzso planning is performed to determine the target position of the zzso valve zzso The contours of the zzso root are extracted automatically from short axis US images in real-time for registering the zzso zzso US image to the zzso dynamic zzso zzso The zzso zzso guides the zzso during positioning and deployment of the zzso valve zzso to the zzso The results of the zzso root zzso zzso demonstrate an error of zzso zzso with a zzso time of zzso zzso The navigation approach was validated in zzso studies, yielding zzso zzso zzso target registration zzso deployment distance, and tilting errors of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso , zzso
