The zzso process has been proposed as a model for the spontaneous activity of a zzso In this model, the firing of the zzso zzso to the first passage of the process to a constant boundary, or zzso While the zzso transform of the zzso time distribution is available, the probability distribution function has not been obtained in any zzso zzso We address the problem of zzso the parameters of the process when the only available data from a zzso are the zzso zzso or the times between zzso In particular, we give an zzso for computing maximum likelihood estimates and their corresponding confidence regions for the three identifiable (of the five zzso parameters by zzso zzso the zzso zzso A comparison of the zzso zzso (where the time constant zzso is known a zzso to the zzso zzso shows that significantly more data is required in the latter case to achieve comparable zzso resolution as measured by zzso confidence intervals zzso The zzso methods described here are a efficient alternative to other well known zzso techniques for leaky zzso zzso Moreover, it could serve as a template for performing zzso zzso on more complex zzso zzso zzso
