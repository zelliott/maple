zzso of zzso parameters is typically done using an intravenous injection of contrast zzso This purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of measuring regional and global zzso using zzso CT with zzso injections of contrast zzso 

Twelve zzso were zzso zzso measurement was performed using standard zzso and then using zzso CT with IV and zzso zzso zzso obtained using zzso CT were compared with those using zzso 

zzso CT zzso maps using zzso injections required less contrast than ones with IV zzso zzso and zzso CT using IV and AA injections provided comparable zzso In controls, zzso CT with a zzso or VA injection provided comparable maps to zzso In animals with a stroke, a zzso or VA injection did not provide maps comparable to ones made with zzso IV and AA zzso CT showed excellent quantitative agreement with zzso while zzso and VA zzso CT studies did zzso 

zzso of global zzso using zzso CT in conjunction with either an IV or an AA injection was feasible in controls and dogs with a zzso zzso of regional zzso with zzso CT using either zzso or VA injection, in normal zzso provided zzso maps zzso comparable with those obtained with zzso the absolute zzso values from these maps were in poor agreement with zzso zzso zzso measurement of zzso using zzso CT requires all tissue in a target region to be fully and equally zzso during any zzso Using zzso or VA injections, it was impossible to document if and when this had been zzso zzso zzso using these routes of injection were therefore not zzso
