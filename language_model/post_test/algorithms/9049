The purpose of this study is to report the significant differences found in the identification of zzso in cervical spinal zzso of two patients with multiple sclerosis when using the zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences as opposed to the conventional zzso and zzso sequences for zzso acquisition at zzso In both patients, one more zzso was identified with the zzso sequences than with the conventional zzso zzso we suggest the use of zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences in place of conventional ones for zzso examination of the cervical spinal zzso of multiple sclerosis zzso The advantages of zzso to reveal the pathology of the cervical spinal zzso and the advantage of zzso sequences to improve image quality should be combined in a sequence that could be ideal for cervical spinal zzso zzso
