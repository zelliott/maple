To evaluate the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso System zzso zzso a zzso zzso portable monitoring device for the evaluation of sleep zzso breathing zzso 

Prospective study with blinded zzso 

Sleep disorder center, academic zzso 

Eighty patients with suspected zzso sleep zzso zzso syndrome zzso and 22 zzso 

zzso 

zzso used the zzso zzso at home for 2 nights using only written zzso Within 2 weeks, they returned to the laboratory for full nocturnal zzso zzso with simultaneous monitoring with the zzso zzso were scored manually to obtain an zzso index based on Medicare guidelines zzso and a respiratory zzso index zzso zzso studies were zzso and reviewed to obtain zzso based on equivalent definitions zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso index zzso zzso from the zzso were compared to the zzso zzso and in-home zzso zzso using mean differences and the zzso correlations zzso For the zzso comparison, there was high zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 96, mean difference zzso zzso and zzso ) and zzso zzso zzso mean difference zzso zzso For zzso versus zzso zzso comparison, there was good zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso mean difference zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso mean difference zzso zzso The diagnostic sensitivity of zzso zzso for diagnosing zzso using an zzso zzso of 15 per hour was zzso and specificity was zzso with a positive likelihood ratio zzso zzso and negative likelihood ratio zzso zzso zzso For in-home zzso data the sensitivity was zzso and specificity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was good agreement between the manually scored zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso provides zzso accurate estimates of zzso zzso compared to conventional laboratory zzso for both the simultaneous and in-home zzso zzso The high sensitivity, zzso and positive and negative likelihood ratios obtained in the group we studied supports the utility of an ambulatory zzso approach not only for diagnosing sleep zzso breathing but also to rule out zzso in suitably selected zzso
