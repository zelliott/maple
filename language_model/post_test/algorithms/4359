The use of zzso zzso for the analysis and characterization of dissolved organic matter zzso has gained widespread interest over the past decade, in part because of its ease of use and ability to provide bulk zzso chemical zzso However, the lack of standard approaches for analysis and data evaluation has complicated its zzso This study zzso comparative statistics to systematically evaluate commonly used zzso metrics for zzso characterization to provide insight into the implications for data analysis and interpretation such as peak picking methods, zzso metrics and the zzso index zzso The uncertainty associated with peak picking methods was zzso including the reporting of peak intensity and peak zzso The linear relationship between zzso intensity and dissolved organic carbon zzso concentration was found to zzso from zzso at environmentally relevant zzso and simultaneously across all peak zzso Comparative analysis suggests that the loss of zzso is composition specific and likely due to zzso zzso interactions of the zzso rather than the inner filter zzso For some zzso sources, Peak A deviated from zzso at optical zzso a factor of 2 higher than that of Peak zzso For zzso zzso zzso the error associated with zzso zzso significantly decreases the ability to distinguish compositional zzso An in-depth analysis of zzso determined that the metric is mostly driven by peak zzso wavelength and less by zzso zzso zzso This study also demonstrates that zzso intensity follows property balance principles, but the zzso index does zzso
