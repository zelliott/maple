zzso zzso is the major problem in the treatment by zzso zzso of the cork processing zzso This problem leads to drastic reduction on the zzso zzso and has been associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso The present work proposes a zzso integrated process for the treatment of these zzso A zzso study was carried out in zzso equipment with zzso The zzso and the particle size were monitored at different pH values and for different zzso zzso The results showed an increase of the zzso when zzso is added and a significant increase of the zzso particle size with the decrease of the zzso A zzso zzso study was performed with the zzso zzso The parameters varied were the operating pressure and the zzso zzso It was observed that for higher pressures and at a zzso ratio of zzso the zzso removal was zzso The zzso experiments were carried out in zzso cells of zzso zzso of membrane surface area at zzso pressures of 1-3 zzso A commercial membrane zzso and four cellulose zzso zzso with molecular weight zzso zzso ranging from zzso to 86 zzso were zzso The zzso zzso led to the enhancement of the zzso zzso zzso For the membrane with higher zzso the zzso flux enhancement reached zzso
