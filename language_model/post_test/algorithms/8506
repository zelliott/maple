zzso zzso expressions are presented for the properties of the zzso zzso model of zzso binding of large zzso to one-dimensional homogeneous zzso These properties include the zzso location and the slope at the middle point of the binding zzso zzso varies with zzso L zzso the location and magnitude of the zzso as well as the location of the inflection point, in the zzso plots zzso varies with v zzso
