zzso zzso zzso of the abdomen is an established, albeit expensive and perhaps zzso diagnostic zzso for the evaluation of the injured zzso We developed a practice management zzso for blunt abdominal trauma intended to reduce the percentage of negative CT scans, yet minimize delayed recognition of injury and zzso zzso 

between April 1996 and March 1997, zzso adult patients at risk for blunt abdominal injury were admitted to our Level I trauma zzso and underwent abdominal evaluation according to the practice management zzso 

abdominal CT was performed in 522 patients zzso and zzso scans were negative zzso Delayed recognition of injury and zzso zzso rates were low, zzso and zzso zzso 

abdominal CT scanning in trauma patients can achieve low zzso zzso and delayed recognition of injury rates but at the expense of high negative CT scan zzso Greater reliance on the physical examination and perhaps abdominal ultrasound may reduce negative CT scan rates and yet preserve low zzso zzso and delayed recognition of injury zzso
