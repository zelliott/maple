Advances in next-generation sequencing zzso technology has provided us with an opportunity to analyze and evaluate the rich microbial communities present in all natural zzso The shorter reads obtained from the zzso technology has paved the way for determining the zzso profile of a community by simply aligning the reads against the available reference zzso While several zzso methods are available for zzso profiling at the zzso and zzso none of these methods are effective at the zzso identification due to the increasing difficulty in detecting variation at that zzso Here, we present zzso an zzso zzso based approach that can accurately identify zzso at the strain level and estimate the abundance of each zzso in a sample, given a zzso sequencing zzso 

zzso is an zzso based method that zzso the profile of unique and common zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and assigns weights to each zzso using a scoring zzso This scoring function assigns higher zzso to the zzso that appear in fewer zzso and vice zzso thus, allows for effective use of both unique and common zzso for species zzso Our zzso zzso results on a simulated zzso show a remarkable accuracy of zzso at the zzso identification of the organisms in gut zzso We also demonstrated that our model shows impressive performance even by using only zzso or 50% of the zzso sequences for zzso In addition to identification of the species, our method can also estimate the relative abundance of each species in the simulated zzso zzso The generic approach employed in this method can be applied for accurate identification of a wide variety of microbial species zzso zzso and zzso present in any environmental zzso 

The proposed scoring function and approach is able to accurately identify and estimate the entire zzso in any zzso zzso The weights assigned to the common zzso by our scoring function are precisely zzso to match the reads up to the strain zzso Our multipronged validation tests demonstrate that zzso is sufficiently robust to accurately identify and estimate the abundance of each zzso in any natural environment even when using incomplete or partially zzso zzso
