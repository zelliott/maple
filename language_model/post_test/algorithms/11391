The camera zzso that are built into the current generation of mobile devices are extremely stressed by the excessively tight packaging requirements, particularly the zzso As a result, the zzso departures and slopes on the lens surfaces, when designed with conventional power series based zzso are well beyond those encountered in most optical zzso When the zzso performance is considered, the excessive zzso slopes result in unusually high sensitivity to tilt and zzso and even zzso resulting in unusually low manufacturing zzso zzso zzso a new zzso for zzso optical surfaces introduced by Forbes, not only build on zzso zzso but their unique zzso provides direct access to the zzso slope of the zzso departure during zzso Using surface shapes with this description in zzso results in equivalent performance with reduced alignment sensitivity and higher zzso As an additional approach to increasing yield, mechanically imposed external zzso points, introduced by zzso can be used as a design technique to further reduce alignment sensitivity and increase zzso In this paper, the zzso zzso and external zzso points were applied to a mobile device camera lens designed using an active zzso slope constraint that was then compared to a design developed using conventional power series surface zzso zzso show that slope constrained zzso zzso description together with external zzso points lead directly to solutions with significantly higher manufacturing zzso
