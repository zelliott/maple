The purpose of this study was to zzso evaluate zzso agreement on zzso detection and characterization in the review of automated ultrasound images of the breast by five zzso 

From August to October 2009, bilateral zzso ultrasound examinations were performed with an automated technique and with a handheld device for 55 women zzso scheduled to undergo diagnostic zzso zzso volume data from automated ultrasound were reviewed by five zzso who were unaware of the results of ultrasound with a handheld device and zzso and of the clinical zzso If a zzso was detected with automated zzso zzso position, distance from the zzso largest diameter, and zzso final assessment category were zzso If the zzso was a mass, shape, orientation, margin, zzso and zzso feature were zzso zzso correlation zzso and zzso statistics were used for statistical zzso 

At least two observers identified 145 zzso with automated zzso Among 725 possible zzso 587 zzso zzso were zzso Individual investigators detected between zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso The rate of detection of zzso larger than zzso zzso was zzso Most zzso detected only with handheld ultrasound zzso zzso or automated ultrasound zzso zzso were zzso or probably benign zzso All zzso correlation zzso for zzso location and size exceeded zzso indicating high zzso zzso agreement was found for mass shape zzso zzso zzso orientation zzso zzso zzso margin zzso zzso zzso and zzso final assessment category zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso larger than zzso zzso in greatest diameter was zzso High reliability was obtained for reporting zzso size and zzso zzso agreement was obtained for description of key feature and final assessment zzso
