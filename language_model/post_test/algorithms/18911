A novel method that uses a two-dimensional zzso digital image correlation zzso based on a single zzso camera to measure three-dimensional zzso displacement and deformation is zzso zzso displacement in zzso space consists of both zzso and zzso zzso The presence of an zzso displacement component results in a shift of the center of the image displacement zzso while the slope of the image displacement zzso is related to the zzso displacement zzso Global zzso is employed to determine the displaced position of each point on an object based on a linear distribution characteristic of the displacement zzso zzso images with deformation introduced by zzso displacement are generated to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed zzso In the zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso displacement components are separated by determining the intercept and slope of the image displacement zzso In the zzso zzso a zero order displacement zzso zzso zzso mode is assumed in a small subset of zzso zzso and experimental results demonstrate that both zzso and zzso zzso can be accurately retrieved using the proposed zzso
