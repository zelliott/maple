zzso unfolding of zzso A, zzso and zzso A was analyzed as a zzso reaction of a protein zzso with water and zzso zzso The protein unfolding process in various solutions of zzso and zzso was described well by the zzso zzso zzso The zzso form of the zzso zzso which describes the zzso protein ratio as a function of water activity, was successfully applied to obtain a good linear zzso From this analysis, the role of water activity on protein stability was clearly explained and the contributions of zzso and zzso binding to protein zzso were separately discussed in protein zzso General solution for the free energy of protein stability was obtained as a simple function of zzso zzso
