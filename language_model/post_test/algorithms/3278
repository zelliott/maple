We define a new general zzso the family of zzso as a tool that produces many new vulnerability functions that measure the capacity of a network to maintain its functional performance under random damages or malicious zzso This new framework comprises most of the vulnerability definitions appearing in the literature and allows to calculate some relationships between the different zzso in terms of their function zzso or their parameters zzso zzso that improve several known results for the vulnerability zzso Some graphics of simulations are provided in order to show the sharpness of these zzso
