The zzso potential at the site of a mechanical deformation has been shown to resemble the underlying zzso action potential, providing a minimally invasive way to access membrane zzso The zzso factors underlying the genesis of this zzso however, are still poorly zzso With the use of data from a recent experimental study in a zzso heart, a three-dimensional zzso zzso model of the mouse zzso free wall was developed to study the currents and zzso resulting from the application of a point mechanical load on cardiac zzso The applied pressure is assumed to open zzso pressure-sensitive channels zzso the zzso leading to zzso currents at the zzso edge that give rise to the zzso action potential zzso The results show that the magnitude and the time course of the zzso are reproduced only for certain combinations of local or global zzso and zzso zzso that form a resting tissue length constant that, if applied over the entire domain, is smaller than that required to match the wave zzso The results suggest that the application of pressure not only causes local zzso but also changes local tissue properties, both of which appear to play a critical role in the genesis of the zzso
