The use of surgical navigation to aid in total joint replacement requires the zzso fixation of reference marker zzso In this context, a number of potential complications have been reported, including zzso infection, soft tissue zzso and stress zzso This study was performed to determine whether a zzso zzso zzso navigation method for total hip zzso zzso is an accurate alternative method of measuring zzso and offset change zzso zzso zzso was simulated on a zzso bench test model including a zzso soft tissue zzso zzso and offset changes were calculated by an zzso navigation system using the zzso measurement algorithm, in which the calculation of zzso and offset changes is based on a specific realignment of the leg and then compared to corresponding zzso on a zzso scale at the level of the zzso zzso Mean difference in zzso measurement zzso versus zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the corresponding mean difference in offset was 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso system is a reliable tool for controlling leg length and offset during zzso in an zzso zzso This system could lead to a reduction of potential risks associated with navigation zzso
