Our purpose was to evaluate the zzso of the use of a Food and Drug zzso human zzso test in zzso patients with zzso zzso showing zzso zzso cells of zzso significance or a zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso compared with an zzso that used zzso zzso 

Four hundred zzso women referred to our zzso Clinic with a zzso zzso report of zzso zzso cells of zzso significance or a zzso zzso zzso zzso underwent repeat zzso zzso cervical zzso directed cervical zzso and zzso zzso In addition, human zzso testing by the Food and Drug zzso zzso Profile zzso zzso Silver Spring, zzso test was zzso A comparison of sensitivity, zzso and zzso of an zzso determining the need for zzso on the basis of repeat zzso testing versus an zzso that incorporated repeat zzso testing and human zzso screening was zzso The zzso of both of these zzso zzso was also zzso 

As expected, high-risk human zzso zzso acid was detected with greater frequency in relation to increasing severity of cervical zzso zzso In 268 women, the follow-up zzso obtained in our clinic was reported as zzso zzso human zzso types were found in zzso of these zzso In the human zzso women, zzso had grade 2 or 3 cervical zzso zzso confirmed on cervical zzso In comparison, zzso of those with a positive result of the human zzso test had grade 2 or 3 cervical zzso zzso on biopsy zzso zzso zzso Despite this difference, the sensitivity of a positive result of a high-risk human zzso test in predicting the presence of grade 2 or 3 cervical zzso zzso was only zzso Among the women for whom a follow-up clinic zzso zzso was reported as showing zzso zzso cells of zzso significance or a zzso zzso zzso zzso there was no difference in the frequency of zzso grade 2 or 3 cervical zzso zzso between those women with a positive human zzso test result and those with a negative test zzso zzso would have been recommended for zzso women because of a repeat clinic zzso revealing zzso zzso cells of zzso significance, a zzso zzso zzso zzso or a high-grade zzso zzso zzso and in zzso of these grade 2 or 3 cervical zzso zzso was shown on biopsy zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso would have been recommended for 180 women because high-risk human zzso or a high-grade zzso zzso zzso was detected at the clinic visit, and in zzso of this group grade 2 or 3 cervical zzso zzso was shown on biopsy zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso and specificity were virtually identical for the two zzso but the cost of human zzso testing was nearly double that of zzso based on repeat zzso testing alone zzso vs zzso per zzso 

The Food and Drug zzso zzso Profile test is not a cost-effective zzso for patients referred with zzso zzso reported as showing zzso zzso cells of zzso significance or zzso zzso zzso
