Diabetes zzso contributes to the increase of cardiovascular deaths zzso Despite continuous treatment evolution, patients with diabetes suffering from an acute coronary syndrome still have a high morbidity and zzso We aimed to analyze the impact of diabetes on one-year outcome in an zzso patient population with zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso analysis of zzso zzso patients with zzso We compared the baseline zzso treatment and outcome of patients versus those without zzso 

A total of 138 patients had diabetes zzso and zzso zzso had no zzso Patients with diabetes were older, often had hypertension, zzso previous zzso zzso and zzso class zzso on zzso zzso zzso of both patients, with and without diabetes, underwent diagnostic coronary zzso zzso disease was more present among patients with diabetes, but patients with diabetes were treated more often zzso At one-year follow up rates of death and major adverse cardiac events were significantly higher in patients with diabetes compared to those without diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Even after adjustment for differences in baseline zzso diabetes remained an independent predictor of mortality zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In an zzso patient population with zzso patients with diabetes have higher risk factors on admission, less often undergo coronary zzso and have worse outcome at one-year zzso Diabetes is an independent predictor of one-year mortality in patients with zzso
