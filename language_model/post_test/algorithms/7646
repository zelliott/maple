An electric circuit model for a clamped circular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was developed for the first zzso The zzso consisted of two zzso layers sandwiched between three thin zzso The top and bottom zzso were separated into central and zzso zzso by a small zzso While the middle zzso was zzso the central and zzso zzso were biased with two independent zzso zzso The strain mismatch between the zzso layers caused the plate to zzso and transmit a pressure wave, whereas the received echo generated electric charges resulting from plate zzso The clamped zzso plate was separated into a circular and an zzso plate, and the respective zzso transformation zzso were zzso The force and zzso zzso were properly selected using zzso principle and the necessary boundary conditions were zzso The zzso transformation zzso for the clamped circular zzso was deduced using simple zzso manipulation zzso The zzso performance under three zzso schemes was zzso 1) central zzso only, 2) central and zzso zzso with zzso of the same magnitude and zzso and 3) central and zzso zzso with zzso of the same magnitude and opposite zzso The circuit parameters of the zzso were extracted for each zzso zzso including the zzso ratio, the clamped electric zzso and the zzso mechanical zzso Each zzso scheme was characterized under different acoustic zzso using the theoretically developed model, which was verified with finite element modeling zzso zzso The zzso size was zzso to maximize the zzso zzso zzso As such, the developed model could provide more insight into the design, zzso and characterization of zzso and allow for performance comparison with their zzso zzso
