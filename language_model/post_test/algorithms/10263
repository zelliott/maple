Impact of the various zzso settings used during zzso zzso zzso simulation that provides data for zzso corrected dose distribution calculations in patients undergoing external beam zzso with either zzso zzso or electron beams have been zzso The change of the zzso Unit zzso values due to the influence of zzso settings and geometrical distribution of various tissue substitute materials has also been zzso The impact of various zzso settings and electron density zzso distribution on the accuracy of dose calculation in zzso zzso beams was found to be well within zzso In the case of dose zzso obtained with a commercially available zzso Carlo dose calculation zzso for electron beams, differences of more than zzso were observed for different geometrical zzso and zzso zzso zzso differences for the electron beams are relatively small at shallow depths but increase with depth around lower zzso zzso
