The water component dominates in in zzso zzso zzso zzso This consists of a prominent central peak with large zzso and consequently zzso that lie on the zzso become difficult to zzso A method has been developed to zzso the water component in in zzso zzso zzso hence highlighting the zzso zzso 

zzso were acquired from volunteers and patients using zzso chemical shift zzso The water zzso procedure employed zzso data processing in the frequency domain and was fully zzso This involved describing the water component as a coarse function consisting of a zzso region and zzso zzso Points were identified in the spectrum that fit this description and then linked together to produce the water zzso The latter was smoothed and then zzso from the original zzso to produce good water zzso 

Over 2,000 in zzso zzso zzso have been subjected to this zzso The method took approximately 5 s to execute per spectrum consisting of zzso data zzso 

zzso data processing has provided a fast, efficient, and robust procedure to zzso the water zzso
