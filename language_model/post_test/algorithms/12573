In many zzso zzso and zzso problems, zzso performance is of critical zzso However, there usually is time to train the system, which we will show to be very zzso Assuming that several registered images of the target object are available, we developed a zzso approach that is effective in this context by zzso zzso matching of zzso extracted from the input images to those found in the model images as a zzso zzso This shifts much of the zzso burden to a training phase, without sacrificing recognition zzso As a result, the resulting zzso is zzso accurate, and zzso for zzso zzso This reduction in zzso zzso complexity is our first zzso Our second contribution is to show that, in this context, a simple and fast zzso detector zzso to support detection and tracking even under large perspective and scale zzso While earlier methods require a detector that can be expected to produce very zzso results, in general, which usually is very zzso we simply find the most zzso object zzso for the specific target object during the training zzso We have incorporated these ideas into a real-time system that detects zzso zzso and zzso zzso It then estimates the pose of the rigid ones and the zzso of the zzso
