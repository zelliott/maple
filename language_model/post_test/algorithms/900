This paper describes the use of zzso functions for calculating the probabilities of finding motifs in zzso acid and protein zzso zzso and zzso are given for calculating the probabilities associated with nine different ways of defining zzso Comparisons are made with searches of random zzso A higher level zzso zzso defined as a list of zzso A pattern also specifies the permitted ranges of spacing allowed between its constituent zzso zzso for calculating the expected numbers of matches to patterns are zzso
