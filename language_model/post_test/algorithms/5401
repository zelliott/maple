In 2007, zzso Sprint zzso zzso leads were taken off the market due to a high rate of lead zzso Current data do not allow for risk zzso of patients with regard to lead zzso 

We sought to determine zzso of Sprint zzso lead zzso 

Between 2004 and 2007, zzso Sprint zzso leads were implanted in 258 patients in our zzso zzso associated with lead failure were assessed by the zzso method and a Cox survival zzso 

During a median follow-up of zzso years zzso zzso we observed 33 zzso Sprint zzso lead failures zzso survival, zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis, age was the only predictor of lead failure zzso ratio zzso for zzso increase zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients zzso years zzso had a significantly increased risk of lead failure compared with patients zzso years zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Survival without Sprint zzso lead failure was zzso zzso zzso in patients zzso years zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso in patients zzso years zzso zzso The annual zzso of lead failure in patients zzso years was zzso zzso zzso during the fourth year after zzso and zzso zzso zzso during the fifth zzso 

Overall, we found a higher rate of Sprint zzso lead dysfunction than previously zzso Lead failure was much more frequent in younger zzso Our results emphasize the need for close follow-up of younger patients with Sprint zzso leads and suggest that, in these patients, the zzso of a new zzso zzso zzso lead at the time of generator replacement might be zzso
