Resolution and zzso zzso have been derived previously for zzso zzso These zzso can provide accurate approximations to the local resolution properties and zzso functions for zzso systems given a good estimate of the mean zzso Although these zzso may be evaluated zzso zzso approximations are often made for practical zzso zzso However, when numerous evaluations are made repeatedly (as in penalty design or calculation of zzso zzso these zzso still require large amounts of computing zzso In zzso and zzso (2000), we discussed methods for zzso a large portion of the predictor for zzso system zzso In this paper, we zzso the efficient procedure discussed in zzso and zzso zzso to zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso relies on a new zzso approximation and several observations on the zzso in zzso zzso These new general procedures apply to both two-dimensional and fully three-dimensional zzso zzso models, that may be either zzso and zzso or written in procedural zzso We demonstrate the high accuracy of the predictions based on these methods using a simulated zzso phantom and fully 3-D zzso zzso The evaluation of these zzso requires significantly less zzso time than traditional prediction techniques, once the system geometry specific zzso have been zzso
