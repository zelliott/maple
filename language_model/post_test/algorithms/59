We introduce an alternative zzso of the exact zzso simulation zzso zzso for sampling zzso of the chemical master equation for a zzso system of coupled chemical zzso Our zzso is based on zzso partial reaction zzso This novel exact zzso called the zzso direct method zzso is highly efficient and has a zzso cost that scales at most zzso with the number of chemical species, irrespective of the degree of zzso of the reaction zzso In addition, we propose a sorting zzso zzso which is especially efficient for zzso reaction zzso
