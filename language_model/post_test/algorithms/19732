zzso zzso zzso zzso can provide estimates of fiber orientation derived from the zzso dependence of the zzso of water zzso enabling the reconstruction of white matter fiber pathways using zzso zzso However, noise arising from various sources can introduce uncertainty into the estimates of the elements of the diffusion zzso resulting in errors in fiber orientation estimates such that zzso reconstructions of fiber pathways potentially can be imprecise and zzso Recently, attempts have been made to characterize the uncertainty in zzso parameters using the zzso zzso however, several questions remain open regarding the number of repeat zzso and zzso required to accurately and precisely reconstruct the probability zzso of the zzso zzso This study investigates the accuracy and precision of the zzso method for characterizing zzso of zzso zzso A number of experimental zzso designs and sampling schemes containing different numbers of zzso distributed zzso zzso are considered, using an idealized system where the true zzso in each zzso is zzso This study demonstrates that for most zzso experiments, robust results will be obtained if the minimum number of zzso is approximately 500, and that at least five repeat samples of each zzso intensity should be used for zzso
