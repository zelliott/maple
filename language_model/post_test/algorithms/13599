zzso zzso provide multiple functions and services for the well-being of zzso In urban zzso planning and decision making about zzso restoration inevitably involves conflicting zzso zzso uncertainties and conflicting value zzso This study applied zzso and zzso criteria decision analysis to analyze and zzso the explicit zzso between the zzso objectives related to management options for the restoration of an urban zzso the zzso in Vienna, zzso The zzso has been disconnected from the main channel of the Danube River through flood protection schemes 130 years ago that have reduced the zzso exchange zzso Urban expansion has also changed the adjacent areas and led to increased numbers of visitors, which zzso the maximum potential for zzso development and exerts additional pressure on the sensitive zzso in the national park zzso The study showed that increased zzso connectivity would benefit several zzso that preferred the ecological development of the zzso zzso However, multiple uses including zzso agriculture and zzso exploring the maximum potential in line with national park regulations, were also possible under the increased zzso connectivity zzso The largest zzso were zzso to be at zzso score between the ecological condition of the aquatic zzso and the drinking water production and zzso score between the ecological condition of the zzso zzso and the drinking water zzso At this point, the drinking water production was zzso with zzso score, while the ecological condition of the aquatic zzso and the ecological condition of the zzso zzso were traded off with zzso and zzso score, zzso The majority of the zzso involved preferred the management options that increased the zzso connectivity compared with the current situation which was not preferred by any zzso These findings highlight the need for targeted restoration zzso By that, it is recommended that additional measures to ensure reliable drinking water production should be developed, if the higher connectivity options would be zzso In the next step it is recommended to include cost and flood risk criteria in the decision zzso for more specific developed zzso The research showed that zzso zzso figures provided a useful means to elaborate and zzso the real zzso Finally, the research also showed that the use of zzso criteria decision analyses should be based on a participatory approach, in which the process of arriving at the final ranking should be equal or more important than the outcome of the ranking zzso
