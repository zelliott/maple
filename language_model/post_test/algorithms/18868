A novel zzso interference zzso detection and suppression zzso is presented to zzso the zzso zzso zzso A distinct feature of this proposed zzso is its ability to detect the presence of zzso in the zzso signal before applying the zzso suppression zzso No zzso suppression operation will be performed if zzso is not zzso We propose a zzso detector that employs an optimal linear zzso analysis zzso zzso to make a decision for the zzso zzso An efficient zzso zzso zzso zzso notch filter is also developed to serve the purpose of zzso zzso Experimental results demonstrate superior performance of this proposed zzso
