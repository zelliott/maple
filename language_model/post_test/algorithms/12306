Conservation organizations are collecting large-scale data regarding distribution and threats to zzso zzso These data sets will enable planners to systematically identify large-scale conservation zzso however, they will cover only a tiny proportion of living zzso zzso it is essential to investigate to what extent the areas selected for conservation actions can provide protection for other zzso We analyzed the umbrella effect between zzso and zzso across mainland zzso We built habitat suitability models within the geographic ranges of zzso species, based on data collected in the framework of the World Conservation Union zzso Global zzso Assessment and zzso Global zzso zzso We applied systematic reserve selection zzso to two sets of zzso of the area of occupancy of zzso and zzso zzso ranges and estimated suitable zzso and thus selected four reserve zzso We then zzso the protection that each of the four systems provided for zzso and zzso Reserves selected for zzso and zzso were comparable in area, with the former concentrated in the zzso region and the latter more evenly zzso zzso reserves left fewer gaps in species coverage among zzso than the reverse, but zzso reserves included a larger proportion of each zzso area of occupancy than the zzso For both zzso setting reserves to include estimated suitable areas instead of ranges resulted in the zzso of reserves in the zzso Furthermore, it efficiently protected hidden gaps zzso with zzso portions of their range inside protected zzso in the other zzso and included a higher proportion of the area of occupancy of the other zzso Overall, zzso and zzso in Africa acted as an umbrella for a high proportion of species in the other zzso Focusing on estimated suitable areas instead of ranges improved the umbrella effect of both zzso
