The use of zzso to diagnose zzso zzso Disease zzso is based on the assumption that the zzso will minimize the influence of age, gender and ethnicity that is observed in zzso concentration and thus allow a single zzso at which further diagnostic and therapeutic actions should be zzso This hypothesis is tested in a retrospective analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso patients in UK and Sweden, zzso An zzso based on the same model as the zzso zzso was derived from simultaneously measured zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a subset of zzso zzso The combined uncertainty of using this zzso was estimated to about 15 % which is about three times that of the zzso concentration zzso The diagnostic performance of zzso concentration was evaluated using the zzso clearance as the reference zzso It was shown that the diagnostic capacity of zzso as it stands, has no added value compared to zzso The gender and age differences of the zzso zzso in the zzso persist after applying the zzso zzso Thus, a general use of the zzso does not seem zzso zzso the claim that the zzso is adjusted for body area is zzso the zzso does not include any body size zzso It is thus a dangerous marker for guiding drug zzso
