In this paper, a novel unknown zzso zzso of zzso zzso systems is designed through the zzso theory, and the corresponding sufficient conditions for the existence of unknown zzso identifiers are zzso In order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, simulation results are zzso The effects of system noise and measurement noise for the proposed method are discussed in zzso The comparative analysis between the proposed method based on zzso theory and the approach based on zzso synchronization is also zzso
