zzso injuries are multifaceted zzso One approach to identify the critical zzso factors is zzso zzso 

A zzso discrete impact model was constructed through system identification and validated using experimental data in order to understand the dynamic interactions of various zzso parameters in zzso forward fall zzso 

The zzso reaction force responses from the identified models had very small identification errors zzso and high zzso zzso between the measured and identified model zzso Model validation with separate experimental data also demonstrated excellent validation accuracy and zzso less than zzso errors and zzso zzso The first force peak was usually greater than the second force peak and strongly correlated with the impact zzso of the upper zzso while the second force peak was associated with the impact zzso of the zzso The impact zzso of the upper zzso relative to the body could be a major risk factor to zzso injuries as observed from model simulations that a zzso faster arm movement relative to the falling speed of the body alone could double the first force peak from that of a soft landing, thereby readily exceeding the fracture strength of the zzso zzso 

Despite the zzso nature of falling often calling for a rapid arm movements, the safe use of the upper zzso in forward fall arrests requires adequate reaction times and coordinated protective motions of the upper zzso
