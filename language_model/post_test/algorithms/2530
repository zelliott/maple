Most approaches for analyzing zzso data are focused on zzso exact protein binding sites from a single zzso However, frequently multiple zzso libraries derived from differing cell lines or tissue types from the same individual may be zzso In such a situation, a separate analysis for each tissue or cell line may be zzso Here, we describe a novel method to analyze such data that intelligently uses the joint information from multiple related zzso zzso We present our method as a zzso zzso First, separate single cell line analysis is performed for each cell zzso Here, we use a novel mixture zzso approach to zzso the subset of genes that are most likely to be involved in protein binding in each cell zzso In the second step, we combine the separate single cell line analyses using an zzso zzso zzso that implicitly incorporates zzso line zzso We demonstrate the usefulness of our method using both simulated data, as well as real zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
