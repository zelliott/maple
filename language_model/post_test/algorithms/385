zzso is one of the most common brain disorders and may result in brain dysfunction and cognitive zzso zzso zzso usually begin in childhood without being zzso by brain damage and are tolerated by drugs that produce no brain zzso In this study, cognitive function is evaluated in children with mild zzso zzso controlled with common zzso zzso Under this prism, we propose a concise technical framework of combining and zzso both linear and zzso methods to efficiently evaluate (in terms of zzso zzso activity during a visual cognitive task consisting of zzso pattern zzso We investigate six measures of zzso zzso zzso activity based on different underlying zzso These measures include the zzso zzso with the traditional formula and an alternative evaluation of it that relies on zzso models, an information zzso measure known as minimum description zzso a robust phase zzso measure known as zzso value, a reliable way of assessing generalized synchronization in zzso and an unbiased alternative called synchronization zzso Assessment is performed in three zzso initially, the zzso methods are validated on coupled zzso zzso under increasing noise zzso second, surrogate data testing is performed to assess the possible zzso channel zzso of the acquired zzso by comparing the synchronization indexes under the zzso hypothesis of zzso linear zzso and finally, synchronization on the actual data is zzso The results on the actual data suggest that there is a significant difference between normal controls and zzso mostly apparent in zzso zzso during zzso observation zzso
