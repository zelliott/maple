The zzso zzso of zzso acids can influence their function and recognition by zzso A class of DNA binding proteins including the zzso box binding protein binds to the DNA minor groove, resulting in an opening of the minor groove and DNA zzso toward the major zzso zzso zzso molecular dynamics simulations in combination with the umbrella sampling approach have been performed to investigate the molecular mechanism of DNA minor groove zzso and the indirect energetic contribution to protein zzso As a reaction zzso the distance between backbone segments on opposite strands was zzso The resulting zzso structures showed close agreement with experimental DNA structures in complex with minor zzso zzso The calculated free energy of minor groove deformation was approximately 4-6 zzso zzso in the case of a central zzso zzso A smaller equilibrium minor groove zzso and more restricted minor groove mobility was found for the central zzso and also a significantly ( approximately 2 zzso larger free energy change for opening the minor zzso The zzso zzso analysis of zzso indicates that an easier partial zzso of a central zzso versus AT zzso step is a likely reason for the larger groove flexibility of the central zzso zzso
