An zzso and zzso zzso model which considers zzso therapy for the AIDS cases and treatment of all forms of zzso zzso zzso and active forms of zzso is zzso We begin by presenting an zzso zzso model and analyze the zzso and zzso zzso separately without any intervention zzso The zzso model is shown to exhibit backward zzso when its corresponding reproduction number is less than zzso On the other hand, the zzso model has a globally zzso stable zzso equilibrium when its corresponding reproduction number is less than zzso We proceed to analyze the full zzso zzso model and extend the model to incorporate zzso therapy for the AIDS cases and treatment of active and zzso forms of zzso The thresholds and zzso quantities for the models are determined and zzso zzso From the study we conclude that treatment of AIDS cases results in a significant reductions of numbers of individuals progressing to active zzso Further, treatment of zzso and active forms of zzso results in delayed onset of the AIDS stage of zzso zzso
