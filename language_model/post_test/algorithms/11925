To establish criteria for and the limitations of novel gene zzso to identify novel genes of potential relevance to Down zzso and to investigate features of zzso organization, zzso zzso In total, 41 novel gene models were predicted, and for a subset of these, zzso experiments helped to verify and refine the models, and were used to assess expression in early development and in adult brain regions of potential relevance to Down zzso zzso suggest generally low and/or restricted patterns of zzso and also reveal examples of complex alternative processing, especially in brain, that may have important implications for regulation of protein zzso Analysis of complete gene structures of the known genes identified a number of very large zzso a number of very short zzso zzso and at least one potentially zzso zzso At least 3/4 of known genes and 1/2 of predicted genes are associated with zzso zzso For novel zzso three cases of overlapping genes are zzso zzso of these analyses illustrate some of the complexities inherent in zzso zzso organization and some of the limitations of current sequence analysis zzso They also doubled the number of potential genes within the zzso
