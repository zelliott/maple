Many important zzso zzso techniques in solid-state zzso are classified as being zzso This means that the phase of the zzso effective zzso but not its zzso depends on the third zzso angle defining the orientation of the molecular spin system in the frame of the zzso zzso In this paper, we provide closed zzso solutions for the dependence of the zzso zzso signal on the zzso times, within the average zzso approximation for zzso pulse zzso The zzso of the zzso solutions is tested by zzso zzso The zzso distance in a zzso retinal is estimated by fitting the zzso zzso to experimental zzso zzso
