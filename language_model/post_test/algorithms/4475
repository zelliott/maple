The binding of the most common metal zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to a model zzso having an zzso zzso network, zzso was studied using first zzso A strong correlation between the zzso of metal zzso zzso complexes with the type of metal zzso degree of zzso state, and the surrounding environment has been zzso On the basis of the zzso network analysis of the zzso complexes zzso the zzso zzso show little effect on the zzso preference while the zzso preference for the binding of the alkaline earth zzso is zzso and zzso For example, these calculations predict that zzso and zzso favor the zzso form while zzso favors the zzso zzso The zzso complex prefers the zzso zzso in the gas phase and in a zzso protein environment, but zzso to the zzso zzso upon entering the polar zzso zzso The binding affinities of the zzso and the zzso values for the zzso complexes are derived from zzso zzso
