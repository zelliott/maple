A program that generates zzso acid sequences that are compatible with the Greek key protein motif is zzso Using statistical data derived from the structures of molecules from the protein zzso the novel zzso generates zzso acid sequences compatible with an zzso perfect Greek key zzso zzso In this zzso all hydrogen bonds present in the theoretical originating zzso stay in register as the whole zzso domain folds at once in an zzso zzso Eight zzso are generated per strand and 32 zzso per sheet making 64 zzso in the zzso zzso The seven zzso between zzso contain an additional 27 zzso All recognized features of zzso and zzso such as alternating zzso zzso zzso with zzso on the zzso zzso side of the theoretical originating zzso sheet twist, strand twist, side chain rotation about the zzso the theories of side chain packing between the zzso an average 30 degrees rotation between zzso the theoretical zzso patch zzso of each zzso and the zzso zzso stressed zzso zzso shape of each sheet, are taken into account in the zzso The sequences of the zzso between strands are designed by turn type and strand twist is considered in the design of the zzso single zzso zzso Secondary structure parameters and zzso zzso acid pair correlations also figure zzso in the novel zzso
