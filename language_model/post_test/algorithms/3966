This article discusses zzso zzso the goal of which is to determine the zzso of treatment effects across zzso zzso for differences among zzso is challenging because it is inherently a multiple testing problem with the complication that test statistics for zzso are typically highly dependent, making simple zzso corrections such as the zzso correction too zzso In this article, a zzso approach to identify zzso effects is proposed, with a scheme for assigning prior probabilities to possible zzso effects that accounts for zzso and yet allows for zzso preference to specific zzso The analysis zzso a new zzso model selection methodology and, as a zzso produces individual probabilities of treatment effect that could be of use in personalized zzso The analysis is illustrated on an example involving zzso analysis of zzso effects on zzso
