To compare zzso thickness zzso using zzso optical zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso eyes from 32 normal patients underwent complete zzso zzso zzso scanning using the zzso and the zzso zzso were performed for a total of three times each on the same zzso The average retinal thicknesses of the nine zzso sectors as defined by the Early Treatment zzso zzso zzso along with the zzso center point and zzso volume, were zzso The zzso the zzso of variation, and the zzso correlation zzso were calculated for each zzso zzso Comparisons were made between the two zzso in terms of retinal thicknesses zzso their zzso and zzso regional zzso zzso between retinal thickness and demographic variables (age and zzso were also zzso Due to known differences in zzso zzso of the two zzso software calipers were used to measure the distance from the internal limiting membrane to the zzso inner zzso segment junction at the zzso center point on all zzso scans to allow a more fair zzso 

The zzso yielded greater retinal thickness zzso in nearly all zzso zzso compared with the zzso Even after accounting for differences in zzso zzso significant disparities were still evident with the zzso zzso less than those of the zzso at the zzso zzso On both machines, the zzso was thinnest at the zzso and thickest within the 3 zzso zzso There were some consistent regional variations in zzso thickness evident on both zzso Compared with the zzso the zzso generally had lower zzso of variation and higher zzso zzso suggesting better zzso Age and gender also appeared to be important zzso in some zzso thickness zzso 

Compared with zzso the zzso zzso zzso yields greater retinal thickness zzso with greater zzso presumably due to different zzso zzso increased sampling density, and greater zzso However, regional differences across the zzso can be consistently observed with both zzso
