zzso zzso is one of the most important landscaping plants produced in zzso Its enormous economic success is due to the prolonged flower attractiveness of zzso in flower zzso the so-called zzso In this study, we present the first genetic linkage map of zzso zzso in which we mapped a locus of the economically highly desired trait zzso zzso 

The map was constructed in zzso zzso using zzso zzso markers from a single mapping zzso A large fraction zzso of markers showed distorted zzso To test the effect of segregation distortion on linkage zzso these markers were sorted regarding their segregation ratio and added in groups to the data zzso The zzso of group formation was evaluated by comparison of the zzso zzso and the zzso mapping zzso Furthermore, zzso mapping was compared to the zzso zzso The majority of maps constructed by different combinations of these methods consisted of eight linkage groups corresponding to the zzso number of zzso zzso 

All maps confirmed the independent inheritance of the most important zzso traits zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso An zzso marker for the most important breeding target zzso zzso was zzso The presented genetic map of zzso zzso can now serve as a basis for further molecular marker selection and zzso cloning of the candidate gene zzso the unique flower architecture of zzso zzso zzso
