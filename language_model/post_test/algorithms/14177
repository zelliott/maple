To investigate methods to predict the effective zzso anterior chamber depth zzso based on a large patient zzso 

University Eye zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Based on zzso consecutive cataract operations with recorded zzso zzso results, the zzso effective zzso was calculated in each case and studied by multiple linear zzso for zzso with a number of preoperatively defined variables including the zzso length by zzso zzso zzso lens zzso zzso radius by zzso zzso zzso patient age, and zzso zzso diameter, the latter of which was available in a zzso of 900 zzso 

The zzso effective zzso was significantly correlated with 6 zzso variables (in decreasing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reading, lens zzso zzso and patient age (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso Age showed the weakest correlation zzso zzso zzso and could be omitted with no significant decrease in the total correlation zzso Using the 5 most significant zzso the zzso could be predicted according to a zzso formula with an accuracy of zzso of the predictions within zzso zzso When this zzso zzso was used in zzso in the zzso lens zzso power zzso the zzso prediction error decreased by zzso from the error associated with a previously published zzso zzso and decreased zzso from the error using no individual zzso method other than the average zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso was significantly correlated with and hence predictable by a zzso zzso method incorporating the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reading, lens zzso and refraction as the most significant zzso The statistical relationship can be used to create a new zzso prediction zzso to incorporate in a modern zzso zzso zzso power calculation formula with significant improvement in the accuracy of the zzso predictions as a zzso
