zzso zzso in combination with novel fluorescent labeling techniques enables imaging of three-dimensional zzso zzso in intact brain zzso In principle it is now possible to automatically reconstruct the zzso branching patterns of zzso from 3-D zzso image zzso In practice however, the zzso ratio can be low, in particular in the case of thin zzso or zzso zzso relatively deep in the zzso Here we present a zzso zzso diffusion filter that enhances the zzso ratio while preserving the original dimensions of the structural zzso The key idea is to use structural information in the raw zzso local moments of zzso locally control the strength and direction of diffusion zzso A zzso zzso for example, is effectively smoothed only parallel to its zzso zzso not perpendicular to zzso This is demonstrated for artificial data as well as for in zzso zzso microscopic data from zzso zzso of rat zzso In both cases noise is averaged out along the zzso leading to bridging of apparent gaps, while zzso diameters are not zzso The filter is a valuable general tool for smoothing cellular processes and is well suited for preparing data for subsequent image zzso and zzso zzso
