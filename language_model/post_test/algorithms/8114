Principal component analysis zzso is a mathematical method that reduces the zzso of the data while retaining most of the variation in the zzso Although zzso has been applied in many areas zzso it suffers from sensitivity to noise and is limited to linear principal zzso The noise sensitivity problem comes from the zzso measure used in zzso and the limitation to linear components originates from the fact that zzso uses an zzso transform defined by zzso of the zzso zzso and the mean of the zzso In this paper, a robust kernel zzso method that extends the kernel zzso and uses fuzzy memberships is introduced to tackle the two problems zzso We first introduce an zzso method to find robust principal zzso called zzso zzso zzso zzso which has a connection with robust statistics and zzso zzso The zzso method is then extended to a zzso one, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso The modified kernel used in the zzso zzso the zzso condition, which means that the derivation of the zzso is also valid for the zzso zzso analyses and experimental results suggest that the zzso is an efficient zzso dimension reduction method and is more zzso than the original kernel zzso
