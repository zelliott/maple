The feasibility for speed of sound zzso zzso imaging was investigated zzso A through transmission new method for measuring the zzso was zzso With this method a long pulse zzso of two zzso one being the double of the other is transmitted through the object and detected on its other zzso zzso projection images were obtained by scanning objects immersed in water using a zzso mode utilizing a computerized scanning zzso Using this approach zzso projection images were obtained for zzso and zzso as well as for a tissue mimicking breast phantom and an in zzso soft zzso zzso The results obtained here, have clearly demonstrated the feasibility of zzso projection zzso zzso may serve as a new contrast source and potentially may aid in breast zzso
