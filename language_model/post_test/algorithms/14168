Over the past decade, the pharmaceutical industry has begun to address an addition to zzso zzso ability of a compound to bind to and inhibit the human zzso gene zzso cardiac zzso zzso With the compilation of a large and diverse set of compounds measured in a single, consistent zzso channel zzso zzso we recognized a unique opportunity to attempt to construct zzso zzso zzso Early efforts with zzso models built from this training set were very zzso Here, we report a systematic evaluation of zzso models based on neural network ensembles in conjunction with a variety of structure representations and feature selection zzso The combination of these modeling techniques zzso networks to capture zzso relationships in the data, feature selection to prevent zzso and zzso to minimize model zzso was found to produce models with very good internal zzso statistics and good zzso on external zzso
