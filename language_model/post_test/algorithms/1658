A reconstruction of full-length transcripts observed by next-generation zzso or zzso zzso is an essential technique to know all phenomena of zzso Several techniques of the reconstruction have been zzso However, problems of high-level noises and biases still remain and interrupt the zzso A method is required that is robust against noise and bias and correctly reconstructs transcripts regardless of equipment zzso 

We propose a completely new statistical method that reconstructs full-length transcripts and can be applied on both next-generation sequencers and zzso zzso The method called zzso analyzes zzso zzso meaning correlations of expression values for every combination on zzso positions of multiple zzso zzso zzso then reconstructs full-length transcripts using a zzso model based on the zzso correlation and the zzso zzso zzso zzso 17 591 full-length transcripts from 55 zzso zzso and showed notable performance compared with other recent prediction zzso Moreover, zzso novel transcripts were zzso We zzso tested 16 novel zzso among which 14 were confirmed by reverse zzso chain reaction and sequence zzso The method also showed notable performance for reconstructing of zzso observed by a next-generation zzso Moreover, the zzso correlation and factor analysis embedded in zzso successfully detected regions at which alternative zzso may exist, and thus are expected to be applied for discovering transcript zzso for a wide range of disciplines including zzso zzso
