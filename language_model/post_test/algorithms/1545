We propose a zzso control system view of the gene zzso in DNA replication from the finite field zzso By treating DNA sequences as state zzso chemical zzso and radiation as control zzso one cell cycle as a step zzso and the zzso of the resulting DNA sequence as zzso we derive system equations for both deterministic and zzso zzso zzso systems of different zzso Defining the cost function as a zzso of the costs of applying zzso and the zzso penalty, we solve the deterministic and zzso optimal control problems by dynamic programming zzso In addition, given that the system is completely zzso we find that the global optimum of both zzso and zzso deterministic zzso can always be achieved within a finite number of zzso
