zzso changes of intrinsic properties of neural networks play a critical role in brain zzso In that context, zzso is a typical pathology where the fast transition between zzso and zzso states is probably associated to intrinsic modifications of underlying zzso In this study, we focused on the zzso of plastic neural mechanisms in the zzso electroencephalogram zzso Data were obtained during 1 zzso electrical stimulation in zzso patients suffering from zzso lobe zzso and implanted with zzso zzso for clinical evaluation before zzso zzso First, we developed a procedure of analysis for zzso of the seizure onset zone based on brain zzso and plasticity defined as the average, and as the zzso zzso zzso respectively, of the standard zzso of zzso responses over zzso Our results suggest that the candidate zzso focus is particularly prone to exhibiting short-term zzso Second, we used Dynamic zzso zzso zzso to model explicitly short-term plasticity as a fast zzso of synaptic zzso in either intrinsic or zzso connections to the zzso We found the two types of zzso both zzso Third, we used zzso to study the fast zzso of synaptic connectivity of long-range connections in zzso networks restricted to the zzso zzso Using zzso we were able to estimate which structures expressed a strong zzso input to the zzso zzso Such early changes in zzso connectivity might be important for the initiation of zzso zzso They may also reflect some aspects of the zzso of zzso in those zzso
