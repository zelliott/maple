We have devised a method to determine the true zzso of membrane zzso for zzso zzso dissolved in zzso zzso and the zzso partition zzso by simple zzso kinetic zzso at varying membrane zzso fractional volumes in the zzso zzso The method has been applied to zzso zzso zzso c zzso using zzso zzso as zzso at zzso zzso zzso The partition zzso of the zzso as obtained by this method, are in good agreement with those determined directly by other zzso zzso values obtained by this method, when expressed as zzso in the zzso zzso are in the zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso analog zzso are independent of zzso zzso as expected from its partition zzso close to zzso
