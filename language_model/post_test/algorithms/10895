The zzso Compliance Device zzso zzso Hamburg, zzso has been available for the automated measurement and calculation of minute by minute zzso zzso zzso practical use has been somewhat limited by the instability of zzso especially at low zzso zzso We looked at two aspects of a methodology in an attempt to increase the value of the zzso device in the clinical zzso zzso we discussed the difference in representing measured values as zzso zzso instead of compliance zzso and zzso we proposed the use of an averaging zzso called the zzso zzso Moving Average zzso which could be applied as a flexible method to follow trends and rapid changes in the zzso (or zzso Clinical data from zzso patients were gathered and statistical analysis was focused on three particular aspects, the zzso of variation which indicates the zzso of data values, the correlation between the zzso (or zzso time series and the underlying zzso signal and the percentage of zzso greater than zzso standard zzso from the zzso Our results showed that expressing zzso zzso instead of compliance zzso yielded fewer zzso and had a better correlation to zzso and the zzso method had a better correlation to zzso than the zzso zzso
