The traditional zzso vessel filters often suffer from detecting complex structures like zzso due to an zzso zzso zzso To solve this problem, we present a zzso strain energy density function to measure vessel likelihood in zzso medical zzso This method is initially inspired by established zzso principles in zzso By considering the zzso zzso as a stress zzso the three zzso from zzso zzso decomposition are used independently or combined to formulate distinctive functions for vascular shape discrimination, brightness contrast and structure strength zzso Moreover, a mathematical description of zzso zzso for general vessel shapes is zzso based on an intensity continuity zzso and a relative zzso strength term is presented to ensure the dominance of zzso derivatives as well as suppress zzso zzso Finally, we adopt the zzso scheme to find an optimal solution through scale zzso The proposed method is validated in experiments with a digital phantom and zzso pulmonary CT zzso It is shown that our model performed more effectively in enhancing vessel zzso and preserving details, compared to three existing zzso
