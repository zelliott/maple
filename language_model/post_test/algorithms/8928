zzso predicting zzso structure at atomic resolution from sequence alone remains a difficult problem, even for small zzso of large zzso Such loop prediction challenges, which arise frequently in comparative modeling and protein design, can become intractable as loop lengths exceed 10 zzso and if surrounding zzso zzso are zzso Current approaches, such as the protein local zzso protocol or zzso inversion closure zzso zzso zzso involve stages that zzso zzso simplifying modeling but zzso a systematic search of zzso zzso This article introduces an alternative modeling strategy based on a zzso zzso recently developed for zzso zzso which zzso that any realistic zzso molecular zzso can be built up by zzso zzso zzso When harnessed to a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso the resulting zzso assembly zzso protocol enables zzso sampling of a 12 zzso loop at a significant but achievable cost of thousands of zzso In a previously established zzso zzso recovers zzso zzso with zzso accuracy for 19 of 20 zzso compared to 14 of 20 by zzso modeling with a comparable expenditure of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso gives high accuracy results on an additional set of 15 zzso highlighted in the biological literature for their zzso or unusual zzso zzso include zzso touch turns, zzso that pass through tunnels of other zzso and zzso of lengths up to 24 zzso zzso problem cases are traced to zzso in the zzso zzso energy zzso In five additional blind tests, zzso achieves zzso accuracy models, including the first such success in a zzso binding zzso the zzso interaction in the fourth zzso zzso These results establish zzso zzso as an unusually systematic approach to zzso zzso protein structure modeling that can leverage high performance computing and physically realistic energy functions to more consistently achieve atomic zzso
