Based on transformation zzso theory, we designed a zzso switching device, such that an object hidden inside would exhibit a reversed zzso zzso from zzso to zzso for an observer at the far zzso zzso from a perfect mirror which also creates a zzso image, our device makes the original object completely invisible to the far field zzso zzso simulations are employed to demonstrate the zzso of the designed devices in both two- and three-dimensional zzso
