The zzso zzso zzso program combined with a zzso protein model has been used to predict zzso complex structures in zzso rounds zzso For six targets acceptable or better quality solutions have been submitted zzso quality predictions for targets 32, 40, 41, and zzso The improved performance compared to previous rounds can be attributed in part to the inclusion of zzso flexibility during systematic searches and an zzso scoring zzso In addition, a recently developed method for the prediction of putative protein binding sites based on the zzso penalty to place neutral low zzso zzso on the protein surface was applied to the most recent zzso The approach resulted in useful predictions of putative binding sites that can help to limit the systematic zzso zzso zzso improvements of the zzso approach in particular at the scoring and refinement steps are zzso
