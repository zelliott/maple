Land surface temperature zzso is key parameters in the interaction of zzso zzso This paper proposed a method to inverse zzso from zzso zzso infrared remote sensing data based on the theory of zzso zzso and zzso temperature cycle zzso The new method was validated by a zzso brightness temperatures data sets corresponding to zzso which was simulated by the atmospheric zzso transfer model zzso 4 with several input parameters under clear sky, including near surface air temperature, atmospheric water, surface temperature and zzso and viewing angles, and result showed the root mean square error zzso of zzso reaches zzso for simulated data and most errors are within zzso zzso with accurate parameters zzso At the same time, comparison of zzso estimated using the proposed method from zzso data with that from zzso zzso product displayed that the zzso equals to zzso and most errors are distributed within zzso zzso But, the method is proposed under no cloudy condition and is tested only in zzso and zzso more validation should be made in different areas and atmospheric zzso
