zzso zzso of zzso binding to zzso receptors zzso was examined in zzso zzso of rat spinal zzso An zzso model enabled us to determine the zzso factors of the zzso agents with zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We modified the zzso model with a slope factor because the slope values of the displacement zzso of partial zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were beyond zzso The slope factor was reduced only by 100 zzso zzso Further, zzso showed positive zzso zzso zzso 1) stronger with zzso than with zzso The extent of the positive zzso of zzso was nearly independent from the zzso and structures of partial zzso The zzso zzso and zzso also zzso zzso better than zzso zzso exerted weak negative zzso with zzso zzso zzso by zzso is attenuated by zzso and zzso representing negative zzso zzso zzso 1) greater than with zzso The results suggest a zzso role of elevated zzso levels of zzso and zzso as well as a better zzso zzso of decreased zzso zzso for impaired zzso zzso
