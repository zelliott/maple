zzso quantitative traits arise naturally in recent zzso zzso studies, in which both structural and functional zzso of the human brain is measured zzso through techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging zzso There is growing interest in detecting genetic zzso associated with such zzso traits, especially in zzso zzso Random forests zzso zzso which are ensembles of decision trees, are amongst the best performing machine learning zzso and have been successfully employed for the zzso of genetic zzso in zzso zzso zzso can also be applied to produce gene rankings in association studies with zzso quantitative traits, and to estimate genetic similarities measures that are zzso of the zzso However, in studies involving hundreds of thousands of zzso and zzso traits, a very large ensemble of trees must be zzso from the data in order to obtain reliable rankings, which makes the application of these zzso zzso zzso 

We have developed a parallel version of the zzso zzso for zzso and genetic similarity learning tasks in large-scale population genetic association studies involving zzso traits, called zzso zzso Random Forest zzso Our zzso takes advantage of the zzso programming model and is deployed on zzso an zzso software framework that supports zzso distributed zzso zzso zzso are obtained by introducing a zzso criterion for zzso splitting in the tree zzso zzso zzso has been applied to a zzso association study on Alzheimer's disease zzso in which the quantitative trait consists of a zzso zzso zzso describing zzso changes in the human brain zzso zzso provides a ranking of zzso associated to this zzso and produces zzso measures of genetic proximity that can be directly compared to zzso measures of zzso zzso Several known zzso zzso have been identified, including zzso and zzso We also present experimental evidence supporting the hypothesis of a linear relationship between the number of top-ranked zzso states, or frequent zzso patterns, and an indicator of disease zzso
