The Allen test is commonly used to assess collateral hand circulation before zzso artery harvest for coronary artery bypass zzso However there is no consensus as to whether an abnormal Allen test is an absolute or relative zzso to zzso artery zzso We assessed the safety of harvesting the zzso artery using zzso duplex zzso in patients with an abnormal Allen zzso 

Two hundred and zzso consecutive patients scheduled for total zzso coronary zzso underwent zzso Allen tests over a zzso zzso Patients with an abnormal Allen test underwent duplex zzso preoperatively to assess the zzso of the zzso collateral supply and the suitability of the zzso artery for zzso 

Two hundred and zzso patients zzso had a normal left Allen test and proceeded directly to zzso artery zzso zzso patients zzso with an abnormal left Allen test underwent duplex zzso scans and of those, 5 patients had an abnormal zzso These patients underwent scanning of the zzso zzso Three patients had a normal right zzso zzso duplex scan and the right zzso artery was zzso The mean diameter of the zzso and zzso arteries was not significantly different between the patients with normal and abnormal duplex zzso There were no zzso hand complications in this zzso 

The Allen test is a zzso easy, and reliable screening test before zzso artery harvesting in the majority of zzso Duplex zzso predicts safe zzso artery harvest in the majority of patients with an abnormal Allen zzso
