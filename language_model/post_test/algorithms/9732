Genes carry the instructions for making proteins that are found in a cell as a specific sequence of zzso that are found in DNA zzso But, the regions of these genes that code for proteins may occupy only a small region of the zzso Identification of the coding regions plays a vital role in understanding these zzso In this paper we have explored an zzso zzso System zzso that can be used to strengthen and identify the protein coding regions in a zzso DNA system in changing environments and the CA technique for protein structure prediction of small zzso proteins using zzso From an initial round of zzso zzso we learn properties of the energy landscape that guide a subsequent round of sampling toward zzso zzso Three different approaches to improve zzso fold prediction using the genetic zzso are zzso refinement of the search zzso combination of prediction and zzso inclusion of experimental data as selection criteria into the genetic zzso It has been developed using a slight zzso of genetic zzso Good zzso can be produced, especially when the number of the zzso is zzso However, an increase in the range of the zzso somehow affects the fitness of the immune zzso Experimental results confirm the zzso of the proposed zzso zzso based zzso to handle large volume of zzso irrespective of the number of classes, zzso and zzso We note an increase in accuracy of more than zzso over any existing standard zzso that address this zzso This was the first zzso to identify protein coding regions in mixed and also zzso zzso boundary DNA zzso The accuracy of prediction of the structure of proteins was also found zzso
