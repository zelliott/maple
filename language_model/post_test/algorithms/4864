zzso is a powerful technique for clinical diagnosis and materials zzso Images are acquired in a homogeneous zzso magnetic field much higher than the fields generated across the field of view by the zzso zzso field zzso Without such a high field, the zzso components of the field zzso dictated by Maxwell's equations lead to severe zzso that make imaging impossible with conventional zzso zzso In this paper, we present a zzso image of a phantom acquired with a fundamentally different methodology in which the applied zzso field approaches zzso Our technique involves zzso with zzso of uniform and zzso field, and acquiring the magnetic field signals with a zzso The method can be extended to weak ambient fields, potentially enabling imaging in the Earth's field without cancellation coils or zzso Other potential applications include quantum information processing and fundamental studies of long-range zzso zzso
