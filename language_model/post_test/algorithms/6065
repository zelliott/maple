zzso zzso zzso was studied under zzso exposure conditions in normal human zzso zzso cells zzso The zzso time course of zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso medium was analyzed according to a first order equation with rapid initial zzso and zzso zzso zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The presence of a zzso excess of zzso zzso dramatically decreased zzso zzso showing the involvement of specific zzso of zzso Our zzso studies revealed the preferential zzso of the free zzso zzso but also suggested that zzso species may contribute to zzso zzso zzso mechanisms of transport of very high and similar affinity zzso approximately 5 zzso have been characterized under both zzso and nitrate exposure conditions, but a zzso higher capacity zzso was estimated in the nitrate medium used to increase zzso over zzso zzso A clear zzso of zzso zzso was observed at external zzso pH under both exposure zzso An zzso zzso increase in zzso zzso was obtained in zzso zzso nitrate zzso whereas zzso provided additional zzso These results show different kinetic parameters for zzso zzso as a function of zzso metal zzso zzso zzso would not involve the zzso zzso zzso but would be related instead to the zzso and/or zzso zzso Because zzso zzso cells play a critical role in the renewal process of the entire zzso zzso studies on the impact of zzso on zzso cell functions clearly deserve further zzso
