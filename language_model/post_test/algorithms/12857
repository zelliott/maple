The analysis of zzso data sets, such as zzso data, often requires that individual variables zzso for example) be grouped into clusters of variables with highly correlated values across all zzso Gene shaving is an established method for generating such zzso but is overly sensitive to the input zzso changing just one sample can determine whether or not an entire cluster is zzso This paper describes a zzso method based on the zzso zzso of gene shaving zzso which overcomes this and other problems, and applies the new method to a large gene expression zzso zzso from brain zzso zzso
