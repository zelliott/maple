To determine the feasibility of ex zzso prostate cancer detection by triple zzso A positive surgical margin following radical zzso is an adverse factor for recurrence-free zzso zzso of residual cancer cells in zzso would be the most useful, allowing the zzso of such tissue during the zzso Aside from the use of frozen zzso the ability to detect positive surgical margins is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are methods that allow discrimination of zzso of different zzso based on their specific zzso We tested whether the combination of these techniques can differentiate zzso and benign prostate tissue ex zzso 

In preparation for future in zzso zzso an ex zzso study was performed to detect characteristics of prostate zzso zzso tissue samples from 32 patients undergoing radical zzso for clinically localized prostate cancer were taken immediately after removal of the prostate and stored in liquid zzso zzso samples were thawed for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Based on these results, a computerized zzso was developed for tissue zzso 

The statistical analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso data demonstrated a differentiation of benign and zzso prostate tissue with a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso By adding the acquired zzso zzso data to the statistical analysis, sensitivity and specificity were increased to zzso and zzso 

A highly accurate differentiation of prostate tissue was achieved in an ex zzso zzso In zzso studies need to be performed to evaluate whether this technique can be successful in an zzso setting to detect positive surgical zzso
