The zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping of plant architecture is a critical step for understanding the genetic determinism of plant zzso Previous studies adopted simple zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso for zzso mapping of plant zzso Many of these quantitative traits were generally correlated to each other, which give rise to statistical problem in the detection of zzso We aim to test the zzso of kernel methods to zzso zzso architecture and its zzso zzso We first test zzso Principal zzso Analysis zzso and Support zzso Machines zzso over an artificial zzso of simulated zzso with different types of flower distribution, which is coded as a sequence of zzso per zzso along a zzso The ability of discriminating the different zzso types by zzso and zzso is zzso We then apply the zzso representation to the real zzso of rose zzso shoots zzso obtained from a 98 F1 hybrid mapping zzso We find kernel principal components with high zzso zzso and the zzso analysis identifies a new zzso which was not detected by a zzso analysis of simple architectural zzso The main tools developed in this paper could be use to tackle the general problem of zzso mapping of complex zzso zzso structure, zzso zzso zzso
