zzso the creation of a stabilized internal zzso is ubiquitous in biological evolution, despite the zzso cost of excluding noise information from a zzso The advantages of stability seem self zzso but the alternatives are not so zzso This issue was studied by means of zzso experiments on a simple evolution model: a population of zzso network zzso selected for performance of a zzso task while subjected to zzso During evolution, noise sensitivity increased with zzso Noise exclusion evolved spontaneously, but only if the noise was sufficiently zzso Noise that was limited to one or a few stereotyped patterns caused symmetry breaking that prevented noise zzso Instead, the organisms incorporated the noise into their function at little cost in ultimate fitness and became totally noise zzso This zzso zzso suggests caution when interpreting apparent adaptations seen in zzso If the noise was totally random from generation to generation, noise exclusion evolved reliably and zzso but if the noise was correlated over several generations, zzso selection of zzso traits could reverse noise zzso with catastrophic effect on population zzso Noise entering the selection process rather than the zzso had a different effect: zzso evolution was totally abolished above a critical noise zzso in a manner resembling a zzso phase zzso zzso adaptation to noise involves the creation of a zzso screened from noise information but increasingly vulnerable to its zzso Similar considerations may apply to information channeling in human cultural zzso
