To obtain zzso as well as diffusion information in normal breast zzso and breast zzso from zzso incoherent motion zzso imaging with zzso analysis of multiple zzso zzso imaging zzso and compare these parameters to apparent diffusion zzso zzso obtained with zzso analysis in their ability to discriminate benign zzso and zzso zzso 

In this prospective study, informed consent was acquired from all zzso zzso patients with 40 zzso tumors, 41 benign zzso 30 simple zzso and 39 normal breast zzso were zzso at zzso T utilizing zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso using 12 b values zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fraction zzso and zzso zzso zzso were calculated using segmented zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 0 and 1000 zzso was calculated with zzso fitting of the zzso zzso D, zzso zzso and zzso values were obtained for normal breast zzso simple zzso benign zzso and zzso zzso zzso operating characteristic analysis was performed for all zzso zzso 

There was good zzso agreement on the zzso between the 2 zzso D values were significantly different among zzso tumors, benign zzso simple zzso and normal breast zzso zzso zzso zzso and it was the same result for zzso zzso and zzso zzso Further comparisons of these 4 parameters between every single pair were as the zzso D and zzso values of zzso tumors were significantly smaller than those of benign zzso simple zzso and normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The f value of zzso tumors was significantly higher than that of benign zzso simple zzso and normal breast zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and P zzso zzso D and zzso values demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity in zzso benign zzso and zzso tumors, with area under the curve zzso of zzso and zzso respectively, while f and zzso with the lower zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Combining f and D values had a sensitivity up to zzso 

zzso response zzso in zzso tumors, benign zzso and normal zzso zzso are found to be zzso fit in comparison with the zzso fit for simple zzso zzso provides separate quantitative measurement of D for zzso and f and zzso for zzso and is helpful for differentiation between benign and zzso breast zzso
