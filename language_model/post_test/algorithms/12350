zzso data obtained from mass zzso have attracted great interest for the detection of zzso zzso However, as mass zzso data are zzso identification of zzso is a key zzso 

This paper proposes the use of zzso zzso in data as zzso Analysis is conducted as zzso data zzso identification of zzso and application of zzso to construct a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are selected by zzso zzso is also examined to balance false zzso and false zzso The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated using an zzso cancer zzso 

Continuous zzso and discrete zzso can be used in the present zzso The difference between the result for the continuous zzso and that for the discrete zzso was investigated in zzso In the example considered here, both zzso provide a good zzso but it seems that they provide different kinds of zzso We can obtain more information on the structure of the data by zzso both zzso
