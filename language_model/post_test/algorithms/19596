DNA sequence zzso analysis can provide valuable information on the evolutionary forces shaping zzso variation, and provides an insight into the functional significance of zzso zzso The recent ongoing zzso projects will radically improve our capabilities to detect specific zzso regions shaped by natural zzso Current available methods and software, however, are unsatisfactory for such zzso zzso 

We have developed methods for the analysis of DNA sequence zzso at the zzso zzso These methods, which have been tested on a zzso and actual data files from mouse and human, have been implemented in the zzso software package version zzso Additionally, we have also incorporated a zzso zzso The main features of this software are: zzso exhaustive zzso analyses including those based on the zzso zzso zzso analysis adapted to the shallow data generated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso use of zzso zzso to conduct a comprehensive analyses separately for different functional zzso zzso identification of relevant zzso regions by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the results integrated with current zzso zzso in commonly available zzso zzso 

zzso is a powerful and flexible suite of software for the analysis of DNA zzso The current version zzso new zzso methods, and capabilities, providing an important tool for an exhaustive exploratory analysis of zzso DNA zzso zzso
