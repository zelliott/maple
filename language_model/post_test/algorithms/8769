This work presents an zzso for collaborative control of an zzso zzso zzso Our approach is based on a statistical machine learning technique to learn task zzso from demonstration zzso The zzso has been developed in the context of zzso powered wheelchairs that provide assistance to individuals with zzso that affect their control in challenging driving scenarios, like doorway zzso We validate our zzso within a simulation environment, and find that with relatively few zzso our approach allows for safe zzso of the doorway while maintaining a high level of user zzso
