In the last decade, the availability of new minimally invasive subcutaneous sensors for monitoring zzso level continuously zzso research on new online strategies for improving the treatment of diabetes, including zzso alert generators and artificial zzso An important aspect that has to be dealt with in these applications is the random measurement noise that affects continuous zzso monitoring zzso zzso One major difficulty is that for a given sensor technology, the zzso ratio zzso can vary from subject to subject zzso zzso and also within subject zzso zzso Recently, a zzso approach implemented through a Kalman filter with parameters automatically zzso once for all, in a zzso zzso was proposed to cope with the zzso zzso of zzso In this paper, we propose a new zzso method able to cope also with the zzso zzso of the zzso The method resorts to a zzso smoothing procedure that uses a zzso criterion to zzso and continuously update, filter parameters in real zzso The performance of the method is assessed on both zzso Carlo simulation and 24 real zzso time series obtained with the zzso system zzso Florence, zzso The method has a general zzso also outside from the zzso zzso
