An electric zzso zzso assist device has been developed for long-term use inside the zzso The system is composed of a zzso blood pump and an zzso consisting of an electrical motor and a ball zzso zzso change of the direction of motor rotation makes a back-and-forth zzso movement of the ball screw zzso The zzso which is detached from the pump zzso pushes the zzso via a zzso plate to zzso blood during zzso blood is sucked by the zzso resilience during zzso Using the output signals from a newly zzso zzso miniature optical rotary zzso mounted inside the zzso the input zzso of the motor is zzso controlled referring to the phase difference between the current position of the moving zzso and the electrical reference signal of the rotation generated by a zzso zzso In zzso performance tests indicated that the system fulfills required zzso The maximum efficiency was zzso which was about twice as high as that obtained with the previous zzso zzso zzso In the air, the surface temperature of the zzso elevated to 20 degrees C above the room zzso An acute in zzso test showed its feasibility as a left zzso assist zzso Analysis of the energy loss in each component of the system indicated that redesign and precise assembly of the mechanical parts could increase the system zzso
