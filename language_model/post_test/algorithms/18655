The aim of this study was to evaluate the zzso and long-term results of zzso for zzso 

Immediate and long-term outcomes of 103 consecutive patients with zzso who underwent zzso from 1989 to 2001 were zzso Immediate outcomes included stone clearance rate, operative zzso and zzso zzso results included stone recurrence rate and zzso 

The immediate stone clearance rate was zzso and the final stone clearance rate was zzso after subsequent zzso zzso by zzso zzso or zzso zzso The operative morbidity and hospital mortality rates were zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that right zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso of zzso zzso Ten patients zzso had associated zzso (four known zzso at the time of zzso With a median follow-up of 56 months zzso zzso zzso stones developed in eight patients and zzso developed in three patients zzso zzso months zzso Sixteen patients had died during the follow-up period, none of zzso zzso zzso was the only significant zzso factor of long-term survival by Cox zzso zzso 

zzso is a safe and effective treatment for zzso with a high immediate stone clearance rate and a low long-term stone recurrence zzso The presence of associated zzso is the main factor compromising long-term survival in patients with zzso
