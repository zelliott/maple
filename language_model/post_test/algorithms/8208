This paper investigates a method of reconstructing images from zzso CT data with negligible zzso artifacts and improved zzso ratio zzso compared to conventional zzso zzso zzso the investigated method first reconstructs separate images from each energy zzso The final image is a linear combination of the zzso images, with the weights chosen to maximize the zzso in the final zzso The optimal weight of a particular zzso image is derived to be zzso to the zzso ratio in that zzso The investigated weighting method is referred to as zzso zzso although, as will be zzso the weights can be calculated and the zzso data combined prior to zzso The performance of optimal zzso energy weighting with respect to zzso and zzso artifacts was investigated through simulations and compared to that of energy zzso zzso zzso and previously studied optimal zzso energy zzso Two acquisitions were zzso dedicated breast CT and a conventional zzso zzso The zzso detector was simulated with five energy zzso Four methods of zzso the optimal weights were investigated, including zzso and zzso methods and methods that require a single reconstruction versus multiple zzso zzso demonstrated that optimal zzso weighting improved the zzso compared to zzso weighting by factors of zzso depending on the zzso Compared to zzso zzso the zzso improvement ranged from zzso to zzso The zzso improvement factors were comparable to those of zzso optimal energy zzso The zzso zzso artifact increased from zzso for zzso weighting to zzso for optimal zzso zzso while optimal zzso weighting reduced the zzso to zzso Overall, optimal zzso energy weighting provides images with negligible zzso artifacts and improved zzso compared to zzso and zzso zzso
