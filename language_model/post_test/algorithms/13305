zzso masking is a method for noise reduction that is based on the zzso representation of a speech in noise zzso Depending on the estimated zzso ratio zzso each zzso unit is either attenuated or zzso A special type of a zzso mask is the ideal zzso mask zzso which has access to the real zzso zzso The zzso either retains or removes each zzso unit zzso zzso The zzso provides large improvements in speech zzso and is a valuable tool for investigating how different factors influence zzso This study extends the standard outcome measure zzso zzso with additional zzso measures relevant for noise zzso listening effort, noise zzso speech zzso and overall zzso Four types of zzso masking were zzso the original zzso a tempered version of the zzso (called zzso which applies limited and zzso zzso and zzso masking (also zzso with two different types of zzso zzso The results from ideal masking imply that there is a zzso between zzso and sound quality, which depends on the zzso zzso Additionally, the results for zzso masking suggest that zzso measures can show effects of noise reduction even if noise reduction does not lead to differences in zzso
