The application of nuclear magnetic resonance zzso to systems of limited quantity has zzso the use of zzso zzso zzso One method recently proposed for the union of zzso with Magic zzso sample zzso zzso involves the integration of a tuned zzso circuit within standard zzso zzso zzso coupled to the zzso probe zzso termed zzso zzso zzso zzso The spinning of zzso materials results in the creation of circulating zzso zzso zzso which generate zzso We report the first data acquired with a zzso zzso system and spinning up to zzso The need to spin faster zzso improved methods to control zzso We propose an approximate solution to calculate the power losses zzso from the zzso currents for a zzso zzso in order to provide insight into the functional zzso of zzso zzso Experimental tests of the zzso reveal conditions which result in reduced sample heating and negligible temperature zzso over the sample zzso
