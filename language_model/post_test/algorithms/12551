The purpose of the present study was to evaluate zzso zzso zzso transport in rats and determine the zzso transport of zzso zzso zzso zzso across the zzso barrier zzso by the use of zzso zzso and zzso which were used as a model compound for zzso organic zzso and a bulk flow marker, respectively, were injected into the zzso humor of rat eye, and a zzso probe was placed in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso eliminated from the zzso humor after zzso zzso zzso The elimination rate constant of zzso during the terminal phase was zzso greater than that of zzso and reduced the level of zzso in the retinal presence of zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is transported via a zzso zzso transport process across the zzso The zzso transport of zzso was significantly inhibited by organic zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas it was not inhibited by zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso transport of zzso across the rat zzso was evaluated by zzso and its zzso by organic zzso suggests organic zzso transporting zzso zzso zzso zzso transport at the zzso
