zzso between cortical areas are crucial for cognitive zzso zzso currently in use to assess such interactions are not well suited for this task because they lack timing precision, zzso precision, or zzso We present a method for simultaneous zzso of source location and orientation parameters and zzso parameters to overcome these zzso Different zzso are evaluated for their zzso From a simulation study, we conclude that the zzso derived from the zzso procedure have good statistical properties with moderate sample sizes, whereas those obtained from the generalized least squares procedure are biased and give zzso standard zzso The method is illustrated with visually evoked field data, with zzso zzso
