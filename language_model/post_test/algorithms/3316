Changes in blood flow influence the structure, function, mechanical properties, and zzso of zzso The objective of the present study was to investigate the role of increased blood flow on the zzso incremental elastic zzso of the zzso right coronary artery zzso and to determine the zzso basis for the changes in zzso We hypothesized that an increase in RCA flow will lead to increased zzso in conjunction with zzso of zzso and collagen in the vessel zzso The control and experimental groups consisted of five RCA vessels zzso The RCA of the experimental group was exposed to 4 zzso of zzso in right zzso zzso induced by pulmonary artery zzso zzso relationships were determined and the incremental elastic zzso were derived in the zzso zzso and cross zzso The results show a significant increase in the elastic zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and cross directions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso of the experimental RCA compared with zzso zzso zzso was used to assess the changes in zzso and collagen content in the media and zzso of the vessel zzso We found a significant increase in zzso and collagen area fraction particularly in the zzso zzso These data suggest stiffening of the vessel wall as a result of increased zzso and more predominantly zzso
