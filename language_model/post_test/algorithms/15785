The human zzso project has led to the discovery of many human protein coding genes which were previously zzso As a large fraction of these are functionally zzso it is of interest to develop methods for predicting their molecular function from zzso 

We have developed a method for prediction of protein function for a subset of classes from the Gene zzso zzso zzso This subset includes several zzso interesting zzso factors, zzso zzso channels, stress and immune response zzso hormones and growth factors can all be zzso Although the method relies on protein sequences as the sole zzso it does not rely on sequence zzso but instead on sequence derived protein features such as predicted post zzso modifications zzso protein sorting signals and zzso properties calculated from the zzso acid zzso This allows for prediction of the function for orphan proteins where no zzso can be zzso Using this method we propose two novel receptors in the human zzso and further demonstrate zzso zzso of related zzso
