zzso the circumstances under which exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to infection is important for managing risks to public zzso Based upon ideas in zzso and zzso it is plausible that exposure to harmful agents, including zzso is completely safe if the dose is low zzso However, the existence of a zzso below which infection probability is zero has never been demonstrated zzso Here we explore this question by combining data and mathematical models that describe zzso infections in mice following experimental challenge over a broad range of zzso We zzso data from zzso mice zzso at doses ranging over ten orders of zzso These data are compared to results from a zzso model in which zzso accumulate according to a zzso zzso zzso zzso this model assumes no threshold on the dose required for zzso Our data reveal that infection is possible at the very low dose of a 1000 fold dilution of the dose that zzso half the challenged animals zzso Furthermore, the dose response curve closely matches that predicted by the zzso These findings imply that there is no safe dose of zzso and that assessments of the risk from low dose exposure are right to assume a linear relationship between dose and probability of zzso We also refine two common perceptions about zzso incubation zzso that their mean values decrease zzso with zzso decreases in dose and that they are highly zzso between zzso The model and data both show that the linear decrease in incubation period holds only for doses above the zzso Furthermore, zzso in incubation periods is greater than predicted by the model, not zzso This result poses new questions about the sources of zzso in prion incubation zzso It also provides insight into the limitations of the incubation period zzso
