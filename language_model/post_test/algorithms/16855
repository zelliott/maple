There is increasing evidence that vitamin D can be protective against the development of multiple sclerosis zzso but it may also be beneficial for the clinical course of the zzso Our objective was to zzso investigate if zzso D zzso levels are associated with zzso risk in zzso in a study with frequent serum zzso 

This was a prospective zzso study in 73 patients with zzso zzso Blood samples for zzso zzso were taken every 8 zzso zzso between zzso levels and zzso rates were assessed using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the individual serum levels as zzso zzso 

During follow-up zzso zzso zzso 58 patients experienced a total of 139 zzso Monthly moving averages of zzso levels were zzso into low zzso zzso medium zzso zzso and high zzso zzso zzso zzso risk decreased significantly with higher serum vitamin D zzso respective relative zzso rates for the medium and high-level category as compared to the low-level category were zzso and zzso zzso value for trend: p zzso zzso The association between zzso zzso and zzso rate was log linear without a zzso With each doubling of the serum zzso concentration the zzso rate decreased by zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

Our finding that higher vitamin D levels are associated with decreased zzso risk in zzso zzso suggests a beneficial effect of vitamin D on disease course in zzso However, the possibility of reverse causality cannot be ruled out zzso zzso intervention studies are therefore needed to investigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation in zzso
