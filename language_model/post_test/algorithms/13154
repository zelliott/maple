We introduce here an incremental version of slow feature analysis zzso combining candid zzso incremental principal components analysis zzso and zzso incremental minor components analysis zzso zzso feature updating complexity is linear with respect to the input zzso while batch zzso zzso updating complexity is zzso zzso does not need to store, or even zzso any zzso zzso The drawback to zzso is data zzso it does not use each data point as effectively as zzso But zzso allows zzso to be zzso applied, with just a few zzso directly on zzso input zzso zzso visual input of an autonomous zzso while zzso has to resort to zzso zzso zzso when the input dimension is too zzso Further, zzso updates have simple zzso and zzso forms, extending the biological zzso of zzso Experimental results show zzso learns the same set of features as zzso and can handle a few cases where zzso zzso
