A new laser zzso analysis zzso technique based on zzso imaging was employed to simultaneously study zzso zzso responses with zzso zzso changes to various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or neutral zzso zzso zzso stimuli as well as to zzso in the newborn zzso zzso zzso animals zzso were fitted with closed zzso zzso Multiple exposure zzso image series zzso zzso were obtained using a near infrared zzso laser zzso zzso The zzso zzso time zzso of zzso fluctuations was determined over zzso zzso and zzso areas to express zzso being zzso to blood flow zzso by two different zzso zzso our novel zzso or a single exposure (2 and 20 zzso zzso zzso values yielded by different zzso techniques were not significantly different at most zzso zzso easily detected both increases and decreases in cortical blood flow zzso zzso zzso changes to zzso closely matched quantitative zzso data determined zzso and were also in accordance with increases of zzso zzso blood flow, calculated from zzso flow zzso and cross zzso area zzso In zzso zzso emerges as an appealing method to simultaneously study zzso zzso and cortical zzso changes in the zzso
