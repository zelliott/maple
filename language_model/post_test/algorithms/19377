Studies on zzso global gene expression using zzso technology have generated ever larger amounts of systematic zzso zzso A major challenge in exploiting these zzso zzso is how to zzso the expression profiles by zzso zzso Different zzso and linear zzso methods have been developed, which essentially rely on the hypothesis that the true or perceived zzso zzso zzso between two different zzso are zzso in zzso However, zzso gene expression changes are frequently observed, leading to zzso zzso results and in consequence potentially to thousands of false zzso zzso we have specifically investigated zzso comparative zzso profiles and developed the zzso using weighted negative second order exponential error functions zzso for robust and global zzso zzso zzso efficiently zzso true gene regulatory events in order to minimize their misleading impact on the zzso zzso We evaluated zzso zzso using artificial and true experimental zzso both of which demonstrated that zzso could be systematically applied to zzso and zzso zzso
