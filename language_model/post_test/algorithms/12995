A method frequently used in zzso systems for improving zzso accuracy is to combine zzso of several zzso Among various types of zzso fuzzy ones are tempting because of using zzso fuzzy zzso zzso In the paper we build an zzso ensemble of zzso zzso zzso Relational fuzzy systems bond input and output fuzzy linguistic values by a zzso zzso thus, fuzzy rules have zzso comparing to traditional fuzzy systems, weights - elements of a fuzzy relation zzso Thanks to this the system is better adjustable to data during zzso In the paper an ensemble of zzso fuzzy systems is zzso The problem is that such an ensemble contains separate rule bases which cannot be directly zzso As systems are separate, we cannot treat fuzzy rules coming from different systems as rules from the same zzso zzso In the paper, the problem is addressed by a novel design of fuzzy systems zzso the ensemble, resulting in zzso of individual rule bases during zzso The method described in the paper is tested on several known benchmarks and compared with other machine learning solutions from the zzso
