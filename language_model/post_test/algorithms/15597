The purpose of this study was to develop and apply a general method for zzso the architectural properties of human muscles in zzso The method consists of a zzso zzso zzso procedure in which the values of peak zzso force, optimal zzso zzso and zzso slack length are calculated for each zzso zzso knowing muscle volume and the minimum and maximum zzso lengths of the zzso In phase I, the positions of the bones and the zzso levels of the muscles are found by maximizing the zzso zzso developed for each degree of freedom at each zzso In phase II, the architectural properties of each zzso zzso are found by matching the strength profile of the model to that measured for zzso The method is used to estimate the architectural properties of 26 major muscle groups crossing the shoulder, elbow, and zzso zzso possible, the model calculations are compared against zzso obtained from anatomical studies reported in the zzso Architectural data obtained from our work should be useful to researchers interested in developing musculoskeletal models of the upper zzso
