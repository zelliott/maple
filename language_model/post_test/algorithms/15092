The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and limitations of published zzso using the zzso zzso to zzso zzso accessory pathways zzso 

The 11 relevant zzso found in the literature zzso database and major scientific zzso were tested on a series of zzso consecutive patients who successfully underwent zzso zzso zzso of a single overt zzso zzso The positive zzso values zzso of the zzso in zzso patients were significantly lower for zzso with zzso 6 accessory location sites zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and show a tendency for zzso not relying on delta wave polarity but on zzso polarity only zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso in zzso patients is related to the zzso location zzso zzso zzso and ranked from the highest to the lowest as zzso left lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso right zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and right zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our study suggests that the accuracy of zzso relying on the zzso zzso depends on zzso locations as defined in the zzso and on the number of zzso zzso The accuracy tends to be lower when delta wave polarity is not included in the zzso zzso This should be considered when using these zzso or when building new zzso
