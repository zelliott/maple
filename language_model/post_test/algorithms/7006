Analysis of data from zzso determined zzso sites on proteins has revealed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso if they occur on the surface of a zzso are more likely to be a part of zzso zzso A zzso method which makes use of zzso properties of zzso acid zzso and their zzso of occurrence in zzso known zzso zzso was developed to predict zzso zzso on zzso Application of this method to a large number of proteins has shown that our method can predict zzso zzso with about zzso accuracy which is better than most of the known zzso This method is based on a single zzso and thus very simple to zzso
