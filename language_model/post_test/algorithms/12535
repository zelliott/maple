zzso base pairs, mostly present in the zzso often play a prominent role towards maintaining their structural zzso Higher order structures like base zzso are also important in defining and stabilizing the zzso folded structure of zzso We have developed a new program zzso to analyze different types of zzso and zzso base pairs and base zzso involving at least two direct hydrogen bonds formed between polar atoms of the bases or sugar zzso zzso We considered 104 possible types of base pairs, out of which examples of 87 base pair types are found to occur in the available zzso crystal zzso Analysis indicates that approximately zzso base pairs in the functional zzso structures are zzso which include different types of zzso and zzso zzso base pairs apart from a wide range of base pair zzso We further noticed that more than zzso of these base pairs are involved in zzso formation, most of which play important role in maintaining long-range zzso contacts in the three-dimensional folded structure of zzso Apart from zzso the program also gives a quantitative estimate of the zzso deformation of detected base pairs in comparison to an ideal zzso base zzso This helps us to gain insight into the extent of their structural variations and thus assists in understanding their specific role towards structural and functional zzso
