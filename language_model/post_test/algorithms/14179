To develop a simple and accurate method for determining appropriate zzso lens zzso power in cataract patients who had prior zzso laser zzso for zzso or zzso because laser vision corrective surgery interferes with traditional zzso and zzso topography, rendering zzso power calculations zzso 

Private zzso in Century City zzso zzso California, and zzso zzso surgery centers with institutional review zzso 

Based on the zzso experience of the senior author, an zzso power correction factor that was zzso to the prior laser zzso was determined and applied to the zzso power calculated by the zzso zzso It was necessary to add to the predicted zzso power in eyes with prior zzso laser zzso whereas eyes having prior zzso laser vision correction required a reduction in the zzso zzso The correction factor was applied to 30 eyes that required cataract surgery at some time after laser zzso zzso 23 eyes had prior treatment for zzso and the remaining 7 eyes had prior zzso laser zzso A zzso formula was generated from the zzso power correction factor that was used in the 30 zzso 

Using the correction factor for 30 eyes, the mean zzso from the desired zzso zzso outcome was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 28 of 30 eyes were within zzso D of the intended zzso the remaining 2 eyes were both zzso D from the desired optical result of cataract zzso Fourteen of the 30 eyes were zzso 

A simple zzso power corrective adjustment zzso formula allowed accurate determination of zzso power after laser zzso zzso zzso The weakness of the current method is that knowledge of the amount of prior laser vision correction is zzso
