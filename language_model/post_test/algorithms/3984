The zzso ratio of municipal solid waste zzso is an essential zzso for evaluation of waste settlement and landfill zzso However, no appropriate model has been proposed to estimate the waste zzso ratio so zzso In this study, a decision tree method was zzso to predict the waste zzso ratio zzso The tree was constructed using zzso zzso zzso A reliable database retrieved from the literature was used to develop a practical model that relates zzso to waste composition and properties, including dry density, dry weight water content, and percentage of zzso organic waste using the decision tree zzso The performance of the developed model was examined in terms of different statistical criteria, including correlation zzso root mean squared error, mean absolute error and mean bias error, recommended by zzso The obtained results demonstrate that the suggested model is able to evaluate the zzso ratio of zzso zzso
