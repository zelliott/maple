Leaf sequencing zzso may use an unnecessary number of monitor units or segments to generate intensity maps for delivery of intensity modulated zzso zzso using multiple zzso zzso An zzso zzso was devised to generate a sequence with the fewest possible segments when the minimum number of monitor units are zzso Special hardware related restrictions on leaf motion can be zzso The zzso was tested using a benchmark map from the literature and clinical zzso zzso were compared to sequences given by the routine of zzso that zzso monitor units by treating each row zzso and the zzso or reducing routines that use fewer segments at the price of more monitor zzso The zzso zzso used on average zzso more segments than provided by the zzso zzso with zzso motion and zzso more segments than did an zzso zzso admitting only zzso zzso The zzso zzso used zzso more monitor units and the reducing zzso used zzso more monitor units than did the zzso zzso algorithm, while the zzso and reducing zzso used zzso more segments than did the zzso zzso zzso leaf sequencing zzso can allow more efficient delivery of zzso field zzso The zzso zzso demonstrates the efficiencies possible with an improved routine and opens a new avenue for zzso
