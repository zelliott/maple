The zzso integral equation theory was tested against newly obtained zzso Carlo computer simulations to describe the potential of mean force between two zzso zzso An excellent agreement was obtained between the theoretical and simulation zzso Further, the zzso integral equation theory with zzso zzso closure zzso correctly (with respect to the experimental zzso describes the zzso structure under conditions where the simulation results are difficult to obtain with good enough zzso
