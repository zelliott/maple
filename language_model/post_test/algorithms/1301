Movement artifact zzso must be detected when zzso recordings of pulse zzso zzso zzso Visual analysis of individual pulse zzso is the zzso but also the most zzso method for this zzso We wanted to test the reliability of a computer zzso zzso Motion zzso zzso based on a comparison between pulse and heart rate, for MA zzso Ten zzso recordings of zzso pulse zzso and heart rate from ten zzso infants were zzso for the presence of MA on the pulse zzso zzso These data were used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the computer algorithm, and of the zzso itself, in detecting zzso zzso were divided into segments of zzso s duration to compare the movement identification zzso Of the segments zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contained zzso The computer zzso identified zzso zzso zzso of these zzso the pulse zzso only zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso or zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the pulse zzso signal showed MA during this time, leaving a significant potential for erroneous identification of zzso zzso of zzso do not allow a reliable identification of zzso 

Without additional information about movement artifact, a significant proportion of recording time of pulse zzso signal may be regarded as demonstrating zzso which, in fact, simply reflects poor measurement zzso The computer zzso used in this study identified periods of movement artifact zzso
