Over the past two decades event by event zzso Carlo track structure codes have increasingly been used for zzso zzso and zzso zzso of these codes has helped to shed light on many aspects of zzso and mechanism of damage by zzso radiation in the zzso These codes have continuously been modified to include new improved cross sections and zzso zzso This paper provides a summary of input data for zzso zzso and elastic scattering cross sections for event by event zzso Carlo track structure simulations for electrons and zzso in the form of zzso zzso which makes it easy to reproduce the zzso Stopping power and zzso distribution of dose are presented for zzso and compared with experimental zzso A model is described for simulation of full slowing down of zzso tracks in water in the range 1 zzso to 1 zzso zzso and calculations are presented for the response of a zzso zzso counter zzso with 5 zzso zzso zzso are presented for the wall and zzso zzso Data shows contribution of indirect effects to the zzso energy distribution for the wall counters responses even at such a low zzso zzso
