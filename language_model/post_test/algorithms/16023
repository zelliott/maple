We studied the complexity of the electroencephalogram zzso in schizophrenic patients by zzso the first zzso zzso zzso which might serve as an indicator of the specific brain function in zzso We recorded the zzso from 25 schizophrenic patients (12 male, 13 zzso zzso zzso fulfilling zzso criteria and 15 healthy controls (9 male, 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso at 16 electrodes, different from previous studies which recorded the zzso at limited zzso We employed a method with an optimal embedding dimension to calculate the zzso For limited noisy data, this zzso was zzso faster and more accurate than previous zzso Our results showed that the schizophrenic patients had lower values of the zzso at the left inferior frontal and anterior zzso regions compared with normal zzso These results for zzso in zzso analysis have some differences from those for power ratios in linear zzso These suggest that the zzso analysis of the zzso such as the zzso of the zzso might be a useful tool in analyzing zzso data to explore the zzso of the brains of schizophrenic zzso
