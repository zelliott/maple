zzso competence is the ability of the zzso to complete zzso undergo successful zzso and reach the zzso zzso zzso cells are indispensable for this zzso Their removal significantly affects the zzso zzso Moreover, the properties and functions of zzso cells are regulated by the zzso They also reflect the zzso degree of zzso Our study was aimed at identifying markers of zzso competence that are expressed in bovine zzso zzso In a previous study in our laboratory, the zzso yield following zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment was zzso zzso we tested four sets of conditions during the first 6 h of in zzso maturation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and negative zzso zzso from each zzso treatment were zzso against the same negative control on a zzso containing a partial library of zzso expressed transcripts in the zzso of competent zzso collected at 6 h after zzso in zzso Common positive clones between zzso treated cells were selected, and 15 candidates were validated by real-time zzso Based on this, the main candidates expressed in zzso cells and that could be valuable and indirect markers of zzso competence are zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso protein 6 zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso These zzso could be potential candidates to predict zzso competence and to select zzso zzso for zzso Additionally, these indirect zzso of zzso competence and zzso health could improve our knowledge of gene expression patterns in the zzso and yield insights into the molecular pathways controlling zzso zzso
