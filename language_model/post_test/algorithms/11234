To evaluate zzso zzso zzso spectral and energy weighted zzso image data sets concerning carotid zzso and zzso plaque zzso 

zzso patients were evaluated using contrast media zzso Energy used for zzso zzso zzso was tin filter with zzso zzso and effective zzso zzso second was zzso Image reconstruction was performed using zzso kernel and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Data sets were analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative zzso 

The zzso ratio, zzso ratio, and zzso were significantly higher in zzso compared to zzso or zzso data (all P zzso zzso zzso zzso span, and zzso diameters were different for zzso zzso and zzso data (all P zzso zzso zzso zzso diameter was significantly different among 140 zzso zzso W, and 80 zzso data (all P zzso zzso A comparison between zzso W and digital zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso in normal zzso zzso 

The dimension of zzso plaque and carotid artery with contrast media decreased with increased zzso The percentage of carotid artery zzso does not vary with different zzso Care must be taken for procedural planning like zzso of zzso Measured diameters of the zzso W were close to digital zzso zzso we suggest that planning should be based on the images acquired using zzso zzso
