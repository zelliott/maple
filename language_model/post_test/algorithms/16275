zzso to reconstruct zzso abound and are widely used in the study of molecular zzso zzso through extensive simulations, we are beginning to understand the potential pitfalls as well as the advantages of different zzso However, little work has been done on possible biases introduced by the methods if the input data are random and do not carry any zzso zzso Although zzso zzso K, von zzso zzso zzso Quartet zzso a quartet zzso method for reconstructing tree zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Schmidt zzso zzso K, zzso M, von zzso zzso zzso zzso maximum likelihood zzso analysis using quartets and parallel zzso zzso zzso has become common in zzso the resulting distribution of labeled zzso zzso trees when data do not carry any zzso signal has not been zzso Our note shows that the distribution zzso to the well-known zzso zzso However, the bias of the zzso distribution will be diminished by a tiny amount of zzso zzso maximum likelihood, zzso zzso zzso tree distribution, zzso zzso
