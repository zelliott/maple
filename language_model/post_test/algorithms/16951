zzso networks were introduced to describe evolution in the presence of exchanges of genetic material between zzso species or zzso zzso networks in particular were introduced as a special kind of abstract network to zzso conflicts between zzso trees which may zzso to such zzso More recently, methods were designed to reconstruct explicit zzso networks (whose zzso can be interpreted as biological zzso from zzso zzso In this article, we link abstract and explicit networks through their zzso properties, by introducing the zzso analog of zzso zzso In particular, we give an zzso zzso between circular split systems and zzso zzso zzso We also show how to adapt to quartets some existing results on zzso in order to reconstruct zzso zzso zzso zzso These results give an interesting perspective on the zzso of zzso networks and also raise zzso and zzso zzso
