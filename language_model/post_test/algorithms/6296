To predict human zzso promoters using computer technology, three data sets of zzso promoter zzso zzso factor binding site sequences and zzso promoter sequences were collected, and the zzso promoter sequences and zzso promoter sequences were analyzed for the comparative density of each unique zzso factor binding zzso The density of each zzso factor binding site in the corresponding data set was used to derive the density ratio, from which the zzso was constructed to identify human zzso zzso This method proved to be highly accurate in predicting the zzso zzso with recognition rates of over zzso of the training sequences and over zzso of the testing zzso
