In this paper, we investigate the use of jitter zzso over short time intervals zzso zzso for voice pathology detection in the case of running or continuous zzso zzso jitter zzso are provided by the spectral jitter zzso zzso which is based on a mathematical description of the jitter zzso The zzso has been shown to be robust against errors in pitch period zzso which makes it a good candidate for measuring jitter in continuous zzso On two large databases of sustained vowel recordings from healthy and pathological voices, we suggest a threshold for the zzso for pathology detection based on zzso zzso zzso that to a database of continuous speech zzso zzso from zzso and zzso speakers, a second threshold and new features are suggested for monitoring jitter in continuous zzso zzso performance of the suggested thresholds and features was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic zzso and their zzso efficiency between healthy and pathological voices was judged using the area under the curve zzso In terms of area under the curve, the suggested features for reading text provide a discrimination score of about zzso while the second threshold provides a zzso rate of zzso Furthermore, estimated short-term jitter values from reading text were found to confirm the studies showing a decrease of jitter with increasing fundamental zzso and the more frequent presence of high jitter values in the case of pathological voices as time zzso
