In this paper we propose a method to simulate zzso changes caused by both closed and tension zzso We consider a clinical zzso the zzso zzso the degree of lung zzso as the input to the zzso Specifically, such an index constitutes a key zzso to the zzso of the changes in size and shape of the affected zzso Once the index is zzso the increase in ventilation rate and the change in the zzso relationship of the affected lung are then zzso For tension zzso the air continuously flows into the zzso cavity and thus every exhalation is followed by the changes seen for a closed zzso until the affected lung zzso The subsequent closure of pulmonary veins and resulting zzso expansion of the zzso lung is also zzso zzso show a real-time zzso of closed and tension zzso using a high-resolution zzso model obtained from a normal human zzso
