To investigate the cost effectiveness of zzso compared to zzso in zzso women after tamoxifen zzso 

A zzso study from the third-party payer perspective in Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain and the United zzso 

A model was constructed, based on and driven by data on survival from a clinical study of these agents, including costs for zzso and zzso and costs for other zzso Data from an zzso study were used to calculate a zzso daily cost for the other zzso zzso gained was used as the measure of zzso zzso were performed for zzso days zzso trial zzso and for a zzso perspective, in which survival after the end of the trial was assumed to be the same as the trend during follow zzso zzso were presented in 1999 zzso 

When running the model for zzso days, the cost effectiveness of zzso compared to zzso varied between about zzso and zzso per zzso zzso In Germany it was much lower zzso due to a higher cost of zzso The total expected cost effectiveness zzso running until no survivors left) ranged from zzso zzso to zzso (The zzso The estimated cost per zzso gained is well within limits generally considered cost zzso 

zzso is cost effective compared with zzso for zzso women with progressive advanced breast cancer after therapy with zzso
