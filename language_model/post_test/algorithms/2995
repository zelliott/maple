A diagnosis of multiple myeloma zzso is difficult to make on the basis of any single laboratory test zzso zzso diagnosis of zzso generally results from a number of costly and invasive laboratory tests and medical zzso The aim of this work is to find a new, highly specific and sensitive method for zzso zzso zzso samples were tested in groups representing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These included a zzso of 17 plasma cell zzso a zzso of 17 zzso zzso 5 B cell zzso and 7 other tumors with zzso zzso as well as 62 healthy donors as zzso zzso calculations associated with zzso were zzso The decision algorithm, with a panel of three zzso correctly identified 24 of 24 zzso zzso samples and 46 of 49 zzso zzso samples in the training zzso During the masked test for the zzso model, 26 of 30 zzso patients zzso zzso were precisely zzso and all 34 normal donors were successfully zzso patients with zzso zzso were also correctly classified into the zzso group, and 11 of the other patients were incorrectly classified as zzso The results suggested that zzso fingerprint technology combining magnetic beads with zzso has the potential for identifying individuals with zzso The zzso zzso model was suitable for preliminary assessment of zzso and could potentially serve as a useful tool for zzso diagnosis and differentiation zzso
