In this article we use the recently developed zzso zzso method zzso to investigate the effect of zzso fluctuations on the electronic properties of zzso in zzso This widely studied zzso has been chosen as a benchmark for evaluating the accuracy of zzso in a large and complex zzso Using a long, zzso molecular dynamics simulation and zzso zzso zzso zzso calculations in zzso we reproduced the main zzso features of zzso Moreover, in line with our previous results on a zzso zzso this study reveals a clear zzso zzso between electronic properties and zzso zzso suggesting that this correlation could be a general feature of zzso
