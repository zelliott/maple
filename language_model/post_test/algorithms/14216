An environmental risk assessment for alcohol zzso zzso is presented that zzso wastewater treatment plant monitoring, fate, and zzso research with a new application of mixture toxicity theory based on simple similar concentration addition of zzso zzso in a zzso distribution zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso composed of a zzso series of molecules that range in zzso chain length from 12 to 18 zzso and zzso from 0 to 18 zzso zzso zzso of zzso is summarized for 17 species in 60 tests and then zzso to monitoring data for zzso zzso To do so, chronic aquatic toxicity was first expressed as zzso per species (the concentration predicted to cause a zzso reduction in an important ecological zzso zzso integrated several new quantitative zzso relationships for algae, zzso fish, and zzso and provided an interpretation of toxicity test data as a function of individual zzso in an zzso zzso zzso were constructed for each zzso and the zzso zzso concentration protective of zzso of species based on a small biological effect zzso chronic zzso was zzso Total mass of zzso in monitored zzso from 29 sites in Europe, Canada, and the United States averaged zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso For risk assessment purposes, correction of exposure to account for fatty alcohol derived from sources other than zzso and for zzso components based on experimental evidence was used to determine zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso from North America and zzso Exposure and effect findings were integrated in a toxic unit zzso model that considers the measured distribution of individual zzso zzso in zzso with their corresponding zzso Use of environmentally relevant exposure corrections zzso and accounting for zzso zzso resulted in zzso ranging from zzso to zzso Low levels of risk are concluded for zzso in the aquatic environments of Europe and North zzso
