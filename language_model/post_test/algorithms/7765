Conventional zzso zzso may cause discomfort to the patient and in some cases it can lead to side effects that include zzso infection and zzso zzso zzso zzso can overcome this problem and further it may lower the risk of operation zzso Very few virtual zzso zzso based investigations of the zzso have been described in the zzso 

CT data sets from a healthy subject were used for the zzso zzso An zzso of zzso and zzso for 3-D image zzso is zzso An zzso based approach is applied in our zzso system which zzso a rapid construction of zzso Some locating techniques are used for fast rendering and navigation zzso 

Our zzso zzso system provides for real time and efficient zzso zzso The virtual camera can be arranged so that it moves along the airway in either zzso Snap shots were taken during zzso The system can automatically adjust the direction of the virtual camera and prevent zzso of the camera and the wall of the zzso 

A virtual zzso zzso system using zzso zzso zzso zzso platform for interactive rendering and zzso zzso of the zzso framework and upper airway is zzso zzso is supported on major operating systems and works with every major zzso zzso The zzso system runs on regular PC zzso and was successfully tested and evaluated using CT data from a normal zzso
