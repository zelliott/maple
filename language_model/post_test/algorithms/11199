This paper presents a zzso approach to derive zzso movement zzso from speech articulation zzso It puts forth a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso constraints zzso to decompose a given data zzso into a set of zzso basis sequences and an zzso zzso The zzso zzso a cost function that trades off the mismatch between the proposed model and the input data against the number of zzso that are active at any given zzso The method is applied to both measured zzso data obtained through electromagnetic zzso as well as synthetic data generated using an zzso zzso The paper then describes how to evaluate the zzso performance zzso and further performs a qualitative assessment of the zzso ability to recover compositional structure from zzso This is done using zzso zzso zzso generated by the zzso zzso based on an zzso zzso zzso zzso and Goldstein zzso zzso and zzso zzso in Mind as zzso zzso in the dynamics of zzso edited by zzso zzso Port and zzso zzso zzso Press, Cambridge, zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that the proposed zzso extracts movement zzso from human speech production data that are zzso zzso Such a framework might aid the understanding of longstanding issues in speech production such as motor control and zzso
