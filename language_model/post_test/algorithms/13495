Although there are a number of statistical software tools for zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso data, such as zzso zzso zzso PET zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso very few software tools exist for power and sample size calculation for zzso zzso Unlike typical biomedical studies, outcomes from zzso studies are zzso images of correlated zzso requiring a correction for massive multiple zzso Thus, a specialized power calculation tool is needed for planning zzso zzso To facilitate this process, we developed a software tool specifically designed for zzso zzso The software zzso called zzso zzso theoretical power calculation zzso based on zzso random field zzso It can also calculate power for statistical analyses with zzso zzso discovery zzso zzso This zzso zzso user zzso tool enables zzso researchers without advanced knowledge in imaging statistics to calculate power and sample size in the form of zzso zzso In this paper, we provide an overview of the statistical framework behind the zzso zzso Three worked examples are also zzso a zzso analysis, an zzso zzso of zzso and a zzso zzso in order to demonstrate the study planning process with zzso We envision that zzso will be a great aide for future zzso zzso
