Both modeling of zzso zzso including major zzso complex zzso binding and zzso prediction of those zzso peptides are essential to develop a zzso system of zzso vaccine design that is one goal of zzso Numerous studies have dealt with modeling the zzso zzso but not the intractable problem of zzso prediction due to complex effects of many intrinsic and zzso zzso zzso affinity of the zzso complex is essential to induce immune responses, but the relationship between the affinity and zzso zzso is too weak to use for predicting zzso This study focuses on mining zzso zzso properties from known experimental zzso data to understand immune responses and predict zzso of zzso peptides zzso 

This study proposes a zzso method to mine a feature set of zzso zzso properties from zzso class I binding peptides to design a support zzso machine zzso based system (named zzso for the prediction of zzso zzso High performance of zzso arises mainly from an zzso zzso genetic algorithm, which aims to automatically determine the best number m out of 531 zzso properties, identify these m properties and tune zzso parameters zzso The zzso consisting of zzso human zzso class I binding peptides belonging to four classes of zzso was established from zzso a database of zzso peptides zzso et zzso zzso zzso utilizing the m zzso 23 selected properties, performs well with the accuracy of zzso using zzso zzso compared with two sequence zzso prediction methods zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is the first zzso system for prediction of zzso zzso based on zzso zzso 

A web server for prediction of zzso zzso zzso and the used zzso of zzso class I binding peptides zzso are available at zzso
