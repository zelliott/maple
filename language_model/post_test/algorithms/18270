In eye movement research in reading, the amount of data plays a crucial role for the validation of zzso A zzso problem for the analysis of the eye movement in reading are zzso when readers close their zzso zzso rate increases with increasing reading time, resulting in high data losses, especially for older adults or reading impaired zzso We present a method, based on the symbolic sequence dynamics of the eye movements, that reconstructs the horizontal position of the eyes while the reader zzso The method makes use of an observed fact that the movements of the eyes before closing or after opening contain information about the eyes movements during zzso Test results indicate that our reconstruction method is superior to methods that use simpler zzso zzso In addition, analyses of the reconstructed data show no significant zzso from the usual behavior observed in zzso
