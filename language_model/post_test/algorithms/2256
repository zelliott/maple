Recent evidence suggests that both pulse zzso monitoring and oxygen zzso therapy may be used inappropriately at times, zzso the need for improved use of pulse zzso by health-care zzso 

We studied the clinical and financial impact of a zzso zzso protocol in 2 groups of zzso Group 1 zzso zzso zzso was comprised of patients whose physicians made all zzso therapy management zzso Group 2 zzso zzso zzso was comprised of patients whose zzso therapy management was performed by respiratory therapists according to an zzso with a stop criterion of zzso zzso or zzso zzso The duration of zzso zzso therapy, the frequency of unnecessary zzso therapy, and group totals of zzso zzso were compared between groups using the zzso Rank zzso zzso 

zzso therapy was used on average zzso zzso zzso zzso in Group 1 and zzso zzso zzso in Group 2 zzso zzso zzso Sixteen zzso patients continued to receive zzso at least 24 hours after achieving a zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Group 1 had 57 zzso zzso and Group 2 had 24 zzso zzso zzso No adverse clinical events ascribed to zzso were noted in either zzso 

Our experience suggest that implementing a uniform, clinically appropriate zzso zzso for zzso zzso therapy in zzso zzso patients can shorten the duration of zzso therapy and reduce the number of zzso zzso without incurring additional zzso
