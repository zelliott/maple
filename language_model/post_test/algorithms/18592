The zzso interaction component zzso the difference between the summed zzso evoked zzso of each ear and the zzso evoked zzso zzso has been shown to be related to directional zzso However, the detection of the zzso as the most consistent part of the zzso is often zzso Furthermore, there is no clearly defined signal feature characterizing the difference between the zzso and the zzso evoked zzso zzso A closer look at the signals shows that zzso differences as well as zzso differences and variations in wave V slopes could be the reason for the formation of a zzso Using a zzso feature extraction zzso we were able to define a signal feature zzso local zzso bases zzso zzso 1) that accounts for the difference between the sum of the zzso and zzso evoked zzso zzso With use of this signal feature, reliable automated detection of differences between zzso and zzso evoked zzso is zzso As zzso 1 replicates the zzso of zzso zzso as well as of the zzso zzso it can also be seen as a correlate of zzso zzso With use of this signal feature, it is possible to judge from a given zzso evoked potential whether it contains information on zzso interaction or not, without comparing it to the sum of the zzso evoked zzso responses zzso zzso interaction can be assessed by one, instead of three, zzso by using the method described in this zzso
