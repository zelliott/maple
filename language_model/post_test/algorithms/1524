Variation in zzso access to different zzso sites is an important factor in the zzso of dental zzso This study zzso zzso how access is modified by chewing zzso and zzso zzso A finite difference computer model, described elsewhere, was zzso This allowed for diffusion and/or reaction of zzso acid product, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange was modeled in terms of a zzso zzso film covering the plaque zzso flowing directly from the zzso zzso zzso flowing from the zzso zzso pool, or zzso exchanging with the zzso zzso zzso or rates of exchange were based on previous zzso zzso The model was also tested against an in zzso study conducted by two of the zzso In addition, the three proposed models of zzso interaction were zzso and the effect of zzso film thickness zzso zzso suggested that: zzso although zzso gum chewed during a zzso challenge causes a rapid rise in plaque zzso zzso gums cause the zzso after a temporary rise resulting from increased zzso flow, to stay low for an extended zzso zzso the computer model reproduced in zzso tests reasonably well; zzso although the three models of the zzso interaction start from different zzso two lead to closely related zzso and zzso increasing the assumed zzso film thickness by a large amount zzso from 50 to 200 zzso caused no change in modeled zzso curves, as long as these changes were accompanied by appropriate reductions in film zzso in zzso zzso with the practical clearance zzso
