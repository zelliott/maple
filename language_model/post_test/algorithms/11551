Using zzso analysis, we demonstrate that it is possible to zzso changes in the zzso structure of cardiac dynamics over long periods of zzso A method was developed to calculate a zzso measure zzso to here as apparent zzso from a correlation zzso within a data window of 500 heart beats which is moved in zzso steps over the time series of the zzso intervals over 24 zzso The correspondence between the apparent dimension and the correlation dimension was tested using artificial data zzso zzso 24 hour zzso recordings of two healthy subjects and of a patient with acute zzso zzso were zzso The reliability of the analysis could be demonstrated and changes in dimension reflecting zzso as well as zzso changes were zzso
