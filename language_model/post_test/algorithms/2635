The purpose of this study was to construct a zzso gel zzso by a zzso system for zzso topical delivery of zzso The optimum zzso were screened by penetration evaluation in zzso zzso zzso gel was prepared by drawing a zzso phase zzso and zzso zzso was added as gel zzso for the zzso The optimal zzso had wide zzso zzso field and good zzso zzso The zzso size was within 100 zzso zzso comparison of the zzso throughout 24 h showed that the two zzso gel preparations of zzso provided higher zzso than that of the normal gel which had only a low cumulative amount of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 24 h after zzso zzso amount of zzso from zzso gels A and B was zzso times and zzso times that of the normal gel at 24 h zzso These results indicate that the zzso gel may be a promising vehicle for topical delivery of zzso
