A new method is presented for the calculation of the zzso zzso Potential zzso in large zzso Based on the mixed zzso zzso Mechanics zzso approach, the method assumes both a quantum and classical description for the zzso and the calculation of the zzso in the space surrounding the zzso is made using this dual zzso The zzso at points close to the zzso is zzso using a full zzso zzso while a pure classical evaluation of the zzso is used for points located at large distances from the zzso The zzso allows the user to select the desired level of accuracy in the zzso so that the definition of the regions where the zzso is zzso at the classical or zzso levels is adjusted zzso The potential use of this zzso zzso in molecular modeling studies is zzso
