The present study was undertaken to compare the zzso effect of various zzso drugs on the intravenous zzso zzso seizure threshold in zzso zzso doses of zzso needed to induce different zzso zzso zzso generalized zzso and zzso zzso of convulsions were recorded as an index of seizure zzso Furthermore, zzso (the dose of an zzso drug required to increase the zzso seizure threshold for zzso zzso by zzso was calculated for all drugs, and from these values the potency ratio was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ethanol zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (20 and 40 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was found to be the lowest among all the drugs tested, indicating higher zzso The relative potency of standard drugs to increase the zzso seizure threshold for zzso zzso was found to be: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results of the present study indicate that the intravenous zzso seizure threshold may be useful for assessing the zzso effect of drugs effective against different stages of zzso
