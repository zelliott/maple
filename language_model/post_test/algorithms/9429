To use recently developed zzso equations to predict zzso water partition zzso zzso apply these predictions to whole body zzso volume of distribution at steady state zzso zzso and explain the differences in the extent of drug distribution both within and across the various compound zzso 

zzso values were predicted for 92 structurally diverse compounds in rats and 140 in humans by two zzso The first approach incorporated zzso values predicted for 13 zzso whereas the second was restricted to zzso 

The prediction accuracy was good for both approaches in rats and humans, with zzso and zzso of the predicted zzso values agreeing with in zzso data to within factors of zzso and 3, zzso 

zzso distribution processes were identified as zzso zzso and dissolution where the former is higher for zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso interactions with zzso zzso can predominate for zzso bases when affinities zzso by binding to constituents within zzso are zzso For zzso drugs zzso binding dominates when plasma protein binding is zzso This ability to explain drug distribution and link it to zzso properties can help guide the compound selection zzso
