We propose a zzso method based on the geometric representation of images as zzso zzso embedded in a higher zzso zzso The zzso is formulated as a zzso problem, where the contours are described by a level set function and the objective functional zzso to the surface of the image zzso In this geometric zzso both zzso and zzso terms of the zzso are represented by a single functional that zzso zzso the zzso of the level set function with the zzso of the image and results in a zzso criterion that exploits the directional information of image zzso to overcome image zzso and fragmented zzso The proposed zzso combines this robust alignment of zzso with attractive properties of previous methods developed in the same geometric zzso 1) the natural zzso of image channels proposed for zzso diffusion and 2) the ability of zzso surfaces to detect weak edges and close fragmented zzso The potential of such a geometric approach lies in the general definition of zzso zzso which naturally zzso existing zzso methods (the zzso active zzso the active contours without edges, and the robust edge zzso to higher zzso spaces, zzso images, and feature zzso Our experiments show that the proposed technique improves the zzso of zzso images, images subject to zzso and images characterized by geometric structures like zzso or zzso
