Pulmonary zzso hypertension zzso is a major cause of mortality in systemic sclerosis zzso zzso guidelines for zzso recommend multiple zzso including annual zzso which together have low specificity and may not be zzso We sought to evaluate the zzso accuracy of serum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in combination with pulmonary function tests zzso zzso zzso in a screening zzso for zzso 

We evaluated our proposed zzso zzso with zzso on 49 consecutive zzso patients with suspected pulmonary hypertension undergoing right heart zzso zzso The zzso accuracy of the proposed zzso was compared with existing screening recommendations, and is presented as sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value zzso and negative zzso value zzso 

Overall, 27 patients were found to have pulmonary hypertension zzso at zzso while 22 had no zzso The sensitivity, zzso zzso and zzso of the proposed zzso for zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso current European Society of zzso zzso Respiratory Society zzso guidelines achieved a sensitivity, zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In an alternate case scenario analysis, zzso a zzso prevalence of zzso the proposed zzso achieved a sensitivity, zzso zzso and zzso for zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The combination of zzso with zzso is a sensitive, yet simple and zzso screening strategy for zzso Patients with a positive screening result can be referred for zzso and further zzso testing for zzso In this way, it may be possible to shift the burden of routine screening away from zzso The findings of this study should be confirmed in larger zzso
