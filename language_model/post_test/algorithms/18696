zzso is a progressive zzso procedure for multiple alignments of protein zzso It searches a library of zzso alignments for all zzso alignments in which a specified number of zzso is consistently zzso These alignments are progressively expanded to include additional proteins and more zzso equivalent zzso subject to certain zzso This action involves zzso the aligned proteins by their zzso equivalent zzso and searching for additional zzso atoms that lie close in zzso The performance of zzso is illustrated and compared with several extant multiple structure alignment methods by using as test the zzso zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso gives better definitions of the common structural features in the structurally more diverse proteins of the zzso and zzso zzso but it yields comparable results for the more similar zzso When no consistent multiple alignments can be derived for all members of a protein group, our procedure is still capable of automatically generating consistent alignments and common core definitions for zzso of the zzso This finding is illustrated for proteins of the zzso fold and zzso zzso believed to share common structural features, and should be very instrumental in zzso modeling and investigations of protein zzso
