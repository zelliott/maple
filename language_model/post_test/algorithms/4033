There is overwhelming evidence that zzso receptors zzso exhibit several distinct low-energy zzso each of which might favor binding to different zzso and/or lead to different downstream zzso zzso the function of such proteins requires knowledge of the ensemble of low-energy zzso that might play a role in this zzso zzso We earlier reported the zzso method for efficiently sampling the zzso zzso 35 million zzso resulting from zzso zzso about the axis zzso of all seven zzso zzso zzso showing that the experimental structure is reliably selected as the best zzso from this zzso However, various zzso differ sufficiently in the tilts of the zzso that this method need not predict the optimum zzso starting from any other zzso In this paper, we introduce the zzso method in which the tilt angles zzso zzso are zzso simultaneously with zzso zzso efficiently enough that it is practical and sufficient to sample (5 zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso 13 trillion zzso This method can correctly identify the optimum structure of a zzso starting with the template from a different zzso We have validated this method by predicting known crystal structure zzso starting from the template of a different protein zzso We find that the zzso zzso ensemble includes the higher energy zzso associated with the active protein in addition to those associated with the more stable inactive zzso This methodology was then applied to design and zzso confirm structures of three zzso of the zzso zzso zzso associated with different zzso
