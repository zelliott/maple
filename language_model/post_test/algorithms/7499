We present a registration framework that combines both tissue zzso and zzso zzso zzso The estimated zzso transform is zzso and calculated by modeling its corresponding zzso field using continuous zzso A new cost function using both zzso image zzso zzso and zzso zzso is also zzso Registration accuracy was evaluated on synthetic data with known ground zzso zzso showed that our method allows zzso wall motion with higher accuracy than when using a single zzso On patient data, both displacement and zzso zzso were compared with the ones obtained from widely used commercial software using either zzso images or zzso Our method demonstrated to be more robust to image noise while being independent from the beam zzso
