Over half of the DNA of zzso zzso is zzso and one of the emerging zzso in the field of zzso research is zzso zzso or zzso induced zzso We argue that fused zzso transcripts constitute neglected pathological mechanism akin to copy number variation, due to loss of zzso zzso ratios in protein zzso An obstacle for zzso zzso of published zzso is the traditional nomenclature of merged transcript neighbors under same zzso zzso zzso transcripts cover zzso of zzso but are only loosely overlapping in zzso They were most enriched in systems medicine zzso concerning zzso zzso and zzso disorders in the zzso zzso zzso zzso evaluated with external zzso zzso Clinical zzso is good news since new disease zzso offer new zzso We identified zzso zzso centered around zzso the zzso zzso network, the zzso system, and zzso zzso surveillance as vulnerable hotspot zzso As a zzso zzso interference would require zzso of zzso from symptomatic tissue contra healthy control tissue from the same zzso
