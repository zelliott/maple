zzso tracking provides a powerful technique for measuring dynamic cellular processes on the level of individual zzso Much recent work has been devoted to using single particle tracking to measure long-range movement of particles on the cell surface, including methods for automated zzso and tracking of particles zzso However, most particle tracking studies to date ignore cell surface zzso and dynamic cellular zzso factors frequently present in zzso relevant zzso In this report, we perform quantitative evaluation of zzso tracking on curved and zzso cell zzso We also introduce a new hybrid method that uses zzso cellular modeling for improved zzso of zzso tracking zzso on the surfaces of cells undergoing zzso This method combines zzso and bulk zzso zzso in an automated manner to enable more accurate and robust characterization of dynamic cell physiology and zzso
