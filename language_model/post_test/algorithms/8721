zzso : zzso fiber-optic zzso is a widespread medical procedure for the diagnosis and treatment of lung zzso zzso systems are needed to track the flexible zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso tracking is currently the only technology used clinically for this zzso The registration between zzso tracking and patient anatomy may become inaccurate due to breathing motion, so the addition of zzso tracking has been proposed as a hybrid zzso zzso zzso : When zzso tracking is used as an zzso for image zzso small changes in the zzso may lead to different local zzso and noise is amplified by hybrid zzso The tracking output is modeled as continuous and uses zzso for zzso thus zzso is greatly zzso The zzso pose relative to zzso zzso data is zzso using zzso zzso for position and zzso linear zzso zzso for zzso zzso : The hybrid method was evaluated using ground truth poses manually selected by experts, where mean zzso agreement was determined as zzso zzso Using four dynamic phantom data sets, the accuracy was zzso zzso which is equivalent to previous zzso Compared to zzso methods, zzso zzso was improved from zzso to zzso zzso zzso : zzso image and electromagnetic zzso guidance provides a more realistic and physically plausible solution with significantly less zzso This quantitative result is confirmed by visual comparison of real and virtual video, where the virtual video output is much more consistent and zzso with fewer occasions of tracking loss or unexpected movement compared with previous zzso
