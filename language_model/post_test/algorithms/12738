zzso pigmented skin zzso in general practice is zzso zzso has been shown to increase diagnostic accuracy for melanoma in referred zzso We aimed to develop and validate a scoring system for zzso diagnosis of pigmented zzso in primary zzso 

This study was conducted in two consecutive settings in the UK and Australia, and occurred in three zzso 1) Development of the primary care scoring zzso zzso on a zzso of zzso from the UK zzso 2) zzso of the zzso on a different zzso of zzso from the same UK zzso 3) zzso of the zzso on a new set of zzso from an Australian primary care zzso Patients presenting with a pigmented zzso were recruited from 6 general practices in the UK and 2 primary care skin cancer clinics in zzso The following data were obtained for each zzso clinical zzso zzso digital zzso and digital zzso zzso were interpreted by an expert and validated against zzso where possible, or expert clinical review of all available data for each zzso 

A total of zzso patients with zzso zzso were zzso Most zzso were benign zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The original zzso diagnostic zzso did not perform well because of the higher prevalence of zzso zzso and zzso seen in primary zzso A primary care scoring zzso zzso was developed to account for zzso In the UK sample the zzso had the following characteristics for the diagnosis of zzso sensitivity zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the Australian sample the zzso had the following characteristics for the diagnosis of zzso sensitivity zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In an analysis of zzso for which zzso diagnosis was available zzso zzso zzso the zzso had a significantly greater Area Under the zzso than the zzso checklist for the diagnosis of melanoma zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso for zzso 

The zzso could have a useful role in improving primary care management of pigmented skin zzso Further work is needed to develop and validate the zzso in other primary care populations and to evaluate the zzso of zzso management of pigmented zzso using zzso
