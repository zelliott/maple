zzso zzso data of zzso from an zzso solution of methanol onto a zzso zzso zzso were acquired by frontal analysis zzso at six different temperatures, in a wide concentration zzso The zzso fitting of these data provided the zzso model as best zzso model, a conclusion further supported by the results of the calculation of the affinity energy distribution zzso The zzso parameters were obtained using several methods, the fitting of zzso zzso data, the calculation of the zzso and the inverse method, that uses overloaded zzso band zzso The different values obtained are in close zzso They allow a quantitative investigation of the separate properties of the low- and the zzso sites on the zzso zzso zzso the temperature decreases the zzso capacity of the low-energy zzso sites and the zzso constant of the zzso zzso In contrast, increasing the temperature does not cause any significant changes in either the zzso capacity of the zzso sites or the zzso constant of the low-energy zzso
