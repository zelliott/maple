Recent studies of learning about elements of zzso zzso in honey bees identified several types of interactions between mixture zzso such as overshadowing and zzso The latter phenomenon in particular indicates at least a limited ability of subjects to identify the most salient element of a zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso in the zzso zzso the first zzso in which synaptic interaction affects sensory processing, could give rise to both effects given the incorporation of modifiable zzso onto zzso zzso The neural model of the zzso lobe that we present incorporates identified cell types and includes a biologically realistic zzso zzso with which modifiable zzso synaptic interactions take zzso A learning rule that incorporates modifiable connections from output zzso zzso onto the zzso zzso is sufficient to account for behavioral results on zzso and zzso A second type of zzso connection from the zzso zzso onto local zzso zzso is necessary to reproduce behavioral results from blocking and zzso We suggest that the neural representations of odor zzso in the zzso lobe can be modified by previous exposure to one of the mixture zzso These results provide testable hypotheses that will guide future behavioral and zzso zzso
