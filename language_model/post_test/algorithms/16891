Recently, zzso and colleagues observed that the average distances between zzso ends of zzso molecules are very small and largely independent of sequence zzso This observation is based on zzso zzso as well as theoretical arguments maximizing certain zzso zzso In this article, we zzso the exact distribution of zzso distances of zzso secondary structures for any finite zzso Furthermore, we zzso the limit distribution and show that for zzso zzso 30 the exact distribution and the limit distribution are very zzso Our results show that the distances of random zzso secondary structures are zzso lower than those of minimum free energy structures of random zzso zzso
