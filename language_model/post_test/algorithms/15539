The use of airborne zzso remote sensing imagery for automated mapping of submerged aquatic vegetation zzso in the tidal Potomac River was investigated for near to real-time resource assessment and zzso Airborne zzso imagery and field zzso zzso were obtained in October of zzso A spectral library database containing selected zzso and airborne sensor zzso was developed for use in image zzso The spectral library is used to automate the processing of zzso imagery for potential real-time material identification and zzso Field based zzso were compared to the airborne imagery using the database to identify and map two species of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso accuracy of the vegetation maps derived from zzso imagery was determined by comparison to a product that combined aerial photography and field based sampling at the end of the zzso growing zzso The zzso and databases developed in this study will be useful with the current and forthcoming zzso zzso remote sensing zzso
