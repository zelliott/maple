We present several zzso of a zzso zzso which all evolve zzso sets adapted to the geometry of general target zzso in metric spaces, and we briefly discuss their relevance to biological zzso In all zzso one repeatedly draws random points from the target zzso 1), each time selecting from the tree to be grown the point which is closest to the point just randomly drawn zzso zzso then adding to the tree a new point in the vicinity of that closest point zzso 3 or zzso zzso The zzso differ in their zzso rule, which can use the position of the target point drawn, or zzso The informed case relates to the early zzso of zzso maps that mimic zzso It is simple enough to be studied zzso near its branching points, which generally follow some unsuccessful zzso Further zzso step 2 leads to a fast version of the zzso that builds zzso zzso search trees, and we show how to use it in zzso spaces to address a problem relevant to zzso medical imaging and artificial zzso In the case of an zzso zzso rule, some adaptation also takes place, the zzso near branching points is zzso very similar to the informed case, and we discuss its interpretations within the zzso zzso
