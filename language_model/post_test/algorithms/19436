The purpose of this work was to determine the accuracy and precision of a real-time zzso system zzso for the monitoring of external markers used on patients receiving zzso zzso Random and systematic errors in the system were evaluated for linear zzso circular zzso and elliptical zzso continuous motions, and for a set of zzso positions offset from an zzso A zzso beam data measurement system and a computer controlled platform (which could be programmed to give motion in zzso were used to move a zzso test zzso The test object had four markers of the type used on zzso Three markers were aligned in the central plane and a fourth was positioned out of zzso Errors were expressed as zzso from the planned positions at the sampled time zzso The marked points on the test object were tracked for the linear motion case with a variation from the true position of less than zzso zzso except for two extreme zzso The variation was within zzso zzso when the lights were dimmed and when the zzso of the movement was zzso zzso The zzso circular motion was tracked with a standard zzso of 1 zzso or less over four zzso The sampling rates of the system were found to be zzso s when it was monitoring actively and zzso s zzso The recorded zzso zzso of known zzso positions were within zzso zzso of the value from the computer controlled platform moving the test zzso The elliptical motions in zzso were tracked to zzso zzso in two directions zzso and generally to within zzso zzso for the third direction zzso however, specific marked points could display an error of up to 5 zzso at certain positions in zzso The overall displacement error for the zzso motion was zzso zzso with a standard zzso of zzso zzso The system performance is satisfactory for use in tracking external marker motion during zzso zzso
