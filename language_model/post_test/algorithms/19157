The zzso subdivision strategy which zzso a zzso matching problem into numerous local rigid transformations is a very common approach in image zzso While mutual information zzso has proven to be a very robust and reliable similarity measure for zzso matching of zzso images, numerous problems have to be faced if it is applied to zzso images, compromising its usefulness for such subdivision zzso We examine and explain the loss of zzso statistical consistency along the zzso zzso Information theoretical measures are proposed to identify the problematic regions in order to overcome the zzso zzso This does not only improve the accuracy and zzso of the zzso but also can be used as a very efficient stopping criterion for the further subdivision of zzso in the zzso which drastically reduces the zzso cost of the entire registration zzso Moreover, we present a new intensity mapping technique allowing to replace zzso by more reliable measures for small zzso Integrated into the zzso zzso this mapping can locally transform the zzso images into an intermediate zzso This intensity mapping uses the local joint intensity zzso of the zzso registered zzso and allows the use of the more robust and zzso more efficient zzso zzso zzso for the matching at lower levels of the zzso
