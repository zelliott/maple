zzso zzso is now the leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and zzso While the molecular basis of this disease remains uncertain, evidence is emerging that gene expression profiles of left zzso zzso isolated from failing versus zzso patients differ zzso In this study, we use zzso zzso zzso with approximately zzso zzso to characterize differences in the expression profiles zzso To facilitate interpretation of experimental data, we evaluate zzso for zzso of zzso data and for zzso of gene expression zzso using a control zzso data zzso We then use these methods to identify statistically significant changes in the expression levels of genes not previously implicated in the molecular zzso of heart zzso These regulated genes take part in diverse cellular zzso including transcription, zzso zzso and zzso function, zzso of the zzso zzso membrane zzso and zzso
