In quantitative trait mapping and zzso zzso zzso variable selection methods have gained popularity in conjunction with the increase in marker data and zzso zzso Whereas zzso methods are common tools in zzso zzso rigorous decision making in mapping studies using such models is not well established and the zzso of zzso results is subject to zzso assumptions because of weak biological prior zzso 

Here, we evaluate the impact of prior specifications in a zzso zzso variable selection method which is based on a mixture of uniform zzso applied to genetic marker effects that we presented in a previous zzso Unlike most other shrinkage approaches, the use of a mixture of uniform zzso provides a coherent framework for zzso based on zzso zzso To evaluate the zzso of genetic association under varying prior zzso zzso factors are compared as signals of positive marker association, whereas zzso estimated breeding values are considered for zzso zzso The impact of specific prior specifications is reduced by calculation of combined estimates from multiple zzso A Gibbs zzso is used to perform zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso zzso and a generalized zzso zzso as a faster alternative for maximum a zzso point zzso The performance of the method is evaluated by using two publicly available data examples: the simulated zzso zzso data set and a real data set from a population of zzso 

Combined estimates of zzso factors were very successful in identifying quantitative trait zzso and the ranking of zzso factors was fairly stable among markers with positive signals of association under varying prior zzso but their zzso varied zzso zzso estimated breeding values using the mixture of uniform zzso compared well to other approaches for both data sets and loss of accuracy with the generalized zzso zzso was small as compared to that with zzso 

Since no zzso method to specify zzso is available for complex biological phenomena, exploring a wide variety of prior specifications and combining results provides some solution to this zzso For this purpose, the mixture of uniform zzso approach is especially zzso because it comprises a wide and flexible family of zzso and zzso intensive zzso can be carried out in a reasonable amount of zzso
