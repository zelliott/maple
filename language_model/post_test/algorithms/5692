Both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso arc therapy zzso deliver radiation using zzso beams with zzso zzso We report a zzso study comparing zzso aspects of these two zzso 

Eight patients each were selected from the University of Maryland zzso and the University of Wisconsin Cancer Center zzso zzso for a total of 16 zzso Four cancer sites including brain, head and neck zzso zzso and prostate were zzso zzso zzso plans were generated at zzso using zzso zzso zzso and zzso plans were generated at zzso using zzso II zzso All 16 cases were planned based on the identical zzso zzso prescriptions, and planning zzso All plans were swapped for analysis at the same time after final zzso zzso zzso for targets and critical zzso were compared based on zzso zzso the zzso time, monitor units, and estimated leakage zzso After the disclosure of comparison results, zzso was done for both techniques to minimize diversity in zzso focus from different zzso 

For the 16 cases zzso the average zzso time was zzso minutes for zzso and zzso minutes for zzso zzso zzso provided better target dose zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso with a lower maximum dose zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso numbers were comparable, with zzso being superior to zzso zzso zzso zzso The doses to normal zzso using these two techniques were comparable, with zzso showing lower doses for more critical zzso After planning comparison results were exchanged, both techniques demonstrated improvements in dose zzso or treatment delivery zzso 

Both techniques created highly zzso plans that met or exceeded the planning zzso The delivery time and total monitor units were lower in zzso than in zzso plans, whereas zzso provided higher target dose zzso
