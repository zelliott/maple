The zzso of zzso visual identification suggests a zzso process in which neural activity is zzso through a number of cortical zzso The process is modeled by using a zzso chain, leading to a zzso model which involves zzso zzso waves through a sequence of zzso zzso and analysis of the zzso behavior, especially in the presence of noise, predict enhancement of wave propagation for a range of noise zzso zzso studies confirm this zzso The results are discussed in terms of zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso processes such as zzso visual identification may benefit from moderate levels of zzso
