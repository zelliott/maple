An important zzso of membrane proteins are the zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso regions are made up of zzso Given the obvious biological and medical significance of these zzso it is of tremendous practical importance to identify the location of zzso zzso The difficulty of zzso the secondary or zzso structure of zzso proteins using experimental techniques has led to a surge of interest in applying techniques from machine learning and zzso to zzso secondary structure from primary structure in these zzso We are therefore interested in determining which zzso properties are most useful for discriminating zzso segments from zzso segments in zzso zzso and for discriminating zzso zzso segments from zzso structured segments in zzso zzso and in using the results of these investigations to develop zzso to identify zzso segments in zzso zzso 

We determined that the most useful properties for discriminating zzso segments from zzso segments and for discriminating zzso zzso segments from zzso structured segments in zzso proteins were zzso zzso and flexibility, and used the results of this analysis to construct zzso to discriminate zzso segments from zzso segments using four zzso zzso two zzso of the zzso Global zzso algorithm, a decision tree algorithm, and a support zzso machine zzso All four techniques exhibited good performance, with zzso zzso of approximately zzso 

Several interesting observations emerged from our zzso zzso zzso segments and zzso segments tend to have opposite zzso zzso proteins appear to be much richer in zzso zzso segments than other zzso and, in approximately zzso of zzso proteins that contain zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso segments are close to zzso zzso
