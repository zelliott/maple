The availability of targeted therapies has created a need for precise zzso of zzso cell lung zzso zzso The aim of this study was to assess the utility of zzso markers in zzso poorly differentiated zzso and to compare the results of zzso zzso on zzso with the corresponding zzso Thirty-nine cases of zzso that could not be further classified on biopsy and had subsequent zzso specimens were zzso zzso of the tumor was based on the zzso zzso using the World Health Organization zzso All zzso and zzso were stained with zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso of the zzso family), zzso zzso and zzso The specimens included 20 zzso zzso 15 zzso cell zzso zzso and 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso was positive in zzso from 16 of 20 zzso 2 of 4 zzso and none of the zzso zzso was positive in all 15 zzso 2 of 20 zzso (both were also positive for zzso and zzso zzso and none of the zzso zzso was positive in 11 of 15 zzso (all zzso zzso but none of the zzso or zzso zzso A stained 11 of 19 zzso (all zzso zzso but none of the other zzso zzso for zzso was present in 19 of 19 zzso and 9 of 15 zzso zzso stained both zzso (15 of zzso and zzso (12 of zzso The combination of zzso zzso A, zzso and zzso allowed an accurate zzso of 30 zzso zzso zzso Of 232 pairs of slides zzso and zzso stained with zzso zzso 12 zzso showed discrepancies in zzso zzso between zzso and their corresponding zzso zzso zzso using a combination of zzso zzso A, zzso and zzso allows zzso of poorly differentiated zzso on small lung zzso in most zzso zzso in zzso zzso between zzso and zzso are zzso
