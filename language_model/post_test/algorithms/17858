We performed zzso zzso folding simulation for a zzso zzso zzso zzso code zzso with a modified zzso force field using the generalized Born zzso model zzso For efficient zzso zzso we extended a previously developed novel zzso exchange molecular dynamics zzso into a zzso zzso Starting from a fully extended zzso we were able to locate the zzso structure in the global free minimum region at 280 zzso The current approach, which combines the more balanced force field with the efficient sampling zzso demonstrates a clear advantage in direct folding simulation at zzso zzso
