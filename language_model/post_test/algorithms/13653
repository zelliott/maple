Identification of essential proteins plays a significant role in understanding minimal requirements for the cellular survival and zzso Many zzso methods have been proposed for predicting essential proteins by using the zzso features of zzso interaction zzso zzso However, most of these methods ignored intrinsic biological meaning of zzso Moreover, zzso data contains many false zzso and false zzso To overcome these limitations, recently many research groups have started to focus on identification of essential proteins by zzso zzso networks with other biological zzso However, none of their methods has widely been zzso 

By considering the facts that essential proteins are more zzso zzso than zzso proteins and essential proteins frequently bind each other, we propose an iteration method for predicting essential proteins by zzso the zzso with zzso networks, named by zzso zzso from other methods, zzso identifies essential proteins depending on not only the connections between proteins but also their zzso properties and features of their zzso zzso is implemented to predict essential proteins in zzso zzso Experimental results show that zzso can achieve higher identification accuracy than eight other existing zzso methods in terms of area under the curve zzso Moreover, zzso identifies a large amount of essential proteins which have been ignored by eight other existing zzso methods because of their zzso Many proteins ranked in top 100 by zzso are both essential and belong to the complexes with certain biological zzso Furthermore, no matter how many reference organisms were selected, zzso zzso all eight other existing zzso zzso While using as many as possible reference organisms can improve the performance of zzso Additionally, zzso also shows good prediction performance in zzso coli zzso 

The accuracy of predicting essential proteins can be improved by zzso the zzso with zzso zzso
