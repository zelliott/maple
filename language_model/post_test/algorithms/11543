The experimental procedure of zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can reveal most of the intermediate zzso states of zzso either at equilibrium or in a kinetic zzso In this paper, a model of zzso zzso zzso under conditions of negligible reverse reaction, is derived with particular attention to zzso The model leads to a zzso zzso First, the ratios of the forward rates are determined by fitting the model to zzso zzso zzso zzso Second zzso an auxiliary relation is used to deduce the scale factor for the rates that make the model consistent with time information if such is zzso The procedure has been applied to zzso binding of the zzso carbon monoxide (this zzso and zzso zzso in zzso
