The zzso zzso zzso is a key component of the cardiac zzso zzso Although it is known that receptors for the zzso hormone zzso zzso are expressed in the zzso there is very little information available on the zzso effects of zzso on AVN zzso This study zzso for the first time acute zzso effects of zzso on AVN cellular zzso 

zzso experiments were conducted in which recordings were made from rabbit isolated AVN cells at zzso using the zzso patch clamp recording zzso 

Application of zzso (10 zzso to spontaneously active AVN cells led rapidly zzso zzso zzso to membrane potential zzso and zzso of spontaneous action zzso zzso This effect was prevented by zzso of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso (1 zzso and was not zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso experiments, zzso partially inhibited zzso calcium current zzso and rapid delayed zzso zzso current zzso whilst it zzso activated the zzso current zzso at zzso negative to the zzso range, and activated an inwardly zzso current that was inhibited by both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (2 zzso each of these effects was sensitive to zzso zzso zzso In cells exposed to zzso zzso application did not produce membrane potential zzso or immediate zzso of spontaneous zzso instead, there was a progressive decline in zzso zzso and zzso of maximum zzso zzso 

zzso applied zzso exerts a direct zzso effect on AVN cell zzso The dominant effect of zzso in this study was zzso of a zzso sensitive inwardly zzso zzso current via zzso zzso which led rapidly to cell zzso
