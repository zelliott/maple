zzso artificial neural networks zzso and hybrid evolutionary zzso zzso were applied to zzso and model 12 years of zzso zzso data of the shallow zzso Lake zzso in zzso The results have improved understanding of relationships between changing zzso zzso zzso species zzso and annual zzso zzso The data analysis by zzso ANN revealed that total zzso abundance and zzso zzso zzso in typical dry years are much higher than those in typical wet zzso It also showed that high zzso zzso in dry years coincided with the dominance of the toxic zzso zzso whilst in typical wet years zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso were used to discover rule sets to explain and forecast the occurrence of high zzso zzso in relation to water quality and climate zzso The results facilitated early warning by zzso forecasting of zzso zzso based on zzso and meteorological input data, achieving an zzso for zzso
