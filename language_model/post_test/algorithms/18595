For the first time, four different methods to determine the degree of molecular orientation from polarized zzso zzso zzso are zzso The great influence of molecular orientation on the properties of zzso has driven the development of multiple experimental techniques and zzso This study is based on the zzso ring stretching zzso of zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso It is shown that simply zzso the band intensity obtained with the polarization parallel and perpendicular to the unique axis of the sample provides a good qualitative method to observe the evolution of orientation in a series of similar zzso To zzso compare the degree of orientation one needs to zzso a more complex method yielding the second- and zzso parameters of the orientation distribution function zzso and zzso zzso To date, most studies have been based on the assumption of a zzso zzso zzso zzso It is shown that this assumption is highly questionable although this method has been used fairly successfully in the zzso This method results in orientation parameters that are clearly different from those obtained with the two more complex zzso The most complex method, both theoretically and zzso requires the most zzso per zzso Major problems have occurred when trying to calculate the desired zzso in particular for samples with high zzso These problems are related to experimental complexities occurring for zzso when the samples are zzso with respect to the polarization direction of the incident zzso These zzso are replaced by a simple determination of zzso ratio in the third zzso This method assumes that the zzso ratio is independent of changes in molecular orientation and zzso It was found that this assumption is not zzso Thus, the most complex method is the method of choice to zzso determine the second- and zzso parameters of the orientation distribution function, unless one has knowledge of the zzso ratio of each sample being zzso That knowledge permits the use of an zzso simpler method to obtain the desired zzso
