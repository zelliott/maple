In the Earth's magnetic field, it is possible to observe spin systems consisting of unlike spins that exhibit strongly coupled zzso zzso zzso Such zzso result when the zzso between two unlike spins is of the same order of magnitude as the difference in their zzso zzso zzso Although the analysis of zzso zzso involving only zzso zzso has been discussed since the early days of zzso zzso zzso zzso involving zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have rarely been zzso Two examples are presented here, the zzso zzso zzso and the ammonium zzso zzso For the zzso zzso zzso and in an Earth's field of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso exhibit features that both zzso and zzso zzso theory are unable to zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso theory adequately describes zzso zzso zzso of the ammonium zzso zzso where zzso when zzso and zzso zzso to an early report, we find that the zzso zzso zzso are independent of the sign of zzso zzso analysis of zzso systems consisting of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are also zzso
