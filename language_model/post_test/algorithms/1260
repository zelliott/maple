This study evaluates the performance of the newly developed high-resolution zzso PET scanner zzso zzso zzso 

The scanner consists of four rings of 72 zzso zzso block detectors each, covering an zzso field of view of zzso zzso with a patient port of zzso zzso A single block detector is divided into an 8 zzso 8 zzso giving a total of 32 rings with zzso detectors zzso The dimensions of a single detector element are zzso zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso The scanner is equipped with zzso zzso zzso for two-dimensional two-dimensional zzso as well as with three zzso line sources for transmission scans and daily quality zzso The spatial resolution, scatter zzso count rate, sensitivity, uniformity and accuracy of the implemented correction zzso were evaluated after the National zzso Manufacturers Association protocol using the standard acquisition zzso 

The zzso resolution in the two-dimensional mode is zzso zzso zzso zzso in the center and increases to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at a distance of r zzso 20 zzso from the zzso The zzso slice zzso measured in the two-dimensional mode varies between zzso and zzso zzso zzso over the zzso field of zzso In the three-dimensional mode the average zzso resolution varies between zzso zzso zzso in the center and zzso zzso at r zzso 20 zzso The scatter fraction is zzso zzso for a lower energy zzso level of 350 zzso The maximum true event count rate of 263 zzso zzso was measured at an activity concentration of 142 zzso zzso The total system sensitivity for true events is zzso zzso zzso From the uniformity zzso we obtained a volume zzso of zzso zzso and a system zzso of zzso zzso The implemented three-dimensional scatter correction zzso reveals very favorable properties, whereas the three-dimensional zzso correction yields slightly inaccurate results in low- and zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso has an excellent, nearly zzso spatial resolution, which is advantageous for brain and small animal zzso While the relatively low slice sensitivity may hamper the capability for performing fast dynamic two-dimensional studies, the scanner offers a sufficient sensitivity and count rate capacity for fully three-dimensional zzso zzso
