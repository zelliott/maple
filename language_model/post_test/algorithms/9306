zzso and assembly of expressed sequence tags zzso constitute the basis for most zzso descriptions of a zzso This approach is limited by the decline in sequence quality toward the end of each zzso zzso both sequence zzso and zzso Here, we exploit the available draft zzso sequence of the zzso green zzso zzso zzso to guide zzso and to correct errors in the zzso We have grouped all available zzso and zzso sequences into zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso based on zzso and generated zzso zzso of average length 934 zzso We predict that roughly zzso of our zzso represent full-length zzso Compared to previous zzso zzso show extended zzso zzso increased accuracy and a reduction in zzso Because our assembly protocol also uses zzso with no corresponding zzso zzso it provides sequence information for genes interrupted by sequence zzso zzso analysis of randomly sampled zzso reveals several hundred putative cases of alternative zzso many overlapping zzso units and new genes not identified by gene prediction zzso Our zzso although developed for and tailored to the zzso zzso zzso can be exploited by any zzso zzso project for which both a draft zzso sequence and zzso are zzso
