zzso contrast, C, is an excellent metric for contrast in images with periodic zzso profiles, such as zzso but is not suitable for images consisting of isolated stimulus zzso zzso single zzso other metrics have been devised for such zzso But what metric should be used for zzso images such as are commonly used in zzso and zzso Previously the standard zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to the root mean square, zzso of the zzso has been taken as a measure of contrast, but on little more than intuitive zzso The zzso of this speculative usage is zzso zzso are described in which a wide range of zzso images of various compositions was used and the adapting power of these images zzso This was taken as an index of their visual zzso The contrast and zzso effects of the stimuli were expressed in terms of six candidate zzso including zzso to discover which would give the most lawful description of the experimental zzso The usefulness and zzso of the zzso measure were zzso The effects of mean zzso were also measured and a general expression that would take them into account was zzso Finally, on the basis of zzso zzso in which spatial filters with properties zzso those of retinal zzso cells were used, a possible theoretical account for the success of the zzso metric is zzso
