This work addresses the problem of zzso signal content from protein mass zzso zzso A zzso decomposition of these zzso is used to focus on local zzso structure by defining zzso zzso zzso of features is accompanied by an efficient method for calculating the location of features which avoids zzso of zzso ratios or zzso zzso zzso serve as zzso functions indicating the regions of high density of features in the zzso These regions provide bins within which features are zzso and compared across zzso As a preliminary step, the locations of prominent features within zzso bins may be used for a crude registration of zzso The zzso decomposition, the zzso feature definition, the calculation of feature locations, and subsequent zzso of features are carried out by way of a zzso zzso zzso
