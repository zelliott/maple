To develop an zzso for predicting passive transfer status of zzso of various ages, using the zzso age and serum zzso zzso zzso 

Prospective zzso 

51 zzso Columbia, and zzso zzso from 1 to 16 days zzso 

zzso was obtained from all zzso zzso zzso activity was measured, using a commercially available zzso zzso zzso concentration was determined by use of zzso zzso zzso serum zzso concentration was estimated from sample zzso zzso lamb age, and the published zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso models were developed to estimate zzso serum zzso concentration as a function of the natural zzso of serum zzso activity zzso and natural zzso of lamb age zzso at the time of zzso These zzso models were then used to calculate serum zzso activities that were equivalent to various zzso zzso zzso in zzso of various zzso 

zzso and zzso were significantly associated with estimated zzso zzso zzso zzso serum zzso concentration could be predicted using the formula: zzso zzso zzso + zzso + zzso The model was moderately accurate in predicting serum zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso activity can be used to assess passive transfer status of zzso
