zzso zzso used in different biotechnology applications are designed with zzso zzso For instance, zzso origins of replication or zzso zzso sites are zzso Similarly, zzso integration or viral delivery of an expression cassette zzso specific structural zzso As de zzso gene synthesis and synthetic biology methods zzso many biotechnology zzso the design of zzso expression zzso becomes the new zzso In this context, it is desirable to formalize zzso design strategies zzso in different zzso 

Using the design of zzso to express genes in the zzso of zzso zzso as an example, we show that a zzso design strategy can be zzso as a zzso zzso We have developed a zzso editor of zzso zzso usable by biologists without prior exposure to language zzso This environment makes it possible for biologists to zzso improve their design strategies throughout the course of a zzso It is also possible to ensure that zzso designed with early zzso of the language are consistent with the latest iteration of the zzso 

The zzso grammar editor is part of the zzso zzso A public instance of zzso is available at zzso zzso source code is available from zzso and licensed under the zzso zzso open source zzso
