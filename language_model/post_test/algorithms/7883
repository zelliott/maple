One essential step in the massive analysis of zzso profiles is the calculation of the correlation zzso a value used to select pairs of genes with similar or inverse zzso profiles across a large fraction of the biological conditions zzso Until now, the choice between the two available methods for calculating the zzso has been dictated mainly by technological zzso Specifically, in analyses based on zzso techniques, researchers have been required to use zzso zzso zzso the correlation between gene expression changes measured between several pairs of biological conditions, expressed for example as zzso In contrast, in analyses of single-channel techniques scientists have been restricted to the use of zzso zzso zzso correlation between gene expression zzso To our knowledge, nobody has ever examined the possible benefits of using zzso instead of zzso in massive analyses of single channel zzso zzso 

We describe here how single-channel techniques can be treated like zzso techniques and used to generate both gene expression changes and zzso zzso We also present a new method that allows the calculation of both positive and negative correlation zzso between zzso First, we perform systematic comparisons between two given biological conditions and zzso for each comparison, genes as increased zzso decreased zzso or not changed zzso As a result, the original series of zzso gene expression level measures assigned to each gene is replaced by an ordered string of zzso zzso zzso zzso with the length of the string corresponding to the number of zzso In a second step, positive and negative zzso zzso zzso are constructed by calculating statistically significant positive or negative correlation scores for any pair of genes by comparing their strings of zzso 

This new method, applied to four different large data sets, has allowed us to construct distinct zzso zzso with similar zzso We have also developed a technique to translate these zzso networks into zzso zzso representations and found that the local zzso of the probe sets was zzso across the four chip set models used which zzso three different species zzso mice, and zzso The application of adapted zzso methods succeeded in zzso six zzso functional regions that we characterized using Gene zzso zzso
