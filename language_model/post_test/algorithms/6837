In order for humans and electronics to fully and safely operate in the space environment, codes like zzso zzso zzso and Energy zzso must be included in any designer's zzso for design evaluation with respect to radiation zzso Currently, spacecraft designers do not have easy access to accurate radiation codes like zzso to evaluate their design for radiation effects on humans and zzso Today, the World Wide Web is sophisticated enough to support the entire zzso code and all of the associated zzso and post processing zzso This package is called zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso There are many advantages to zzso The most important advantage is the instant update capability of the zzso Another major advantage is the zzso that the web zzso on the zzso Right now, the major disadvantage of zzso will be its zzso inside the designer's zzso This mostly comes from the fact that a consistent interface between the designer and the computer system to evaluate the design is zzso This, however, is to be solved in the zzso zzso Environment zzso program currently being zzso by zzso
