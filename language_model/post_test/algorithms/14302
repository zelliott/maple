We propose a novel approach for zzso simulating articulated rigid bodies undergoing frequent and unpredictable contact and zzso In order to leverage existing zzso for zzso bodies, multiple collisions, large contact groups, zzso zzso we use zzso rather than generalized coordinates and take an zzso approach that allows us to treat zzso zzso and collision in a unified zzso Traditional constraint handling methods are subject to zzso and we propose a novel zzso method that does not require zzso potentially stiff parameters as does zzso zzso This differs from zzso in that we zzso allowable zzso before moving the rigid bodies to their new positions, instead of correcting them after the fact when it can be difficult to incorporate the effects of contact and zzso A zzso technique is used for momentum and angular zzso Our approach works with any black box method for specifying valid joint constraints and no special considerations are required for arbitrary closed zzso or zzso Moreover, our zzso is linear both in the number of bodies and in the number of auxiliary contact and collision constraints, unlike many other methods that are linear in the number of bodies, but not in the number of auxiliary zzso
