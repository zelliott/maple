A new zzso zzso zzso gel composite system zzso as a depot drug delivery system, was developed to deliver zzso weight zzso zzso An zzso drug, zzso was used as a model zzso Human zzso gels zzso zzso loaded zzso were formed within zzso scaffolds to zzso the zzso The in zzso release behaviors of zzso from zzso were studied by characterizing the constituents of zzso The results show that the release periods of zzso from zzso with 50 zzso pores in the zzso scaffolds are generally zzso or longer more than those with 200 zzso zzso The following results were obtained for the system that comprised 50 zzso zzso The release periods of zzso from zzso loaded with zzso zzso can sustain zzso longer and significantly less burst release zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) than with zzso The release profiles of zzso from zzso change markedly when zzso and zzso zzso is used to zzso the zzso Additionally, for all zzso the release periods of zzso from zzso zzso with zzso zzso are zzso or more longer time zzso 19 zzso with significantly less burst release zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) than those of zzso zzso zzso the zzso of released zzso from zzso that is zzso by zzso zzso effectively zzso zzso zzso inducing zzso zzso The work also suggests that zzso may have potential as a depot drug delivery system for zzso zzso zzso
