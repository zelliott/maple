Some methods to study and intuitively understand zzso flows in complicated zzso pathways are zzso For this purpose, a suitable decomposition of complex zzso schemes into smaller zzso is zzso These independent zzso are then interpreted as basic colors of a chromatic coloring zzso The mixture of these basic colors allows an intuitive picture of how a steady state in a zzso zzso can be zzso Furthermore, actions of drugs can be more easily investigated on this zzso An zzso zzso of zzso metabolism in rat liver zzso is presented as a simple zzso This experiment allows measurement of the percentage that each basic color contributes to the steady states resulting from different experimental zzso zzso zzso of existing zzso and rational design of new drugs are zzso A zzso program, based on a new zzso for finding all basic colors of zzso networks, is zzso
