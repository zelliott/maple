This paper presents a new approach to automatic zzso of foreground objects from an image sequence by zzso techniques of background zzso and zzso foreground zzso First, a zzso motion zzso zzso is proposed to obtain a set of zzso regions and the correspondence among regions at different time zzso Next, we formulate the zzso problem as a graph labeling over a region zzso graph based on zzso random fields zzso statistical zzso A background model representing the background scene is built and then is used to model a likelihood zzso Besides the background model, a zzso zzso is also maintained by modeling it as the prior zzso On the other hand, color zzso of two neighboring regions are taken into consideration to impose spatial zzso Then, the a zzso energy of zzso takes both spatial and zzso zzso into account to maintain the continuity of our zzso Finally, a labeling is obtained by maximizing the a zzso energy of the zzso Under such zzso we integrate two different kinds of techniques in an elegant way to make the foreground detection more zzso Experimental results for several video sequences are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed zzso
