An zzso formula is suggested to predict the accurate zzso spectral lines of zzso transitions for zzso systems by taking multiple spectral differences, and is applied to study the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso band of the zzso and zzso zzso systems of zzso zzso using zzso known accurate experimental transition zzso The results show that not only the known experimental transition lines are accurately zzso but also the correct values of the unknown spectral lines are zzso
