To identify the respiratory viral pathogens associated with acute lower respiratory tract infection in critically ill pediatric patients by using real-time reverse zzso chain reaction, and compare results with those of direct zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cohort zzso 

zzso intensive care unit at a zzso care academic zzso 

zzso patients admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit with severe respiratory symptoms consistent with viral lower respiratory tract zzso

Respiratory samples of pediatric patients admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit with severe respiratory symptoms between January 2008 and July 2009 were tested with direct zzso zzso zzso and real-time reverse zzso chain zzso 

At least one viral agent was detected in zzso of specimens by real-time reverse zzso chain reaction and in zzso by direct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso chain reaction increased the total viral yield zzso compared to direct zzso zzso zzso zzso was the most commonly identified virus zzso For viruses included in the direct zzso zzso zzso panel, direct zzso zzso zzso had a sensitivity of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso and a specificity of 1 zzso confidence zzso zzso compared with real-time reverse zzso chain zzso zzso were not zzso in particular with zzso and these patients tended to have higher zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso testing is a zzso method for the detection of respiratory viruses in critically ill children with lower respiratory tract zzso Given the importance of a prompt and accurate viral diagnosis for this group of patients, we suggest that real-time reverse zzso chain reaction becomes part of the routine diagnostic zzso in critically ill children when a viral zzso is suspected, even if conventional tests yield a negative zzso
