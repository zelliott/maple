The software tools required for zzso of magnetic resonance zzso zzso include the following zzso data zzso image zzso and vascular zzso A custom zzso software called zzso zzso zzso Computer Assisted Analysis zzso has been zzso This software combines the most commonly used three-dimensional zzso techniques with image processing methods for analysis of vascular zzso on MR zzso The main contributions of zzso are zzso zzso of a fast method for zzso zzso on three-dimensional MR zzso which is clinically zzso in a personal computer-based system; and zzso zzso to the most widespread zzso The zzso is performed in three steps: extraction of the vessel zzso detection of vessel boundaries in planes locally zzso to the zzso and calculation of zzso parameters on the basis of the resulting zzso zzso results from application of the method to data from patients showed that the vessel zzso correctly tracked the vessel path and that contours were correctly zzso zzso results obtained from images of zzso showed that the zzso of zzso severity was zzso
