zzso is a computer zzso that zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso at the structural level by zzso and zzso comparisons of zzso zzso acid triplets in zzso sequences of zzso class I zzso This program permits the identification of mismatched zzso zzso that share all of their zzso triplets with the patient's zzso zzso and, therefore, could be considered fully zzso The zzso of this zzso has been verified by analyzing the zzso specificity patterns of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that had been screened by direct zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso testing with large zzso cell zzso A 2 zzso 2 zzso zzso analysis program was applied to determine positive and negative correlations between serum zzso and the presence zzso triplets assigned from the zzso types in the cell zzso The results indicate that high zzso patients do not produce zzso to shared triplets on mismatched zzso zzso Moreover, this serum analysis has permitted the identification of triplets with different degrees of zzso as indicated by the zzso of positive and negative correlations of serum zzso with the zzso cell zzso zzso for triplets with low zzso provides further opportunities for identifying donors with acceptable zzso zzso for highly zzso zzso
