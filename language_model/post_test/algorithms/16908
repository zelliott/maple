High coverage whole zzso sequencing provides near complete information about genetic zzso However, other technologies can be more efficient in some settings by zzso reducing redundant coverage within samples and zzso exploiting patterns of genetic variation across zzso To characterize as many samples as possible, many genetic studies therefore employ lower coverage sequencing or zzso array zzso coupled to statistical zzso To compare these approaches individually and in zzso we developed a statistical framework to estimate zzso jointly from sequence reads, array zzso and zzso In European samples, we find similar sensitivity zzso and specificity zzso from zzso with either zzso sequencing or 1 M zzso zzso zzso is increased, particularly for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when low coverage sequence reads are added to dense zzso zzso zzso zzso however, is not zzso At sites where sequence reads and array zzso produce different sample zzso joint analysis reduces zzso errors and identifies novel error zzso Our joint framework informs the use of next-generation sequencing in zzso wide association studies and supports development of improved methods for zzso zzso
