zzso systems, genetic regulatory systems and other living systems can be modeled as zzso zzso networks with stable states, which are also called zzso zzso zzso This paper summarizes three classes of zzso and presents a new efficient zzso decision zzso based zzso to find all zzso of zzso zzso zzso After comparison with the tool zzso empirical experiments with zzso systems demonstrated the feasibility and efficiency of our zzso
