zzso zzso high-resolution optical technique for profiling soft or zzso boundary of an opaque object is zzso Our technique zzso the fact that the angle zzso the angular separation between two adjacent intensity zzso in the forward shadow zzso is zzso zzso to the projected zzso of the object in the same zzso An zzso formula for reconstructing the boundary shape is obtained for an object with zzso symmetry in terms of the angle zzso measured for various zzso angles of the zzso The typical error in determining the object shape zzso is less than zzso which zzso to 20 zzso of zzso accuracy when applied to an object with a mean radius of 10 zzso
