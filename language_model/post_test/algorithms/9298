Emory cardiac zzso zzso and quantitative gated single zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso software are the two most often used techniques for automatic calculation of left zzso volumes zzso and ejection fraction zzso Few studies have shown that these software are not zzso however the effect of zzso defects on performance of these software has not been widely zzso The aim of this study was to compare the performance of zzso and zzso for the calculation of zzso zzso volume zzso and zzso volume zzso in patients with normal and abnormal zzso zzso One hundred and zzso consecutive patients with suspected coronary artery disease underwent a two-day protocol with zzso zzso gated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (8 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso findings were analyzed using zzso and zzso zzso between the results of zzso and zzso was greater than zzso In patients with no zzso zzso zzso and zzso using zzso were significantly higher than using zzso zzso whereas no significant difference was noticed in zzso zzso In patients with zzso zzso also zzso yielded significantly higher values for zzso zzso and zzso than zzso zzso In zzso of patients with zzso zzso mean differences of zzso and zzso between the two software, were significantly higher than in zzso of patients without defects zzso while for zzso this difference was not significant zzso zzso Patients were classified into three zzso based on the summed rest score zzso zzso patients with zzso zzso or zzso 3 zzso zzso patients with 4 zzso or zzso zzso zzso or zzso 8 zzso and zzso patients with zzso zzso or zzso 9 zzso zzso zzso showed that the mean differences of zzso and zzso values between zzso and zzso between the zzso were significant zzso for both zzso while no significant difference was noticed between the subgroups, as for the mean difference of zzso calculated by the two software zzso By increasing zzso the zzso and zzso values were overestimated to a higher level by the zzso as compared to the zzso zzso Linear zzso analysis showed that the difference in zzso values, between the two software increased, when zzso also increased zzso In conclusion, correlation between zzso and zzso software was very good both in patients with and without zzso zzso In patients with zzso zzso calculated zzso zzso and zzso values are higher using zzso compared to the zzso zzso However, the more extensive the zzso zzso was, the greater the difference of zzso between these two zzso For the follow up of patients, we suggest the use of a single software either zzso or zzso for serial zzso of zzso zzso
