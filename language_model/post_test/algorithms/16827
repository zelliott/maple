This paper investigates zzso modeling of known and unknown causes of events in the context of zzso zzso We introduce a zzso zzso approach that models multiple zzso features of every person in the zzso This approach models and detects zzso known diseases zzso influenza and zzso by using zzso prior probabilities and zzso unknown diseases zzso a new, highly contagious respiratory virus that has never been seen zzso by using relatively zzso prior zzso We report the results of simulation experiments which support that this modeling method can improve the detection of new disease outbreaks in a zzso A contribution of this paper is that it introduces a zzso zzso approach for jointly modeling both known and unknown causes of zzso Such modeling has general zzso in zzso where the space of known causes is zzso
