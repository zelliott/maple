zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso technique used to image the electrical zzso and zzso within a body from zzso taken on the body's zzso zzso zzso images are required for many medical imaging zzso zzso such images usually requires an accurate way to calculate the expected zzso on the surface resulting from the application of known currents to that zzso This is described as the forward zzso This paper introduces a new method to improve zzso images by using an improved forward solution which estimates a different zzso value for each applied current zzso This method, creating an automatically adjusting forward solution, can improve the sensitivity of zzso images under many zzso imaging zzso It does so by reducing the boundary effects caused by zzso and any layered structures near them such as zzso The drawback of this method is that zzso zzso structures of interest may be suppressed or eliminated from the zzso The performance of this method is illustrated in a zzso circular phantom with simulation data from both a zzso model and experimental zzso
