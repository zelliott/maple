One of the goals of zzso chemists is to automate the de zzso design of zzso zzso Despite significant advances in zzso approaches to zzso design and binding energy zzso novel procedures for zzso design are zzso zzso zzso provides a new approach to this design zzso We propose an evolutionary tool for de zzso zzso design, based on the evaluation of energies for zzso binding to a zzso protein surface zzso Special emphasis has been placed on the evaluation of the proposed zzso leading to two different evaluation zzso The software developed was successfully tested on the design of zzso for the proteins zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso
