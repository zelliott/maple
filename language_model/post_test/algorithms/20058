To determine the precision for in zzso applications of model and zzso zzso zzso for zzso the measurement uncertainty of diffusion parameters derived from diffusion zzso imaging zzso 

Four different zzso methods were applied to diffusion zzso acquired during 10 repeated imaging zzso zzso uncertainty was derived in eight manually selected regions of interest and in the entire brain white matter and gray zzso The precision of the zzso methods was analyzed using zzso of variation and zzso correlation zzso Comprehensive simulations were performed to validate the zzso 

All zzso zzso showed similar precision which slightly varied in dependence of the selected region of zzso The averaged zzso of variation in the selected regions of interest was zzso zzso and zzso with respect to the apparent diffusion zzso the fractional zzso value, and the cone of uncertainty, zzso The repeated zzso showed a very high similarity with zzso zzso larger than zzso The simulations confirmed most of the in zzso zzso 

All investigated zzso methods perform with a similar, high precision in zzso the measurement uncertainty of diffusion zzso Thus, the zzso zzso zzso approaches should be the method of choice in clinical zzso
