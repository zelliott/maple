This paper presents a new method to extract a set of correlated genes with respect to multiple biological zzso zzso among genes on a specific feature are zzso as a graph structure whose zzso zzso to zzso For example, the zzso is a graph representing zzso correlations of genes on the zzso the zzso is a graph representing functional correlations of gene products, and the expression profile is a graph representing gene expression zzso When a set of genes are localized in a single zzso such as a gene cluster on the zzso an zzso cluster in the zzso pathway, or a set of zzso genes in the zzso gene expression profile, this may suggest a functional link among those zzso The functional link would become stronger when the clusters are zzso zzso when a set of corresponding genes form clusters in multiple zzso The newly introduced zzso zzso extracts such correlated gene clusters as zzso zzso in multiple zzso by using zzso links that are defined based on biological zzso Using the method, we found zzso correlated gene clusters in which genes are related with respect to the positions in the zzso and the zzso pathway, as well as the zzso structural zzso We also analyzed zzso interaction data by zzso experiments and gene zzso data by zzso in zzso and estimated the possibility of utilizing our method for screening the zzso that are likely to contain many false positive zzso
