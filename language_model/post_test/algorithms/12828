zzso software upgrades are common in consumer electronics but not in zzso medical zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso leads present commonly as inappropriate zzso A zzso alert zzso designed to reduce inappropriate shocks is the first software download approved to enhance zzso zzso previously implanted zzso 

We performed a prospective study to determine whether an zzso could reduce inappropriate zzso Patients were included if they had zzso lead fractures confirmed by analysis of zzso zzso The zzso group included the first zzso patients who met the inclusion criteria after the zzso was approved who had the zzso zzso The zzso is triggered either by high zzso or rapid zzso It responds by delaying detection of zzso zzso and initiating a patient alert every 4 zzso The control group included the first zzso patients who did not have the zzso zzso They were monitored by conventional daily zzso zzso that respond with a daily zzso The zzso group had a zzso relative reduction zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso in the percentage of patients with zzso inappropriate shock zzso 38% versus control zzso zzso and a 50% relative reduction zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso in the percentage with zzso shocks zzso versus zzso zzso The zzso group also had a higher percentage of patients who either did not receive a shock or had zzso days of warning before the shock zzso versus zzso zzso
