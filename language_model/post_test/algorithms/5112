We developed an zzso metric called the zzso Index for zzso genetic variations and environmental variables for follow-up in detailed sequencing zzso The zzso Index was found to be effective for zzso the genetic and environmental variables involved in zzso for a diverse range of simulated data zzso The metric was also evaluated for a zzso Crohn's disease zzso and a simulated data set containing zzso zzso and multiple zzso that was modeled on a zzso arthritis data zzso Our results demonstrate that the zzso Index zzso is effective and efficient for zzso interacting variables for a diverse range of zzso data sets containing complex combinations of direct effects, multiple zzso and zzso
