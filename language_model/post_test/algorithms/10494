This paper aims at the development and evaluation of a personalized insulin infusion advisory system zzso able to provide real-time zzso of the appropriate insulin infusion rate for type 1 diabetes zzso zzso patients using continuous zzso monitors and insulin zzso The system is based on a zzso zzso controller zzso that uses a personalized zzso metabolism model, consisting of two zzso models and a zzso neural zzso The model takes as input patient's information regarding meal zzso zzso zzso and insulin infusion rates, and provides zzso zzso The predictions are fed to the zzso in order for the latter to estimate the optimum insulin infusion zzso An zzso based on fuzzy logic has been developed for the zzso adaptation of the zzso control zzso The zzso has been in zzso evaluated using an appropriate simulation environment zzso zzso zzso The zzso was able to handle various meal profiles, zzso conditions, zzso zzso zzso variation in zzso zzso and errors in meal amount zzso
