To acquire images of dynamic scenes from multiple points of view zzso the acquisition time of vision sensors should be zzso This paper describes an zzso synchronization method derived from the zzso loop zzso zzso zzso light to a vision sensor from an zzso zzso source serves as the reference signal for zzso zzso and digital zzso within the vision sensor forms a zzso to regulate the output zzso which zzso to the vision frame timing, to be synchronized with the zzso zzso and experimental results show that a 1,000 zzso frame rate vision sensor was successfully synchronized with 32 zzso zzso
