A zzso zzso gel was produced to improve the surface affinity to an oily medicine, zzso zzso The effect of the degree of surface modification of the zzso gel on the drug release behavior from the zzso porous zzso was zzso The zzso gels were zzso using the zzso zzso agent, zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso A mixture of zzso solution and zzso zzso gel was evaporated under reduced pressure at room temperature, then the resulting powder was dried in zzso The degree of surface modification was evaluated based upon elementary zzso The dissolution profiles of the samples were investigated in Japanese zzso zzso 1st fluid buffer zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso containing zzso sodium zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso gels suggested that the amount of zzso zzso with the zzso group on the gel surface decreased with increasing zzso of the zzso zzso Since the modified group was rotating on the zzso gel surface, and inhibited the zzso of zzso to the surface, the attractive molecular interaction between zzso and the zzso gel surface might decrease with increasing length of the modified functional zzso However, the characteristics of the affinity of zzso to the functional groups significantly differed among the zzso The zzso release from the modified zzso gels was initially zzso slowed markedly after 1 zzso and continued for more than 24 zzso The amount of zzso released from the modified surface zzso gels by zzso zzso or F3 increased with increasing density of the surface modification zzso The mean drug release moment zzso decreased with an increase in zzso group zzso
