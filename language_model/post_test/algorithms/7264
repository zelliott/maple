The aim of the study was to determine the influence and clinical consequences of different zzso reconstruction zzso on the image quality and diagnostic accuracy of low count statistics single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Phantom scans were used to assess the image quality zzso of recovered contrast, relative noise level, and spatial zzso The diagnostic accuracy of zzso zzso performed in 60 patients with primary zzso was zzso Phantom and patient zzso scans were reconstructed by two different zzso zzso and zzso Two blinded nuclear medicine physicians interpreted the patient scans in random order, without knowledge of any clinical zzso zzso image quality and certainty of diagnosis were zzso 

zzso lower relative noise levels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and higher image spatial resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso in the zzso plane, zzso were found in the phantom studies using zzso as compared with zzso In the clinical scans, the mean zzso ratio was higher for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no significant difference in zzso sensitivity zzso zzso zzso zzso or specificity zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso image quality as well as certainty of interpretation was higher for zzso zzso 

There is a significant difference in image quality between commercially available zzso for zzso reconstruction of zzso scans, which appears to have an impact on diagnostic accuracy and interpreter zzso zzso we believe that a systematic comparison of different zzso reconstruction zzso should be made to ensure zzso high image quality in clinical zzso
