Fluorescence zzso is an evolving technology that can rapidly differentiate between benign and zzso zzso These differences are thought to be due to zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso such as zzso and zzso We hypothesized that a statistically significant difference would be demonstrated between benign and zzso breast zzso on the basis of their unique zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were performed on 56 samples of tumor or benign breast zzso zzso zzso were measured at zzso zzso ranging from 300 to 460 zzso and diffuse zzso was measured between 300 and 600 zzso Principal component analysis to zzso reduce the spectral data and a zzso ranked sum test were used to determine which zzso showed statistically significant zzso A support zzso machine zzso compared zzso results with the zzso diagnosis zzso zzso 

Several zzso zzso and diffuse zzso zzso showed significant differences between tumor and benign zzso By using the support zzso machine zzso to incorporate relevant spectral differences, a sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso were zzso 

A statistically significant difference was demonstrated in the diffuse zzso and zzso zzso zzso of benign and zzso breast zzso These differences could be exploited in the development of zzso to diagnostic and surgical zzso
