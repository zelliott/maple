The action of zzso factor zzso is zzso by two recently identified zzso zzso and zzso that differ with respect to their anatomical distribution and zzso zzso zzso Here we show by an analysis of zzso heartbeat zzso fluctuations that zzso in mice does not interfere with the zzso mechanisms underlying the control of heart zzso zzso intact zzso would not constitute an indispensable requirement of zzso cardiac rhythm zzso However, both zzso knockout zzso and zzso control zzso mice showed altered zzso properties of cardiac zzso fluctuations in contrast to zzso zzso strains of mice zzso and zzso The results stress the impact of genetic background and support the generalized notion that transgenic zzso knockout mice exhibit altered cardiac dynamics which is interpreted to reflect an zzso of zzso zzso zzso
