To develop a computer-based system for zzso and interpreting plasma zzso zzso for therapeutic drug monitoring zzso 

Data were extracted from a prospective zzso study of 199 zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso parameters were zzso using a zzso method and interpreted by an expert committee of zzso specialists and zzso who made zzso zzso These zzso models and recommendations formed the knowledge base to develop an artificial intelligence zzso system that could estimate drug exposure, interpret zzso data and generate zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and expert committee zzso recommendations were considered optimum and used to validate results obtained by the zzso zzso 

A group of patients, 67 on zzso 46 on zzso and three on both drugs, were included in this zzso zzso were high for zzso and zzso estimated trough and 4 h zzso zzso between the Al estimates and zzso values zzso zzso zzso for all zzso P zzso zzso Although trough zzso were similar, significant differences were seen for mean predicted 4 h zzso for zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso and expert committee zzso recommendations agreed in 53 out of 69 zzso cases zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and 47 out of 49 zzso cases zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

The zzso system successfully estimated zzso and zzso trough zzso and achieved good agreement with expert committee zzso recommendations for zzso and zzso zzso
