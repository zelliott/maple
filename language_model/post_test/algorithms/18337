This paper discusses different possibilities of zzso reference values for the natural zzso zzso in building materials to estimate possible additional radiation exposure for the zzso Based on comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigations the consequences of the resulting hypothetical reference activity zzso in building materials, applying different dose limits, were zzso The calculation of the activity concentration standards was performed for standard conditions obtained by earlier studies on exhalation of zzso and zzso from building zzso
