A computer based simulation program was developed to assess the usefulness of various zzso correction zzso and data acquisition methods in single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a unified zzso The program zzso calculated projection ray sums from a mathematical model with various zzso of activities and either uniform or non uniform zzso zzso by using the line zzso including the effect of zzso Data acquisition starting at arbitrary angles, various acquisition angles, including a 180 degree scan and a non circular orbit of a gamma camera, including an elliptical orbit can readily be taken into consideration in our simulation zzso To simulate non circular orbit data zzso the resolution dependence on the object distance from the zzso surface was incorporated into the zzso This computer based simulation program allows various combinations of zzso correction zzso such as hybrid methods, and data acquisition methods can be evaluated under a large number of study zzso The usefulness of this computer based simulation program is shown with several representative zzso
