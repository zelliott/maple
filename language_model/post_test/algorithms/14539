Previous solutions for spatial impulse responses of zzso zzso zzso require either approximations or complex geometrical zzso This paper describes a new, simplified and exact solution using only zzso functions and simple set zzso This solution, which can be zzso implemented with a straightforward algorithm, is an exact zzso of the zzso integral without any far field or zzso zzso Additionally, a zzso relationship was also established for spatial impulse responses from two field points which share the same projection point on the zzso surface zzso By incorporating this relationship in the algorithm, the zzso efficiency of spatial impulse responses and continuous fields is improved about zzso and zzso zzso This zzso has practical applications in designing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as demonstrated through zzso simulations with array zzso zzso were also conducted to verify the new solution and results show that the zzso is both accurate and zzso The application of this method may include development of ultrasound imaging system for hard and soft tissue zzso zzso
