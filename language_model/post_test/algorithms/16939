The new generation of zzso sequencing technologies requires reliable measures of data zzso Such measures are especially important for zzso zzso However, in the particular case of zzso zzso a great number of zzso zzso may be zzso One needs to distinguish putative zzso from sequencing or other zzso We found that not only the probability of sequencing errors zzso the quality zzso is important to distinguish an zzso but also the conditional probability of zzso this error (the zzso best zzso zzso conditional on that of the first zzso Surprisingly, around zzso of zzso can be zzso with this second zzso Another way to reduce the rate of zzso is to retrieve DNA motifs that seem to be prone to sequencing zzso and to attach a corresponding conditional quality value to these zzso We have developed several measures to distinguish between sequence errors and candidate zzso based on a base zzso zzso context and its mismatch zzso In addition, we suggested a simple method to correct the majority of zzso based on conditional probability of their zzso best intensity zzso We attach a corresponding second call confidence zzso zzso of being corrected to each zzso
