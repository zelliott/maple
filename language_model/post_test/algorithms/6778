zzso intelligence is an area where computer systems are used to solve real-life problems that require expert human zzso Expert systems serve as an effective alternative to supplement the dearth of human experts in a narrow domain of zzso We developed an expert system named zzso using zzso (an expert system shell for diagnostic zzso for the diagnosis and management of zzso 

A clinical trial was done to test the reliability of zzso The clinical and demographic data from the medical records of 50 patients with zzso who attended an zzso clinic were provided to the expert zzso The zzso diagnosis was compared with the clinical zzso 

The seizure types and zzso syndromes for the 50 patients included generalized zzso seizure zzso absence zzso complex partial seizure zzso simple partial seizure zzso juvenile zzso zzso zzso and other zzso syndromes zzso There were two cases of hysterical conversion zzso There was zzso in the diagnosis between the expert system and zzso in 47 cases zzso The overall sensitivity was zzso and the specificity was zzso for absence, generalized zzso seizures, simple partial zzso and juvenile zzso zzso zzso for complex partial zzso and zzso for hysterical conversion zzso 

This expert system could generate reliable diagnoses for patients with zzso Such a system may be useful for a doctor in a remote or peripheral area where an expert on zzso is not zzso
