zzso of calcium channels by both auxiliary zzso and G proteins was studied in zzso patches from zzso cells zzso with zzso channel zzso zzso zzso and either zzso or zzso These were zzso with either zzso or the zzso domain of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso Since G protein zzso of zzso channels may affect both zzso and zzso we examined zzso zzso of zzso channels in the presence of two different zzso that affect zzso differently and compared in detail the single-channel characteristics of zzso channels expressed with either of these zzso zzso The single-channel mean zzso and mean open time were not influenced by the zzso zzso However, the mean closed time at zzso zzso was increased for both zzso and zzso by zzso with zzso This effect was absent at lower zzso as examined for channels with the zzso The distribution of zzso of zzso channels was similar for both zzso zzso However, the inclusion of the zzso zzso resulted in channels with an zzso zzso slow zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso channels markedly reduced the ensemble current zzso and slowed the first zzso The zzso imposed by zzso was largely independent of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso currents (the channel response following a large and brief zzso zzso was observed for channels with both zzso and involved mainly enhancement of the zzso as assessed by the faster first zzso The zzso process was strongly dependent on the zzso species, with zzso supporting zzso and zzso reducing this zzso This difference was assessed by zzso of both zzso zzso zzso influence on test pulse zzso and the zzso time course during zzso At zzso zzso channels with the zzso had a fast component of zzso zzso constant zzso zzso zzso and a slow phase with time constant of approximately 1 zzso while the zzso supported only a very slow zzso process with time constant of approximately 5 zzso zzso of zzso with the zzso channel had no effect on the zzso properties with either zzso In zzso we show that the zzso properties of expressed zzso channels depend largely on the zzso species and to a minor extent only on the presence or absence of the zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso mean open and closed times and G protein zzso of zzso channels were similar for both zzso and zzso
