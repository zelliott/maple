We describe a novel experiment that we conducted with the Drug zzso zzso zzso to determine which combinations of evidence enable a zzso theory of zzso zzso interactions to make the most optimal set of zzso The focus of the experiment was a group of 16 drugs including six members of the zzso inhibitor family zzso The experiment helped identify zzso strategies that enabled the zzso to predict significantly more interactions present in a validation set than the most rigorous strategy developed by drug experts with no loss of zzso The best-performing strategies included evidence types that would normally be of lesser zzso value but that are often more accessible than more rigorous zzso Our experimental methods represent a new approach to leveraging the available scientific evidence within a domain where important evidence is often missing or of questionable value for supporting important zzso
