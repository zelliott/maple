A new, simple, sensitive, low cost and rapid zzso method for direct determination of ultra trace amounts of sodium zzso zzso zzso with a new zzso zzso is zzso The zzso was prepared by zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso on the surface of a Pt zzso The zzso zzso zzso was used for zzso of zzso zzso in the potential range of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso This sensor showed a zzso behavior zzso zzso zzso zzso over a very wide linear range zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a detection limit of zzso zzso zzso zzso The response time of the zzso was 15 s for zzso zzso zzso M of zzso the zzso can be used for 4 weeks without any major zzso This zzso can be used in the pH range of zzso The selectivity of zzso to zzso over some organic, zzso and zzso zzso was investigated with the fixed primary zzso zzso The results show that the zzso is highly selective to zzso zzso over other zzso The proposed zzso was applied to the determination of zzso in real zzso
