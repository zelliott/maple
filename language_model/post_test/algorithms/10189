Different analysis methods have been developed for assessing zzso organization of movement zzso In the uncontrolled zzso zzso method, the structure of zzso is analyzed by comparing zzso and zzso zzso components at the level of zzso variables zzso joint zzso In contrast, in the zzso by zzso zzso approach, zzso organization is assessed by comparing zzso at the task level between empirical and zzso surrogate zzso zzso effects can be due to both zzso among zzso variables and selective channeling of zzso to zzso variables with low task sensitivity zzso zzso suggesting a link between the zzso and zzso zzso However, the precise relationship between the notion of zzso in the two approaches has not been analyzed in detail zzso Analysis of empirical and simulated data from a study on manual pointing shows that in general the two approaches are not zzso but the respective zzso measures are highly correlated zzso zzso zzso for two proposed definitions of zzso in the zzso zzso For one-dimensional task spaces, a formal comparison is possible and in fact the two notions of zzso are zzso In situations in which individual variation does not contribute to zzso effects, for which necessary and sufficient conditions are zzso this zzso the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the interpretation of zzso effects are zzso
