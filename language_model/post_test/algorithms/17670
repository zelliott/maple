Comprehensive identification of DNA zzso elements is crucial for a zzso understanding of zzso network zzso Strong evidence suggests that these DNA sequence motifs are highly zzso between related species, reflecting strong selection on the network of regulatory interactions that zzso common cellular zzso Here, we exploit a zzso aspect of this zzso zzso zzso of these zzso map zzso factor zzso binding sites on a zzso zzso Using zzso conservation as a zzso our zzso finds zzso of known zzso binding sites in the zzso zzso zzso using only zzso of the sequence of a zzso zzso Most of the novel predicted motifs show strong features of known zzso binding sites, such as functional category and/or expression profile zzso of their corresponding zzso zzso conservation should provide a powerful constraint for the systematic mapping of zzso binding sites in the larger zzso of higher zzso
