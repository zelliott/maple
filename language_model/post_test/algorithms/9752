In previous work a deterministic model for the compartment level was built, taking into account the two different syndromes with which zzso zzso appears at pig zzso Based on this model, a zzso one was built in this work that simulated different zzso sizes, taking into account compartments of 200 to 400 zzso Multiple scenarios of starting conditions of infection zzso ranging from zzso to zzso were tested for each population zzso The effect of each of these two factors on the probability of disease zzso and the prevalence of each of the classes of the model and the risk groups of pigs were zzso The results showed that the compartment population had an inverse effect on the probability of disease zzso On the other hand, low zzso resulted in high levels of early zzso reaching zzso while higher zzso led to high levels of late zzso Early zzso resulted in the absence of the pathogen from the zzso while late zzso did not assure zzso This effect shows that reducing the population of the compartment combined with appropriate cleaning and good farming practices could have a positive effect in the reduction of the risk of introducing zzso zzso into the zzso zzso On the other hand, the profile of zzso at slaughter age allows for risk characterization of the farm, given the relative stability and the small variation for higher zzso
