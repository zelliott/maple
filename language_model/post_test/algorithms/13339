The charge of Task Group 186 zzso is to provide guidance for early adopters of zzso dose calculation zzso zzso for zzso zzso dose calculations to ensure practice zzso zzso to external beam zzso zzso correction zzso have only recently been made available to the zzso zzso Yet, zzso dose calculation accuracy is highly dependent on scatter conditions and zzso effect zzso relative to zzso In specific situations, differences between the current zzso zzso dose calculation zzso zzso and zzso can lead to differences in calculated doses exceeding a factor of zzso zzso raise three major issues that are not addressed by current guidance zzso zzso zzso calculated doses are sensitive to the dose zzso zzso resulting in zzso differences between dose calculated to water in a homogeneous water geometry zzso dose calculated to the local medium in the zzso zzso and the intermediate scenario of dose calculated to a small volume of water in the zzso zzso zzso zzso doses are sensitive to zzso interaction cross zzso Neither conventional zzso CT nor zzso tissue composition compilations provide useful guidance for the task of assigning interaction cross sections to each zzso zzso Since each zzso combination is unique, having reference data for each possible combination to benchmark zzso is an zzso zzso zzso a new commissioning process is zzso zzso addresses in detail the above issues through the literature review and provides explicit recommendations based on the current state of zzso zzso dose prescription and dose calculation remain in effect, with zzso dose reporting performed in parallel when zzso In using zzso it is recommended that the radiation transport should be performed in the zzso medium and, at zzso the dose to the local medium be reported along with the zzso calculated zzso zzso of zzso cross sections represent a particular zzso zzso density information is readily extracted from CT imaging, but cannot be used to distinguish between different materials having the same zzso zzso a recommendation is made to use a number of standardized materials to maintain uniformity across zzso zzso analysis shows that this recommendation offers increased accuracy over zzso zzso commissioning will share zzso with current zzso systems, but in addition there will be zzso zzso Two levels of commissioning are zzso zzso zzso dose parameters and testing the advanced capabilities of zzso For validation of zzso and scatter conditions, zzso should mimic the zzso dose zzso from reference virtual zzso Potential changes in zzso dose prescriptions and zzso limitations are zzso When data required for full zzso zzso are insufficient, interim recommendations are made and potential areas of research are zzso Application of zzso guidance should retain practice uniformity in transitioning from the zzso to the zzso zzso
