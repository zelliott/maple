Although DNA zzso technologies are very powerful for the simultaneous quantitative characterization of thousands of zzso the quality of the obtained experimental data is often far from zzso The measured zzso images represent a regular collection of spots, and the intensity of light at each spot is zzso to the DNA copy number or to the expression level of the gene whose DNA clone is zzso Spot quality control is an essential part of zzso image analysis, which must be carried out at the level of individual spot zzso The problem is difficult to formalize due to the diversity of instrumental and biological factors that can influence the zzso 

For each spot we estimate the ratio of measured zzso zzso revealing differential gene expression or change in DNA copy numbers between the test and control zzso We also define a set of quality characteristics and a model for combining these characteristics into an overall spot quality zzso We have developed a training procedure to evaluate the contribution of each individual characteristic in the overall zzso This procedure uses information available from zzso spots, located in the same array or over a set of zzso zzso It is assumed that zzso zzso spots must have very close ratios, whereas poor spots yield greater diversity in the obtained ratio zzso 

The developed procedure provides an automatic tool to zzso spot quality and to identify different types of spot zzso occurring in DNA zzso zzso Quality values assigned to each spot can be used either to eliminate spots or to weight contribution of each ratio estimate in follow-up analysis zzso
