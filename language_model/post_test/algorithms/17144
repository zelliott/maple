This paper describes a complete real-time system for zzso signal zzso zzso software and hardware have been designed to provide biologists with an efficient zzso which allows a complete study of the different states of vigilance as well as the zzso zzso The analysis method which is based on the zzso transform is first presented and compared to the standard spectral zzso The dedicated digital signal zzso card, based on the Motorola zzso zzso zzso that has been designed to support real-time acquisition and real-time processing of zzso signals is then zzso We finally illustrate the proposed method by processing real zzso signals of rats, and show that it opens up new prospects in the domain of zzso zzso We propose a new zzso called zzso that provides a global view and better detection of zzso zzso
