zzso zzso exchange chemistry monitored by zzso laser zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso is used to study solution phase zzso changes of zzso zzso stimulating hormone, and zzso as water is added to zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results are interpreted in terms of a preference for the peptides to acquire more compact zzso in organic zzso as compared to the random zzso Our interpretation is supported by circular zzso zzso of the peptides in the same zzso systems and by previously published structural data for the zzso These results demonstrate the utility of zzso as a method to monitor the zzso exchange chemistry of peptides and investigations of zzso zzso of zzso
