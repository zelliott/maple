The speed at which zzso waves zzso in tissue can be used to zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso As many groups have zzso zzso waves can be generated within zzso using focused, zzso acoustic radiation force zzso and the resulting displacement response can be zzso tracked through zzso The goals of the work zzso are twofold: zzso to develop and validate an zzso to zzso zzso wave speed from radiation zzso zzso displacement data that is robust in the presence of poor displacement zzso ratio and zzso to apply this zzso to in zzso zzso acquired in human volunteers to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of using this method to zzso the zzso zzso of liver tissue in zzso zzso The ultimate clinical application of this work is zzso zzso of liver zzso in the setting of zzso and zzso In the proposed algorithm, zzso displacement data in response to impulsive acoustic radiation force outside the region of zzso are used to characterize the zzso wave speed of a material, which is used to reconstruct the zzso zzso zzso The zzso is developed and validated using finite element method zzso By using this zzso on simulated displacement fields, reconstructions for materials with zzso zzso zzso ranging from zzso zzso are accurate to within zzso zzso whereas stiffer zzso zzso ranging from zzso zzso are accurate to within zzso zzso zzso tracking the displacement data, which introduces jitter in the displacement estimates, does not impede the use of this zzso to reconstruct accurate zzso zzso By using in zzso data acquired zzso in 20 volunteers with body mass zzso ranging from normal to obese, liver zzso zzso have been reconstructed between zzso and zzso zzso with an average precision of zzso zzso These reconstructed liver zzso are consistent with those reported in the literature zzso zzso zzso zzso with a similar precision zzso zzso zzso zzso liver zzso zzso reconstructions were performed on nine different days in two volunteers over a zzso period, yielding an average zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the first volunteer and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the second zzso The simulation and in zzso data to date demonstrate that this method is capable of generating accurate and zzso liver zzso zzso and appears promising as a clinical tool for zzso liver zzso
