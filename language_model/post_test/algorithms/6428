The spatial ordering information of zzso acid zzso in protein primary sequence is an important zzso of protein three-dimensional zzso In this paper, we describe a zzso basis function neural network zzso whose hidden centers and basis function zzso are zzso by a genetic zzso zzso for the purpose of predicting three zzso spatial distance location from primary sequence zzso Experimental evidence on soybean protein sequences indicates the utility of this zzso
