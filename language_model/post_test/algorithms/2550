Previous studies have used zzso approaches for coronary plaque zzso on zzso row zzso zzso zzso while an automated quantitative approach using a dedicated registration zzso is currently zzso zzso the study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of automated coronary plaque zzso on cardiac CT using dedicated software with a novel zzso zzso zzso of CT and zzso ultrasound zzso data zzso 

Patients who had undergone CT and zzso were zzso zzso zzso and vessel wall zzso detection was performed for both imaging zzso Dedicated automated quantitative software zzso with a unique registration zzso was used to fuse a complete zzso run with a CT zzso volume using true anatomical zzso At the level of the minimal zzso area zzso percentage zzso area zzso plaque burden, and degree of zzso were obtained on zzso Additionally, mean plaque burden was assessed for the whole coronary zzso At the identical level within the coronary artery, the same variables were derived from zzso Fifty-one patients (40 men, 58 zzso 11 years, 103 coronary zzso with 146 zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed good correlation for zzso zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso At the level of the zzso both techniques were zzso for zzso area zzso zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso and plaque burden zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso Mean plaque burden zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso index zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso showed significant correlations between zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso of coronary plaque on CT is feasible using dedicated quantitative software with a novel zzso registration zzso
