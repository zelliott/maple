zzso zzso zzso with curved zzso was used to acquire signals through regions of air containing solid objects, air flow, and temperature zzso zzso zzso were collected and used in a zzso reconstruction zzso to produce zzso images of the area under zzso In the case of the solid objects, zzso rays from the projections were accounted for using a compensation zzso and a zzso knowledge of the zzso A zzso routine was used to pick out parallel ray sets from the zzso zzso The effects of further reducing the number of zzso also were investigated, and, in the case of imaging solid objects, characteristic Gibbs phenomena were seen in the reconstructions as zzso However, when imaging temperature and flow fields, the zzso zzso were not seen, but the reconstructed values decreased with the size of zzso zzso The effect of changing the kernel filter function also was investigated, with the different filters giving the best compromise between image noise, reconstruction zzso and amount of data required in each zzso
