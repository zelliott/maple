An zzso for zzso zzso associated with several quantitative zzso is zzso The concept of a receiver operating characteristic zzso curve was introduced, and a linear combination of the quantitative zzso values was zzso This set of values was divided into two zzso values for subjects with and without a particular zzso The goodness of its partition was evaluated by the area under the zzso curve zzso The zzso value varied from 0 to 1; this value was close to 1 when the partition had high zzso zzso the strength of association between zzso and zzso was considered to be zzso to the zzso zzso In our algorithm, the parameters representing a degree of association between the zzso and zzso were estimated so as to maximize the zzso value; further, the zzso with the maximum zzso value was considered to be the best zzso associated with the zzso This zzso was implemented by using R zzso The effectiveness of our zzso was evaluated by applying it to real zzso data of the zzso gene obtained from zzso The results showed that our zzso was more reasonable and advantageous for use with several quantitative zzso than the generalized linear model or the neural network zzso
