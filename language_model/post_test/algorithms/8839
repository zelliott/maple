In this work, we have proposed an zzso zzso diagnostic system called zzso that zzso a zzso zzso zzso image into zzso or zzso with the help of zzso Higher Order zzso zzso features and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso system consists of an zzso system where five significant features (one zzso feature and four zzso zzso are extracted from the test zzso These zzso features are transformed by the zzso parameters obtained using the training zzso to determine the zzso We trained and tested six zzso The zzso used for evaluation had 144 zzso images which were split into training and testing zzso zzso and zzso zzso protocols were adopted for training and zzso the accuracy of the zzso The ground truth used for training was obtained using the biopsy zzso Among the six zzso using zzso zzso technique, Support zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso presented the best zzso accuracy of zzso with equally high values for sensitivity, specificity and positive zzso zzso Our proposed automated system, which achieved more than zzso values for all the performance measures, can be an adjunct tool to provide an initial diagnosis for the identification of patients with prostate zzso The technique, however, is limited by the limitations of zzso ultrasound guided zzso and we intend to improve our technique by using zzso zzso images in the zzso
