Variation calling is the process of detecting differences between donor and consensus DNA via zzso sequencing read zzso When evaluating the performance of different variation calling methods, a typical scenario is to simulate artificial zzso zzso and sample reads from zzso After variation zzso one can then zzso precision and recall zzso This works reliably on zzso but on larger zzso there is the problem of zzso a predicted zzso can differ slightly from the true one, yet both make the same change to the zzso Also exactly correct predictions are rare, especially on larger zzso so one should consider some notion of approximate predictions for fair zzso 

We propose a full zzso zzso strategy that allows for fair comparison of variation calling zzso First, we apply the predicted variations to the consensus zzso to create as many zzso zzso as are necessary to explain the zzso Second, we align the zzso zzso to the zzso artificial zzso zzso allowing arbitrary zzso The resulting zzso to zzso alignments tells how much the predictions differ from the true ones, solving the zzso issues in direct variation zzso In an effort to make the approach zzso to real zzso we develop a simple zzso of the classical edit distance dynamic programming zzso and apply the diagonal doubling technique to zzso the zzso We experiment with the approach on simulated predictions and also on real prediction data from a variation calling zzso
