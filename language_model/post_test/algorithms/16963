zzso membrane proteins zzso of zzso zzso have various functions related to zzso and zzso and represent important targets for vaccine zzso Various zzso zzso can predict outer membrane zzso and discriminate zzso by structure or zzso The designation of a confident prediction framework by zzso different zzso followed by consensus zzso results integration and manual confirmation will improve the prediction of the outer membrane zzso 

In the present study, we used 10 different zzso classified into three groups zzso zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso to identify putative zzso from two available zzso zzso zzso those of avian strain zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso zzso proteins in each group were filtered by zzso criteria for consensus zzso at least two positive predictions for the zzso zzso zzso three for the zzso zzso protein zzso and one for the zzso zzso The consensus predicted proteins were integrated from each group into a single list of zzso We further incorporated a manual confirmation step including a public database search against zzso and sequence zzso zzso sequence and structural zzso zzso zzso functional zzso and zzso interactions to enhance the confidence of zzso As a result, we were able to confidently predict 98 putative zzso from the avian strain zzso and 107 zzso from the zzso strain zzso with zzso overlap between the two zzso 

The zzso framework developed in this study has increased the number of putative zzso identified in zzso zzso and allowed these zzso to be identified with a higher degree of zzso Our approach can be applied to investigate the outer membrane zzso of other zzso zzso
