We present a new smooth zzso zzso method that allows to observe highly resolved zzso zzso in solid-state zzso The method, which works mainly at fast or zzso zzso speed zzso zzso is complementary to previous methods, such as zzso zzso or zzso zzso The method is very robust and efficient and does not present zzso zzso or fake zzso The main limitation of the method is that it requires a modern console with fast electronics that must be able to define the zzso zzso in a smooth way, without any zzso However, this limitation mainly occurs at zzso zzso where the rotation period is very zzso
