zzso visceral zzso is endemic in the Mediterranean Basin, where the dog is the main zzso zzso The zzso zzso agent, zzso zzso is transmitted by zzso female zzso This paper reports an zzso study of canine zzso in a region of France spanning the southwest zzso Central and the northeast zzso where the zzso are the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso were sampled in 2005 using sticky traps placed zzso over an area of approximately 100 by 150 zzso zzso and zzso satellite data for the area were combined to construct a model of the zzso data, which was then used to predict zzso abundance throughout the area on a zzso by zzso basis zzso of zzso 1 zzso Using zzso and zzso estimates of other variables and zzso a zzso explicit zzso map for zzso was constructed within a zzso Information zzso zzso is a measure of the risk of establishment of a disease in an area, and it also zzso with the amount of control needed to stop zzso 

To our knowledge, this is the first analysis that combines a zzso abundance prediction model, based on zzso variables measured at different levels of spatial resolution, with a fully zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The resulting maps should be considered as zzso rather than as zzso risk zzso since validation is currently not zzso The described approach, based on zzso several modeling methods, provides a useful new set of tools for the study of the risk of outbreaks of zzso zzso
