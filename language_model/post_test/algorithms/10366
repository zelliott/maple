Genome wide association studies have identified several single zzso zzso zzso that are independently associated with small increments in risk of prostate cancer, opening up the possibility for using such zzso in risk zzso Using segregation analysis of zzso samples of zzso families of prostate cancer patients from the UK and Australia, and assuming all familial zzso has genetic causes, we previously found that the best model for the genetic zzso to prostate cancer was a mixed model of inheritance that included both a zzso major gene component and a zzso component zzso that represents the effect of a large number of genetic zzso each of small effect, where zzso Based on published studies of 26 zzso that are currently known to be associated with prostate cancer, we have extended our model to incorporate these zzso by zzso the zzso component into two zzso a zzso component due to the known zzso zzso , and the residual zzso component due to the zzso but as yet unknown genetic zzso zzso The resulting zzso can be used for predicting the probability of developing prostate cancer in the future based on both zzso profiles and explicit family history zzso This approach can be applied to other diseases for which zzso family data and established risk zzso zzso
