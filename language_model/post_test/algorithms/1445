This paper discusses a computer program, called zzso designed to fit a zzso zzso model with zzso with a particular emphasis on the analysis of survival zzso The zzso model consists of zzso transient disease states and one absorbing zzso The exact transition times are not observed, except in situations such as zzso zzso transition zzso and zzso zzso are estimated via the method of maximum likelihood using a zzso zzso zzso The program's output includes the zzso estimates, the standard error of the estimates, the zzso of the correlation of the estimates and minus two times the zzso function, evaluated at the initial values and at the maximum likelihood zzso zzso survival zzso can be generated from each transient state, for one or more combination of zzso values and simple tests about the zzso The program is illustrated by using a zzso model to determine factors influencing diabetic zzso in young subjects with zzso diabetes zzso
