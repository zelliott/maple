The aim of this study was to identify differences between elite male and female pole zzso in terms of their mechanical energy and angular zzso The zzso total mechanical energy and angular momentum were calculated from the three-dimensional zzso data of the pole vault finals at the Sydney 2000 Olympic zzso The development of total, kinetic and potential energy showed similar characteristics for men and zzso The initial energy of the vault, the energy at maximum pole bend position and the final energy were significantly higher for male athletes zzso zzso while the energy gain produced by the athletes during the vault showed no significant differences zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso female zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso parameters relating to pole zzso and zzso also showed no significant differences zzso zzso In contrast to the male zzso the female zzso did not show a free upward flight zzso The angular momentum was significantly higher for the female zzso during the initial pole bend and during the bar clearance zzso zzso We conclude that the pole zzso technique of female elite athletes is not a projection of the technique of male elite zzso at a lower jump zzso but rather a different way of jumping and interacting with the elastic zzso The current technique of elite female pole zzso still has potential for further zzso
