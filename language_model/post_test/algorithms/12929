We apply the transformation optical technique to modify or improve conventional zzso and zzso index optical imaging zzso In particular, when it is known that a detector will terminate the paths of rays over some surface, more freedom is available in the transformation approach, since the wave behavior over a large portion of the domain becomes zzso For the analyzed zzso zzso and zzso coordinate transformations can be used, leading to simplified zzso zzso zzso that, in some cases, can be realized with zzso zzso zzso media can be zzso and have broad zzso We apply a coordinate transformation to zzso a Maxwell zzso zzso forming a near-perfect relay zzso and also zzso the focal surface associated with a conventional zzso zzso such that the system exhibits an zzso zzso with reduced zzso
