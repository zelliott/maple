zzso tracking of animal movement allows analyses that would not otherwise be possible by providing great quantities of zzso The additional capability of tracking in real zzso minimal zzso up the experimental possibility of manipulating sensory feedback, thus allowing detailed explorations of the neural basis for control of zzso Here, we describe a system capable of tracking the three-dimensional position and body orientation of animals such as flies and zzso The system operates with less than 40 zzso zzso and can track multiple animals zzso To achieve these results, a zzso tracking zzso was developed based on the extended Kalman filter and the nearest zzso standard filter data association zzso In one zzso an zzso system is capable of tracking three flies simultaneously at 60 frames per second using a zzso network of nine standard Intel zzso 4 and Core 2 Duo zzso This manuscript presents the rationale and details of the zzso employed and shows three zzso of the zzso An experiment was performed using the tracking system to measure the effect of visual contrast on the flight speed of zzso zzso At low zzso speed is more variable and faster on average than at high zzso Thus, the system is already a useful tool to study the zzso and zzso of freely flying zzso If combined with other techniques, such as zzso zzso computer graphics or genetic zzso the tracking system would offer a powerful new way to investigate the biology of flying zzso
