Increased access to zzso testing is essential in working towards universal access to zzso prevention and treatment in zzso zzso We here evaluated currently used zzso diagnostic tests and zzso in Cameroon for their ability to correctly identify zzso zzso 

We estimated sensitivity, zzso and positive and negative zzso values of 5 zzso tests, of which 3 were used by the national program, and 2 fourth generation zzso The reference panel included 500 locally collected zzso zzso zzso zzso M, 10 zzso O, 259 zzso negative and 44 zzso indeterminate zzso 

None of the 5 rapid zzso and only 1 zzso reached the current zzso recommendations on performance of zzso tests of at least zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso Overall, sensitivities ranged between zzso and zzso while zzso were zzso to zzso The combination of all zzso generated up to zzso of samples with indeterminate zzso status, because they reacted zzso with at least one of the different zzso Including zzso indeterminate samples in test efficiency calculations significantly decreased zzso to a range from zzso to zzso Finally, two rapid zzso failed to detect all zzso group O zzso tested, with one rapid test detecting only 2 out of 10 group O zzso 

In the era of ART zzso in Africa, significant proportions of false positive but also false negative results are still observed with zzso screening tests commonly used in Africa, resulting in inadequate treatment and prevention zzso Depending on tests or zzso used, up to zzso of zzso M and zzso of zzso O infected patients in Cameroon do not receive ART and adequate counseling to prevent further transmission due to low zzso Also, the use of tests with low zzso could imply inclusion of up to zzso zzso negative people in ART programs and increase budgets in addition to inconveniences caused to zzso
