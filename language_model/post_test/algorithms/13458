zzso CT is promising for prosthetic heart valve zzso assessment but zzso zzso scanning has a considerable radiation zzso Recently introduced zzso reconstruction zzso zzso may enable radiation dose reduction with retained image zzso Furthermore, zzso image quality on the CT scan mainly depends on extent of zzso zzso zzso may decrease streak zzso We compared image noise and artifact volumes in scans of mechanical zzso reconstructed with conventional filtered back projection zzso to lower dose scans reconstructed with zzso Four different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were scanned in a zzso in zzso zzso Ten zzso zzso CT scans were performed of each zzso at 120 zzso 600 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 120 zzso 300 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on a 64 zzso zzso zzso and zzso images were reconstructed with zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso artifact volumes were determined using two threshold zzso Image noise was zzso Mean zzso and zzso artifact volumes zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reconstructions had similar image noise compared to high-dose zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso respectively, P zzso zzso zzso allows zzso zzso imaging with similar image noise and zzso artifacts at 50% less dose compared to conventional zzso in an zzso in zzso zzso
