It is a consensus in zzso analysis that identifying potential local patterns, characterized by coherent groups of genes and conditions, may shed light on the discovery of previously zzso biological cellular processes of genes as well as zzso zzso of related zzso In order to simultaneously cluster genes and conditions, we have previously developed a fast zzso algorithm, Minimum zzso zzso zzso zzso which employs an alternating zzso scheme and generates what we call zzso in a zzso zzso In this paper, we propose specific strategies that enable zzso to escape poor local zzso and resolve the zzso problem in zzso zzso zzso The strategies include zzso deterministic spectral zzso and incremental local zzso We assess the effects of various strategies on both synthetic gene expression zzso and real human cancer zzso and provide empirical evidence that zzso with the proposed strategies performs better than existing zzso and zzso zzso In particular, the combination of all the three strategies leads to the best zzso Furthermore, we illustrate zzso of the resulting zzso in a zzso structure, where genes in a zzso manifest the zzso structure of corresponding specific samples, and evaluate the enrichment of functional zzso in Gene zzso zzso
