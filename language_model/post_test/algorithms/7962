In this study, we report the investigation of both zzso and zzso electromagnetic characteristics of two-dimensional silver zzso zzso embedded in zzso aluminum oxide with the use of a zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso The simulated zzso scattering zzso agree with the experimental zzso We show that enhanced electric field is created between adjacent zzso and, most importantly, zzso scattered light wave is mainly contributed from surface magnetic field, instead of the surface enhanced electric zzso The identified zzso to zzso connection produces an important implication in the development of efficient zzso zzso scattering zzso
