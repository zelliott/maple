zzso lens can provide a wide view over zzso It then has prominence advantages in three zzso reconstruction and machine vision zzso However, the serious deformation in the image limits zzso zzso zzso To overcome this obstacle, a new zzso method named zzso (Digital zzso zzso is developed based on two zzso perspective zzso zzso is a type of digital grid representation of the deformation of each zzso on zzso chip which is built by zzso the difference between the actual image coordinate and zzso coordinate of each mark on a control zzso This method zzso the zzso coordinate according to two zzso perspective transformation by setting four zzso zzso on zzso The main advantages are that this method does not rely on the optical principle of zzso lens and has relatively less zzso In applications, equivalent pinhole images can be obtained after correcting zzso lens images using zzso
