zzso variation and its impact on identified populations is a major concern in database zzso We assessed potential differences in demographics and zzso charges among patients with zzso glaucoma identified through different International zzso of zzso Ninth Revision zzso coding zzso 

zzso database zzso 

Three glaucoma zzso were identified based on zzso inclusion of patients with zzso glaucoma zzso codes zzso zzso Watertown, Massachusetts, USA, 1998 to zzso zzso statistics and zzso charges were assessed for each zzso 

The three zzso included zzso zzso and zzso unique patients zzso Although significant differences in age, zzso region, payer type, product type, and medical zzso existed among the three zzso these differences had little impact on resource consumption when the zzso were combined, given the smaller number of patients outside of the primary zzso 

zzso coding variation in administrative data sets has limited impact on analyses of resource consumption among zzso glaucoma zzso
