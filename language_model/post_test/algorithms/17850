Foot and ankle volume may be an important measurement for conditions such as zzso trauma or zzso zzso Water zzso often used for this measure, is accurate but not always zzso We used zzso tape zzso zzso zzso foot size measurement zzso zzso and zzso measurement zzso with the standard of water zzso to compare foot and ankle zzso 

All five techniques were used to measure both the feet and zzso of ten zzso men and zzso zzso was determined by repeating several trials, and zzso was determined by comparing all of the techniques with water zzso (the established zzso zzso equations were found that related each technique to water zzso 

All of the techniques were reliable zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso The zzso technique showed the highest agreement with water zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso method, the lowest zzso zzso zzso 

Although any of these techniques should be acceptable for monitoring foot and ankle volume in normal zzso the zzso method comes closest to zzso the results of water zzso We believe that this technique would also be best in the presence of foot zzso but this remains to be zzso
