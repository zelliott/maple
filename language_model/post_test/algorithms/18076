Electronic monitoring zzso is used increasingly to measure medication zzso zzso zzso assessment requires fulfillment of zzso The purpose of this study was to determine assumptions needed for internal and external zzso of zzso zzso To test internal zzso we examined if zzso zzso equipment functioned correctly, zzso if all zzso bottle openings corresponded to actual drug zzso and zzso if zzso did not influence a patient's normal adherence zzso To assess external zzso we examined if there were indications that using zzso affected the sample zzso 

We used data from the Supporting Medication zzso in Renal zzso zzso study, which included 250 adult zzso transplant patients whose adherence to zzso drugs was measured during 3 months with the Medication Event Monitoring System zzso Internal zzso was determined by assessing the prevalence of zzso zzso systems, the prevalence of zzso discrepancies between cap openings and actual zzso zzso zzso notes and interview at the end of the zzso and by exploring whether adherence was initially zzso high and decreased over time (an indication of a possible zzso intervention zzso Sample zzso was examined by screening for differences between participants and zzso or drop outs on zzso 

Our analysis revealed that some assumptions were not zzso 1) one cap zzso zzso 2) zzso zzso between bottle openings and actual drug intake occurred in zzso of the patients zzso zzso zzso and 3) adherence decreased over the first 5 weeks of the monitoring, indicating that zzso had a waning intervention zzso 

The zzso assumptions presented in this article should be checked in future studies using zzso as a measure of medication zzso
