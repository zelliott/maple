This paper uses the task of zzso detection as a benchmark problem to assess the potential for dose reduction in zzso zzso We present the results of a newly developed zzso for detection of zzso as a case study for a typical commercial zzso system zzso zzso zzso The first part of the paper deals with the simulation of dose reduction for zzso zzso based on a physical model of the imaging zzso Use of a more sensitive zzso system is expected to result in additional smoothing of the zzso We introduce two different models of that zzso called moderate and strong zzso We then present an zzso zzso zzso detection zzso Comparing detection results with zzso images obtained under the supervision of an expert zzso allows us to establish the soundness of the detection zzso We measure the performance on the zzso images in order to assess the loss of information due to dose zzso It turns out that the smoothing zzso has a strong influence on detection zzso For moderate zzso a dose reduction by zzso has no serious influence on the detection zzso whereas a dose reduction by 50% already zzso a marked deterioration of the zzso Strong smoothing generally leads to an unacceptable loss of image zzso The test results emphasize the impact of the more sensitive zzso system and its characteristics on the problem of assessing the potential for dose reduction in zzso zzso The general approach presented in the paper can be adapted to fully digital zzso
