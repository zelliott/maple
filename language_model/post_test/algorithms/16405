Previously, we showed that in zzso experiments, correction for measurement error in a baseline variable zzso bias in the estimated treatment effect, and zzso that ignoring measurement error avoids zzso In zzso studies, zzso baseline zzso differences between treatment groups may be zzso Using a zzso approach, we argue intuitively that if baseline differences are large, failing to correct for measurement error leads to a biased estimate of the treatment zzso In contrast, correction eliminates bias if the true and observed baseline differences are zzso If this equality is not satisfied, the corrected zzso is also zzso but typically less so than the zzso zzso zzso these findings, we conclude that there must be a threshold for the true baseline difference, above which correction is zzso We derive expressions for the bias of the corrected and zzso zzso as functions of the correlation of the baseline variable with the study outcome, its zzso the true baseline difference, and the sample zzso zzso of these expressions defines a theoretical decision threshold about whether to correct for measurement zzso The results show that correction is usually preferred in large studies, and also in small studies with moderate baseline zzso If the group sample sizes are very zzso correction is less zzso If the equivalent balanced sample size is less than about 25 per group, one should correct for measurement error if the true baseline difference is expected to exceed zzso standard zzso zzso These results are illustrated with data from a cohort study of zzso
