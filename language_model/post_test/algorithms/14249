The increasing use of zzso in clinical research on severely ill lung patients requires a clarification of the influence of zzso zzso zzso on the zzso of the resulting zzso zzso zzso of zzso air zzso zzso or zzso or zzso liquid zzso zzso or zzso may conflict with treating the imaging problem as purely zzso First, we investigated the influence of zzso inflation and zzso by up to 300 zzso of air and 300 zzso of zzso solution into the zzso space of five pigs on the resulting zzso during ventilation at constant tidal zzso Series of zzso images representing relative zzso changes were generated on the basis of a modified Sheffield back projection zzso and ventilation distribution was displayed as functional zzso zzso In addition, a modified simultaneous zzso reconstruction technique zzso was applied to zzso the zzso distribution on an absolute level scaled in zzso m zzso Second, we applied these two zzso techniques on four intensive care patients with zzso air and fluid distribution and compared the zzso results to zzso zzso zzso and to a reference set of zzso zzso data of 20 healthy volunteers calculated by zzso The results of the animal model show that zzso based on back projection is not disturbed by the artificial zzso or zzso Application of zzso allows reliable discrimination and detection of the location and zzso of zzso or zzso These results were supported by the good agreement between the electrical zzso zzso and CT scans on patients and by the significant differences of regional zzso data between patients and healthy zzso
