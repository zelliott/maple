The American College of Surgeons criteria for Level I trauma centers calls for zzso of trauma patients to be admitted directly by a trauma surgeon or surgical zzso however, the efficiency of the trauma system may be increased if patients presenting with zzso conditions and minor injuries are treated by a zzso team zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized outcomes would be equivalent for patients treated under zzso versus a surgical zzso 

This retrospective review compared zzso hospital length of stay zzso Emergency Department zzso zzso placement to rehabilitation facilities, and complication rates for patients who could have been treated by zzso as identified by an zzso The study population for 2003 zzso was compared with the study population for 2006 zzso zzso analyses and zzso zzso and linear zzso were used to identify outcomes that were different for patients treated in 2003 versus zzso zzso zzso and percent zzso agreement were calculated for patients who were treated by the zzso team in 2006 versus patients in 2006 who were identified using the zzso 

The zzso had reasonable sensitivity zzso and specificity zzso the zzso agreement was excellent zzso No differences were found in mortality zzso zzso zzso rate of complications zzso zzso zzso zzso LOS zzso zzso zzso or placement to rehabilitation facilities zzso zzso zzso for patients identified in 2003 versus zzso Hospital LOS was increased in 2006 zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

These data support admission of trauma patients with zzso zzso injuries to a zzso zzso zzso We zzso that overall system efficiency may be improved by applying this alternative model in other trauma zzso
