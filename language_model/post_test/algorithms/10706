Families of zzso zzso evolved from common zzso The availability of multiple sequences representing each activity presents an opportunity for zzso information specifying the functionality of individual zzso We present a straightforward method for the identification of zzso likely to determine class specific functionality in which multiple sequence alignments are converted to an zzso zzso form by the zzso Property zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Three test cases, each comprised of two groups of zzso zzso are zzso Of the test cases, one is a membrane and two are soluble zzso zzso The zzso data was used to design and test the zzso zzso because a comparative sequence approach had been successfully applied to manipulate the specificity of these zzso The other two cases, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were chosen because they are well characterized structurally and zzso For the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso groups of 8 (of approximately zzso 4 (of approximately zzso and 10 (of zzso zzso respectively, of interest were identified that contain zzso defined specificity determining zzso 

zzso consistently identifies positions near zzso active sites that include those predicted from structural and/or zzso studies to be important for specificity and/or zzso This suggests that zzso will have broad utility for the identification of potential class determining zzso based on multiple sequence analysis of groups of zzso zzso Because the method is zzso rather than structure, based it is equally well suited for designing zzso experiments to investigate membrane and soluble zzso
