Software for the removal of noise from reaction zzso using the principle of zzso filtering has been written in zzso to execute on a zzso The program zzso reaction traces which are subjected to a zzso process, to produce functions suitable for zzso zzso zzso transformation into the frequency domain is followed by zzso of the transform by a zzso filter function, to remove the noise zzso zzso transformation then yields a zzso reaction trace suitable for further zzso The program is interactive at each stage and could easily be modified to remove noise from a range of input data zzso
