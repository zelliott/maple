To evaluate the possibility of processing zzso using time domain zzso 

An inverse zzso transform zzso is applied on zzso thus transforming the chemical exchange zzso transfer zzso data into the time zzso Here, large interfering signals from zzso and zzso zzso transfer can be fit and filtered zzso The method is demonstrated on a range of zzso zzso a zzso agent, and zzso egg zzso and also in zzso on a mouse zzso 

Using time domain analysis, signal components in zzso could be fit very well, thus enabling irreverent or nuisance components to be zzso The method worked equally well for samples in a solution or a gel where the large contribution from conventional zzso transfer contrast zzso was easily separated zzso zzso from egg white and mouse brain in zzso data showed that the large water resonance could easily be removed thus allowing the remaining signal to be analyzed without interference from direct water zzso 

This method successfully filtered out the large nuisance signals from bulk water and zzso in zzso in a large variety of phantom types and also in zzso It is expected to be a potentially powerful tool for zzso studies without needing asymmetry zzso
