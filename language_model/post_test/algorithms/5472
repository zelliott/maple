Biological networks reconstruction is a crucial step towards the functional characterization and zzso of living zzso zzso methods for zzso the structure of these networks are of paramount importance since they provide valuable information regarding organization and behavior of the cell at a system level and also enable careful design of zzso zzso Despite many recent advances, according to the scientific literature, there is room for improvements from both the efficiency and the accuracy point of view in link prediction zzso In this article, we propose a new method for the zzso of biological networks that makes use of a notion of similarity between graph zzso within the framework of graph zzso for ranking the links to be zzso The proposed approach results in more accurate zzso rates in a wide range of experiments, while the zzso complexity is reduced by two orders of magnitude with respect to many current state-of-the-art zzso
