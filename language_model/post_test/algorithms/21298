zzso were performed on the zzso cheek zzso zzso muscle to investigate the influence of zzso zzso on zzso zzso and the rate of oxygen transport to zzso zzso In 23 zzso zzso of red blood cell zzso zzso vessel diameter, segment length zzso zzso oxygen zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were made in four branching orders of zzso before and after zzso exchange with zzso zzso decreased systemic zzso from 52 to zzso In zzso through zzso zzso this degree of zzso resulted in an average decrease in zzso zzso from 42 to zzso and average increases in red blood cell zzso zzso blood flow, and systemic zzso zzso of 50, 30, and zzso zzso In addition, delta zzso was significantly smaller in zzso zzso and fourth order zzso compared with control zzso It was estimated that approximately zzso of the oxygen that diffused across the zzso network was transferred by diffusion to nearby zzso and zzso the remaining oxygen was consumed by the surrounding zzso Following zzso the magnitude of zzso transfer declined to zzso zzso flow remained at its control level in the zzso zzso and progressively increased above control with increasing branching zzso The increased oxygen delivery to the zzso network after limited zzso can be attributed to a zzso increase in blood flow, an increase in systemic zzso blood zzso and a decrease in zzso oxygen zzso
