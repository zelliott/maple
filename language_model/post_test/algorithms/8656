The aim of the study was to describe the influence of zzso calorie and nitrogen zzso supply upon the cumulative zzso by analyzing the literature of the past 18 zzso Three groups of patients were formed, in which nutritional therapy was performed following trauma of differing zzso zzso patients following moderate zzso zzso zzso zzso patients following severe zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso more than 20 zzso The data gained for the calorie and zzso as well as for the zzso in each group of patients served as a basis for the calculation of zzso analyses of higher zzso in these the cumulative zzso was regarded as a function of the calorie and the zzso zzso zzso f zzso N) zzso for the group of zzso patients only statements for a zzso supply of about zzso zzso zzso and zzso g zzso zzso are possible, due to the limited data available, general statements about the different influence of calorie and zzso can be made for nutritional therapy after moderate and major zzso the calculated functions reveal that the zzso influences the zzso zzso whereas the calorie supply exerts only a slight zzso zzso The zzso calculated optimum of the zzso after severe trauma is zzso zzso zzso corresponding to an zzso acid supply of zzso zzso zzso
