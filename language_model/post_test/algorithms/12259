The degree of zzso in brain zzso is assessed based on magnetic resonance imaging zzso findings and clinical data before zzso These data contain irrelevant features, while uncertainties and missing values also zzso zzso set theory can deal with zzso and uncertainty in data analysis, and can efficiently remove redundant zzso In this paper, a rough set method is applied to predict the degree of zzso As feature selection can improve the zzso accuracy zzso rough set feature selection zzso are employed to select zzso The selected feature zzso are used to generate decision rules for the zzso zzso A rough set attribute reduction zzso that employs a search method based on particle swarm zzso zzso is proposed in this paper and compared with other rough set reduction zzso Experimental results show that zzso found by the proposed zzso are more efficient and can generate decision rules with better zzso zzso The rough set zzso method can achieve higher zzso accuracy than other intelligent analysis methods such as neural networks, decision trees and a fuzzy rule extraction zzso based on zzso zzso zzso Networks zzso Moreover, the decision rules induced by rough set rule induction zzso can reveal regular and zzso patterns of the relations between zzso zzso features and the degree of zzso which are helpful for medical zzso
