zzso zzso is a possible risk factor for development of complications from zzso Numerous methods have been used to characterize zzso zzso 

We propose several new methods to characterize zzso zzso We evaluated these methods zzso and theoretically and compared them with previous zzso 

We describe zzso extension and zzso of the mean zzso of zzso excursion zzso zzso zzso day zzso zzso extension and zzso of the mean of daily differences zzso zzso the zzso zzso time points zzso zzso zzso daily means zzso zzso zzso time points zzso of the zzso profile averaged over several days, zzso zzso series zzso for a time segment of any arbitrary zzso zzso new measures of the stability of the daily zzso patterns, zzso new types of zzso displays, including within day zzso between zzso time points zzso and between daily means zzso versus total zzso and between daily means zzso versus within day zzso and zzso new methods to evaluate whether within series and between zzso time points zzso zzso systematically by time of zzso We examined the new measures in relation to previous measures of zzso zzso using correlation analysis on a clinical zzso for 85 zzso zzso zzso and continuous overall net zzso action zzso are directly zzso to total standard zzso zzso zzso is highly correlated with both total zzso and within day zzso but zzso correlated with measures of between day zzso zzso is highly correlated with between zzso time points zzso and total zzso but zzso correlated with measures of within day zzso 

We provide a zzso logical framework to characterize multiple aspects of zzso zzso and have implemented a simple, practical computing zzso This approach can help clinical researchers and clinicians identify the major sources of zzso for any given patient and monitor responses to zzso
