zzso a zzso zzso zzso antibiotic, whose three-dimensional structure was recently solved using solution state zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Rotondi and zzso 2005), requires calcium for zzso To date, the exact nature of the interaction between zzso zzso such as zzso or zzso has not been fully zzso It has, however, been suggested that addition of zzso to zzso in a zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso Moreover, it has been suggested that certain zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are essential for activity zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso may also be important for zzso binding zzso et zzso zzso In this work, we have zzso zzso to further pinpoint how zzso affects zzso zzso using zzso zzso and zzso to determine whether a specific calcium binding site exists, based on one-dimensional zzso zzso zzso and molecular dynamics zzso zzso The zzso results indicated that zzso formed zzso of between 14 and 16 zzso in the presence of a zzso zzso ratio of zzso and zzso The zzso zzso data indicated that addition of calcium had a significant effect on the zzso and zzso zzso indicating that either calcium binds in this region or that these zzso may be important for zzso Finally, the molecular dynamics simulation results indicated that the zzso change of zzso upon calcium binding might not be as significant as originally zzso Similar studies on the zzso zzso zzso are also zzso The implication of these results for the biological function of zzso is zzso
