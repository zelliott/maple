zzso zzso correlation zzso which takes advantage of the apparent enhancement of spectral resolution, is known to be useful in qualitative discrimination of seemingly similar zzso The possibility of quantitative zzso of zzso correlation zzso is even more zzso Two useful zzso namely zzso distance and correlation zzso between zzso correlation zzso are introduced for this zzso Dry and sweet red wine samples are used to demonstrate the utility of these zzso The distances between the zzso infrared zzso zzso of sweet and dry red wines are roughly zzso to the differences of sugar contents in zzso The result shows that the two parameters are useful measures for the quantitative evaluation of the similarity among the samples and their corresponding zzso correlation zzso
