zzso zzso aim to provide treatment options for individuals with nervous-system disease or zzso It is necessary, however, to increase the performance of such systems before they can be clinically viable for patients with motor zzso One performance limitation is the presence of correlated zzso zzso that can cause neural responses to wax and wane in concert as the subject is, for example, more attentive or more zzso If a system does not properly account for this zzso it may zzso interpret such zzso as an entirely different intention by the zzso We report here the design and characterization of zzso zzso decoding zzso that can contend with this zzso We characterize the zzso zzso on experimental data where monkeys performed both a real reach task and a prosthetic zzso task while we recorded from 96 zzso implanted in zzso zzso zzso The decoder attempts to zzso the underlying factors that zzso the zzso responses and can use this information to substantially lower error rates (one of eight reach zzso zzso by zzso zzso approximately zzso total prediction error using traditional independent zzso models reduced to approximately zzso We also examine additional key aspects of these new zzso the effect of neural integration window length on performance, an extension of the zzso to use zzso statistics, and the effect of training set size on the decoding accuracy of test zzso We found that zzso methods are most effective for integration windows zzso zzso although still advantageous at shorter zzso that zzso zzso performed better than the analogous zzso zzso and that the zzso zzso is robust even with a limited amount of training zzso We propose that zzso methods are effective in modeling correlated zzso neural zzso and can be used to substantially increase overall prosthetic system zzso
