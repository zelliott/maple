Electric currents are applied to body in numerous applications in medicine such as electrical zzso zzso cardiac zzso zzso and zzso If the magnetic field within a region is measured, the currents generating these fields can be calculated using the zzso zzso In this study, magnetic fields generated within a phantom by currents passing through an external wire is measured using a magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso A pulse sequence that is originally designed for mapping zzso magnetic field zzso is zzso zzso current in the form of a burst sine wave is applied zzso with the pulse zzso The frequency of the applied current is in the audio range with an zzso of zzso zzso It is shown that each zzso value of sequential images obtained by the proposed pulse sequence is modulated similar to a single tone broadband frequency modulated zzso zzso with the zzso magnetic field strength determining the zzso zzso An zzso is developed to calculate the zzso magnetic field intensity at each zzso using the frequency spectrum of the zzso zzso Experimental results show that the proposed zzso can be used to calculate zzso magnetic field distribution within a conducting sample that is placed in an zzso zzso
