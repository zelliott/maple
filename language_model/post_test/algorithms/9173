Numerous zzso and zzso zzso are permitting the zzso of zzso regulatory networks in the zzso zzso zzso However, predicting the condition dependence of regulatory network interactions has been challenging, because most zzso interactions identified in zzso are from zzso performed in one or a few cellular zzso Here, we present a novel method to predict the zzso functions of zzso zzso zzso factors zzso by zzso zzso zzso gene expression data sets and either comprehensive zzso binding site data from protein binding zzso zzso or in zzso motif zzso zzso our method does not impose arbitrary thresholds for calling target regions zzso or genes zzso zzso but rather allows all the information derived from a zzso binding or gene expression experiment to be zzso We show that this method can identify zzso physical, and genetic zzso as well as distinct sets of genes that might be activated or zzso by a single zzso under particular zzso This approach can be used to suggest conditions for directed in zzso zzso and to predict zzso zzso
