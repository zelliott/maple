zzso zzso zzso dating has been used to investigate the zzso development of the outer barrier spit forming zzso Lake zzso zzso the largest zzso zzso in zzso Sixteen samples were zzso and these yielded equivalent doses of between 153 zzso 3 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to ages from approximately 40 y at the top of the spit to approximately 300 y at the zzso The youngest ages are consistent with the age of the zzso zzso and modern material taken from the zzso beach gave a dose of 4 zzso 2 zzso zzso to an age of zzso zzso zzso zzso confirming that any previous potential zzso signal in the source zzso is completely set to zero before incorporation into the zzso A clearly defined period of zzso m of barrier construction approximately 40 y ago is zzso prior to that the deposition rate was relatively constant for approximately 300 zzso
