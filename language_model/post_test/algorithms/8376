A new approach to surface and volume formation is introduced in response to the question, zzso do some zzso look 3 zzso zzso and others look zzso The central idea is that form information can zzso away from a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso that could have projected onto the image from the visible portion of a zzso of a zzso A key property of a zzso is that it exhibits abrupt zzso changes where it meets the rest of the zzso zzso An zzso is described for filling in curved surfaces from a zzso When copies of a zzso are zzso into the interior, they act as zzso surface contours that also exhibit abrupt zzso changes with the rest of the zzso zzso The result is a zzso coding of zzso in terms of local zzso surface zzso and orientation relationships that is scale, translation, and rotation zzso
