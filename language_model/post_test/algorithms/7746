A method is presented to estimate the zzso parameters of a quantitative trait locus linked to a genetic marker when both zzso are segregating in the zzso generation of a cross between two zzso zzso The method, which assumes underlying normal zzso is a combination of maximum likelihood and moments methods and uses the statistics of the genetic marker zzso samples for the quantitative trait to estimate the zzso frequency between the two zzso and the means and zzso of the zzso of the quantitative trait zzso With this method, the genetic parameters of a locus affecting plant height linked to an zzso marker for zzso were accurately estimated from a sample of zzso zzso progeny of a cross between two species of zzso zzso zzso distance between the two zzso was 38 map units and the effect of the quantitative trait locus was zzso zzso standard zzso zzso zzso estimates of the genetic parameters and linkage distance for populations of 2000 individuals simulated with a segregating zzso locus with an effect of zzso standard zzso linked to a genetic marker with zzso zzso were also derived by this zzso The method is not effective in distinguishing between complete and partial linkage in samples of only 500 individuals or for quantitative zzso with effects less than a zzso standard zzso The method is more effective for zzso than for dominant zzso
