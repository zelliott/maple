A zzso description of the unique properties of zzso networks is critical for understanding many fundamental zzso processes in zzso zzso In this zzso a novel simulation approach, combining an zzso zzso force field for water with a quantum treatment of the nuclear motion, is applied to investigate zzso dynamics in liquid water with a specific focus on the relationship of these dynamics to zzso zzso Linear and zzso infrared zzso zzso are calculated for liquid water, zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso and discussed in the context of the results obtained using other approaches that have been employed in studies of water zzso A comparison between the calculated zzso and the available experimental data yields an overall good agreement, indicating the accuracy of the present simulation approach in describing the properties of liquid water under ambient zzso zzso improvements on the representation of the underlying water interactions as well as the treatment of the molecular motion at the zzso level are also zzso
