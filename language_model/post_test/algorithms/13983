In this paper, a novel approach, using the adapted local zzso transform combined with the zzso zzso zzso is proposed to remove noise from the zzso ultrasound zzso In the proposed approach, the local zzso transform is first performed on the signal of interest followed by a search zzso to select the best zzso Then the zzso of the obtained best basis are zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso By means of the zzso zzso of the best basis, the signal is zzso In the simulation study, the zzso zzso of the mean frequency zzso and the spectral zzso zzso are studied for the signal after zzso The simulation and clinical results have shown that the proposed approach is superior to ones based on the zzso zzso especially under low zzso ratio zzso zzso
