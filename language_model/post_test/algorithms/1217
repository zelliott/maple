zzso movement is a fast movement towards a given zzso The main characteristics of such a movement are straight path and a zzso speed zzso In this work a mathematical model for the control of the human arm during ballistic reaching movements is zzso The model of the arm contains a 2 degrees of freedom zzso zzso and a zzso zzso mechanical model of six zzso The arm model is taken from the literature with minor zzso The nervous system is modeled as an adjustable pattern generator that creates the control signals to the zzso The control signals in this model are zzso zzso activated at various zzso and zzso that are determined according to the given zzso These zzso and zzso are the parameters that should be related to each target and initial conditions in the zzso The model of the nervous system consists of an artificial neural net that maps any given target to the zzso space of the pattern zzso In order to train this net, the nervous system model includes a sensitivity model that zzso the error from the arm zzso coordinates to the zzso zzso The error is assessed only at the termination of the movement from knowledge of the zzso The role of the zzso in the muscle model and the performance of the learning scheme are zzso illustrated in simulations and zzso The results of the present study demonstrate the central nervous system's zzso ability to generate typical reaching movements with a simple zzso controller that controls only the timing and zzso of zzso zzso zzso to the muscles and adjusts these parameters based on knowledge of the zzso In this zzso which is based on the adjustment of only a few parameters instead of the whole zzso the dimension of the control problem is reduced zzso It is shown that the zzso properties of the muscles are essential to achieve this simple zzso This conclusion agrees with the general concept that motor control is the result of an interaction between the nervous system and the musculoskeletal zzso
