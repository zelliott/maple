The relative performances of four strategies for aligning a large number of protein sequences were assessed by referring to corresponding structural alignments of 54 independent zzso Multiple sequence alignment of a family was constructed by a given method from the sequences of known structures and their zzso and the subset consisting of the sequences of known structures was extracted from the whole alignment and compared with the structural counterpart in a zzso zzso zzso and zzso penalties were zzso for each family and zzso Each of the four multiple alignment methods gave significantly more accurate alignments than the conventional zzso zzso In addition, a clear difference in performance was detected among three of the four multiple alignment methods zzso The currently most popular progressive method ranked worst among the four, and the zzso zzso strategy that zzso the zzso score ranked next zzso The two best-performing strategies, one of which was newly developed, both pursue an optimal weighted zzso score, where the pair weights were introduced to correct for uneven representations of zzso in a zzso The new method uses doubly zzso zzso to make zzso zzso tree and pair weights mutually zzso Most importantly, the improvement in accuracy of alignments obtained by these zzso methods over zzso or progressive method tends to increase with decreasing average sequence identity, zzso that zzso refinement is more effective for the generally difficult alignment of remotely related zzso Four well-known zzso acid substitution zzso were also tested in combination with the various zzso However, the effects of substitution zzso were found to be minor in the framework of multiple zzso and the same order of relative performance of the alignment methods was observed with any of the zzso
