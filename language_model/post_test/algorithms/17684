zzso The interaction of zzso local zzso with zzso sodium channels is traditionally assumed to be characterized by tighter binding of the drugs to zzso zzso As zzso and zzso channels are both unavailable on zzso an indirect approach is required to yield estimates for the zzso zzso from channels in zzso zzso The established model, originally described by zzso et zzso describes the difference in affinity between resting and zzso states in terms of the concentration dependence of the zzso shift in the availability zzso We have tested the hypothesis that this model, which assumes a simple zzso relationship, could be improved by introducing a zzso zzso which would take into account potential sources of zzso zzso zzso block by zzso was studied in zzso zzso zzso expressed human skeletal muscle sodium channels and compared with experimental data previously obtained for zzso zzso and zzso zzso were clamped to membrane zzso from zzso to -5 zzso and a subsequent test pulse was used to assess the number of channels available to zzso zzso All compounds shifted the zzso dependence of channel availability in the direction of negative zzso zzso zzso of the concentration dependence of the zzso shift in the availability curve was improved by the modified model, as shown by a marked reduction in the residual sum of zzso zzso For all compounds, the zzso zzso was significantly greater than zzso These results could be interpreted in the light of the contemporary hypothesis that zzso functions as an zzso gating zzso to enhance sodium channel zzso by strengthening the latch mechanism of zzso which is considered to be a zzso process zzso coupled to zzso zzso they could be interpreted by zzso additional binding sites for zzso on zzso sodium zzso
