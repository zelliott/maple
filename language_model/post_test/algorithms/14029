zzso image zzso zzso permits investigation of the distribution and zzso of the zzso in the zzso zzso During breathing, the main zzso flow stream passes through the middle zzso and turbulent flow can be detected under zzso zzso 

Physical models or casts of the zzso cavity have been zzso in several studies in an effort to understand its zzso zzso is a new technique for measuring the aerodynamic properties of zzso zzso In this article we evaluate zzso zzso characteristics during zzso breathing under normal conditions and the usefulness of zzso 

A zzso model cast obtained by a combination of rapid zzso and zzso of clear silicone was connected to a pump which simulated the zzso pressure in the upper airway zzso A zzso mixture was used as the flow zzso The zzso was marked with zzso zzso zzso observed through solidified clear silicone and analyzed using zzso 

The main flow within the zzso which was mostly zzso passed through the middle zzso zzso was clearly visible in the zzso part of the middle zzso The flow rate was highest at the middle zzso during inspiration and zzso
