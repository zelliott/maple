zzso proceeds through the selection of zzso The distribution of zzso fitness effect and the forces shaping this distribution are therefore keys to predict the evolutionary fate of organisms and their constituents such as zzso Here, by producing and sequencing a comprehensive collection of 10,000 zzso we explore the zzso landscape of one zzso involved in the spread of zzso resistance, the zzso zzso We measured zzso impact on the zzso activity through the zzso of zzso minimum zzso concentration on a subset of 990 zzso carrying a unique zzso zzso representing zzso of possible zzso acid changes in that protein reachable by point zzso We established that zzso type, zzso accessibility of zzso and the predicted effect of zzso on protein stability primarily determined alone or in combination changes in minimum zzso concentration of zzso Moreover, we were able to capture the drastic modification of the zzso landscape induced by a single stabilizing point zzso zzso by a simple model of protein zzso This work thereby provides an integrated framework to study zzso effects and a tool to zzso better the zzso zzso
