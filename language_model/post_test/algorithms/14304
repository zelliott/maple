Recently, differential information as local intrinsic feature zzso has been used for mesh zzso Given certain user input as constraints, a zzso mesh is reconstructed by minimizing the changes in the differential zzso Since the differential information is zzso in a global coordinate system, it must somehow be transformed to fit the zzso of details in the zzso surface, otherwise distortion will zzso We observe that visually pleasing zzso zzso should preserve both local zzso and geometry zzso We propose to zzso these two types of information in the dual mesh domain due to the simplicity of the neighborhood structure of dual mesh zzso Both sets of information are zzso and zzso dependent on the zzso zzso Thus, we present a novel editing framework that zzso updates both the primal zzso positions and the dual zzso coordinates to progressively reduce distortion in zzso and zzso Unlike previous related work, our method can produce visually pleasing zzso with simple user interaction, requiring only the handle positions, not local frames at the zzso
