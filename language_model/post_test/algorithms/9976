zzso electric zzso are applied to zzso zzso of zzso zzso above and below a stationary conducting viscous zzso The zzso of these zzso are chosen to produce a zzso traveling wave that traps zzso zzso and partially traps zzso zzso in periodic and zzso chaotic zzso with average zzso that are commensurate with the wave zzso zzso periodic zzso have periods up to 101 times the wave zzso zzso broadband chaotic zzso are described by one-dimensional zzso zzso return zzso which feature zzso zzso sequences that zzso zzso at unstable trapped zzso zzso of singular angles and sequences of step transitions are characterized by distinct convergence zzso A criterion for allowed zzso orbits is zzso zzso are suggested to evaluate the zzso of the theory to zzso zzso
