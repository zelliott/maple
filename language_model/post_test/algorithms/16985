A novel method, which we call zzso has been developed to suggest chemically reasonable structures which fill the active sites of zzso The proposed molecules provide good zzso contact with the zzso and exist in low-energy zzso These structures are composed entirely of zzso zzso which are grown zzso but which can also branch or form zzso zzso zzso seed atoms may be used to determine the area in which structure generation zzso zzso zzso may begin with a zzso zzso zzso from which atoms are zzso For each new atom generated by the program, several hundred candidate positions representing a range of reasonable bond zzso bond angles, and zzso angles are zzso Each of these candidates is zzso based on a simple zzso contact zzso The selected position is chosen at random from among the highest scoring zzso zzso structures may be removed using a variety of zzso The compounds may be energy minimized and displayed using standard modeling zzso Also, it is possible to analyze the collection of all structures created by zzso and locate binding motifs for common fragments such as zzso and zzso Tests of the method using zzso zzso zzso binding protein zzso and human zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that structures similar to known potent zzso may be generated with zzso
