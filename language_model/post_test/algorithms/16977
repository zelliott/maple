zzso the center of the eyes allows for valuable information to be captured and used in a wide range of zzso zzso eye center location can be determined using commercial zzso zzso but additional constraints and expensive hardware make these existing solutions unattractive and impossible to use on standard zzso visible zzso zzso images of zzso Systems based solely on appearance are proposed in the literature, but their accuracy does not allow us to accurately locate and distinguish eye centers movements in these zzso zzso Our aim is to bridge this gap by locating the center of the eye within the area of the zzso on zzso images taken from a zzso or a similar zzso The proposed method makes use of zzso properties to gain zzso to linear lighting changes zzso and zzso to achieve zzso zzso zzso and to keep zzso zzso To further gain scale zzso the approach is applied to a scale space zzso In this paper, we extensively test our approach for its zzso to changes in zzso head pose, scale, zzso and eye zzso We demonstrate that our system can achieve a significant improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art techniques for eye center location in standard zzso zzso
