The dynamic range of fiber-optic fluorescent zzso such as single fibers and fiber zzso is calculated for strongly absorbing samples, such as process liquids, zzso and zzso The model assumes an zzso beam profile based on a zzso light source and uses zzso forms of the collection efficiency, followed by an Abel transformation and zzso zzso It is found that the effect of primary zzso of the zzso light and secondary zzso of the zzso is zzso For fiber zzso and zzso fiber zzso the upper accessible concentration limit is roughly given by the zzso length of the primary and secondary zzso Fluorescence detectors that are placed at right angles to the zzso beam axis or zzso to the beam axis are equally strongly affected by secondary zzso A probe in which the same fiber is used for zzso and for collection of the zzso emerges as the fiber probe with the largest accessible concentration zzso
