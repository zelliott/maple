A model of the zzso spine capable of taking into account realistic loads derived from human activity would be of great benefit in studying its normal zzso functioning as well as its in zzso behavior in injured and surgically altered zzso This paper proposes a method to analyze the mechanical response of the zzso spine subjected to loads derived from human activity, combining a zzso finite element model zzso and an zzso force predicting zzso zzso borne by the zzso spine at the zzso level zzso zzso are first predicted with the zzso zzso and then applied to the zzso while a boundary condition prescribing the relative zzso rotation is imposed onto the zzso to account for three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso The prescribed rotation is achieved through the application of moments on zzso To account for the effect of these moments on zzso joint zzso an iteration between the zzso technique and the zzso zzso has been carried zzso This method provides two main benefits over previous zzso first, it allows for the application of any zzso loading condition while considering the real zzso rotation measured between the zzso and the zzso and second, it makes it possible to estimate the moments that must be applied on zzso in order to maintain this zzso taking them into account when predicting joint zzso As an example application of the method, results are presented for the zzso spine mechanical response at the time of peak zzso joint force during zzso
