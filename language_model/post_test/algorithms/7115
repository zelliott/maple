The automatic zzso of zzso by zzso methodology can provide functional information for new zzso in the whole zzso zzso and this information is important for the development of novel zzso Since zzso zzso is classified zzso general ways for zzso function prediction are based on zzso zzso Various zzso tools have been developed to predict zzso zzso those tools use not simple sequence searches but more powerful methods, such as zzso methods, statistical model methods, and machine learning methods used in protein sequence analysis, based on learning zzso The first stage of zzso function prediction involves the discrimination of zzso from zzso and the second stage involves the zzso of the predicted zzso candidates into family, zzso and zzso zzso Then, further zzso is performed according to their zzso interaction zzso binding zzso type, zzso partner type, zzso Those methods have achieved zzso zzso of around 90 zzso Finally, I described the future subject of research of the zzso technique about functional prediction of zzso
