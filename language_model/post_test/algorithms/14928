zzso transmitted infections zzso continue to exert a tremendous health burden on women in developing zzso Poor socioeconomic status, inadequate knowledge, lack of diagnostic facilities, and shortages of effective treatment all contribute to the high zzso of zzso The use of clinical zzso for the detection and management of zzso has gained widespread acceptance in settings where there are limited zzso zzso of these zzso have been few, especially in women who are not recognized as members of high-risk zzso 

To develop a simple scoring system based on historical and demographic data, physical findings, zzso and zzso zzso zzso urine zzso to predict cervical zzso and zzso infection among zzso zzso 

One thousand and zzso women attending an urban family planning clinic in Nairobi were randomly selected to zzso After the identification of factors that were associated with infection, we assigned one point each for: age 25 or younger, single status, two or more sex partners in the past year, cervical zzso cervical zzso zzso and a positive zzso urine zzso Identification of any one of these six factors gave a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso for the detection of cervical zzso A positive zzso urine zzso had a sensitivity of 63 % and a specificity of zzso when used alone and did not contribute to the identification of infection if a physical examination was zzso The application of existing clinical zzso to this population performed zzso 

The use of risk scores, physical examination, zzso and the urine zzso zzso used alone or in zzso as zzso of zzso or zzso cervical infection was of limited utility in zzso zzso zzso zzso diagnostic testing is necessary to zzso zzso 

This cross zzso study presents a risk scoring system that would identify women at highest risk for sexually transmitted infections zzso zzso randomly selected women participated in the study in zzso zzso of these, 1048 participants were included in the zzso The study was conducted from May 1994 to July 1995 at a clinic sponsored by the Family Planning Association of zzso Information pertaining to the zzso behavioral and social characteristics of the participants was zzso In addition, a clinical algorithm, which includes physical examination, zzso and zzso zzso zzso urine zzso was employed to detect gonorrhea and zzso infections among zzso zzso The results revealed that the prevalence of zzso including zzso was high among women attending this urban family planning zzso Standard zzso zzso and clinical characteristics were only zzso associated with infection, resulting in poor sensitivity and specificity calculations in the risk zzso zzso of cervical infections gave a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso A positive zzso urine zzso had a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso Although the addition of physical examination and zzso zzso to the zzso improved the sensitivity of case zzso it did not improve the overall zzso of the scoring zzso
