zzso zzso imaging with zzso zzso devices is an attractive approach for real-time image guidance in modern radiation therapy such as zzso or zzso but it falls short in providing reliable information along the direction of imaging zzso By effectively taking consideration of projection data at prior times and/or angles through a zzso zzso the authors develop an zzso for real-time and full zzso tumor zzso with a single zzso zzso during treatment zzso 

First, a prior probability density function is constructed using the zzso tumor locations on the projection images acquired during patient zzso Whenever an zzso image is acquired during the treatment delivery, the corresponding zzso tumor location on the zzso is used to update the likelihood zzso The unresolved third dimension is obtained by maximizing the zzso probability zzso The zzso can also be used in a retrospective fashion when all the projection images during the treatment delivery are used for zzso zzso zzso The zzso does not involve complex zzso of any model zzso and therefore can be used in a zzso zzso The authors validated the zzso using zzso simulated zzso linear and zzso motion and zzso zzso tumor motion zzso of a lung and a zzso patient reproduced by a physical zzso Continuous zzso images were acquired over a full zzso rotation with the zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso Three scenarios were zzso zzso setup, cone beam CT setup, and retrospective zzso 

For the simulation study, the zzso zzso zzso error is zzso and zzso zzso for the linear and zzso motions, zzso For the phantom experiments, the zzso zzso error is zzso 1 zzso on average and zzso zzso zzso at 95th zzso in the lung and zzso cases for all three zzso The difference in zzso zzso error for different scenarios is small and is not statistically zzso 

The proposed zzso eliminates the need for any population based model parameters in zzso image guided zzso and allows accurate and real-time zzso tumor zzso on current standard zzso with a single zzso zzso
