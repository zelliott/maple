The aim of this paper is to develop a zzso zzso hybrid model based on finite element analysis and neural network zzso to link zzso scale zzso network zzso and zzso zzso bone zzso to simulate the process of bone zzso As whole bone zzso including the zzso reconstruction of zzso level bone, is time zzso finite element calculation is only performed at the zzso level, whilst trained neural networks are employed as zzso zzso for the finite element code needed for the zzso zzso The bone mechanical properties are updated at the zzso scale depending on the zzso and mechanical adaptation at the zzso scale zzso by the trained neural zzso The digital zzso zzso technique using zzso and zzso finite element analysis is used to capture volume elements representative of 2 zzso at the zzso level of the zzso zzso The input data for the artificial neural network are a set of bone material zzso boundary conditions and the applied zzso The output data are the updated bone properties and some zzso bone zzso The current approach is the first model, to our knowledge, that incorporates both finite element analysis and neural network zzso to rapidly simulate zzso bone zzso
