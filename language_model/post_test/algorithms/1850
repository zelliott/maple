The aim of this paper is to introduce and assess three zzso for the identification of overlapping zzso structures in networks of zzso We implemented three recently proposed approaches to the identification of overlapping and zzso zzso in zzso and applied the corresponding zzso to a network of zzso zzso papers coupled via their cited zzso The zzso zzso obtained and zzso produced by the three zzso cluster zzso were compared to a zzso zzso which we based on the interpretation of titles, zzso and zzso We defined sets of papers dealing with three topics located on different levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso We identified these topics with branches in the zzso produced by the three cluster zzso and compared the overlapping topics they detected with one another and with the three zzso paper zzso We discuss the advantages and drawbacks of applying the three approaches to paper networks in research zzso
