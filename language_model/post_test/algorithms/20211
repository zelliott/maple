An zzso is proposed for the conversion of a zzso zzso chain zzso C alpha zzso to an zzso zzso based on determining the most extensive zzso network between the zzso groups of the zzso while maintaining all of the backbone atoms in energetically feasible zzso zzso bonding is represented by aligning the zzso zzso These zzso groups are not zzso in the zzso acid zzso The first zzso to be aligned are those that are both sufficiently close in space to be arranged in approximately linear zzso termed zzso zzso The criteria used in the construction of zzso paths are: to assure good alignment of the greatest possible number of zzso that are close in space; to zzso the zzso interactions between the zzso that belong to different paths close in space; and to avoid locally zzso zzso acid zzso zzso The equations for zzso alignment are solved separately for each path, and then the remaining single zzso are aligned zzso with the zzso field from the zzso that belong to the zzso zzso A zzso zzso is used to keep the geometry of the zzso trace of the resulting backbone close to that of the input zzso zzso This procedure is sufficient to convert the zzso chain to a real zzso in applications to real systems, however, the final structure is obtained by minimizing the total zzso zzso zzso energy program for zzso energy of the system, starting from the geometry resulting from the solution of the alignment zzso When applied to model zzso and zzso structures, the algorithm, followed by the zzso energy zzso resulted in an energy and backbone geometry characteristic of these zzso and zzso zzso Application to the zzso trace of the backbone of the zzso zzso structure of bovine pancreatic zzso zzso followed by zzso energy zzso with C zzso constraints, led to a structure with almost as low energy and root mean square zzso as the zzso geometry analog of zzso the best agreement between the crystal and reconstructed backbone being observed for the zzso involved in the zzso zzso
