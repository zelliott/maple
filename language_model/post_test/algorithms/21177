While the zzso zzso remains the most commonly used system for reporting coordinates in zzso studies, the absence of an actual 3-D image of the original brain used in its construction has severely limited the ability of researchers to automatically map locations from 3-D anatomical zzso images to the zzso Previous work in this area attempted to circumvent this problem by constructing approximate linear and zzso zzso between standard brain templates zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso These methods are limited in that they can only account for differences in overall brain size and orientation but cannot correct for the actual shape differences between the zzso template and the zzso zzso In this paper we describe our work to zzso the zzso zzso and generate a zzso mapping between the zzso zzso and the zzso template that attempts to compensate for the actual differences in shape between the two, resulting in more accurate coordinate zzso We present examples in this paper and note that the method is available freely online as a zzso zzso
