zzso studies of breast cancer revealed biological zzso of the disease and opened new perspectives for personalized zzso While multiple gene zzso systems have been developed, current clinical practice is largely based upon conventional clinical and zzso zzso This gap may be filled by development of combined zzso zzso to characterize biological and clinical zzso of the zzso Digital image analysis zzso with zzso statistics of the data opens new opportunities in this zzso 

zzso zzso of 109 patients with breast zzso zzso were stained for a set of 10 zzso markers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso imaging platform with the zzso Nuclear and zzso zzso were used for the zzso Factor analysis of the zzso data was performed in the whole group and hormone zzso zzso positive zzso of the patients zzso zzso zzso 

Major factor potentially reflecting aggressive disease zzso zzso was zzso characterized by opposite zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso factor scores revealed zzso distribution and were strongly associated with higher Nottingham zzso grade zzso and more aggressive intrinsic zzso In zzso zzso the aggressiveness of the zzso was best defined by positive zzso and negative zzso zzso High zzso factor scores were strongly associated with the higher G and zzso B types, but also were detected in a set of zzso and zzso A cases, potentially indicating high risk patients in these zzso zzso relation between zzso and zzso expression was found in the zzso zzso pointing at differential information conveyed by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso along with zzso reflected the second major factor of variation in our zzso in the zzso group they were zzso associated with the zzso and zzso expression and represented the major factor of zzso Finally, we confirmed high expression levels of zzso in zzso zzso 

Factor analysis of multiple zzso zzso measured by automated zzso is an efficient exploratory tool clarifying complex zzso in the breast zzso zzso zzso profiles and zzso value of single zzso zzso Integrated zzso zzso may provide additional risk zzso for the currently used grading systems and prove to be useful in clinical outcome zzso
