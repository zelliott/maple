The use of zzso models for the analysis of zzso data with missing responses has been discussed by several zzso In this paper, we extend the zzso zzso model for a single response to the case of multiple responses, allowing for arbitrary patterns of observed and missing zzso zzso for this model are estimated via the zzso zzso and by the zzso approximation available in zzso zzso zzso The set of equations for this zzso procedure is derived and these are appropriately modified to deal with missing zzso The methodology is illustrated with an example using data coming from a study involving 161 pregnant women presenting to a private obstetrics clinic in Santiago, zzso
