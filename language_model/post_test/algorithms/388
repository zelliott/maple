In this study, heartbeat time series are classified using support zzso machines zzso zzso methods and signal analysis techniques are used to extract features from the zzso The zzso zzso is favorably compared to other neural network-based zzso approaches by performing zzso cross zzso The performance of the zzso with respect to other state-of-the-art zzso is also confirmed by the zzso of signals presenting very low zzso zzso Finally, the influence of the number of features to the zzso rate was also investigated for two real zzso The first zzso consists of long-term zzso recordings of young and elderly healthy zzso The second zzso consists of long-term zzso recordings of normal subjects and subjects suffering from coronary artery zzso
