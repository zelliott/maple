We propose a zzso zzso analysis to zzso specific features in both lateral and frontal zzso This analysis allows an elegant spectral investigation that leads simultaneously to image zzso and edge zzso It is combined with an a zzso knowledge of the zzso zzso and a zzso zzso curve characterization of its global zzso zzso work deals with identifying the contours of the zzso bodies and the zzso of zzso zzso However, this information could also lead to the selection of a zzso statistical model of the spine suited for the studied zzso Working with zzso of the model, we aim at creating edge models for each vertebra that will be used to zzso match the zzso zzso The manual feature identification could then be replaced in the reconstruction of the zzso representation of the zzso
