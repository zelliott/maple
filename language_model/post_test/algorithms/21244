The membrane protein type is an important feature in characterizing the overall zzso folding type of a protein or its zzso zzso Many investigators have put their efforts to the prediction of membrane protein zzso Here, we propose a new approach, the zzso zzso method or bragging zzso to address this problem based on the protein zzso acid zzso As a demonstration, the benchmark zzso constructed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso was used to test the new zzso The overall success rate thus obtained by zzso zzso was over zzso indicating that the bragging zzso as presented in this paper holds a quite high potential in predicting the attributes of zzso or at least can play a complementary role to many existing zzso in this zzso It is anticipated that the prediction quality can be further enhanced if the zzso zzso acid composition can be effectively incorporated into the current zzso An online membrane protein type prediction web server developed in our lab is available at zzso
