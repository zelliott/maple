We introduce an automated method for the zzso tracking of zzso acquired as a sequence of zzso ultrasound zzso The method includes an image stabilization step that compensates for the cardiac and respiratory motion of the zzso and tracks the carotid wall via a shape and appearance model trained from representative zzso zzso an application in automatic detection of zzso the zzso was tested on ultrasound volumes from 4,000 patients and its accuracy was evaluated by measuring the distance between the location of more than 4,000 carotid plaques and the location of the carotid wall as estimated by the proposed zzso zzso show that the zzso of over zzso of the carotid plaques in the zzso were located within 3 zzso of the estimated carotid wall, indicating the accuracy of the tracking zzso
