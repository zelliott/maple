To define a unified method for the automatic recognition and quantitative description of zzso zzso events of sleep zzso occurring during zzso sleep, particularly zzso phase A zzso of zzso alternating pattern and zzso 

The zzso sleep zzso of 10 normal young subjects was examined in order to recognize formal zzso events of sleep zzso The following zzso events zzso events defined exclusively on the basis of automatic analysis zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso not including zzso and zzso and zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso corresponding to visually recognized zzso were also formally zzso The identification of these events was carried out following a three-step zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso introduction of suitable thresholds and zzso application of simple logical principles, zzso an exclusion principle and an overlapping zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso bursts showed spectral characteristics which were consistent with visual zzso The value of the zzso zzso for the recognition of the zzso was zzso In particular, the different zzso distribution of the zzso in Stage 2 preceding slow wave sleep with respect to Stage 2 preceding zzso sleep was zzso 

The proposed method provides a unified quantitative approach to the study of sleep zzso zzso defined events can be reliably identified by means of automatic zzso
