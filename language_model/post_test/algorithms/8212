The purpose of this work is to develop a zzso diagnosis zzso system to differentiate zzso and benign lung zzso on CT zzso A fully automated system was designed to segment the zzso from its surrounding structured background in a local volume of interest zzso and to extract image features for zzso Image zzso was performed with a zzso active zzso zzso The initial zzso was obtained as the boundary of a zzso object generated by zzso zzso within the zzso and smoothed by zzso zzso A data set of 256 lung zzso zzso zzso and 132 zzso from 152 patients was used in this zzso In addition to zzso and texture features, the authors designed new zzso surface features to characterize the lung zzso surface zzso and shape zzso The effects of two demographic features, age and zzso as adjunct to the image features were also zzso A linear zzso analysis zzso zzso built with features from zzso feature selection was trained using zzso zzso to select the most effective zzso A zzso zzso zzso scheme was developed to reduce the optimistic bias in zzso the test performance of the zzso zzso The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, zzso for the test cases improved significantly zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso when the newly developed image features were included with the original zzso and texture zzso A similar experiment performed on the data set restricted to primary zzso and benign zzso excluding the zzso zzso also resulted in an improved test zzso though the improvement did not reach statistical significance zzso zzso zzso The two demographic features did not significantly affect the performance of the zzso system zzso zzso zzso when they were added to the feature space containing the zzso texture, and new zzso field and radius zzso To investigate if a support zzso machine zzso zzso can achieve improved performance over the zzso zzso we compared the performance of the zzso and zzso with various kernels and zzso Principal component analysis was used to reduce the zzso of the feature space for both the zzso and the zzso zzso When the number of selected principal components was zzso the highest test zzso among the zzso of various kernels and parameters was slightly higher than that of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso However, no zzso with fixed architecture consistently performed better than the zzso in the range of principal components zzso This study demonstrated that the zzso proposed zzso and feature extraction techniques are promising for zzso lung zzso on CT zzso
