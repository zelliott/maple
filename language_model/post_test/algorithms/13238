The conventional signal model of zzso sensors is well established and has proven to be exceptionally robust especially when measuring rough zzso Its physical derivation however is explicitly based on plane surfaces or point like objects, zzso Here we show experimental results of a zzso point sensor measurement of a surface zzso The results illustrate the rise of severe artifacts when measuring curved zzso On this basis, we present a systematic extension of the conventional signal model that is proven to be capable of zzso explaining these zzso
