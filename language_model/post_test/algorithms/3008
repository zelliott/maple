Studies of zzso differentiation in zzso often involve tracing and analysis of zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Part A zzso zzso is a program that can be used for zzso tracing of individual zzso when tracing is completed, a text file containing zzso length zzso is zzso Using cultured zzso zzso we have found that to reach statistical significance it is generally necessary to trace about 100 zzso in each treatment zzso zzso data analysis requires importing each text file into a statistics zzso Analysis of distinct zzso such as effects of a treatment on zzso versus zzso zzso requires a great deal of time consuming zzso data zzso We have developed zzso a zzso program that performs batch analysis on zzso measurement files and automatically makes multiple calculations, including the number, zzso and total output zzso zzso of primary, secondary, and zzso zzso on zzso and zzso and writes the calculations into an Excel zzso zzso processing of zzso measurement files dramatically reduces the time required to analyze zzso zzso In addition, our program performs more than 45 distinct calculations, enabling detailed determination of treatment effects on zzso zzso Using this program to analyze zzso tracing data, we demonstrate that continuous exposure of zzso zzso zzso to zzso 1 increases the number of secondary branches on both zzso and zzso without significantly altering the length of the zzso zzso or zzso Similar results were obtained when zzso were grown on zzso or zzso
