The zzso image registration zzso procedure has been zzso for zzso zzso The data on registration shifts obtained on matching planning image with zzso zzso CT are used in our software for acceleration of the first step zzso zzso of the zzso procedure and for zzso of the zzso zzso with intelligent zzso Priorities of the masks were automatically calculated based on disagreement detected during rigid zzso zzso tasks zzso zzso comparison of accuracy and rate for schemes of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the effectiveness of the intelligent masking process, and zzso determination of acceleration of achievable with zzso zzso A specially designed head and neck phantom used for evaluation included structures with controlled changes of position, volume, density, and zzso zzso procedures were performed with an zzso Planning software zzso zzso No statistical difference was observed in accuracy of zzso based on structure position match on the zzso unit and non zzso images zzso zzso zzso Using zzso data reduces the total time required for execution of the elastic registration procedure by zzso These data are also necessary for intelligent masking procedure during zzso zzso zzso masking procedure increases accuracy of the registration for a masked structure zzso zzso zzso without decreasing the accuracy in zzso zzso and additionally reduces the total time by zzso zzso zzso speed up procedure 30 zzso zzso computing of the zzso in current status of our investigation could be realized in a relatively short time after zzso zzso The proposed approach can be used in the routine assessment of zzso changes occurring in healthy tissue during the course of zzso Further developments will be concentrated on the full integration of zzso zzso in the imaging and treatment process of zzso zzso
