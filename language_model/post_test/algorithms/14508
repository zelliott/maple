The zzso study on simultaneous zzso of zzso and zzso onto zzso activated carbon zzso in zzso solution was carried out at zzso by conducting batch experiments at initial concentration range of zzso zzso Three equilibrium zzso models for zzso zzso studies were zzso In order to determine the parameters of zzso zzso zzso individual zzso studies of zzso and zzso on zzso were also carried zzso The experimental data of single and zzso zzso were fitted to these zzso The parameters of zzso models were estimated using error zzso technique on zzso zzso It has been observed that for low initial concentration of zzso zzso modified zzso model represents the data very well with the zzso constant zzso zzso zzso and average relative error zzso of zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso for high initial concentration of zzso zzso zzso extended zzso model represents the data very well with zzso constant zzso of zzso zzso and ARE of zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso The effect of pH of solution, zzso dose and initial zzso of zzso and zzso on zzso zzso was also zzso
