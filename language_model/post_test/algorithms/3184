MR techniques are sensitive to the early stages of zzso characterized by disruption of collagen and loss of zzso zzso but are of limited zzso Here, water compartments in normal and zzso bovine zzso cartilage were identified using a zzso least squares zzso analysis of zzso zzso Three components were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso resulted in increased zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso supporting their assignment to water compartments that are bound and loosely associated with zzso zzso The zzso of the rapidly relaxing component was not altered by zzso supporting assignment to relatively immobile zzso zzso zzso data were simulated for a range of zzso number of zzso and zzso to guide selection of acquisition parameters and assess the accuracy and precision of experimental zzso Based on this, the expected experimental accuracy of measured zzso and associated weights was within zzso and zzso respectively, with precision within zzso and zzso These results demonstrate the potential of zzso zzso analysis to increase the specificity of MR characterization of zzso
