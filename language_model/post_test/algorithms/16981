zzso and shock are risk factors for death, zzso zzso and stroke in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso management lacks zzso monitoring strategies to assess the zzso of zzso Our aim is to develop a clinically viable, continuous metric of zzso zzso to gauge zzso zzso during zzso We present the zzso zzso index zzso which zzso passivity of zzso blood volume to spontaneous changes in zzso blood zzso We tested the ability of the zzso to detect reductions in zzso blood zzso zzso shock was induced in 10 zzso The zzso was monitored as a correlation between slow waves of zzso blood pressure and relative total zzso zzso obtained with zzso zzso zzso zzso over the zzso The zzso was compared with zzso zzso of red blood cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso were compared with cerebral zzso zzso Renal blood flow decreased to zzso zzso and zzso of baseline at zzso pressures of 60, 45, and 40 zzso respectively, whereas in the brain these zzso occurred at pressures of 30, 25, and 15 zzso zzso The zzso compared favorably to the zzso zzso zzso Areas under the receiver operator characteristic zzso using zzso blood flow thresholds of 50% and zzso of baseline were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be monitored and is impaired in advance of cerebrovascular zzso during zzso zzso
