zzso zzso features may provide objective data regarding prognosis in children zzso from cardiac arrest zzso but therapeutic zzso zzso may impact its zzso zzso We aimed to determine whether specific zzso features were zzso of short-term outcome in children treated with zzso after CA, both during zzso and after return to zzso 

Thirty-five children managed with a standard clinical zzso zzso after CA were zzso zzso zzso recordings were scored in a standardized manner and zzso zzso category 1 consisted of continuous and zzso zzso zzso category 2 consisted of continuous but zzso zzso zzso category 3 included those with any degree of zzso burst suppression, or lack of cerebral zzso The primary outcome was zzso short-term outcome defined as zzso zzso Performance Category score of 4-6 zzso zzso zzso zzso at hospital zzso zzso analyses of the association between zzso category and outcome was performed using zzso zzso 

For zzso obtained during hypothermia, patients with zzso in categories 2 or 3 were far more likely to have poor outcome than those in category 1 zzso zzso P zzso zzso and OR 35, P zzso zzso zzso Similarly, for zzso obtained during zzso patients with zzso in categories 2 or 3 were far more likely to have poor outcomes than those in category 1 zzso 27, P zzso zzso and OR 18, P zzso zzso zzso 

A simple zzso zzso scheme has zzso value for short-term outcome in children undergoing zzso after zzso
