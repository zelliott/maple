A mathematical notation is introduced to zzso at a symbolic level, different mechanisms of DNA zzso and a zzso zzso is proven by zzso describing the zzso properties of the zzso chain reaction zzso This approach led to the discovery of novel techniques, based on a form of zzso which we called cross pairing zzso zzso zzso They were zzso analyzed and already zzso proven in different zzso such as DNA extraction and zzso Thus, a mathematical analysis of standard zzso may highlight novel mechanisms of DNA zzso and this can provide new technologies for DNA zzso
