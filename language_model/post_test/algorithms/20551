zzso staging of Hodgkin's disease zzso and zzso zzso zzso is important for treatment zzso In this study, the utility of zzso zzso zzso PET was evaluated as an imaging zzso for initial staging or restaging of 7 HD and 11 NHL zzso 

zzso zzso staging results were compared to the patient's clinical stage based on conventional staging studies, which included combinations of CT of the chest, abdomen and zzso zzso scans, zzso scans, zzso staging zzso and bone zzso 

zzso staging was performed in 17 of 18 patients using a zzso zzso staging zzso compared to the conventional staging zzso in 15 of 18 zzso In 5 of 18 patients, zzso zzso staging showed additional zzso not detected by conventional staging zzso whereas conventional staging demonstrated additional zzso in 4 of 18 patients not detected by zzso zzso The total cost of conventional staging was zzso for 16 CT chest scans, 16 CT zzso scans, three limited zzso scans, four bone scans, five zzso scans, two zzso and one zzso In contrast, scans cost zzso for 18 zzso PET studies and additional selected zzso zzso one plain film zzso one limited CT, one bone zzso zzso one upper zzso and one zzso 

A zzso zzso staging zzso may be an accurate and cost-effective method for staging or restaging HD and zzso
