A novel zzso zzso zzso for zzso electroencephalogram zzso is proposed based on zzso decomposition zzso zzso is represented in suitable zzso zzso forms to efficiently exploit zzso and spatial correlations zzso Several zzso decomposition models are analyzed in view of efficient zzso of the zzso forms of zzso A zzso zzso is built based on the principle of zzso plus residual zzso consisting of a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso layer followed by zzso coding in the residual zzso This approach guarantees a zzso maximum absolute error between original and reconstructed zzso The zzso zzso is applied to three different scalp zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso each with different sampling rate and zzso The proposed zzso achieves attractive zzso ratios compared to zzso individual channels zzso For similar zzso ratios, the proposed zzso achieves nearly fivefold lower average error compared to a similar zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
