zzso interactions and zzso zzso of water in zzso zzso complexes have been studied by using the hybrid density functional theory method zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to explore the influence of hydrogen bond interactions and the zzso effect on the zzso zzso of water, model complexes, such as the zzso charged water clusters zzso zzso zzso 2 and zzso the zzso zzso zzso X zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso atom zzso complexes zzso M zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been employed in the present zzso These model complexes contained different types of hydrogen bonds, such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso In particular, the last one is a zzso electron involved in the zzso water zzso Our results showed that there exists a large enhancement in the zzso zzso zzso of both the zzso zzso mode and the zzso zzso stretching mode, and the enhancement factor is more significant for the former than for the zzso The reasons for these spectral properties can be attributed to the strong polarization effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso O, and zzso in these zzso zzso We proposed that the strong zzso signal of the zzso zzso mode may be used as a fingerprint to address the local zzso of water molecules in the chemical and biological zzso
