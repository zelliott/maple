Although zzso association studies zzso have found many common genetic zzso associated with human diseases, it remains a challenge to zzso the functional links between associated zzso and complex zzso 

We developed a package called zzso by implementing and extending the existing zzso zzso for zzso candidate disease genes through cellular zzso Using type II diabetes zzso as a study case, we demonstrate that zzso zzso currently available approaches in zzso candidate disease zzso More importantly, the package is instrumental in revealing cellular pathways underlying zzso genetic zzso
