zzso noise can be disruptive for people wearing hearing zzso zzso the transient noise should be detected and controlled by the signal zzso without zzso speech and other intended input zzso A technology for detecting and controlling transient noises in hearing aids was evaluated in this zzso 

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a transient noise reduction strategy on various transient noises and to determine whether the strategy has a negative impact on sound quality of intended speech zzso 

This was a zzso zzso The study involved 24 hearing aid zzso Each participant was asked to rate the parameters of speech clarity, transient noise zzso and overall impression for speech stimuli under the zzso and zzso zzso During the zzso three types of stimuli were zzso transient noises, speech, and background zzso The transient noises included zzso on a ceramic zzso zzso on a zzso zzso door zzso zzso door zzso and zzso tapping on zzso The speech sentences used for the test were presented by a male speaker in zzso The background noises included zzso zzso and zzso zzso All of these sounds were combined into five listening situations: zzso speech only, zzso transient noise only, zzso speech and transient noise, zzso background noise and transient noise, and zzso speech and background noise and transient zzso 

There was no significant difference on the ratings of speech clarity between the zzso and zzso zzso p zzso zzso Further analysis revealed that speech clarity was significant better at 70 zzso zzso than 55 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For transient noise zzso under the zzso condition, the percentages of subjects rating the transient noise to be somewhat soft, appropriate, somewhat loud, and too loud were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The corresponding percentages under the zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A significant difference on the ratings of the transient noise zzso was found between the zzso and zzso zzso p zzso zzso For overall impression for speech zzso under the zzso condition, the percentage of subjects rating the zzso to be not helpful at all, somewhat zzso zzso and very helpful for speech stimuli were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Under the zzso condition, the corresponding percentages were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed there was a significant difference on the ratings of overall impression on speech zzso The ratings under the zzso condition were significantly more helpful for speech understanding than the ratings under zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

The transient noise reduction strategy appropriately controlled the zzso for most of the transient noises and did not affect the sound quality, which could be beneficial to hearing aid zzso
