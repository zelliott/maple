When zzso noble gases are brought into the bore of a zzso magnet for magnetic resonance imaging zzso or zzso studies, the gases must pass through substantial field zzso which can cause rapid zzso zzso In this communication, we present a means of calculating this zzso dependent relaxation rate in the fringe field of typical zzso We then compare these predictions to experimental zzso of zzso relaxation at various positions near a zzso zzso small animal zzso zzso The calculated and measured relaxation rates on the central axis of the magnet agree well and show a maximum zzso relaxation rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso at a distance of 47 zzso from the magnet zzso We also show that if this magnet were zzso its minimum zzso would drop to zzso zzso In contrast, a typical zzso zzso clinical zzso scanner will induce a minimum zzso zzso of 12 zzso Additionally, we show that the zzso zzso fields of these magnets enable zzso relaxation to be calculated using only knowledge of the zzso zzso field, which can either be measured directly or calculated from a simple field zzso Thus, while most zzso magnets employ complex and proprietary current zzso we show that their fringe fields and the resulting zzso relaxation are well zzso by simple zzso zzso Finally, our modeling also demonstrates that relaxation rates can increase by nearly an order of magnitude at zzso distances equivalent to the zzso zzso
