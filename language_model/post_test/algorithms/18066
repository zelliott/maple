The prognosis for many zzso could be improved dramatically if they could be detected while still at the microscopic disease zzso It follows from a comprehensive statistical analysis that a number of zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso can be considered as cancer zzso while another set of zzso such as zzso and zzso are possible markers for normal zzso Because more than one marker must be considered to obtain a zzso of cancer or no cancer, and if cancer, to zzso it as zzso zzso or benign, we must develop an intelligent decision system that can zzso such an zzso medical zzso 

We have developed an intelligent decision system using machine learning techniques and markers to characterize tissue as zzso zzso or zzso The system incorporates learning techniques such as zzso of support zzso machines, neural networks, decision trees, zzso feature maps zzso and zzso maximum contrast trees zzso These zzso and zzso we have developed, tend to detect microscopic pathological changes based on features derived from gene expression levels and zzso zzso We have also used zzso techniques to measure the gene expression profiles from a number of zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in several particular types of neuroendocrine tumors such as zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso involved with zzso zzso We provided statistical evidence that higher expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are associated with a higher risk that the tumors are zzso or borderline as opposed to zzso We also investigated whether higher expression levels of zzso and zzso zzso are associated with a decreased risk of zzso zzso While no significant difference was found between zzso zzso such as zzso for zzso zzso and benign tumors, there was a significant difference between expression levels of such zzso in normal adrenal zzso samples and in zzso zzso 

Our frame work focused on not only different zzso schemes and feature selection zzso but also ensemble methods such as boosting and bagging in an effort to improve upon the accuracy of the individual zzso It is evident that when all sorts of machine learning and statistically learning techniques are combined appropriately into one integrated intelligent medical decision system, the prediction power can be enhanced zzso This research has many potential zzso it might provide an alternative diagnostic tool and a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in zzso transformation as well as information that is useful for treatment planning and cancer zzso
