In targeted zzso therapy, zzso zzso based on zzso S values zzso is preferable to zzso based on mathematical zzso zzso zzso simulations are necessary to deduce zzso for those zzso sizes required by quantitative zzso The aim of this study is, starting from a single set of high-resolution zzso obtained by zzso simulations for a small zzso size along one single axis perpendicular to the source zzso to present a suitable method to accurately calculate zzso for larger zzso zzso 

zzso sets of zzso for target zzso to source zzso distances up to 10 zzso were obtained for high-resolution zzso sizes zzso zzso for electrons and zzso zzso for zzso from zzso simulations for zzso zzso and zzso using the radiation transport code zzso zzso To make these values suitable to any larger zzso size, different zzso methods (based on zzso zzso and zzso were tested and compared to values obtained by direct zzso zzso As a result, an optimal calculation procedure is zzso This procedure consisted of: zzso zzso simulation for obtaining of a starting set of zzso along a single line of zzso for a small zzso size for each zzso and type of zzso zzso zzso within the values obtained in point zzso for obtaining the zzso for zzso within a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the data obtained in zzso and zzso for obtaining zzso for zzso sizes larger than the one used for the zzso calculation for zzso zzso ratios zzso zzso zzso zzso size zzso zzso zzso zzso on within the data obtained in zzso for zzso zzso zzso The results were also compared to results from other zzso 

The results obtained with the method proposed in this work show zzso relative to the source zzso below zzso for zzso and zzso and below zzso for zzso as compared with values obtained by direct zzso simulations for zzso sizes ranging between zzso and zzso zzso The results obtained in this work show differences between the scored deposited energy and the zzso energy lower than zzso for electron zzso Higher differences, attributable to the short considered radius of 10 zzso in comparison with their zzso can be found for zzso The zzso results agree well with previously published data obtained by other authors using different zzso 

A reliable and fast approach for obtaining accurate zzso for zzso sizes larger than the zzso size used for the zzso calculation of the starting set of high-resolution zzso was developed and successfully tested for three different zzso of interest for targeted zzso one pure beta zzso and 2 zzso zzso zzso und zzso zzso the method of this work allows any interested reader to repeat the calculations for arbitrary zzso of interest zzso smaller high-resolution zzso sizes, provided the means for running zzso simulations are zzso
