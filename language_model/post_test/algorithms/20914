zzso amplification has long been regarded as a virtually universal property of signal zzso zzso yet a comprehensive zzso analysis remains a challenge even for relatively simple zzso We use a fast and accurate method to zzso properties of zzso zzso of zzso cycles and show that the zzso zzso amplify sensitivity only under specific zzso In particular, it is found that efficient sensitivity amplification in a zzso relative to the sensitivities of individual cycles, requires asymmetry in zzso of zzso zzso with zzso much more saturated than zzso
