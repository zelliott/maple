We present an zzso method to retrieve the zzso index zzso distribution of the zzso zzso lens from optical path difference data extracted from zzso zzso zzso zzso images of the zzso lens are obtained in two zzso (with the anterior surface up and zzso surface zzso allowing to obtain the lens zzso The zzso reconstruction method is based on a genetic zzso that searches for the parameters of a zzso zzso model that best fits the distorted zzso surface of the zzso Computer simulations showed that, for noise of 5 zzso in the surface zzso the zzso is recovered with an accuracy of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso of the nucleus and surface of the zzso zzso The method was applied to retrieve zzso the zzso of a zzso zzso lens in zzso We found a zzso index ranging from zzso in the surface to zzso in the nucleus of the zzso an zzso exponential zzso of the zzso profile of zzso and a zzso exponential zzso ranging from zzso to zzso The effect of zzso on the aberrations of the lens also zzso The estimated zzso aberration of the measured zzso lens was zzso zzso assuming a zzso equivalent zzso index, and the presence of zzso shifted the zzso aberration toward negative values zzso zzso for a zzso zzso
