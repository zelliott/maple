To assess the long-term outcome of the efficacy of zzso zzso of the prostate zzso in men with zzso zzso zzso a cause of lower urinary tract symptoms zzso in a significant minority of zzso 

zzso intact men with zzso who were investigated in our department between 1972 and 1986, diagnosed with zzso and who underwent surgical intervention, were invited for a repeat symptomatic and zzso zzso zzso methods were used, allowing direct comparison of the zzso 

In all, 224 men were initially diagnosed with zzso 87 zzso of these died in the interim and 22 followed had a zzso with a mean follow-up since surgery of zzso zzso There were no significantly sustained reductions in any zzso There was a small but significant reduction of questionable clinical significance in the zzso outlet obstruction index, but this did not translate into an improved flow zzso zzso with 58 zzso patients with zzso who remained zzso showed no significant advantage of surgical intervention in the zzso on the contrary, there was more chronic retention in those who had had zzso 

There are no long-term symptomatic or zzso gains from zzso in men shown to have zzso The results of zzso in men with zzso are important, as zzso who surgically treat patients based on the symptoms and zzso alone will do so in a significant minority of men with zzso These results strengthen the argument for a routine zzso zzso zzso
