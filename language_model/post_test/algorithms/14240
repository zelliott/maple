In this paper we study several zzso equations for the brain based on the strain energy density zzso We use the zzso function and zzso Ogden model for the strain energy and include the energy dissipation by a zzso series zzso The models are compared with known zzso zzso experimental results of the human brain tissue to obtain the best fitted model and brain mechanical zzso zzso element simulations are also performed using the given zzso zzso and zzso solutions match the zzso results very zzso The results are compared with other zzso and zzso zzso
