Complex zzso contain numerous repeated zzso and zzso zzso is believed to be a main evolutionary mechanism to obtain new zzso Several tools are available for de zzso repeat sequence zzso and many approaches exist for zzso zzso protein zzso We present an efficient new approach to identify and cluster zzso DNA sequences with high accuracy at the level of whole zzso excluding zzso repeats, tandem repeats and zzso zzso zzso We also determine the boundaries of each group member so that it closely represents a biological unit, zzso a complete zzso or a partial gene coding a protein zzso 

We developed a program called zzso to identify zzso groups zzso to zzso sequences that have been properly marked for zzso repeats and zzso zzso zzso We applied it to the whole zzso of human zzso zzso zzso and mouse zzso Groups obtained include gene families zzso zzso zzso gene family, zinc finger zzso zzso zzso repeats and additional zzso groups that resulted from recent zzso zzso Our program incorporates several new zzso a new abstract definition of consistent duplicate units, a new criterion to remove moderately frequent tandem repeats, and new zzso zzso We also provide preliminary analysis of the output on the three zzso mentioned above, and show several applications including identifying boundaries of tandem gene clusters and novel zzso repeat zzso 

All programs and zzso are downloadable from zzso
