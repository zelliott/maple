zzso patterns show the presence or absence of certain genes or proteins in a set of zzso They can also be used to determine sets of genes or proteins that occur only in certain evolutionary zzso zzso patterns analysis has routinely been applied to protein databases such as zzso and zzso but not upon gene zzso Here we present a tool named zzso which allows the complete zzso gene database to be zzso using zzso zzso 

zzso is an zzso zzso which can be used to query the zzso of all complete zzso within the zzso database using zzso zzso This enables the determination of sets of genes that occur only in certain evolutionary branches or even single zzso We found in total zzso genes and zzso zzso relationships within the zzso zzso zzso We used a single linkage zzso zzso to create zzso zzso zzso using every one of the zzso provided by zzso zzso provides the possibility of zzso with either zzso zzso patterns zzso by zzso or regular zzso zzso branches of a zzso tree of the 21 included species can be selected to create a zzso zzso zzso Users can also input a list of zzso or zzso zzso to check which zzso lineage any gene belongs zzso The output can be saved in zzso Excel or plain text format for further zzso A link to the zzso web interface has been incorporated in the zzso zzso creating easy access to functional zzso Finally, lists of zzso zzso and zzso genes have been zzso 

zzso is the first tool to combine complete zzso information with zzso pattern zzso Since we used the zzso generated by the accurate pipeline of zzso the obtained zzso lineages are zzso The zzso and reliability of these zzso lineages will further increase with the addition of newly found zzso relationships within each new zzso zzso
