Treating cancer is one of the major challenges of modern zzso Since mice models are an important tool in cancer treatment research, it is required to assess zzso tumor zzso zzso methods for investigating tumor development are either high cost and limited by their availability or suffer from low accuracy and zzso In order to overcome these zzso zzso may be zzso zzso breast cancer zzso tumors in 12 zzso mice were zzso zzso and monitored for a period of several zzso Eight mice were treated with zzso alpha zzso radiation therapy zzso zzso while four were treated with zzso zzso For large tumors, the area was estimated by analyzing zzso images and was found to be in correlation with manual zzso zzso In addition, the correlation between tumor area and relative temperatures was calculated and compared to previous zzso zzso differences were larger for tumors treated with zzso wires than tumors with zzso zzso These correlations can be used to assist in tumor size zzso and reveal information regarding its zzso zzso Overall, zzso was shown to be a promising tool for assessing tumor development with the additional advantages of being zzso and potentially providing indication of zzso biological zzso
