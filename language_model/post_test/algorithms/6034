Modern microscopic techniques like zzso screening zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging, and zzso imaging may involve collection of thousands of images per zzso zzso zzso techniques are indispensable to manage these vast amounts of zzso This goal is frequently achieved using zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso However, these zzso are zzso to preserve visual quality but not necessarily the integrity of the scientific data, which are often analyzed in an automated zzso Here, we propose three zzso zzso zzso designed to preserve information contained in the zzso These zzso were constructed using zzso ratio zzso zzso from a single image as a quality measure to establish which image components may be zzso The zzso efficiency was measured as a function of image brightness and zzso The zzso introduced by zzso in biological images were estimated using brightness zzso zzso mover distance zzso zzso and textures zzso zzso Furthermore, a microscope test pattern was used to assess the effect of zzso on the effective resolution of microscope zzso
