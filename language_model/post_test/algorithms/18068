Genome evolution is shaped not only by zzso zzso but also by structural changes including gene and zzso zzso zzso deletions and gene order zzso The most popular methods for reconstructing zzso from zzso zzso include zzso and zzso However these methods are limited to cases where equal gene content or few deletions can be zzso Since zzso duplicated regions are present in many zzso zzso the zzso of zzso repeats is needed in zzso zzso analysis and ancestral zzso zzso 

We extend zzso and develop a new method zzso to handle zzso zzso A test of zzso using divergent zzso zzso from land plants and green algae recovers the zzso zzso with prior studies, while analysis that do not consider zzso structure fail to obtain the accepted zzso Our extensive simulation study also confirms that zzso has better accuracy then the existing zzso 

Tests on a biological and simulated zzso show zzso can accurately recover the zzso zzso as well as ancestral gene zzso Close analysis of the ancestral zzso structure suggests that zzso zzso in zzso is probably limited by zzso repeats with a zzso core zzso In addition, the boundaries of zzso repeats are hot spots for gene zzso or zzso The new zzso is available from zzso
