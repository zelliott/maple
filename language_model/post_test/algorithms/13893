A technique has been developed for accurate zzso of three-dimensional zzso zzso imaging geometry and reconstruction of zzso objects based on two perspective projections acquired at arbitrary zzso without the need of zzso The required prior information zzso the intrinsic parameters of each zzso imaging zzso for determination of zzso imaging geometry includes zzso the distance between each focal spot and its image plane, SID (the zzso to zzso zzso zzso the zzso size, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the distance between the two focal spots zzso or the known zzso distance between two points in the projection zzso and zzso for each view, an approximation of the zzso factor, zzso zzso zzso which is the ratio of the SID and the approximate distance of the object to the focal zzso zzso zzso is optional but may provide a more accurate zzso if it is zzso Given five or more corresponding object points in both views, a constrained zzso zzso zzso is applied to obtain an optimal estimate of the zzso imaging geometry in the form of a rotation zzso R and a translation zzso zzso that characterize the position and orientation of one imaging system relative to the zzso With the calculated zzso imaging zzso zzso spatial information concerning the object can then be zzso The accuracy of this method was evaluated by using a zzso coronary zzso tree and a cube phantom zzso Our simulation study showed that a zzso coronary tree can be reconstructed from two views with less than 2 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (or zzso error and zzso error, respectively, even if the input errors in the corresponding zzso points are fairly large (more than two zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, input image error of more than one zzso zzso zzso zzso can yield zzso position errors of 10 zzso or more when other existing methods based on linear approaches are zzso For the cube phantom images acquired from a routine zzso system, zzso errors in the zzso zzso of the cube and the zzso absolute position were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
