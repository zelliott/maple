Here we present a novel zzso geometry pipeline for constructing three-dimensional cubic zzso finite element zzso of the whole human heart from zzso patient image zzso To build the cardiac atlas, two superior zzso two inferior zzso as well as the zzso and the pulmonary trunk are first zzso and zzso and zzso boundary surfaces are extracted and zzso Critical points and skeletons (or zzso zzso are identified, following the cardiac zzso The surface model and the path tree are used to construct a zzso control mesh via a zzso sweeping zzso zzso parameters are zzso from the control mesh, defining cubic zzso finite zzso The thickness of the zzso and the zzso is obtained using segmented zzso boundaries or via offsetting from the zzso surfaces in regions where the image resolution is zzso We also develop a robust optical flow approach to zzso the constructed zzso and align it with the image from a second zzso This registration method is zzso and avoids manual operations required by zzso and path zzso Moreover, we demonstrate that this method can also be used to zzso map diffusion zzso zzso data with patient zzso to include fiber and sheet zzso in the finite element zzso
