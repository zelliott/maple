Although we have known since the 19th century that oxygen tension affects zzso production, we have only recently begun to understand many subtleties of zzso zzso The unanticipated increase in mortality associated with zzso use found in recent zzso studies is prompting a reassessment of zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in dialysis patients do not correlate with zzso zzso production and may be related to differences in oxygen delivery resulting from shifts in the zzso zzso zzso The time may have arrived to develop more zzso targets such as oxygen delivery that would mimic the natural response to zzso There are several equations that already exist that can compensate for the effects of the concentration of zzso and organic zzso as well as zzso carbon dioxide, and temperature on the delivery of zzso However, since the shape and zzso of the zzso zzso curve may actually change in different disease states, more work is zzso
