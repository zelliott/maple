zzso and particularly zzso zzso cholesterol zzso have been proposed as independent risk factors zzso to chronic zzso zzso 

The primary objective of this prospective zzso study was to evaluate the efficacy of the modified National zzso Education Program zzso Step I Diet to prevent zzso zzso The secondary objective was to assess the impact of zzso on the zzso profile of patients unresponsive to dietary zzso 

The study population consisted of 143 consecutive patients who underwent transplantation between October 1998 and January zzso Patients who failed to demonstrate total and zzso levels below the optimal values of 200 zzso and 130 zzso respectively, were recruited for zzso zzso The remaining patients who achieved and maintained the target zzso levels continued on the same dietary zzso 

zzso demographic characteristics were not different among the zzso and modified Step I Diet zzso Mean total cholesterol zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso zzso levels following the dietary zzso period were significantly different between the patients assigned to zzso treatment and those left on the diet, zzso zzso achieved reductions ranging from zzso to zzso in the zzso of total cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso among zzso of patients after 1 year of zzso A substantial decrease in all zzso zzso occurred in 53 patients in the modified Step I Diet group with significant reductions in total cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso and education of the Step I Diet should be provided during zzso The zzso dietary zzso period was deemed sufficient to determine the effect of diet on zzso zzso Reduction of zzso levels by a zzso daily zzso dose was zzso safe, and zzso
