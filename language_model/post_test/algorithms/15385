In this paper, a novel zzso zzso quantum neural network model is proposed based on some concepts and principles in the quantum zzso By combining the quantum mechanism with the zzso neural network, we defined quantum hidden zzso and connected quantum zzso and used them as the fundamental information processing unit in a zzso zzso neural zzso The quantum zzso make a wide range of zzso functions serve as the zzso functions in the hidden layer of the network, and the Grover searching zzso zzso the optimal zzso setting zzso and thus makes very efficient neural network learning zzso The quantum zzso and zzso along with a Grover searching zzso based learning, result in a novel and efficient neural network characteristic of reduced network, high efficient training and prospect application in zzso Some simulations are taken to investigate the performance of the proposed quantum network and the result show that it can achieve accurate zzso
