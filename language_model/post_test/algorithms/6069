zzso measures are designed to exclude complications when they map International zzso of Diseases zzso codes to diagnostic zzso The use of data fields that indicates whether each secondary diagnosis was present at the time of hospital admission may lead to the more accurate identification of zzso zzso 

To examine the rate of zzso of zzso codes into diagnostic categories by the zzso adaptation of the zzso index and by the zzso zzso zzso 

Analysis of zzso patients in the California State zzso Database zzso zzso admitted in 2000 for one of seven major medical and surgical zzso The CA SID includes a condition present at admission zzso modifier for each zzso zzso 

The zzso index and the zzso zzso measure were used to map the zzso codes into diagnostic categories for patients in each study zzso We calculated the zzso rate for each mapping algorithm, using information from the zzso as the zzso zzso 

The zzso index underestimated the prevalence of zzso by 70 percent, cerebrovascular disease by 70 percent, zzso zzso by 65 percent, zzso heart failure zzso by 45 percent, and zzso zzso disease by 34 zzso The zzso zzso zzso complications as zzso conditions for 43 percent of the zzso 25 percent of the fluid and zzso disorders, 18 percent of the cardiac zzso 18 percent of the cardiac zzso and 9 percent of the cases of zzso 

Adding the zzso modifier to administrative data would significantly enhance the ability of the zzso index and of the zzso zzso to map zzso codes to diagnostic categories zzso
