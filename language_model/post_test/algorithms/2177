A simple and easily implemented method for zzso detection from zzso signals is zzso The method is based on the zzso of a filtered version of the zzso The filter we used is a zzso median zzso The median filter is applied to the zzso zzso It results in a smoothed version of the zzso without any reminder of the R zzso This smoothed signal is then zzso from the original and the resulting signal presents zzso zzso without baseline zzso A simple threshold detection can then be performed on the filtered zzso zzso are presented for simulated signals, with zzso and step baseline zzso as well as zzso complex shape zzso The detection is accurate and the average error we obtained for 300 s length signals was of the order of zzso for zzso intervals of 1 zzso zzso are also presented for a real experimental signal with strong baseline zzso and the accuracy of the detection can be zzso
