zzso ultrasound display relies on many assumptions that are known to be zzso zzso from these makes interpretation of conventional ultrasound images difficult, and three-dimensional zzso zzso harder zzso For instance, zzso and enhancement are the result of an incorrect assumption that sound zzso is a function only of zzso Attempts to reduce such zzso by zzso zzso locally have been frustrated by large statistical variations and the influence of zzso zzso We address the latter by examining the influence of zzso type on two existing zzso zzso zzso This analysis is novel for one of the zzso and contains a correction to previously published work for the zzso We then propose a novel zzso that is less sensitive to zzso zzso We also present a novel technique for handling large statistical variations based on combined assumptions of zzso and zzso We then assess the performance of each zzso for correcting zzso and enhancement in in zzso data, using a real time 3-D radio frequency zzso ultrasound acquisition system developed for this zzso The results show visible differences in zzso estimates from each technique, which are supported by the theoretical zzso The novel zzso zzso zzso does show less sensitivity to zzso variation, though it results in a more noisy zzso Nevertheless, the novel technique for reducing statistical variations is sufficient to allow some degree of correction of zzso and enhancement in each zzso
