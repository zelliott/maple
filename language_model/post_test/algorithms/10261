The purpose of this study is to simulate random and systematic zzso delivery errors for external beam prostate zzso plans in order to determine the dose sensitivity for each error zzso Ten prostate plans were created with a single zzso zzso The zzso files for these treatment plans were then imported into an in-house computer program that introduced delivery zzso Random and systematic zzso position zzso zzso zzso monitor unit zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso position zzso 1, 2 zzso errors were zzso The zzso errors were either random or one of three types of systematic zzso where the zzso banks moved in the same zzso gaps remain zzso or opposing directions zzso or decreasing the zzso zzso The generalized equivalent uniform dose zzso was calculated for the original plan and all treatment plans with errors zzso The dose sensitivity for the cohort was calculated using linear zzso for the zzso position, zzso and zzso position zzso Because there was a large amount of zzso for systematic zzso position zzso the dose sensitivity of each plan was calculated and correlated with plan zzso mean zzso zzso and the percentage of zzso leaf gaps less than 1 and 2 zzso for each individual zzso We found that random and systematic zzso position errors were relatively insignificant zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso errors up to zzso Random zzso errors were also zzso and systematic zzso increases caused a systematic increase in zzso For zzso position zzso random zzso errors were relatively insignificant up to 2 zzso as had been determined in previous zzso zzso zzso zzso shift errors caused a decrease of approximately zzso in the zzso per zzso For systematic zzso gap open zzso the dose sensitivity was zzso and for zzso gap close errors the dose sensitivity was zzso There was a large zzso for zzso gap zzso errors for the ten zzso plans which correlated strongly with zzso mean gap zzso and percentage of zzso gaps less than 1 or zzso This study evaluates the magnitude of various simulated zzso delivery errors by calculating zzso on various prostate zzso
