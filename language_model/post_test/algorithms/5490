We investigated the severity of partial volume effects zzso which may occur in zzso studies, and the performance of two zzso correction zzso A hybrid zzso system was used to scan a zzso phantom that included zzso a heart insert and six zzso containers of different sizes and activity zzso This phantom zzso allowed us to have zzso background activity and a combination of zzso and zzso effects for several zzso The reconstruction with corrections for zzso scatter and resolution loss but not zzso correction accurately recovered absolute activities in large zzso However, the activities inside segmented zzso zzso containers were underestimated by zzso After applying our zzso correction to the data pertaining to six small zzso the accuracy of the recovered total activity improved with errors ranging between zzso and zzso zzso zzso and between zzso and zzso zzso with an zzso updated background zzso While the zzso zzso zzso demonstrated slightly better accuracy for cases with less severe zzso than the zzso algorithm, it underperformed in situations with considerable spill out and/or mixture of zzso and zzso zzso
