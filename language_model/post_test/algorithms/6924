This paper introduces an zzso computing zzso that zzso zzso based on the action potential of single cardiac zzso Taking solid angle analysis as zzso this zzso analyzes the field potential of a cardiac cell that connects and communicates with neighboring zzso This zzso has been implemented in our zzso model zzso which was built with extended Cellular zzso cellular zzso zzso Algorithm and simulation results reveal that it is the zzso potential slope among cell group that contributes to zzso zzso generation and determines the zzso zzso To a specific lead location, whenever cell group has a zzso potential slope that zzso end is higher than zzso end, a downward zzso zzso is zzso Whenever cell group has a reverse zzso potential zzso an upward zzso zzso is zzso Whenever there is no zzso potential zzso zzso keeps on zzso According to our algorithm, the significance of normal and many abnormal zzso zzso can be analyzed and interpreted at cellular zzso
