zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the internal zzso distribution within a body using electrical contact zzso The image reconstruction for zzso is an inverse problem, which is both zzso and zzso The traditional zzso method cannot avoid introducing negative values in the zzso The zzso of the solution produces artifacts in reconstructed images in presence of zzso A statistical method, zzso the expectation zzso zzso method, is used to solve the inverse problem for zzso in this zzso The mathematical model of zzso is transformed to the zzso constrained likelihood zzso zzso The solution is obtained by the zzso zzso Newton zzso iteration zzso This paper also discusses the strategies of choosing zzso zzso and experimental results indicate that the reconstructed images with higher quality can be obtained by the zzso method, compared with the traditional zzso and zzso zzso zzso methods, even with zzso zzso
