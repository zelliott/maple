zzso the interaction of local zzso zzso with plasma proteins is essential to understanding their systemic pharmacology and zzso The molecular zzso of LA binding to the major zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso were therefore investigated zzso using whole zzso and a novel, zzso zzso probe previously developed in our zzso zzso competitive displacement of this probe by zzso observed by the recovery of zzso zzso as the zzso probe was displaced from its zzso site, was characterized by zzso zzso zzso for the various zzso The importance of zzso factors was assessed by examining the pH dependent binding of an zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to control for pH dependent zzso of zzso zzso zzso bound with at least 8 times the affinity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This result is inconsistent with the current model of the zzso site, which depicts a buried pocket having a zzso charged region that interacts with the zzso zzso of basic zzso zzso with the model, however, two sets of structurally zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a strong positive correlation between zzso zzso as the zzso partition zzso of the neutral zzso and their free energies of zzso Given that the zzso structure of zzso has proven zzso to resolution, these zzso studies should contribute to understanding the nature of the binding site on this important zzso
