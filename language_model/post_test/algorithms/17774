Image processing zzso and a zzso research software tool have been developed for zzso and quantitative analysis of vessels in data sets from zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso The software is based on a sequence of processing steps, which are as zzso zzso vessel zzso based on a region growing algorithm, zzso interactive zzso to zzso exclude interfering structures close to the vessels of interest, zzso distance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the vessel path, zzso identification of the zzso boundary on the zzso zzso images, and zzso zzso zzso The development of the zzso components and the application user interface has been carried out in close cooperation with clinical users to achieve a high degree of zzso and flexible support of work zzso The software has been successfully applied to the zzso zzso carotid zzso and abdominal and zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso and peripheral zzso
