We developed a software program zzso zzso Ion zzso software for zzso or, in short, zzso that increases the reliability of precursor zzso zzso from zzso analysis using ultra zzso scanning of zzso linear zzso trap zzso and automatically zzso the zzso Although existing software zzso the theoretical zzso distribution according to zzso with a zzso algorithm, our method simply searches for zzso close to the theoretical mass value using both zzso raw data and zzso search result files, followed by a second database search that identifies the proteins using the zzso peak list zzso Our software program mimics the manual inspection of the spectral data of precursor zzso and is expected to be zzso not only for low resolution zzso such as zzso but also for a wide variety of zzso zzso
