In this paper we propose zzso strategies, zzso statistical estimates, and zzso software for zzso phasing by zzso of shared zzso Specifically, we consider four types of results which together provide a comprehensive zzso of zzso data zzso zzso statistics of zzso of shared zzso zzso graph zzso zzso for zzso assembly based on conflict zzso of sequencing reads zzso zzso of pedigree structure through zzso sharing via tract finding zzso and zzso zzso of shared zzso of cases, controls, and zzso The input for the zzso that we consider are any of the combination of: zzso zzso data zzso next generation sequencing zzso zzso pedigree zzso zzso We present zzso statistics for zzso projects for the zzso of shared zzso zzso are presented in zzso zzso zzso In zzso 3, we present zzso strategies for zzso assembly using zzso zzso + zzso data, and zzso + pedigree zzso zzso This work builds on zzso presented in zzso et zzso and are part of the same library of tools zzso for zzso zzso zzso Section zzso contains zzso strategies for zzso of zzso zzso We present zzso for assembling large data sets and for determining and using shared zzso to more reliably assemble and phase the zzso zzso zzso provide a set of rigorous zzso which have the potential to identify zzso interactions between rare zzso in linkage equilibrium which are associated with zzso They build on our extensive work on zzso zzso zzso zzso and whole zzso assembly zzso
