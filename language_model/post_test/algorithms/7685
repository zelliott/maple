In this paper we propose a novel zzso which zzso models of white matter zzso zzso to improve zzso zzso methods exploit directional information from diffusion weighted magnetic resonance zzso imaging to zzso connectivity between different brain zzso Most zzso methods use a single direction zzso the principal zzso of the diffusion zzso or a small set of discrete directions zzso from the zzso of an orientation distribution zzso to guide streamline zzso This strategy ignores the effects of zzso orientation zzso which arises from fanning or zzso at the zzso scale, and can lead to missing zzso Various recent zzso imaging techniques estimate the zzso zzso in each bundle directly and model it as a continuous zzso Here we introduce an zzso to exploit this information to improve zzso The zzso further uses a particle filter to probe local zzso structure during streamline zzso Using information gathered from zzso structure enables the zzso to resolve ambiguities between zzso and zzso fanning structures, which cannot be distinguished from isolated orientation distribution zzso We demonstrate the advantages of the new approach in synthetic experiments and in zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the particle filter in gathering and exploiting zzso information in recovering various zzso zzso zzso and experiments with in zzso brain data demonstrate the advantages of zzso zzso in zzso providing benefits in practical zzso
