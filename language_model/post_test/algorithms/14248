Imaging has made zzso the destruction of unwanted tissue through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been explored as a method to determine the volume of tissue that is frozen during the zzso However, studies have shown that tissue near the edge of the frozen zone often survives since in this region it may only be the zzso space that is zzso This threatens the usefulness of zzso for cancer therapy since inaccurate zzso either allows the cancer to survive or increases the chances of zzso Since zzso zzso of tissue increases due to cell membrane zzso and zzso tissue implies impaired zzso zzso has the capability to recover images of tissue zzso zzso is a technique that can benefit from this: zzso scans before freezing and after zzso can show changes in zzso and hence viability due to zzso Assuming zzso tissue will survive treatment, we explore the use of differential zzso in combination with zzso ice front imaging modes that are currently in clinical practice to recover zzso images of zzso treatment efficacy in a set of simulated zzso We also investigate the sensitivity to violation of this assumption and predict tolerable levels of measurement zzso
