The method of twin surrogates has been introduced to test for phase synchronization of complex systems in the case of passive zzso In this paper we derive new zzso expressions for the number of twins depending on the size of the neighborhood, as well as on the length of the zzso This allows us to determine the optimal parameters for the generation of twin zzso Furthermore, we determine the quality of the twin surrogates with respect to several linear and zzso statistics depending on the parameters of the zzso In the second part of the paper we perform a hypothesis test for phase synchronization in the case of experimental data from zzso eye zzso These miniature eye movements have been shown to play a central role in neural information processing underlying the perception of zzso visual zzso The high number of data sets (21 subjects and 30 trials per zzso allows us to compare the generated twin surrogates with the zzso surrogates that zzso to the different zzso We show that the generated twin surrogates reproduce very well all linear and zzso characteristics of the underlying experimental zzso The synchronization analysis of zzso eye movements by means of twin surrogates reveals that the synchronization between the left and right eye is zzso indicating that either the centers in the brain stem generating zzso eye movements are closely linked, or, alternatively that there is only one center controlling both zzso
