We report on the possibilities of a new method development zzso zzso that searches the zzso zzso space by systematically shifting and stretching the zzso window over different parts of the zzso In this way, the search automatically focuses on the most promising areas of the solution zzso Since only the retention properties of the first and last zzso compounds of the sample need to be zzso known, the zzso can be directly applied to samples with unknown zzso and the proposed solutions are not sensitive to any modeling zzso The search efficiency of the zzso has been evaluated on an extensive set of zzso in zzso samples covering a broad range of different retention zzso Compared to a pure zzso search, the zzso could reduce the number of missed components by 50% and zzso The zzso has also been applied to solve three different real-world separation problems from the pharmaceutical zzso All problems could be successfully solved in a very short time zzso of 12 h of instrument zzso
