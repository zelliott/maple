The zzso head within a fully penetrating well may be estimated by evaluating the zzso equation at the radius of the zzso A method is presented here to extend results from the zzso equation to horizontal zzso and to partially penetrating zzso The particular model used in this investigation is based upon the zzso element zzso it accurately reproduces a boundary condition of uniform head along the zzso surface at the zzso face of the zzso This model is exercised over a representative range of parameters including the zzso zzso zzso and pumping rate, and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are presented in a set of figures and tables that compare the zzso zzso to the zzso that would have been obtained using the zzso solution with the same pumping rate and zzso A methodology is presented to estimate the head within a horizontal or partially penetrating well by adding a correction term to results that can be readily obtained from computer models of vertical fully penetrating zzso This approach may also be used to contrast the differences in head between horizontal and vertical zzso of various zzso zzso and placement zzso
