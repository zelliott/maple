To validate a new zzso zzso method for the zzso of regional zzso zzso consumption during zzso stress with zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso prepared zzso sequence was modified to measure zzso zzso within a single zzso Six beagle dogs were randomly selected for the induction of coronary artery zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso experiments were performed with the zzso imaging and zzso zzso imaging at rest and during either zzso or zzso zzso zzso blood flow zzso was zzso using a previously developed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso extraction fraction zzso and consumption zzso ) were calculated using a zzso model developed zzso PET imaging using (11) zzso and zzso zzso was performed in the same day to validate zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso mapping sequence measured regional zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso By zzso zzso analysis, zzso measured by zzso is closely correlated with that measured by PET zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Similar correlation zzso were observed for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 9, mean difference of PET - zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 7, mean difference zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso imaging method may allow quantitative zzso of regional zzso zzso with relatively good zzso The precision of the method remains to be zzso
