To formulate a mathematical model of zzso zzso growth and establish the dynamics of zzso enlargement and role of zzso pressure forces throughout its zzso 

The model assumed a zzso zzso with a zzso lining of living cells and a core consisting of zzso cellular material, including generic zzso material, fed by the continuous death of zzso cells in the zzso The lining cells were assumed to have both elastic and viscous properties, reflecting the action of physical stresses by the surrounding zzso zzso composed of zzso and collagen zzso The model couples the zzso radius and zzso pressure differences resulting in a system of 2 zzso ordinary differential zzso 

The model predicts that in all zzso regimens the long-time behavior of the zzso is the same and that linear zzso expansion zzso 

In the early and intermediate stages of zzso growth, zzso pressure differences play an important zzso however, in very large zzso this role becomes zzso and cell birth in the lining dominates zzso
