zzso removal from zzso signals is an essential component of the zzso processing zzso The need for powerful and robust methods for this process has become particularly acute as zzso technology deployment zzso transition from the current zzso setting toward a zzso and ubiquitous monitoring zzso Currently, determining the relative efficacy and performance of the multiple artifact removal techniques available on real world data can be problematic, due to incomplete information on the zzso desired zzso The majority of techniques are presently evaluated using simulated data, and therefore, the quality of the conclusions is contingent on the zzso of the model zzso zzso in the biomedical signal processing community, there is considerable focus on the generation and validation of appropriate signal models for use in artifact zzso Most approaches rely on mathematical models which capture suitable approximations to the signal dynamics or underlying physiology and, therefore, introduce some uncertainty to subsequent predictions of zzso zzso This paper describes a more empirical approach to the modeling of the desired signal that we demonstrate for functional brain monitoring tasks which allows for the procurement of a zzso zzso signal which is highly correlated to a true desired signal that has been contaminated with zzso The availability of this zzso zzso together with the corrupted zzso can then aid in determining the efficacy of selected artifact removal zzso A number of commonly implemented artifact removal techniques were evaluated using the described methodology to validate the proposed novel test zzso
