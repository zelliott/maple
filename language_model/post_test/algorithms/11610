zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso The zzso used was designed to induce an zzso binding site with zzso zzso for the zzso plus a zzso environment to accelerate zzso A recent X-ray crystal structure of zzso has shown that the binding pocket contains an array of both polar and charged zzso Nevertheless, zzso is able to catalyze a reaction that involves a decrease in polarity from zzso to transition zzso The origins of this phenomenon were explored using various zzso zzso mechanics, zzso models, zzso molecular zzso free energy zzso and linear interaction zzso combination of which has produced a consistent picture of zzso By partially zzso the charged zzso zzso manages to effect zzso on the zzso without burying the zzso in a zzso region of the binding zzso The results have implications for that broad class of zzso and zzso zzso reactions that involve the conversion of a zzso with a relatively localized charge into a transition state with a highly dispersed zzso
