the use of movement monitors zzso for measuring physical activity zzso in intervention and zzso studies is becoming a standard methodology for the objective measurement of sedentary and active behaviors and for the validation of zzso PA zzso A vital step in PA measurement is the zzso of daily time into zzso wear and zzso intervals using its recordings zzso and an zzso zzso 

the purpose of this study was to validate and improve a commonly used zzso for zzso zzso wear and zzso time intervals using objective movement data obtained in the zzso indirect zzso 

we conducted a validation study of a wear or zzso automatic zzso using data obtained from 49 adults and 76 youth wearing zzso during a strictly monitored zzso stay in a room zzso The zzso wear and zzso time classified by the zzso was compared with actual wearing zzso Potential improvements to the zzso were examined using the minimum zzso error as an zzso zzso 

the recommended elements in the new zzso are as zzso 1) zzso threshold during a zzso time zzso 2) zzso time window for consecutive zero or zzso counts, and 3) allowance of zzso zzso of zzso counts with the upstream or downstream zzso consecutive zzso window for detection of zzso zzso Compared with the true wearing status, improvements to the zzso decreased zzso time zzso during the waking and the zzso periods (all P values zzso zzso 

the zzso wear or zzso time zzso improvements may lead to more accurate zzso of time spent in sedentary and active zzso
