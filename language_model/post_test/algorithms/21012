Strokes are a leading cause of morbidity and the first cause of adult disability in the United zzso Currently, no zzso are being used clinically to diagnose acute zzso zzso A diagnostic test using a blood sample from a patient would potentially be beneficial in treating the zzso 

A zzso approach is described for zzso between zzso samples of stroke patients and controls, and a second novel zzso model is developed for predicting the severity of stroke as measured by the National Institutes of Health Stroke zzso zzso The models were constructed by applying the zzso Analysis of Data zzso methodology to the mass peak profiles of 48 stroke patients and 32 zzso The zzso model was shown to have an accuracy of zzso when tested on an independent validation set of 35 stroke patients and 25 controls, while the zzso model exhibited superior performance when compared to alternative zzso In spite of their high zzso both models are extremely simple and were developed using a common set consisting of only 3 zzso 

We have successfully identified 3 zzso that can detect zzso stroke with an accuracy of zzso The performance of the zzso model on the validation set and on zzso does not deteriorate significantly when compared to that on the training set, indicating the zzso of the zzso As in the case of the zzso zzso model, the results of the zzso model validate the function constructed on our zzso for zzso the severity scores of stroke zzso The correlation and root mean absolute error of the zzso zzso model are consistently superior to those of the other zzso used zzso zzso machines, zzso decision trees, zzso zzso and zzso zzso
