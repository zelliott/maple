Recently, there has been an increased interest in quantitative MR parameters to improve diagnosis and zzso zzso mapping requires multiple images acquired with different zzso usually resulting in long acquisition zzso While acquisition time can be reduced by acquiring zzso data, obtaining accurate estimates of parameters from zzso data is a challenging problem, in particular for structures with high spatial frequency zzso In this work, principal component analysis is combined with a zzso zzso to reconstruct maps of selected principal component zzso from highly zzso zzso zzso zzso This novel approach zzso the cost function of the zzso problem yielding a more accurate and reliable zzso of MR zzso zzso The proposed zzso of principal component zzso maps using compressed zzso demonstrated in zzso and in zzso and compared with two other zzso previously developed for zzso zzso
