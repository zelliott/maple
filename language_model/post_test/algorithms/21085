Eight different learning zzso used for creating artificial neural network zzso models and the different ANN models in the prediction of coronary artery disease zzso are zzso 

This work was carried out as a retrospective zzso zzso Overall, 124 consecutive patients who had been diagnosed with zzso by coronary zzso (at least 1 coronary zzso zzso 50% in major zzso zzso were enrolled in the zzso zzso the 113 people zzso 2) with normal coronary arteries were taken as control zzso zzso zzso ANN architecture were zzso The ANN models trained with different learning zzso were performed in 237 records, divided into training zzso and testing zzso data zzso The performance of prediction was evaluated by sensitivity, specificity and accuracy values based on standard zzso 

The results have demonstrated that ANN models trained with eight different learning zzso are promising because of high zzso than zzso sensitivity, specificity and accuracy values in the prediction of zzso zzso sensitivity and specificity values varied between zzso zzso and zzso for training, zzso For testing, the values were more than zzso for sensitivity, zzso for specificity and zzso for zzso 

It may be proposed that the use of different learning zzso other than zzso and larger sample sizes can improve the performance of zzso The proposed ANN models trained with these learning zzso could be used a promising approach for predicting zzso without the need for invasive diagnostic methods and could help in the zzso clinical zzso
