The differentiation between dental and skeletal anterior open zzso both with distinct zzso and zzso is necessary to establish adequate zzso and zzso treatment zzso 

To establish a formula for the differential diagnosis of dental anterior open bite and skeletal anterior open bite based on a zzso analysis of the angles that measure the zzso plane inclination zzso the vertical and zzso zzso growth zzso and the zzso Axis zzso 

78 lateral zzso of individuals with ages varying from 6 to 13 years, were analyzed and divided into two groups: dental anterior open bite and skeletal anterior open zzso 

There was a significant difference between the groups regarding the zzso of the zzso for the group with skeletal anterior open bite the zzso and the zzso angles were bigger and the zzso Axis angle was smaller when compared to the group with dental anterior open zzso The adjustment to the linear function resulted in a formula that determines the type of anterior open bite with only zzso of zzso 

It was possible to establish a high precision formula for the differential diagnosis between dental and skeletal open zzso based on the angle zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The presented formula for the differential diagnosis has research and clinical zzso
