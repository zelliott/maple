The current gold standard of zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso is manually manipulated and still has significant room for improvement in performance and zzso 

This paper reports our developments toward automated zzso surveillance that employs a shape memory zzso zzso scanning zzso In conjunction with the zzso advances, we use modified commercial zzso computer vision software capable of converting zzso video of the zzso into stitched zzso 

Experimental results conducted on a synthetic zzso demonstrate that this zzso scanning tool can help zzso of the entire zzso surface being zzso Although the panoramic zzso zzso increases the field of view and generates reasonable results in many cases, some image matching failures result in incompleteness in its full panoramic zzso 

Our current study ensures that the automated steering mechanism can follow the desired trajectory to scan the surface of the zzso but must be zzso The current reconstruction zzso needs further zzso Our methodology may constitute a first step in suggesting a new automated and zzso zzso surveillance zzso
