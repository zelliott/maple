Previous zzso of zzso zzso zzso were slow or designed for zzso zzso sacrificing two unique and extremely beneficial aspects of light zzso zzso imaging in multiple zzso This is especially unfortunate because, among the zzso techniques, SIM is an attractive choice for zzso zzso it requires no special zzso or high light zzso to achieve twice zzso resolution in three zzso Furthermore, its zzso nature makes it zzso and zzso the acquisition speed from the size of the lateral field of view, meaning that high frame rates over large volumes are zzso Here, we report a previously zzso SIM setup that is fast enough to record zzso zzso zzso of living whole zzso Using rapidly zzso liquid crystal devices and a flexible zzso grid pattern zzso to switch between zzso zzso quickly, we show volume rates as high as 4 s in one color and zzso s in two colors over tens of time zzso To demonstrate the capabilities of our zzso we image a variety of biological structures, including zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso in either zzso cells or cultured zzso
