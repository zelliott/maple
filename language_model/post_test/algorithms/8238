This paper presents a zzso zzso model to reconstruct sparse images when the observations are obtained from linear transformations and corrupted by an additive white zzso zzso Our zzso zzso model is well suited to such naturally sparse image applications as it seamlessly accounts for properties such as zzso and zzso of the image via appropriate zzso zzso We propose a prior that is based on a weighted mixture of a positive exponential distribution and a mass at zzso The prior has zzso that are tuned automatically by zzso over the zzso zzso zzso To overcome the complexity of the zzso distribution, a Gibbs sampling strategy is zzso The Gibbs samples can be used to estimate the image to be recovered, zzso by maximizing the estimated zzso zzso In our fully zzso approach, the zzso of all the parameters are zzso Thus, our zzso provides more information than other previously proposed sparse reconstruction methods that only give a point zzso The performance of the proposed zzso zzso sparse reconstruction method is illustrated on synthetic data and real data collected from a tobacco virus sample using a zzso zzso zzso
