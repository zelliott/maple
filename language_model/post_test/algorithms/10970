We hypothesized that patients with bipolar disorder would demonstrate verbal recognition performance deficits consistent with processing efficiency theory, a theory about how emotional states zzso performance by interfering with working memory resources or increasing cognitive zzso We predicted that zzso a manic group zzso would demonstrate slow reaction time zzso and low zzso zzso a zzso group zzso would demonstrate slow zzso to maintain high zzso and zzso a healthy comparison group zzso would demonstrate fast zzso and high zzso The groups were administered zzso scales and compared on a zzso zzso directed forgetting in recognition zzso This task requires participants to comply with an overt instruction to forget irrelevant studied words, and it places a relatively high demand on working zzso The manic group was impaired on zzso zzso however, when zzso was statistically controlled, the groups demonstrated similar zzso zzso These findings are consistent with processing efficiency zzso They suggest that bipolar patients perform directed forgetting in recognition by increasing zzso control at zzso at the expense of processing efficiency, although acute mania reduces the capacity for control, thereby zzso recognition zzso zzso with processing efficiency are viewed as trait characteristics of bipolar disorder that may be overlooked by traditional zzso zzso
