The concept of zzso zzso was proposed originally to map the zzso of band energy in zzso zzso with a spatial resolution of a few zzso in a scanning transmission electron microscope with the focus beam zzso In this paper, several techniques were developed to demonstrate the possibility to map the distribution of zzso energies for zzso zzso structures using electron zzso imaging zzso The phase correlation function was used to register different zzso images among zzso series with an accuracy of 1 zzso The energy zzso of zzso series was improved by a fast zzso transform zzso zzso An zzso multivariable least square zzso was derived to refine the fitting of the single scattering distribution to an zzso form of the density of states function zzso - zzso The zzso of the band energy of the quantum well can be revealed from the zzso zzso A threshold filter method is applied to estimate the average value and zzso of the zzso energy from barrier and well regions in the energy zzso The average zzso energy of zzso and zzso is determined to be zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso on the accuracy of zzso determination is zzso The zzso accuracy of this analysis is comparable to half of the energy resolution of the zzso zzso
