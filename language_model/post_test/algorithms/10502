The detection of zzso in the gastrointestinal tract can be performed using optical zzso based on zzso optical filters and silicon zzso This paper describes two optical zzso that can be used for zzso data collection in two different spectral bands (one in the zzso region and the other in the green zzso for which two optical filters were designed and zzso An empirical analysis of gastrointestinal zzso data using these specific spectral bands is zzso The obtained results show that it is possible to accurately differentiate zzso zzso from normal zzso with a sensitivity and specificity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso the developed filters can be used as a tool to aid in zzso The small size of the optical zzso can zzso in the future, integration in zzso zzso
