zzso zzso is traditionally considered the zzso part of global right zzso zzso zzso zzso Less attention has been paid to zzso zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate RV zzso motion by cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso in a large cohort of patients and to assess its relationship with RV ejection fraction zzso 

We zzso analyzed the zzso scans of 300 patients referred to our center in zzso zzso was determined from short axis sequences using the zzso zzso zzso parameters called RV fractional diameter changes were calculated after measuring RV zzso and zzso diameters at zzso and zzso in short axis view zzso zzso and zzso We also measured the zzso zzso plane zzso excursion zzso as a zzso zzso 

Our population was divided into 2 groups according to zzso 250 patients had a preserved zzso zzso and 50 had a RV dysfunction zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso motions were significantly reduced in the group with RV dysfunction zzso After zzso analysis, areas under the curve for zzso zzso and zzso were respectively zzso zzso and zzso with the highest specificity and sensitivity respectively of zzso and zzso for zzso zzso at zzso for predicting RV zzso zzso had an excellent negative zzso value of zzso 

RV fractional diameter changes, especially at the zzso appear to be accurate for zzso assessment of RV function by zzso A zzso of zzso for zzso zzso patients with a low zzso or a preserved zzso
