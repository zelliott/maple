The influence of zzso modifications in zzso fluid characteristics on heart rate was investigated by using a detailed computer model of zzso electrical zzso Changes similar to those occurring in the course of zzso in zzso zzso of sodium (from 138 to 140 zzso zzso (from 6 to zzso zzso and calcium (from zzso to zzso zzso zzso as well as in pH (from zzso to zzso and zzso volume were zzso The model predicted that such changes may largely influence the rhythm of the zzso zzso zzso causing the heart rate to range from 69 to 86 zzso Heart rate increases after removing zzso (up to 7 zzso and also after calcium zzso (up to 11 zzso whereas restoring pH slows heart beat (up to 6 zzso zzso sodium has no significant influence, but the heart rate strictly depends on zzso sodium concentration (5 zzso A complex dependence of heart rate on zzso and pH was also zzso Providing zzso zzso concentration is maintained above 5 zzso heart rate exhibits low sensitivity to changes in calcium and zzso When zzso concentration is reduced below zzso zzso heart rate sensitivity to calcium and zzso increases significantly to 10 and 30 zzso zzso A sustained increase in heart rate always zzso to an increase in zzso sodium zzso
