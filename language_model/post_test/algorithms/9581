In this paper, we present a new zzso efficient zzso scheme for the minimizing flow approach for optimal mass transport zzso with applications to zzso zzso image zzso The approach zzso all of the zzso data in both images, and the optimal mapping from image A to image B is the inverse of the optimal mapping from B to zzso Further, no landmarks need to be zzso and the zzso of the distance functional involved is zzso Our zzso also employs zzso and parallel zzso on a consumer graphics processing unit zzso for fast zzso Although computing the optimal map has been shown to be zzso expensive in the past, we show that our approach is orders of magnitude faster then previous work and is capable of finding transport maps with zzso measures zzso zzso previously unattainable by other works (which directly influences the accuracy of zzso We give results where the zzso was used to zzso zzso registrations of zzso synthetic data as well as zzso zzso and zzso zzso brain zzso zzso
