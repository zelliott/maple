zzso of water and fat in magnetic resonance imaging zzso is important for biomedical research and clinical zzso In this paper, we propose a zzso approach for the zzso zzso decomposition zzso Our contribution consists of two zzso 1) a zzso zzso random field zzso energy model to formulate the local zzso of field zzso 2) a new zzso conditional modes zzso zzso accounting for zzso zzso of the zzso energy zzso The zzso energy model is integrated with background masking to prevent error propagation of background estimates as well as improve zzso The central component of our new ICM zzso is the stability tracking zzso mechanism intended to zzso track zzso stability on zzso so that zzso per iteration is performed only on zzso zzso The ST mechanism significantly improves the efficiency of zzso We also develop a zzso zzso zzso to provide good initial guesses for ICM zzso and an zzso zzso scheme for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso We evaluate the robust of our approach with high-resolution mouse zzso acquired from zzso zzso
