zzso the causes of aging is a complex problem due to the multiple factors that influence aging, which include zzso environment, metabolism and zzso among zzso These multiple factors create logistical difficulties in the evaluation of zzso zzso There is a need for good model systems to evaluate potential zzso zzso The model systems used should represent the complexities of aging in humans, so that the findings may be zzso to human studies, but they should also present an opportunity to minimize the variables so that the experimental results can be accurately zzso In addition to positively affecting zzso the impact of the compound on the zzso zzso of aging, including zzso and the health zzso period of life where an zzso is generally healthy and free from serious or chronic zzso the model zzso needs to be zzso zzso is considered a major zzso of aging in fruit zzso It is well established that female flies that are exposed to toxic substances typically reduce their dietary intake and their zzso output and display an zzso lifespan zzso As a result, drugs that achieve longevity benefits by reducing zzso as a result of diminished food intake are probably not useful candidates for eventual treatment of aging in humans and should be eliminated during the screening zzso zzso zzso provides a suitable model system for the screening of zzso compounds as zzso zzso and humans have many zzso zzso and biological zzso In this paper, I propose an zzso to screen zzso compounds using zzso zzso as a model zzso
