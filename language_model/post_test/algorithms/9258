The zzso interaction that is characterized by a potential of mean force zzso between zzso zzso zzso immersed in the simple point charge zzso model for water was studied using an interaction site model integral equation based on a zzso theory for molecular zzso For comparison with the zzso for various size zzso in the zzso model, the zzso in a zzso zzso model for a zzso whose diameter is same as the zzso model were also studied using a zzso chain integral zzso It is noted in the zzso model that the hydrogen bond and its network structure are completely ignored, but the zzso zzso is taken into zzso Both zzso obtained from the zzso model and from the zzso model have a large first minimum at a contact distance of zzso In the case that the zzso size is about three times larger than water, these zzso also have a large maximum at a longer distance than the contact zzso The strong attraction is attributed to the zzso zzso of the zzso and that the large zzso barrier is arising from the weak attraction between the zzso and the zzso The comparison between the zzso model and the zzso zzso model suggests that the qualitative description of the zzso interaction is possible by using the zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso tendency on the surface of the zzso zzso in a room condition is observed only on the zzso zzso These results indicate that the characteristics of water such as the hydrogen bond affect rather the zzso zzso than the zzso zzso
