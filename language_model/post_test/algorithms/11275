The Clinical and Laboratory zzso Institute recently published zzso zzso for Laboratory Testing and Diagnosis of Human zzso zzso zzso zzso Approved zzso zzso which includes a state of the art zzso for identifying zzso acute and zzso zzso To assess the ability of Canadian laboratories to detect these sample types and the impact of zzso the National Laboratory for zzso zzso Services distributed a special proficiency testing zzso 

zzso was sent to 42 laboratories across zzso It contained one zzso negative sample zzso two zzso positive samples (A and zzso one zzso positive sample zzso and one zzso zzso zzso zzso positive sample zzso Data was collected and analyzed using zzso a standardized zzso zzso 

zzso laboratories returned zzso Sample B zzso zzso was identified by zzso of laboratories zzso and samples A and E zzso zzso by zzso zzso No laboratory identified sample C as zzso positive, although zzso zzso detected zzso prompting a referral for further zzso The remaining laboratories identified sample C as zzso positive zzso indeterminate zzso or gave no final status zzso Sample D zzso zzso zzso zzso was correctly identified by two laboratories as zzso zzso positive while zzso zzso detected zzso recommending further zzso One laboratory did not provide a final zzso zzso six laboratories called this sample zzso zzso 

Although there is a high quality of zzso testing across Canada, introduction of the zzso zzso would further improve the ability of laboratories to diagnose zzso acute and zzso zzso
