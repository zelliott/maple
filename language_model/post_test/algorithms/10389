In this study, variations in the particulate organic carbon zzso were monitored during a zzso bloom event, and the corresponding changes in zzso properties were tracked at one station zzso zzso located in the Pearl River zzso A greater than zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed during the zzso with the zzso a concentration zzso varying from zzso to zzso zzso zzso A power law function is used to describe the relationship between zzso and zzso and the zzso ratio tends to change zzso with zzso zzso carbon concentration is indirectly estimated using the conceptual model proposed by zzso et zzso zzso and this carbon is found to contribute zzso zzso to total zzso The estimated zzso ratio of zzso in zzso waters is found to be comparable with results reported in the zzso zzso zzso for determining the zzso of zzso and zzso were developed based on the relationships of these variables with the zzso zzso zzso With these zzso models, the levels of particulate organic carbon and zzso could be predicted from the zzso data measured by a marine optical zzso which showed much more detailed information about the zzso in zzso parameters during this bloom zzso
