In this paper, we present the design of a novel zzso zzso zzso that zzso a natural amount of knee compliance during the weight acceptance phase and potentially the entire stance phase of the zzso and allows for free motion during the rest of the zzso We explain that the unaffected knee behaves close to a linear zzso spring in stance and zzso that an zzso device that places a linear spring of appropriate zzso in parallel with the knee can help restore the natural behavior of the joint in zzso We present the design of a zzso zzso mechanism and a control zzso that engages the spring in parallel with the knee in stance and zzso it during the swing phase of zzso and explain how this module is implemented into a brace in order to create a novel class of zzso stance control zzso The device is zzso in that a small zzso serves to lock and zzso the spring zzso but the device otherwise requires no zzso and very little power, computation, and control to zzso
