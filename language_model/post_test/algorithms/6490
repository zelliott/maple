This study demonstrates the power of a novel zzso approach developed for the detection and identification of biological markers in body zzso The goal was to observe zzso in the protein patterns of zzso fluid zzso related to zzso lateral sclerosis zzso a neurodegenerative disorder with unknown zzso In the experiments, zzso zzso of zzso from patients and healthy controls were analyzed by zzso zzso liquid zzso transform zzso zzso resonance mass zzso zzso zzso Typically, around zzso peptides were detected in one such experiment, and a pattern recognition program was constructed for the data analysis to distinguish mass zzso from patients and zzso This strategy was evaluated comparing the zzso patterns of zzso spiked in zzso with a zzso with control zzso The patterns were clearly separated and the zzso peptides of the zzso were successfully selected as characteristic zzso zzso the method was applied to compare mass zzso of zzso from 12 zzso and 10 matched healthy zzso While no zzso alone could be identified from the characteristic peaks, we were able to assign 4 out of 5 unknown samples correctly zzso zzso correctly zzso zzso zzso and it would be zzso if we reject a possible zzso believed to be caused by an zzso in the spinal zzso zzso These findings are very promising, although the clinical relevance is not fully established due to the low number of unknown samples zzso In addition to the diagnostic potential, these results may be important steps towards understanding the neurodegenerative zzso
