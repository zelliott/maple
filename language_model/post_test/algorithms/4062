zzso zzso zzso zzso is an established treatment for zzso zzso zzso A key feature of the RCA procedure is the need for a mapping approach that zzso the identification of the target zzso zzso In this study, we investigate the effect of the location of the reference potential and spatial anatomical constraints on the accuracy of an zzso to identify the target site for zzso therapy of zzso This zzso involves processing body surface zzso using the single equivalent moving zzso zzso model embedded in an infinite homogeneous volume conductor to model cardiac electrical zzso We employed a zzso animal model and an zzso array of nine zzso that was zzso on the zzso surface of the right zzso We identified two potential reference zzso locations: at an zzso most far away from the heart zzso and at the average of all 64 body surface zzso zzso zzso Also, we developed three spatial zzso schemes of the zzso used to obtain the zzso location: one that does not impose any constraint on the inverse solution zzso one that zzso the solution into a volume that zzso to the heart zzso and one that zzso the solution into a volume that zzso to the body surface zzso We have found that zzso is the most accurate approach zzso zzso zzso versus zzso at earliest zzso zzso for zzso zzso electrical sources of known locations in zzso Although the homogeneous volume conductor introduces systematic error in the estimated compared to the true zzso location, we have observed that the overall error of the estimated zzso distance compared to the true one was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the zzso and zzso combinations, respectively, at the EAT zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, at the pacing spike time zzso zzso In conclusion, our zzso to estimate the zzso parameters from body surface zzso can potentially be a useful method to rapidly and accurately guide the zzso tip to the target site during a RCA procedure without the need for spatial anatomical information obtained by conventional imaging zzso
