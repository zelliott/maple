A vitamin zzso protein zzso from chicken serum has been zzso to zzso by zzso affinity zzso and characterized by gel zzso and zzso zzso of its zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso is a zzso with a molecular mass of about 70 zzso and a protein zzso of about 40 zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso complexes are relatively broad zzso (with or without zzso zzso shifted downfield by zzso zzso from the position of the free zzso zzso From the line zzso data, the relaxation of the zzso nucleus is found to be dominated by chemical shift zzso with a very minor zzso component from zzso interaction with the two nearest neighbor zzso The zzso correlation time of the zzso at 25 degrees C is estimated to be 85 zzso and the zzso energy for zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The downfield shift of the zzso zzso of zzso upon binding to the zzso cannot be due to hydrogen bonding zzso zzso or displacement of the zzso base by a group on the zzso zzso also show that the downfield shift is very unlikely to be due to zzso zzso of the zzso nucleus by the ring current of an aromatic zzso of the zzso It is concluded that the downfield shift of the zzso resonance must be due to zzso induced changes in zzso zzso which may, or may not, involve zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
