To compare the efficacy and safety of different zzso of zzso with that of zzso and zzso in zzso Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes zzso controlled by diet and zzso 

In the zzso zzso phase of this zzso study, zzso patients aged zzso years with type 2 diabetes zzso zzso zzso to zzso were zzso to zzso with zzso zzso zzso 25 or 50 zzso once daily, zzso or zzso zzso zzso three times daily for a period of 12 zzso In a subsequent zzso long-term extension phase, patients continued on the same treatment for an additional 40 weeks zzso in the zzso group were reassigned equally to one of the four zzso zzso 

The primary efficacy zzso was the change in zzso from the baseline value at week 12 of zzso Safety zzso were the occurrence of adverse events, vital sign zzso physical examination and zzso findings, and laboratory test results recorded over the entire 52-week zzso 

zzso was zzso reduced by zzso and the changes versus baseline were statistically significant with all four zzso in comparison with both zzso and zzso In addition, changes in zzso plasma zzso and zzso plasma zzso zzso values were significantly greater with all four zzso of zzso in comparison with zzso The zzso of adverse events with zzso over 52 weeks was not zzso and was lower than with zzso zzso occurred infrequently and was generally rated as zzso Changes in body weight with zzso were minimal zzso zzso and not clinically zzso 

zzso was well tolerated and zzso improved zzso parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes zzso controlled on diet and zzso
