The forces responsible for zzso in initial oral bacterial zzso are zzso Since zzso der zzso and zzso forces work zzso upon approach, it is hypothesized that zzso is governed by hydrogen zzso zzso analysis of zzso forces observed during the zzso of bacterial zzso from surfaces in atomic force zzso can be used to analyze the nature of the zzso zzso zzso zzso forces increased from about zzso to zzso zzso when the contact time between cell surfaces and zzso films on zzso was increased from 0 to 120 zzso zzso and final zzso forces were stronger for initial zzso of tooth surfaces zzso zzso zzso zzso than for later, more zzso strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after increased contact times showed minor peaks, representative of hydrogen bonds, and zzso analyses indicated repulsive zzso forces of around zzso zzso and slightly more attractive zzso forces zzso zzso for initial than for late zzso zzso zzso
