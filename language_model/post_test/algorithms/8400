zzso molecular dynamics zzso computer simulations are used to calculated the bulk zzso for a zzso zzso A methodology is developed zzso zzso can be effectively used to calculate material properties for complex systems that undergo long zzso zzso zzso It is found that the bulk zzso upon expansion from a zero stress state agrees well with experimental zzso However, it is also found that the zzso upon contraction from a zero stress state is zzso From a molecular perspective, it is possible to explain this phenomena by examining the molecular origins of the pressure zzso The finding that the two zzso are not equal upon zzso and expansion is in apparent contradiction to zzso stress experiments where the area zzso was found to be the same upon expansion and zzso This issue is zzso
