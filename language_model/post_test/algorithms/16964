zzso zzso segments within completely zzso zzso provides valuable information to address zzso evolution and in particular the important question of the emergence of novel zzso The usual approach to gene zzso zzso based on zzso protein gene zzso provides only a restricted view of zzso 

In this paper, we introduce zzso zzso a software using a flow based zzso zzso targeted at detecting tandem zzso zzso of moderate to longer length regions, with possibly locally weak similarities, directly at the DNA zzso On the zzso zzso zzso using a reference set of tandem duplicated genes built using zzso we show that zzso zzso is able to predict a large fraction of recently duplicated genes zzso zzso 1) and that it is also able to predict tandem zzso involving non coding elements such as zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso zzso allows to identify large tandem zzso without any zzso leading to agnostic identification of tandem zzso This approach nicely zzso the usual protein gene based which ignores zzso involving non coding zzso It is however inherently restricted to relatively recent zzso By recovering otherwise ignored events, zzso zzso gives a more comprehensive view of existing evolutionary processes and may also allow to improve existing zzso
