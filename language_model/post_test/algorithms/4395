The idea that models should be as simple as possible is often accepted without zzso However, too much zzso and zzso may degrade a zzso zzso Models are often constructed to make zzso yet, they are commonly zzso with a focus on zzso regardless of whether zzso the zzso data can zzso simulated predictions or zzso the number and type of zzso parameters are commensurate with the zzso property details on which key predictions may zzso zzso estimated through the zzso process is commonly limited by the necessity that the number of zzso parameters be smaller than the number of zzso This limitation largely stems from historical restrictions in zzso and computing zzso we argue here that better methods and computing capabilities are now available and should become more widely zzso To make this case, two approaches to model zzso are zzso zzso a traditional approach based on a small number of homogeneous zzso zones defined by the zzso a zzso and zzso zzso zzso which includes many more parameters than the traditional zzso We discuss some advantages of zzso zzso focusing on the increased insight that can be gained from zzso zzso We present these issues using reasoning that we believe has a common sense appeal to zzso knowledge of mathematics is not required to follow our zzso We present equations in an zzso however, to illustrate the fundamental differences between traditional model zzso and a zzso inversion zzso
