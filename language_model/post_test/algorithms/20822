We make use of the zzso simulation random walk zzso method to zzso the zzso diffusion zzso of electrons in zzso materials via zzso zzso First, a summary of zzso results is given that relates the diffusion zzso obtained from zzso to those in the zzso zzso and hopping zzso zzso are performed in a three-dimensional lattice of trap sites with energies distributed according to an exponential distribution and with a zzso distribution centered at the Fermi zzso It is observed that once the stationary state is reached, the ensemble of particles follow zzso statistics with a zzso Fermi zzso In this stationary situation the diffusion zzso obeys the theoretical predictions so that zzso effectively reproduces the zzso zzso zzso can be also zzso when an electrical bias is applied and they are observed to comply with the Einstein relation when compared with zzso diffusion zzso The evolution of the system towards the stationary situation is also zzso When the diffusion zzso are monitored along simulation time a transition from anomalous to zzso transport is zzso The nature of this transition is discussed in terms of the evolution of electron distribution and the Fermi zzso All these results will facilitate the use of RW simulation and related methods to interpret zzso as well as transient experimental zzso
