The form of the two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso allow to study zzso fluid dynamics in zzso systems by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso relaxation zzso given rise to numerous zzso zzso we find zzso a number of fundamental structural properties of the zzso within the zzso zzso we establish relationships between the signs and zzso of the diagonal and zzso in zzso obtained by various 1 and zzso zzso techniques, reveal zzso of the zzso and uncover zzso between zzso We investigate more specifically a practically important case of porous system that has sets of zzso and zzso and zzso similar to each other by applying the zzso zzso zzso we provide a comparative analysis of the application of the, zzso more rigorous, zzso zzso and the, rather more zzso zzso zzso exchange model to zzso zzso Finally we put the results that we could formulate zzso to the test by comparing them with zzso for zzso porous model zzso The structural properties, in general, are to provide useful clues for assignment and analysis of relaxation zzso The most striking of zzso presence of negative zzso an urgent need for improvement of the current zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso used for calculation of relaxation zzso from zzso raw zzso
