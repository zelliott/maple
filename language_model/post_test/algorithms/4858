Magic angle spinning zzso is used in solid-state zzso to remove the broadening effects of the chemical shift zzso zzso In this work we investigate a technique that can reintroduce the zzso in order to selectively zzso zzso zzso The technique involves an zzso sweep of the radio frequency field through a multiple of the spinning zzso The selectivity of this inversion mechanism is determined by the size of the zzso We develop a theoretical framework to describe this process and demonstrate the zzso selective inversion with zzso simulations and experimental zzso We combine this approach with zzso zzso for potential applications in zzso zzso zzso
