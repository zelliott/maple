The zzso of white matter tracts using zzso has previously been achieved by displaying zzso that pass between regions of interest zzso These techniques require a significant amount of user interaction, and their results are entirely dependent on the positioning of the zzso Furthermore, in patients with zzso zzso secondary to zzso vascular zzso there is often significant cerebral zzso and zzso artifact from the zzso which degrade the reliability of zzso In this paper, the zzso objectives were to zzso the motor pathways of patients with zzso and zzso vascular zzso by using a novel zzso technique that functions without the need for multiple zzso 

The authors investigated the zzso appearance of the descending motor pathways in 6 patients with zzso vascular zzso Of these patients 4 presented with a spontaneous zzso zzso 2 of whom were clinically zzso zzso zzso imaging was performed using a zzso clinical MR imaging system, and zzso zzso was performed after reconstruction of the zzso A fractional zzso threshold of zzso was used to terminate the zzso The semiautomatic motor zzso zzso technique required definition of a single zzso within the zzso tract of the zzso from which the descending motor pathways were automatically defined by grouping together all zzso within the entire image with a geometry similar to that of the single streamline generated from this initial zzso The results of this zzso were then visually assessed and compared with the patient's motor zzso 

The zzso semiautomatic zzso consistently zzso the location of the descending motor pathways in patients with zzso and zzso vascular zzso In 1 patient whose complete right zzso zzso zzso was caused by a large left frontal zzso that zzso the descending motor zzso the authors were unable to reconstruct the motor pathways due to severe tract zzso However, in all cases in which motor function was intact or only mildly impaired, the technique clearly delineated the motor zzso even in the presence of large anatomical displacement by the vascular zzso or associated zzso 

zzso zzso allows consistent and rapid demonstration of the descending motor pathways in patients with zzso and zzso zzso vascular zzso The technique allows the use of a comparatively low fractional zzso threshold and does not require the definition of multiple zzso These techniques may help to improve the clinical feasibility and potentially the reliability of zzso for the evaluation of patients with zzso vascular zzso as well as other zzso zzso of the zzso
