We investigated the utility of three manual zzso methods to zzso carotid plaque zzso A single observer measured 15 individual plaques from 15 three-dimensional zzso ultrasound zzso zzso images of patients ten times each using three different zzso zzso Individual plaque volumes were measured zzso zzso zzso using a standard zzso approach zzso zzso a plaque end was identified and sequential contours were zzso The same plaques were measured using a second approach zzso zzso plaque ends were first identified and the zzso US image of the plaque was then subdivided into equal zzso A third method zzso was used to measure total plaque burden zzso zzso zzso in a region zzso zzso zzso relative to the carotid zzso zzso systematically underestimated individual plaque volume compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso due to a difference in the mean plaque length zzso zzso of zzso zzso for zzso and zzso decrease with increasing plaque volume, with zzso results less than zzso Root mean square difference between experimental and theoretical zzso for zzso was zzso The standard zzso in the identification of the zzso location of the carotid zzso was zzso zzso zzso for plaque burden measured using zzso ranged from zzso to zzso and were less than zzso determined for individual plaque volumes of the same zzso The utility of zzso was demonstrated by measuring carotid plaque burden and volume change over a period of 3 months in three zzso In conclusion, zzso was determined to be a more superior measurement technique than zzso to measure individual plaque zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated the utility of zzso to zzso regional plaque burden and to zzso change in plaque zzso
