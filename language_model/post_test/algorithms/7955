A novel fast zzso retrieval zzso for zzso optical security systems based on the zzso domain is presented in this zzso Two zzso masks are efficiently determined by using a modified zzso algorithm, in which two zzso zzso zzso are replaced by one zzso transform with zzso to reduce the consumed zzso zzso results show that the proposed zzso substantially speeds up the zzso process, while keeping the reconstructed image highly correlated with the original zzso
