We used zzso components analysis to investigate the underlying zzso of the quantitative zzso zzso and their zzso in replicate 42 of the zzso Analysis Workshop 12 simulated general zzso zzso components models were fitted using Gibbs sampling in zzso zzso zzso zzso were estimated for each zzso and were used as derived zzso in subsequent linkage zzso zzso zzso linkage analyses were based upon a new zzso zzso descent zzso method that takes a weighted combination of the zzso and zzso The five quantitative traits simulated were closely correlated with each other and with affection zzso The zzso screen of quantitative traits associated with the simulated complex disease suggested that one or more major zzso regulating zzso zzso to zzso zzso and that one or more major zzso regulating zzso may zzso to zzso zzso
