Common genetic zzso may explain a portion of the zzso risk for common zzso Within candidate zzso the number of common zzso is zzso but direct zzso of all existing common zzso is inefficient, because zzso at many of these sites are strongly zzso Thus, it is not necessary to zzso all common zzso if the patterns of zzso association between common zzso can be zzso We have developed an zzso to select the zzso zzso set of common zzso zzso zzso to zzso in zzso association studies, such that all known common zzso either are directly zzso or exceed a threshold level of association with a zzso The zzso is based on the zzso linkage zzso zzso zzso because zzso is directly related to statistical power to detect disease associations with zzso zzso We show that, at a relatively stringent zzso threshold zzso the zzso zzso resolve zzso of all zzso across a set of 100 candidate zzso regardless of zzso and tag specific zzso and zzso of related zzso in zzso zzso Thus, if the patterns of common variation are described for a candidate zzso analysis of the zzso set can zzso interrogate for main effects from common functional zzso We demonstrate that, although common variation tends to be shared between zzso zzso should be selected separately for populations with different zzso
