Gene zzso is considered to be a major driving force in evolution that enables the zzso of a species to acquire new zzso A zzso mapping of gene tree zzso to the edges or zzso of a species zzso where gene zzso have occurred on the species zzso In this study, we sample zzso from a zzso over zzso gene trees, edge lengths and other zzso given a species tree and gene zzso We employ a zzso analysis zzso based on the zzso model zzso that zzso gene duplication, gene loss and sequence evolution under a relaxed molecular clock for substitution rates, to obtain this zzso
