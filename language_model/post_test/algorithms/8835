zzso techniques, such as zzso transform infrared zzso and zzso offer zzso that overlap and expand X-ray zzso and transmission electron zzso zzso analyses and help gain new insight into mechanisms of zzso zzso and zzso zzso techniques measure the molecular environment of zzso and zzso vibrating bonds, zzso As such, these techniques have widely been used to gain information on mineral content, phase, and orientation as well as chemical composition of associated organic zzso like zzso zzso or zzso The traditional zzso of optical zzso to the newer generation zzso and zzso zzso has enabled these analyses to be performed on samples with zzso zzso spatial zzso zzso we briefly discuss the basis and protocol for effective zzso using zzso zzso by taking two systems from our own research as zzso
