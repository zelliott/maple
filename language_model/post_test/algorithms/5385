zzso causes abnormal forces that may lead to loosening after knee zzso Whether a zzso technique can improve the precision of implant positioning guaranteeing good long-term results in total knee zzso this is a matter of zzso The authors evaluate the alignment accuracy of 20 primary total knee zzso performed using an zzso computer navigation systems, with standardized CT protocol and three-dimensional digital model zzso The results of this study demonstrate that the zzso navigation system is able to improve accuracy in zzso limb alignment and positioning of the components in the majority of zzso moreover, the difference between the mean mechanical axis value of the navigation system zzso and the median mean value obtained during the zzso evaluation zzso is not statistically significant zzso
