zzso zzso zzso is the most common sustained zzso and is associated with significant morbidity and zzso zzso diagnosis of the zzso particularly transient episodes, can be difficult since patients may be zzso In this study, we describe a robust zzso for automatic detection of zzso based on the zzso zzso and complexity of the heart beat zzso zzso time zzso Specifically, we employ a new zzso the Turning Points zzso in combination with the Root Mean Square of zzso zzso zzso and Shannon zzso to characterize this zzso The detection zzso was tested on two databases, namely the zzso zzso zzso Database and the zzso zzso zzso These databases contain several long zzso zzso series from a multitude of patients with and without zzso and some of the data contain various forms of zzso zzso Using thresholds and data segment lengths determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we achieved a high sensitivity and specificity zzso and zzso respectively, for the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso performed well even when tested against zzso mixed with several other potentially zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Database zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
