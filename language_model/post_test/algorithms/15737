Water plays a role in the thermodynamics of dilute zzso solutions that is unusual in two zzso First, knowledge of zzso equilibrium zzso of species is not required in calculations of zzso properties of zzso zzso and reactions at specified zzso Second, since zzso provides an essentially infinite source of oxygen atoms in a reaction system where water is a zzso oxygen atoms are not zzso in the reaction system in dilute zzso zzso This is related to the fact that zzso is omitted in equilibrium expressions for dilute zzso zzso zzso of the standard transformed Gibbs energies of formation of total carbon dioxide and total zzso at specified pH are discussed, and the average zzso of hydrogen zzso by these zzso are calculated by zzso Since both of these zzso are involved in the zzso reaction, the apparent equilibrium zzso and changes in the numbers of hydrogen zzso bound are calculated for this reaction as functions of zzso
