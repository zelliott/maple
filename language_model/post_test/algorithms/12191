zzso is considered as a valuable source of renewable zzso Indeed, it can be turned into useful energy zzso electricity, zzso and can contribute to reduce greenhouse gas zzso zzso of its safety characteristics is a very important practical zzso Experimental investigation of zzso zzso explosion characteristics was conducted in a zzso sphere at various temperatures zzso degrees zzso and at atmospheric zzso The studied zzso was made of 50% methane zzso and 50% carbon dioxide zzso It was also saturated with zzso this composition is frequently met in zzso during waste zzso There are two zzso gases in zzso water zzso and carbon zzso Its zzso water content rises along with zzso The presence of these zzso gases zzso considerably zzso characteristics compared to the ones of pure zzso explosion limits are lowered and beyond 70 degrees C, water zzso content is sufficient to zzso the zzso Furthermore, explosion violence zzso with the maximum rate of pressure rise values, zzso is three times lower for zzso than for pure methane at ambient zzso
