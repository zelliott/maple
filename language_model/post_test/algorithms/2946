A zzso approach is shown to simplify the analysis of transient zzso zzso The zzso of the characteristic zzso for kinetic equations are obtained by zzso construction of directed trees and zzso in the kinetic zzso An example of kinetic schemes, providing a simple zzso zzso solution, is zzso This example describes a zzso zzso reaction and zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso It is shown that rapid equilibrium in some parts of the kinetic scheme can simplify the zzso The zzso zzso with a product is shown to be characterized by the zzso transient zzso This phenomenon is useful to estimate correctly the kinetic zzso It is supposed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso can be important for switching the zzso zzso
