zzso for discrete energy zzso are of fundamental importance in computer zzso In this paper, we focus on the recent technique proposed by zzso et zzso zzso zzso message passing zzso It was inspired by the problem of maximizing a lower bound on the zzso However, the zzso is not guaranteed to increase this zzso may actually go zzso In addition, zzso does not always zzso We develop a modification of this zzso which we call sequential zzso message zzso Its main property is that the bound is guaranteed not to zzso We also give a weak tree agreement condition which characterizes local zzso of the bound with respect to zzso zzso We prove that our zzso has a limit point that achieves weak tree zzso Finally, we show that, our zzso requires half as much memory as traditional message passing zzso Experimental results demonstrate that on certain synthetic and real problems, our zzso zzso both the ordinary belief propagation and zzso zzso in zzso In addition, on stereo problems with zzso zzso we obtain a lower energy than graph zzso
