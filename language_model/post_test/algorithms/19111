zzso retinal zzso form an zzso detection system that drives many zzso responses to light such as zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso To understand the role of zzso size in zzso light responses, zzso diameter was zzso manipulated and the effect on behavioral phase shifts at different zzso levels was studied in the Syrian zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso size and for behavioral phase shifts were constructed for 3 zzso conditions zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was calculated from zzso zzso zzso size, retinal surface area, and zzso of zzso zzso The sensitivity of zzso responses to retinal zzso is approximately zzso log units higher than to zzso zzso When plotted against zzso zzso pharmacological zzso zzso reduces the light sensitivity of the zzso system, but zzso zzso has no zzso As expected, when plotted against retinal zzso all zzso zzso zzso confirming that the zzso system responds to zzso flux on the zzso zzso zzso does not increase the zzso response to increasing zzso since the response of the zzso system attains zzso at zzso levels lower than those required to induce zzso zzso The main finding shows that due to the different response sensitivities, the effect of zzso zzso on the light sensitivity of the zzso system in the zzso under natural conditions is virtually zzso We further suggest the existence of distinct modulating mechanisms for the differential retinal zzso sensitivity of the zzso system and the zzso system, which enables the different responses to be tuned to their specific tasks while using similar zzso zzso
