zzso models for zzso zzso zzso have been limited by modest accuracy and lack of zzso zzso zzso offer a novel methodology, which may improve zzso risk zzso among patients with zzso Our study's aim was to develop and compare zzso models for zzso development among zzso patients, using conventional zzso analysis and zzso zzso 

We enrolled zzso patients with Child A or B zzso at the University of Michigan between January 2004 and September 2006 zzso zzso and zzso followed them until zzso development, liver zzso death, or study zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso were used to construct zzso models for zzso development, which were tested on an independent validation cohort from the zzso C zzso zzso Treatment against zzso zzso zzso Both models were also compared with the previously published zzso zzso Discrimination was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, and diagnostic accuracy was assessed with net zzso improvement and integrated discrimination improvement zzso 

After a median follow-up of zzso years, 41 patients developed zzso The zzso zzso model had a zzso of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso had a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the validation zzso The zzso model had a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the validation cohort and was outperformed by the zzso zzso The zzso zzso had significantly better diagnostic accuracy as assessed by net zzso improvement zzso and integrated discrimination improvement zzso 

zzso zzso improve the accuracy of risk zzso patients with zzso and can be used to accurately identify patients at high-risk for developing zzso
