In the context of the zzso zzso of zzso the effects of zzso carbon dioxide tension zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and fetal zzso zzso zzso in terms of five constants, zzso to zzso were determined by a zzso least squares analysis of zzso records of data containing measured values of oxygen tension zzso oxygen zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The standard values of zzso to zzso used in the zzso were found to be significantly different from those giving the best fit to the present data whereas the presently used zzso for zzso was found to be zzso The zzso for fetal zzso zzso could not be determined due to insufficient zzso pH and zzso effects were found to be correlated in the data and this fact accounts for some of the zzso of zzso and zzso from the standard zzso The analysis evaluated the effect of pH as being stronger and the effect of zzso as being weaker than assumed in the standard zzso Finally the effects of the zzso of zzso and zzso were found to be correlated but no explanation of this fact is known at zzso
