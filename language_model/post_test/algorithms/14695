In pedestrian navigation systems, the position of a pedestrian is zzso using an zzso navigation zzso In the algorithm, the zero zzso updating plays an important role, where zero zzso intervals are detected and the zzso error is zzso To use the zero zzso zzso it is necessary to detect zero zzso intervals zzso A new zero detection zzso is proposed in the paper, where only one zzso value is zzso A zzso model is constructed using zzso of zzso zzso instead of using zzso zzso directly, which makes the zero zzso detection more zzso
