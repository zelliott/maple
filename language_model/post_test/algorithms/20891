We study the effects of a zzso constraint on an zzso model of zzso group formation using a coarse analysis zzso This involves using an automated zzso technique which defines a diffusion process on the graph of a sample zzso formed from a representative stationary zzso The zzso of the graph zzso are used to construct zzso coordinates which provide a zzso meaningful zzso representation of the zzso We show that, for the zzso regime zzso the second principal zzso provides a sufficient representation of the zzso and use it as a coarse zzso This allows the zzso of coarse zzso zzso which are used to compare the effects of the zzso constraint on the zzso behavior of the zzso
