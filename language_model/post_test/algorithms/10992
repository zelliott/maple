To evaluate the influence of exposure parameters and zzso based zzso reconstruction zzso on the measurement zzso of zzso zzso zzso on chest zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso lung zzso were inflated in a dedicated ex zzso phantom and prepared with zzso artificial zzso zzso was performed eight consecutive times zzso of 120 and 80 zzso with zzso 60, 30 and 12 zzso and reconstructed with filtered back projection zzso and zzso zzso volume and diameter were measured zzso with dedicated zzso The absolute percentage measurement error zzso was zzso in relation to the 120 zzso 120 zzso zzso Noise was recorded for each zzso in every zzso 

Mean zzso volume and diameter were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso reduced noise by zzso on average compared to zzso zzso zzso with zzso was equal to or slightly higher than with zzso Mean zzso for volume increased significantly below a volume zzso zzso dose index zzso of zzso zzso for 120 zzso 12 zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 80 zzso 12 zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with image noise revealed that at identical noise zzso was higher with zzso than with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is robust in a wide range of exposure settings, and zzso is reduced at a zzso below zzso zzso only, but the error rate remains clinically zzso Noise reduction by zzso is not zzso for measurement error in the setting of zzso zzso zzso on chest zzso
