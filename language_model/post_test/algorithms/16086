Interest remains strong for the development of a zzso technique for assessment of regional fatty acid zzso rate in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso and preliminarily evaluated as a metabolically trapped probe of zzso fatty acid zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso is zzso by zzso zzso assisted zzso zzso of an zzso zzso followed by alkaline zzso and by zzso by reverse phase high performance liquid zzso zzso studies in rats showed high zzso and long retention of zzso in heart, liver, and zzso consistent with relatively high fatty acid zzso rates in these zzso zzso of zzso zzso caused an zzso reduction in zzso zzso suggesting the dependence of zzso on the transport of zzso into the zzso zzso with zzso rat hearts showed that the estimates of the fractional zzso zzso rate zzso of zzso tracked zzso of zzso rate of zzso with zzso whereas the zzso of the zzso analog zzso acid was insensitive to zzso In zzso zzso of zzso in the rat was evidenced by bone zzso of zzso A PET imaging study with zzso in normal zzso showed excellent zzso images, prolonged zzso zzso and no bone zzso of zzso up to 3 zzso the last finding suggesting a species dependence for zzso of the zzso fatty zzso The results support further investigation of zzso as a potential PET zzso for assessing regional fatty acid zzso rate in the human zzso
