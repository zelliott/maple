To test whether a feeding zzso could improve the nutritional support of intensive care zzso 

Numerous factors may impede delivery of both zzso and zzso nutrition to patients in the intensive care zzso Often there is a zzso between what is prescribed and actual delivery of zzso The purpose of this study was to test the effect of a nutritional support zzso in an intensive care unit mainly by using the zzso route and if necessary by combining zzso and zzso zzso 

In this prospective study, nutritional data were collected from routinely fed critically ill patients zzso zzso during the first three days following admission to the intensive care zzso A nutritional support zzso was then implemented and nutritional data were collected from critically ill patients who participated in this intervention zzso group, zzso Data collected included the total amount of calories prescribed zzso received, onset of delivery of zzso nutrition, zzso zzso zzso nutrition, and the use and size of zzso feeding zzso 

Patients in the intervention group were both prescribed and actually received significantly larger amounts of nutrients than patients in the control zzso They also received a larger proportion of their nutrients in the form of zzso zzso In addition, the nutritional support zzso led to greater consistency in nursing practices with respect to aspiration of gastric content and rate of zzso in zzso zzso 

The study confirms that a nutritional support zzso improved the delivery of nutrients to critically ill zzso The zzso was most effective with respect to the delivery of zzso zzso The effect was primarily because of early and more rapid zzso in the delivery of zzso nutrition administered by nurses based on improved physician zzso The combination of zzso and zzso nutrition may contribute to meeting adequate nutritional zzso 

By using a nutritional zzso focused on zzso nutrition, but including zzso nutrition as a supplement, it is possible to improve the delivery of clinical nutrition in the intensive care unit zzso
