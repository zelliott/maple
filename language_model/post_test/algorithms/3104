A quantitative summary of computer models in diving applications is zzso zzso dual phase dynamics and zzso metrics in tissue and zzso zzso covered include the zzso zzso split phase zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso varying zzso reduced zzso bubble, tissue bubble zzso and zzso phase zzso Defining relationships are zzso and zzso staging regimens are zzso zzso diving sectors, and correlations are indicated for models with a history of widespread zzso zzso and safe application across recreational, scientific, military, research, and technical zzso zzso all models are incomplete, but many zzso above) are useful, having resulted in diving tables, underwater meters, and dive planning zzso Those zzso employ varying degrees of zzso and data zzso We discuss bubble metrics in tissue and blood as a backdrop against computer zzso The past 15 years, or so, have witnessed changes and additions to diving protocols and table procedures, such as shorter nonstop time limits, slower ascent rates, shallow safety stops, ascending repetitive profiles, deep zzso stops, zzso based breathing zzso permissible reverse profiles, zzso techniques, both faster and slower controlling repetitive tissue zzso smaller critical zzso longer zzso surface zzso and zzso zzso by zzso and imaging technology, table and zzso meter development, theory, statistics, chamber and animal testing, or safer diving consensus, these modifications affect a gamut of activity, spanning bounce to zzso single to zzso and air to mixed gas zzso As it turns out, there is growing support for many protocols on zzso zzso and theoretical zzso with bubble models addressing many concerns on plausible zzso but with further testing or profile data analyses zzso
