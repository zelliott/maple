Plant hormones regulate growth and responses to environmental zzso zzso action ultimately zzso cellular zzso processes and gene zzso To facilitate zzso evaluation of novel zzso and environmental responses, there is a need to rapidly assess the possible contribution of hormone action to changes in the levels of gene zzso We developed a zzso zzso that rapidly compares lists of transcripts yielding correlation zzso The application as described here, called zzso was used to analyze zzso activity in a zzso of zzso zzso zzso The veracity of the zzso analysis was established by comparison with zzso and zzso hormone zzso as well as with zzso and selected zzso zzso The zzso accurately predicted correlations between hormone action and zzso zzso for which zzso data are zzso A high degree of correlation was detected between many hormones, particularly at early time points of hormone zzso zzso complexity was detected in the analysis of zzso and in zzso zzso The zzso provides a diagnostic tool for evaluating the zzso state of being of the plant from the point of view of transcripts regulated by hormones and yields biological insight into the multiple response components that enable plant adaptation to the zzso A Web-based interface has been developed to facilitate external zzso with this zzso
