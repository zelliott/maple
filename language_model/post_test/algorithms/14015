zzso the most efficient use of diagnostic tests is one of the complex issues facing medical zzso With the soaring cost of zzso particularly in the zzso there is a critical need for cutting costs of diagnostic tests, while achieving a higher level of diagnostic zzso This paper develops a learning based methodology that, based on patient information, recommends zzso that zzso a suitable measure of diagnostic zzso A comprehensive performance measure is developed that accounts for the costs of testing, zzso and mortality associated with the tests, and time taken to reach zzso The performance measure also accounts for the diagnostic ability of the zzso The methodology combines tools from the fields of data mining zzso set theory, in zzso utility theory, zzso decision processes zzso and reinforcement learning zzso The rough set theory is used in zzso diagnostic information in the form of rules from the medical zzso zzso theory is used in bringing various zzso performance measures into one cost based zzso An zzso model together with an zzso zzso zzso obtaining efficient testing zzso The methodology is implemented on a sample problem of diagnosing solitary pulmonary zzso zzso The results obtained are compared with those from four alternative testing zzso Our methodology holds significant promise to improve the process of medical zzso
