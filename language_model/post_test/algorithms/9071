Previous research has shown that inadequate zzso zzso levels zzso occur in burn patients and may increase the risk of zzso zzso events zzso The objective of this retrospective review was to investigate the usefulness of an zzso dosing zzso using a previously published zzso With institutional review board approval, all acute burn patients at an American zzso zzso regional burn center who were treated with zzso for zzso prophylaxis and had at least one zzso from May 1, 2011 to December 15, 2012 were zzso Patients with zzso zzso received increased zzso dose per unit protocol with the goal of obtaining a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients were included in our zzso The zzso equation was used in 33 patients for initial zzso dosing zzso whereas 31 patients received traditionally recommended prophylaxis dosing zzso Groups were comparable in sex, age, weight, inhalation injury, and burn zzso zzso zzso dosing in zzso was significantly more likely to reach target than in zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso No episodes of zzso zzso or zzso sensitivity were documented in either zzso Median final zzso dose required to reach zzso level was 40 zzso every 12 hours zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients ultimately reached target, and 11 of these final doses were equivalent to or greater than the predicted zzso Ten patients never reached zzso zzso before zzso was discontinued zzso from zzso Two patients, one from each group, developed zzso complications despite appropriate zzso for zzso A strong correlation was shown between weight, burn size, and zzso dose zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Use of the zzso dosing zzso significantly increased the frequency of obtaining a target initial zzso There were no bleeding zzso zzso dosing zzso to burn size and weight, making a standard dose inappropriate because patient zzso and extent of burn injury are highly zzso This simple equation improves zzso dosing for acute adult burn zzso
