zzso direct method is a zzso simulation zzso that may be used to calculate the steady state solution of a chemically reacting zzso Recently the all possible states method was introduced as a way of accelerating the convergence of the zzso We demonstrate that while the all possible states zzso method does reduce the number of required zzso it is actually much slower than the original zzso for most zzso We introduce the elapsed time method, which zzso the process of recording the species zzso The resulting zzso yields the same results as the original method, but is more efficient, particularly for large zzso In implementing the elapsed time method, we present robust methods for recording statistics and empirical probability zzso We demonstrate how to use the zzso distance to estimate the error in steady state zzso
