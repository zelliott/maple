Original zzso for simultaneous alignment of protein sequences are zzso including sequence zzso and zzso or zzso multiple zzso The way of matching similar regions is fundamentally zzso Complete matches are formed by segments more similar than expected by random, according to a given probability zzso Any classic or zzso score zzso can be used to express the similarity between the zzso The zzso seeks for complete matches common to all the sequences without performing zzso alignment and regardless of gap zzso An automatic screening zzso all the similar regions zzso that may be defined for a given zzso shift between the zzso The shift can be large enough to allow the matching of any region of a sequence with any region of another zzso It can also be short and used to refine the alignment around anchor zzso The zzso provides the most likely optimal alignment and a comprehensive list of the alignment zzso zzso between zzso and zzso is zzso Depending on the problem complexity, a final alignment is obtained fully automatically or requires some interactive handling to discriminate alternative zzso
