Research in recent years has provided some evidence of zzso zzso of functional connectivity in resting state zzso In this paper, we present a novel methodology that can decode connectivity dynamics into a zzso sequence of hidden network zzso for each subject, using a Hidden zzso Modeling zzso zzso Each state is characterized by a unique zzso zzso or zzso zzso Our model generates these zzso zzso from a common but unknown set of sparse basis networks, which capture the range of functional activity zzso of regions of interest zzso zzso hidden states arise due to a variation in the strengths of these basis zzso Thus, our zzso model combines a zzso framework with sparse basis learning of positive zzso zzso zzso on simulated zzso data show that our method can effectively recover underlying basis networks as well as hidden zzso We apply this method on a zzso zzso of resting state zzso zzso zzso indicate that the functional activity of a subject at any point during the scan is composed of combinations of overlapping zzso pairs of networks as revealed by our zzso zzso hidden zzso states are produced due to a different set of basis networks dominating the zzso pattern in each zzso
