Previous research showed that zzso the surface zzso zzso can improve zzso zzso zzso (where zzso zzso is defined as the zzso standard zzso of the zzso However, conventional zzso via a linear filter seems to fail at low zzso zzso levels, perhaps due to additive background noise in the measured zzso This paper describes an zzso zzso technique that overcomes this problem by zzso a zzso zzso zzso an zzso Wiener zzso and an zzso gain zzso These stages can be zzso from two, five second zzso zzso zzso zzso one at a reference level zzso 50% maximum voluntary contraction zzso and one at zzso zzso In experimental studies, subjects used real-time zzso zzso estimates to track a zzso zzso random zzso With a zzso bandwidth target, either zzso zzso or zzso processing reduced the tracking error roughly zzso to the error achieved using the zzso signal as the zzso At the zzso zzso all of the zzso processors had errors equivalent to that of the zzso zzso reflecting that errors in this task were dominated by subjects' inability to track targets at this zzso zzso in the additive noise level, smoothing window zzso and tracking bandwidth diminish the advantages of zzso
