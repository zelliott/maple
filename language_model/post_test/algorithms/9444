It is known that people zzso scenes they see during rapid eye movements called zzso It has been suggested that some of these zzso could be an artifact of zzso processes related to the internal zzso of spatial coordinates during zzso zzso we have recently suggested, based on a zzso model, that zzso zzso result from optimal zzso As one of the properties of the model, sudden object zzso that occur in sync with a zzso should be perceived as contracted in a zzso zzso To explore this model property, here we use computer simulations and zzso methods first to test how robust the model is to zzso approximations and second to test two model zzso zzso contracted zzso perception should be zzso with more contraction for jumps parallel to the zzso than zzso to it, and zzso contraction should rise as a function of zzso zzso Our results are consistent with these zzso They support the idea that human zzso integration is governed by zzso zzso
