A method for image reconstruction of the effective size and number density of scattering particles is discussed within the context of interpreting zzso zzso zzso images of breast zzso An approach to use zzso theory to estimate the effective scattering parameters is examined and applied, given some assumptions about the index of refraction change expected in zzso zzso zzso When using a limited number of zzso zzso in the reduced scattering zzso the zzso extraction technique is limited to representing a continuous distribution of zzso sizes, which is modeled as a simple zzso decreasing distribution zzso In this paper, image formation of effective zzso size and number density is presented based on the zzso zzso The method was evaluated with zzso phantom studies to demonstrate particle size zzso to within zzso of the expected zzso Then the method was used in zzso patient images, and it indicates that for a cancer zzso the effective zzso size is smaller than the background breast values and the effective number density is zzso In contrast, for benign tumor patients, there is not a significant difference in effective zzso size or number density between tumor and normal zzso The method was used to interpret magnetic resonance zzso zzso images of zzso and zzso zzso and it indicated that the zzso tissue has smaller effective zzso size and larger effective number density than the zzso tissue zzso
