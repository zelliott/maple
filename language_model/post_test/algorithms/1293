zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso are troublesome to the patient and sometimes a difficult task for the physician trying to identify and treat the zzso 

For the first time, we report a mechanism of inappropriate zzso zzso during episodes of zzso flutter with a slow zzso response and intermittent zzso zzso The episodes occurred in two patients and were triggered by the unique sensing zzso of the zzso Cadence zzso in combination with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lead, which provides integrated bipolar zzso 

Besides treatment of the underlying zzso zzso of the device, an zzso position far away from the zzso and true bipolar sensing will enhance the performance of zzso systems with respect to the episodes described zzso In addition, more flexible sensing zzso may, in the future, prevent this overall rare zzso
