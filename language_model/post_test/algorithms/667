We interpret the nucleus properties and jet activity from the zzso spacecraft imaging and the onboard dust monitoring system zzso zzso of 20 jets shows that 2 zzso from the nucleus dark side and 16 zzso from sources that are on slopes where the Sun's zzso is greater than predicted from the fitted zzso zzso Seven sources, including five in the Mayo depression, coincide with relatively bright surface zzso Fitting the zzso jets, the zzso zzso distribution of dust impacts indicates that the spacecraft crossed thin, densely populated sheets of particulate zzso extending from small sources on the rotating nucleus, consistent with an zzso cone zzso
