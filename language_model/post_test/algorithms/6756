Several zzso processes that regulate the removal of nutrients in wetlands are affected by temperature, thus influencing the overall treatment zzso In this paper, the effects of temperature on zzso zzso and zzso cycling processes in treatment wetlands and their implications to water quality are zzso Many environmental factors display annual cycles that mediate whole system zzso Water temperature is one of the important zzso zzso but inlet flow rates and zzso and several features of the annual zzso cycle, also can contribute to the observed patterns of zzso and zzso zzso Atmospheric zzso including rain, zzso and water zzso also follow seasonal zzso zzso regulating zzso in wetlands are active throughout the year and can act as seasonal reservoirs of zzso zzso and zzso Many individual zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso are affected by zzso Response was much greater to changes at the lower end of the temperature scale zzso 15 degrees zzso than at the optimal range (20 to 35 degrees zzso zzso regulating organic matter decomposition are affected by zzso Similarly, all nitrogen cycling reactions zzso zzso and zzso are affected by zzso The temperature zzso zzso varied from zzso to zzso for carbon and nitrogen cycling processes during isolated zzso zzso zzso reactions are least affected by temperature, with zzso values of zzso to zzso Physical processes involved in the removal of particulate zzso zzso and zzso are not affected much by zzso In contrast, observed zzso zzso may have different temperature zzso Design models are zzso because of limitations of data for zzso The result of complex system behavior and the simple model is the need to interpret whole zzso data to determine temperature zzso zzso seems to have minimal effect on zzso oxygen demand zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and more significant effect on nitrogen removal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In colder climates, there may be seasonal slowdown of treatment, which can decrease the overall treatment efficiency of constructed zzso
