We introduce a framework for mining event related dynamics based on conditional zzso zzso For a given set of responses, the variation in the data is summarized by means of a small set of meaningful prototypes accompanied with a zzso graph capturing their relative zzso zzso enables zzso in a zzso zzso zzso constraints, which are imposed by the nature of experimental data and/or dictated by the zzso zzso direct the process of knowledge extraction and can zzso zzso zzso The method is introduced using simulated data and demonstrated using actual zzso zzso
