Mean zzso pressure zzso is determined in most automated zzso blood pressure devices, but its derivation has been little zzso In this research, different techniques were studied and compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso blood pressure zzso and zzso were obtained in 55 healthy subjects by two trained observers, and zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso was determined by six techniques from zzso cuff pressures recorded digitally and simultaneously during manual zzso zzso were derived from the peak and foot of the largest zzso pulse, and from time domain zzso fitted to the sequence of zzso pulse zzso (4th order and three versions of the 6th order zzso zzso The agreement between automated and zzso zzso was zzso Compared with the zzso zzso the automated zzso from the baseline cuff pressure at the peak of the 6th order zzso curve had the smallest mean paired difference zzso zzso and smallest standard zzso of paired differences zzso zzso These values from the peak of the largest zzso pulse were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from a model of the zzso pulse zzso had the smallest differences from the manual zzso zzso
