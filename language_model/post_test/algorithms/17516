zzso displacement axes zzso have been employed to describe joint zzso in zzso zzso Previous reports have investigated the accuracy of zzso combining various motion analysis techniques and smoothing zzso To our knowledge, no study has assessed SDA accuracy describing the relative movement between adjacent bodies with an electromagnetic tracking zzso This is important, since in relative motion, neither body is fixed and consequently sensitivity to potential measurement errors from both bodies may be zzso zzso this study assessed the accuracy of zzso for describing relative motion between two moving zzso We analyzed zzso simulated data, and physical experimental data recorded using a precision zzso and electromagnetic tracking zzso The zzso simulations demonstrated SDA position accuracy zzso was superior for single compared to relative body motion, whereas orientation accuracy zzso was zzso Experimental data showed zzso zzso zzso improved SDA position and orientation zzso for rotation zzso smaller or equal to zzso degrees, with no effect at larger rotation zzso zzso This suggests that in absence of a zzso zzso should only be calculated at zzso of greater than zzso zzso For rotation zzso of zzso degrees zzso degrees ) about the zzso SDA position and orientation error zzso determined from filtered experimental data were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso degrees zzso degrees ), zzso Experimental accuracy values describing the translation along and rotation about the zzso were zzso zzso and zzso degrees, zzso These small errors establish the capability of zzso to detect small zzso and zzso In conclusion, application of zzso should be a useful tool for describing relative motion in joint zzso zzso
