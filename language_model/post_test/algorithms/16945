The zzso zzso zzso zzso Problem zzso involves a subset of instances of the distance geometry problem for which some assumptions allowing for zzso are zzso The search domain for the zzso is a zzso tree that can be efficiently explored by employing a Branch & zzso zzso zzso We showed in recent works that this zzso tree may contain several zzso which are directly related to the total number of solutions of zzso zzso In this paper, we study the possibility of exploiting these zzso for speeding up the solution of zzso and propose an extension of the zzso zzso that we named zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments on artificial and protein instances are zzso
