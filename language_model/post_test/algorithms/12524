zzso symmetry zzso averaging is a well known method for improving the quality of an zzso map and thus aiding structure zzso Prior methods of zzso determination based on estimated zzso positions are prone to errors arising from zzso in these coordinates or differences in the relative zzso of zzso between zzso In this paper, two zzso methods to determine zzso relationships from initial zzso maps are zzso A zzso method identifies matching regions in a map by local density zzso A zzso zzso uses zzso features to reduce the zzso time taken by the zzso zzso by filtering out regions that are likely to have dissimilar density zzso This makes the zzso zzso faster and as accurate as the zzso zzso Neither method requires the positions of heavy atoms or any information regarding the protein zzso Both methods have been tested on a diverse range of zzso phased maps and the correct zzso relationships were accurately identified for almost all of the test zzso The zzso operators obtained by the zzso zzso were used to perform zzso averaging and an improvement in map correlation was observed for some zzso
