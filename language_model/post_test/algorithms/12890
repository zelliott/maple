We present a novel image zzso method based on the polarization features of the zzso zzso displays zzso zzso are manufactured to work between a crossed zzso zzso When the zzso is at 45 zzso (instead of 90 zzso with respect to the zzso one zzso an zzso processed image with pronounced outlines zzso zzso at middle intensity, zzso the borders between illuminated and dark areas are zzso The proposed method is quite robust and does not require precise alignment or coherent zzso Since it does not involve zzso processing, it could be useful for zzso large images in zzso which presents potential applications in medical and biological zzso zzso experiments are zzso
