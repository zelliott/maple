We studied a 62-year-old female zzso patient during initiation and maintenance of zzso zzso zzso Three different methods were applied to estimate the zzso a scenario based on volume of distribution zzso a scenario based on zzso zzso rate zzso and a scenario in which we developed an zzso based on a zzso distribution without zzso The zzso estimate led to plasma zzso zzso times lower than those zzso In contrast, the estimates based on zzso and the zzso derived from zzso modeling led to comparable loading dose zzso Furthermore, the maintenance dose estimated from the central compartment zzso led to plasma zzso within the therapeutic zzso Thus, a regimen where zzso zzso zzso was given after each zzso session resulted in stable zzso plasma zzso zzso in this patient with no residual kidney zzso We did not observe adverse effects related to this regimen, which was monitored from 18 days to 8 months of therapy, and the patient experienced relief from her severe depressive zzso In conclusion, dialysis patients may be treated with zzso zzso immediately zzso Further observations are necessary to obtain robust long-term safety data and to zzso the monitoring zzso
