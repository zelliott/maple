We present a method for prediction of functional sites in a set of aligned protein zzso The method selects sites which are both well zzso and clustered together in space, as zzso from the zzso structures of proteins included in the zzso We tested the method using 86 alignments from the zzso zzso database, where the sites of zzso determined zzso and/or zzso interactions are zzso In agreement with earlier zzso we found that functional site predictions are most successful when overall background sequence conservation is low, such that sites under evolutionary constraint become zzso In addition, we found that averaging of conservation values across zzso clustered sites improves predictions under certain conditions: that is, when overall conservation is relatively high and when the site in question involves a large zzso binding zzso Under these conditions it is better to look for clusters of zzso sites than to look for particular zzso zzso
