A prior knowledge of protein structural class can provide useful information about its overall zzso So, it is vitally important to develop a zzso prediction method for fast and accurately determining the protein structural zzso In this paper, a zzso zzso support zzso machine zzso is presented via the general form of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso which is featured by introducing zzso as a kernel and making decisions by the fusion from three individual zzso As a demonstration, the rigorous zzso zzso tests were performed on two benchmark zzso including the more challenging zzso zzso Our success rates were reliable, and it has not escaped from our notice that the present method has specific ability to predict the most difficult case of zzso zzso The program developed can be acquired freely on request from the zzso
