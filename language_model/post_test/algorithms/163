Stereo correspondence methods rely on matching costs for computing the similarity of image zzso We evaluate the zzso of different costs for passive zzso stereo methods with respect to zzso variations of the input zzso We consider both zzso and zzso zzso like the absolute difference, the zzso absolute difference, and zzso cross zzso as well as their zzso zzso We also consider filters like zzso mean, and bilateral background zzso zzso and zzso measures like zzso zzso zzso and zzso Finally, zzso mutual information zzso is considered as zzso zzso Using stereo data sets with zzso disparities taken under controlled changes of exposure and lighting, we evaluate the costs with a local, a zzso and a global stereo zzso We measure the performance of all costs in the presence of simulated and real zzso differences, including exposure differences, zzso varying lighting, and zzso Overall, the ranking of methods across all data sets and experiments appears to be zzso Among the best costs are zzso which performs consistently very well for low zzso zzso zzso which is slightly better as zzso matching cost in some cases and for strong image zzso and zzso which showed the best and most robust overall zzso
