In biological studies, it is often required to track thousands of small particles in microscopic images to analyze underlying mechanisms of cellular and zzso processes which may lead to better understanding of some disease zzso In this paper, we present an automatic particle tracking method and apply it for analyzing an essential zzso process, namely zzso zzso zzso using total internal reflection zzso zzso are detected by using image filters and subsequently zzso mixture models are fitted to achieve zzso zzso A multiple hypothesis based framework is designed to solve data association problems and handle zzso zzso The tracking method is demonstrated on synthetic data under different scenarios and applied to real zzso We also show that, by zzso with a cell detection zzso the method can be extended zzso for zzso cell images taken by zzso zzso zzso
