Next Generation zzso techniques are producing enormous amounts of biological sequence data and analysis becomes a major zzso zzso Currently, most analysis, especially the identification of zzso regions, relies heavily on Multiple zzso zzso and its various zzso such as progressive zzso whose run time grows with the square of the number and the length of the aligned sequences and requires significant zzso zzso In this work, we present a method to efficiently discover regions of high similarity across multiple sequences without performing expensive sequence zzso The method is based on zzso edit distance between segments of sequences using zzso frequency zzso Then, efficient zzso data stream zzso is used to group highly similar segments into so called zzso zzso have numerous applications such as identifying species and their zzso class from zzso comparing sequences for similarities, and, as in this paper, discovering zzso regions across related zzso 

In this paper, we show that zzso can be used to discover highly similar segments across multiple sequences from related or different zzso efficiently and zzso zzso on a large number of zzso zzso zzso sequences obtained from the zzso database show that the method is able to identify zzso regions which agree with known zzso regions in zzso zzso Furthermore, the experiments show that the proposed method scales well for large data sets with a run time that grows only zzso with the number and length of zzso whereas for existing multiple sequence alignment zzso the run time grows zzso 

zzso zzso can detect highly similar regions and zzso areas across multiple zzso Since the run time is linear and the sequences are converted into a compact zzso model, we are able to identify zzso regions fast or even zzso using a standard zzso Our method has many potential applications such as finding characteristic signature sequences for families of organisms and studying zzso and variable regions in, for example, zzso zzso
