Bone contains a significant fraction of water that is not zzso with ordinary Cartesian imaging zzso The advent of zzso zzso zzso methods has allowed the recovery of this zzso zzso zzso In this work, we have developed a new three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging technique based on slab selection by means of zzso zzso zzso slice zzso and zzso for zzso The protocol consists of collecting two zzso differing in zzso from which zzso is zzso which is needed for zzso Unlike zzso which has been found to vary within a narrow range and does not require individual zzso zzso is critically subject dependent zzso zzso zzso No zzso suppression was used to preserve the zzso ratio of the zzso bone water zzso or to minimize the loss of relatively mobile water in large zzso Critical for zzso is correction for spatial variations in reception field and selection of the zzso boundary for inclusion of zzso in the bone water zzso because of the ruffled boundary stemming from zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso evaluated in 10 subjects covering the age range zzso years, yielded an average zzso of variation of zzso and an zzso correlation zzso of zzso suggesting that a treatment effect on the order of zzso could be detected in as few as 10 zzso Lastly, experiments in specimens by means of graded zzso exchange showed that approximately zzso of the detected signal arises from water zzso whose relaxation rates zzso and zzso scale zzso with the zzso volume fraction of light water after zzso exchange with heavy zzso The data thus show zzso that the method zzso water even though, in zzso no distinction can be made between various zzso such as zzso vs zzso zzso
