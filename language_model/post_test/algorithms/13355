Reliable zzso cardiac safety evaluations of drug candidates are essential for selecting the best therapeutic zzso Advanced automated patch clamp technologies now allow for characterizing drug effects on multiple cardiac zzso enabling subsequent simulations of integrated zzso responses on zzso tissue and organ zzso In this issue, zzso et zzso zzso the strengths and limitations of models and simulations predicting drug-induced zzso responses, emphasizing delayed zzso and zzso de zzso zzso The utility of zzso approaches is contingent upon realistic models of zzso zzso robust characterization of zzso interactions and an understanding of zzso interactions and zzso zzso zzso evaluating effects on zzso zzso zzso should aid in selecting safer drug candidates early in drug discovery, while simulations evaluating risk of zzso de zzso zzso known risk zzso should zzso zzso risk and reduce the need for costly clinical zzso studies later in zzso The wider adoption of realistic models and simulation studies will depend on simulation performance compared with zzso zzso clinical zzso
