zzso analysis, which separates upstream from downstream events and defines their interaction, has been used to study the effects of changes in left zzso zzso zzso zzso and left zzso coronary artery resistance zzso on the coronary zzso flow impediment zzso In 10 zzso zzso dogs, we measured zzso zzso and zzso pressures, coronary zzso zzso and zzso zzso was increased by paired pacing and zzso was modulated by zzso infusions of zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso zzso When both zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and the energy of the zzso zzso wave zzso were greatest at the highest levels of zzso and the lowest levels of zzso zzso was zzso to the zzso We conclude that zzso and coronary resistance change zzso by modulating the zzso zzso zzso
