In a usual zzso process, the researchers evaluate the protein zzso growth states based on visual impressions and repeatedly assign scores throughout the growth zzso Although the development of zzso robotic systems has generally zzso the automation of the setup and storage of zzso samples, evaluation of zzso states has not yet been completely zzso The method presented here attempts to categorize individual zzso zzso images into five classes using multiple zzso In particular, linear and zzso zzso are zzso The zzso is comprised of zzso feature extraction from images using texture analysis and a categorization process using linear zzso analysis zzso and support zzso machine zzso The performance of this method has been evaluated by comparing the results obtained using the method with the results obtained by a human expert and the zzso rate was zzso
