The zzso domain of human zzso zzso zzso binds zzso rather than zzso with high binding zzso zzso binds to the zzso of both zzso DNA duplexes and a zzso duplex zzso We performed zzso experiments on complexes between the zzso and zzso DNA duplexes, zzso or zzso with a variety of zzso zzso zzso zzso of these results with those from the analysis of zzso in the previous study suggests that zzso exhibits the sequence preference of zzso through multiple sequence discrimination steps during the zzso zzso
