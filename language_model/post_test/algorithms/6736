zzso cells generating zzso transient zzso responses were stained by zzso injection of zzso zzso after determining their zzso zzso response zzso light zzso zzso Ten cells specifically having zzso zzso trees were zzso The zzso area of the zzso in each zzso (a and b) of the inner zzso layer was initially zzso Although some zzso was observed, there was no statistically significant overall difference in the zzso areas of the zzso trees in zzso a and zzso Also, the zzso of the ON and OFF responses, generated by a zzso criterion zzso could not be correlated with the zzso areas or the number of branches of the zzso in zzso b and zzso zzso On the other hand, determination of the generalized zzso zzso revealed that the negative (up to zzso and zzso zzso dimensions of the zzso trees in zzso a were consistently higher than those for zzso zzso Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between response zzso and some part of the generalized zzso dimension in the respective parts of the zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso tree characteristics differ in the two halves of the inner zzso layer and that these can be related to the zzso zzso response zzso Furthermore, generalized zzso analysis appears to be a useful method for zzso structure and function in retinal zzso cells with complex zzso zzso
