This study compared coronary flow reserve zzso estimated by zzso zzso zzso imaging with the results obtained with zzso zzso in patients with coronary artery zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was also zzso 

Fourteen consecutive patients zzso age, 54 zzso 7 zzso with documented coronary artery disease in whom zzso coronary intervention was planned underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging and zzso zzso within 5 zzso zzso blood flow zzso was estimated by measurement of first transit counts in the pulmonary artery and zzso counts from single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed as the ratio of stress zzso to rest zzso In the study vessels, zzso was zzso zzso zzso as estimated by zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso ( P zzso zzso A significant relationship between zzso estimated by zzso and zzso obtained by zzso zzso was observed ( r zzso zzso P zzso zzso On zzso analysis, the mean difference between zzso by zzso and by zzso was zzso and the zzso correlation zzso for zzso and zzso zzso were high (all P zzso zzso for both global and regional zzso 

This study demonstrates a good agreement between zzso estimated by zzso imaging and by zzso zzso results and a lack of zzso and zzso zzso of this zzso zzso
