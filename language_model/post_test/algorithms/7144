The zzso of zzso tasks has drawn much attention in recent zzso In this paper, a novel zzso model based on independent component analysis zzso and zzso learning machine zzso is proposed to detect zzso zzso zzso and its topography information were used to automatically identify the zzso zzso Then, time and zzso features were extracted from the reconstructed zzso zzso Finally, two classes of feature samples were used to train zzso zzso network zzso and support zzso machine zzso zzso for zzso The optimal number of zzso zzso and the values of zzso zzso were zzso by the zzso zzso Experimental results show that the presented method zzso achieves the highest training accuracy of zzso with extremely less training and testing time on detecting zzso components for the guilty and the innocent zzso The results indicate that the proposed method can be applied in lie zzso
