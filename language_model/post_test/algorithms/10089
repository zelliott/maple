The differential diagnosis of clear cell, zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso is clinically important, because these tumor zzso are associated with different zzso and clinical zzso For cases in which zzso is zzso zzso and quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction can assist in the differential diagnosis by measuring expression of zzso zzso Several zzso tumor zzso have been discovered in expression zzso zzso However, due to zzso of gene and protein zzso additional zzso are needed for reliable diagnostic zzso We developed novel zzso systems to identify candidate zzso tumor zzso from the zzso profiles of 45 clear cell, 16 zzso and 10 zzso zzso cell zzso the zzso data was derived from 2 independent published zzso The zzso zzso system merged the zzso data sets into a single file, so gene expression could be analyzed from a larger number of zzso The zzso system removed zzso sources of error from the zzso data, and the zzso system analyzed data with several zzso zzso to identify zzso effective at recognizing previously described zzso tumor zzso We predicted these zzso would also be effective at identifying unknown zzso that could be verified by independent zzso We selected 6 novel candidate zzso from the zzso analysis and verified their differential expression in zzso zzso zzso by quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction and zzso The candidate zzso were zzso zzso IX, zzso zzso protein 1, zzso factor 3, zzso c zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso chain reaction was performed on 17 clear cell, 13 zzso and 7 zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso IX and zzso were zzso in clear cell zzso cell zzso zzso protein 1 and zzso factor 3 were zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso c zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1 were zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso was performed on tissue zzso containing 66 clear cell, 16 zzso and 12 zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso IX zzso was significantly associated with clear cell zzso cell zzso Strong zzso zzso protein 1 and zzso c zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly more frequent in zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso zzso In zzso we developed a novel process for identifying candidate zzso tumor zzso from zzso data, and zzso differential expression in independent zzso The tumor zzso have potential utility as a multiplex expression panel for zzso zzso cell zzso with zzso zzso zzso expression zzso are increasingly important for zzso cell zzso diagnosis, as needle core zzso become more common and different therapies for tumor zzso continue to be zzso
