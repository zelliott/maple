Prospective testing of zzso protocols to reduce the risk of zzso sickness zzso in astronauts requires zzso accept and reject zzso We assume that the zzso of a test, the presence or absence of signs and symptoms attributable to zzso is zzso However, diagnosis of zzso is not perfect, nor is there is a gold standard to assess diagnosis error zzso These error rates could cause consistent bias in the decision to accept or reject proposed zzso We used a zzso Class Model zzso incorporating zzso agreement to estimate zzso and negative rates of zzso diagnosis for each of six symptomatic zzso zzso 

Case descriptions from 135 reports collected since 1982 were available with 103 diagnosed as zzso zzso There were 3 zzso of 45 descriptions that were randomly selected, information about the original diagnosis zzso and were sent to 15 physicians zzso all experts in altitude zzso zzso were diagnosed for zzso by either four, five, or six zzso We then used a zzso to estimate zzso and zzso error rates for the original NASA test diagnosis, even though a gold standard was not zzso 

Estimates of zzso rates in the NASA diagnoses ranged from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso for zzso rates over the six strata of symptomatic response zzso 

Our findings suggest that use of current zzso diagnostic outcomes as if they were error free would likely produce an inflated rejection rate of acceptable protocols in future testing if adjustments are not zzso
