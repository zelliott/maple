As a simple model of cortical zzso we study a locally connected network of zzso zzso in the zzso limit of space and zzso This is to be contrasted with the usual zzso simulations that zzso both of zzso zzso noise, zzso delays, and the time course of zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been taken into account zzso We pose, and answer, the question of whether the zzso limit presents a full description of scenarios found zzso (the answer is no, not zzso In other words, can the zzso be reduced to a zzso description of a well-known zzso As a zzso we derive some classical results such as those of Wilson and zzso zzso thus indicating under what conditions they are zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso discrete objects may be fragile due to noise arising from the zzso of the individual zzso whereas they are not once the zzso limit has been zzso This, then, resolves the above zzso Finally, we indicate how one can directly incorporate orientation preference of the zzso
