Principal component analysis zzso has been proven to be an efficient method in pattern recognition and image zzso Recently, zzso has been extensively employed for zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso The encouraging results have been reported and discussed in the zzso Many zzso zzso systems have also been developed in the last zzso However, existing zzso zzso systems are hard to scale up because of the zzso cost and zzso zzso To overcome this zzso an incremental approach is usually zzso zzso zzso zzso methods have been studied for many years in the zzso zzso The major limitation of existing zzso methods is that there is no guarantee on the approximation zzso In view of this zzso this paper proposes a new zzso method based on the idea of a singular value decomposition zzso updating algorithm, namely an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the proposed zzso algorithm, we have zzso proved that the approximation error is zzso A complexity analysis on the proposed method is also zzso Another characteristic of the proposed zzso zzso is that it can be easily extended to a kernel zzso The proposed method has been evaluated using available public databases, namely zzso zzso and Yale B, and applied to existing zzso zzso Experimental results show that the difference of the average recognition accuracy between the proposed incremental method and the zzso method is less than zzso This implies that the proposed zzso method gives a close approximation to the zzso zzso zzso
