Performing experiments with simulated data is an inexpensive approach to evaluating competing experimental designs and analysis methods in zzso association zzso zzso based on zzso known zzso is fast and efficient and can produce samples with patterns of linkage zzso zzso which mimic those in real zzso However, the inability of current methods to simulate multiple nearby disease zzso on the same zzso can limit their zzso 

We introduce a new simulation zzso based on a successful zzso method, zzso that can simulate multiple nearby disease zzso on the same zzso The new method, zzso retains many advantages of zzso methods and expands the range of disease models that current zzso zzso
