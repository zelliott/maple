Estimates for delays in the zzso fluid zzso zzso response to changes in blood zzso zzso differ substantially among research zzso We review these findings along with arguments that continuous zzso monitoring zzso devices used to measure zzso delay contribute to the zzso We consider the impact of the zzso delay and review approaches to correct for it, including strategies pursued by the manufacturers of these zzso The focus on how the manufacturers have approached the problem is motivated by the observation that clinicians and researchers are often unaware of how the existing zzso devices process the zzso zzso zzso 

Numerous models and simulations were used to illustrate problems related to measurement and correction of zzso zzso zzso 

We find that zzso there is no evidence that the true zzso zzso zzso delay is longer than zzso zzso and that the values longer than this can be explained by delays in zzso filtering zzso zzso the primary impact of the true zzso delay is on sensor zzso zzso making it difficult to estimate zzso factors and offset zzso zzso zzso inaccurate estimates of the sensor zzso current result in zzso of sensor zzso at low values, making it difficult to detect zzso zzso many device companies introduce zzso components into their zzso which can be expected to confound attempts by investigators to reconstruct zzso using linear zzso and zzso zzso advocated by academic groups are seldom compared to zzso pursued by industry, making it difficult to ascertain their zzso 

The absence of any direct comparisons between existing and new zzso for correcting zzso delay and sensor zzso current is, in part, due to the difficulty in zzso relevant details from industry patents and/or zzso unfiltered sensor signals from industry zzso The model simulation environment, where all aspects of the signal can be zzso may be more appropriate for developing new filtering and zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso academic researchers, and the industry would benefit from collaborating when evaluating those zzso
