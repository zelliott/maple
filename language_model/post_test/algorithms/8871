To validate an established breast cancer zzso model in an independent prospective data zzso After aligning time periods for zzso we restricted populations to comparable age ranges zzso zzso and followed them for incident invasive breast cancer zzso zzso zzso Health Study zzso and zzso California Teachers Study zzso We identified zzso cases during zzso person years of follow-up in zzso and 1,400 cases during zzso person years in zzso We fit the zzso zzso model and the Gail model using baseline zzso We zzso future use of hormones based on type and prior duration of use and other zzso We assessed performance using area under the curve zzso and zzso zzso Participants in the zzso had fewer children, were leaner, consumed more alcohol, and were more frequent users of zzso zzso zzso rate ratios for breast cancer showed significantly higher breast cancer in the zzso zzso zzso zzso 95 % zzso zzso zzso for the zzso model were comparable across the two zzso Overall, the zzso model performed equally well when applied in the zzso In the zzso the zzso was zzso zzso zzso and applying the zzso zzso to the zzso the performance in the independent data set zzso was zzso zzso zzso The Gail model gave values of zzso zzso zzso a significant 4 % lower, p zzso zzso For women zzso the zzso values for the zzso model are zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso and for Gail are zzso and zzso In both zzso performance of both models dropped off in older women zzso and later in follow-up zzso zzso zzso showed good zzso against zzso with a zzso 4 % underestimate of overall breast cancer zzso when applying the model in the zzso population zzso zzso zzso The zzso model performs consistently well when applied in an independent data zzso Performance is stronger predicting zzso among women zzso and over a zzso time zzso zzso values exceed those for Gail by 3-5 % based on zzso when both are applied to the independent validation data zzso Models may be further improved with addition of breast density or other markers of risk beyond the current zzso
