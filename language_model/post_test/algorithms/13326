Small angle X-ray scattering zzso experiments are widely applied in structural zzso The zzso experiments yield one-dimensional profile that needs further analysis to reveal structural zzso The pair distance distribution function zzso zzso can provide molecular structures more zzso and it can be used to guide zzso zzso model zzso making it a critical step to derive zzso from experimental zzso zzso To calculate the zzso curves, a new method based on a specially designed zzso functional form is developed, and implemented in zzso This method is tested against both synthetic and experimental data, the estimated zzso functions are in good agreement with correct or known zzso The method can also predict the molecular zzso In zzso the zzso method is robust and accurate in zzso determination from zzso zzso The zzso source code and an online server are available at zzso
