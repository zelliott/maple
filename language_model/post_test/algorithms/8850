zzso partial wave zzso zzso is introduced as a high-speed spectral zzso technique that zzso the field effect of zzso to perform minimally invasive cancer screening on zzso zzso zzso uses fully automated hardware and an zzso zzso filter to scan slides at low zzso to select cells, and to rapidly acquire zzso at each spatial zzso in a cell between 450 and 700 zzso completing zzso of 30 cells in 40 zzso zzso quantitative analysis on the size and density of zzso zzso extracted from the zzso at each zzso in a cell yields the diagnostic zzso disorder strength zzso Linear correlation between zzso and the length scale of zzso was measured in zzso with zzso zzso sensitivity was demonstrated by measuring significantly higher zzso from a human colon cancer cell line zzso control zzso than a less aggressive zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso Clinical diagnostic performance for lung cancer screening was tested on 23 patients, yielding a significant difference in zzso between smokers and cancer patients, zzso and effect zzso The zzso performance, zzso sensitivity, and diagnostic sensitivity make zzso a potentially clinically relevant zzso for risk zzso of the large populations at risk of developing zzso
