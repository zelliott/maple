The development of automatic approaches for the comparison of protein sequences has become increasingly zzso zzso that compare profiles allow for the use of information about whole protein families, resulting in more sensitive and accurate detection of zzso related zzso In this contribution, we describe a thorough zzso and tests of a zzso alignment zzso A number of different scoring schemes has been implemented and compared on the basis of their ability to identify a template protein from the same zzso family as a zzso In addition to sequence profiles, secondary structure profiles were used to increase the rate of successful zzso Our results show that a properly tuned one-dimensional zzso method can recognize a correct template from the same zzso family nearly as well as structural zzso Our benchmark set, which might be useful in other similar studies, as well as the zzso software we developed may be downloaded zzso
