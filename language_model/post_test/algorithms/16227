The zzso between a gene tree and a corresponding species tree can be attributed to evolutionary events such as gene zzso and gene zzso This paper describes a zzso model where so-called zzso are used to explain the differences between a gene tree and a corresponding species tree taking into account gene zzso gene losses, and lateral gene transfers (also known as horizontal gene zzso The reasonable biological constraint that a lateral gene transfer may only occur between contemporary species leads to the notion of zzso zzso zzso methods are introduced by defining appropriate zzso zzso We show that finding most zzso zzso zzso is zzso However, by dropping the condition of zzso the problem becomes zzso and we provide a dynamic programming zzso as well as a zzso zzso zzso for finding most zzso zzso
