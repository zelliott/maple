In this Letter we show how zzso forms of zzso localized zzso or zzso can occur in two-dimensional excitable neural media with short-range zzso and long-range zzso The basic zzso mechanism involves a zzso zzso of a stationary pulse solution in the presence of a zzso localized zzso Such an input could arise from external stimuli or reflect changes in the zzso of local populations of zzso as a precursor for zzso zzso The resulting zzso instability breaks the underlying zzso symmetry of the stationary pulse, leading to the formation of a zzso zzso zzso The number of breathing zzso is consistent with the order of the dominant unstable zzso mode associated with zzso of the stationary pulse zzso
