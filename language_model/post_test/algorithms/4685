Given the thousands of genes and the small number of samples, gene selection has emerged as an important research problem in zzso data zzso Support zzso zzso Feature zzso zzso is one of a group of recently described zzso which represent the zzso for gene zzso Just like zzso itself, zzso was originally designed to solve zzso gene selection zzso Several groups have extended zzso to solve zzso problems using zzso zzso However, the genes selected from one zzso gene selection problem may reduce the zzso performance in other zzso zzso 

In the present study, we propose a family of four extensions to zzso (called zzso to solve the zzso gene selection problem, based on different zzso of zzso zzso By simultaneously considering all classes during the gene selection zzso our proposed extensions identify genes leading to more accurate zzso
