We investigate the potential of zzso zzso zzso for automated evaluation of excised skin tissue during zzso zzso surgery zzso The main aim is to develop an automated method for imaging and diagnosis of zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bands responsible for the largest spectral differences between zzso and normal skin regions and linear zzso analysis zzso are used to build a zzso supervised zzso zzso The model is based on zzso zzso zzso measured on skin tissue obtained from 20 zzso zzso is zzso from healthy tissue with zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity in a zzso to zzso split zzso zzso This zzso model is then applied on tissue sections from new patients to image tumor zzso The zzso images show excellent correlation with the gold standard of zzso zzso zzso being detected in all positive zzso We demonstrate the potential of zzso as an automated objective method for tumor evaluation during zzso The replacement of current zzso during zzso by a zzso of the proposed technique may improve the feasibility and efficacy of zzso leading to a wider use according to clinical zzso
