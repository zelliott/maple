A zzso automatic volume registration zzso based on intensity zzso is zzso This zzso can successfully perform registrations under conditions of unrelated zzso zzso zzso significant object zzso and/or significant amounts of missing zzso It also allows the user to zzso the registration zzso clearly illustrating any source of registration zzso This zzso consists of a matching zzso based on zzso finding the correspondence of the closest zzso containing a high three-dimensional intensity zzso zzso This zzso was tested by registering zzso MR volumes that had undergone varying displacement transformations to simultaneously acquired zzso zzso These transformations involved zzso of up to 25 degrees followed by translations of up to 25 zzso along the axis of zzso For all registrations, the mean registration error was less than one-fifth of a zzso and the mean registration time was less than 30 zzso In conclusion, this zzso is shown to be a powerful method of zzso MR volume registration that is simple to both use and zzso
