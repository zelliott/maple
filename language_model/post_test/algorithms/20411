The present study investigated the control of manual zzso movements in zzso zzso zzso luminous virtual discs with the thumb and index finger, and we recorded the instantaneous grip zzso defined as the 3-D distance between the thumb and index zzso Target size could remain constant zzso zzso or unexpectedly change shortly after target appearance zzso zzso In zzso responses, grip zzso varied throughout the movement in a consistent zzso zzso responses exhibited distinct corrective zzso which followed the target change with a zzso similar to the normal reaction zzso This suggests that visual size information has a fast and continuous access to the processes involved in grip zzso The zzso profiles of zzso responses had a different shape when the target called for an increase than when it called for a decrease in the initial finger zzso The same asymmetry was observed for zzso corrections in zzso zzso These findings indicate that increases and decreases of grip zzso are controlled through separate zzso engaged equally by the appearance and by the size change of a zzso Corrections of grip zzso in zzso trials had a higher peak zzso and reached their maximum as well as their final value earlier than the zzso profiles of zzso zzso Nevertheless, the total duration of zzso trials was zzso These response characteristics did not fit with either of the three corrective strategies previously proposed for zzso pointing movements, which could indicate that grasping and pointing movements are controlled by different zzso However, more data are needed to substantiate this zzso
