zzso bone modeling from medical images is essential in the diagnosis and treatment of patients because it supports the detection of abnormal bone zzso which is often responsible for many musculoskeletal diseases zzso of human zzso In a clinical setting, images of the suspected zzso are acquired in a high resolution but with a small field of view zzso in order to maximize the image quality while reducing acquisition zzso However bones are only partially visible in such small zzso This presents difficult challenges in automated bone zzso and thus limits the application of sophisticated zzso such as statistical shape models zzso which have been generally proven to be an efficient technique for bone zzso Indeed, the reduced image information affects the zzso and evolution of these zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we present a robust zzso zzso zzso with an adapted zzso to address the zzso of zzso bone images acquired in small zzso for modeling and zzso zzso Our innovation stems from the derivation of a robust zzso based on complete and corrupted shapes, as well as from a simultaneous zzso of transformation and shape parameters to yield an efficient zzso zzso We demonstrate our zzso zzso using 86 clinical zzso images of the zzso and hip zzso These images have a varied resolution and limited zzso The results of our zzso zzso average distance error of zzso zzso zzso zzso are within the needs of zzso clinical zzso
