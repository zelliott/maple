zzso imaging in insects reveals the neural response to zzso both at the zzso level on the antenna and in the zzso zzso the first stage of zzso information processing in the zzso Changes of zzso calcium concentration in response to zzso presentations can be observed by employing zzso fluorescent zzso The response pattern across all recorded units is characteristic for the zzso 

Previously, extraction of zzso response patterns from calcium imaging movies was performed offline, after the zzso We developed software to extract and to zzso zzso response patterns in real zzso An zzso zzso in combination with an zzso for the graphics processing unit enables fast processing of movie zzso Relying on correlations between zzso in the zzso domain, the calcium imaging movie can be segmented into regions that zzso to the neural zzso 

We applied our software to calcium imaging data recorded from the zzso lobe of the zzso zzso zzso and from the antenna of the fruit fly zzso zzso zzso on reference data showed results comparable to those obtained by previous zzso methods while zzso time was significantly zzso Demonstrating practical zzso we employed the software in a real-time experiment, performing zzso of zzso functional units of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso response patterns expands the experimental repertoire targeted at understanding information processing in the zzso zzso zzso In interactive experiments, zzso can be selected for manipulation based on their present or past activity, or based on their anatomical zzso Apart from supporting zzso the software allows for zzso the insect antenna as a zzso zzso to detect or to zzso zzso
