The objective of this work is to evaluate biological models and dose zzso in a new partial breast zzso method, the zzso zzso The study is based on 11 patients who received the zzso For each patient, we determined the dose volume distribution delivered to the zzso Based on these data, we estimate some important biological zzso Eleven patients with zzso zzso zzso breast cancer were treated using zzso zzso zzso which delivers radiation through a balloon placed in the zzso zzso The radiation was provided by an zzso source, and 340 zzso were delivered per fraction twice zzso We calculated some commonly used zzso zzso and evaluated the biological parameters tumor control probability zzso and normal tissue complication probability zzso We also looked for correlations among these zzso The average equivalent uniform dose zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of variation zzso among the patients was very low for all 3 zzso Two dose zzso zzso zzso and the zzso are strongly correlated zzso zzso zzso The area under the zzso zzso zzso and the treatment volume zzso also showed a strong correlation zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso A simplified zzso zzso model is suitable for determining zzso and zzso Other factors such as the area under the zzso and dose zzso zzso are also useful in planning zzso treatments for early breast zzso
