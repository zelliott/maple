Typically, zzso data is processed in the time domain with linear methods such as zzso and correlation zzso We propose that the theory of phase synchronization may be used to more completely understand the dynamics of interacting systems, and can be applied to zzso data as a novel method of detecting zzso zzso synchronization is a phenomenon that occurs when there is a zzso functional relationship present between two or more zzso zzso systems, whereas phase synchronization is defined as the zzso of the zzso while the zzso may zzso In this study, we developed an application of phase synchronization analysis that is appropriate for zzso data, in which the phase zzso condition is investigated between a zzso time series and the reference function of the task zzso A synchronization index is calculated to zzso the level of phase zzso and a zzso zzso test is used to determine the statistical significance of the zzso We performed the phase synchronization analysis on the data from five volunteers for an zzso zzso zzso zzso maps were created that provide information on the zzso between the instantaneous zzso of the reference function and the zzso time series in a zzso zzso zzso data zzso We conclude that this method of analysis is useful for revealing additional information on the complex nature of the zzso time zzso
