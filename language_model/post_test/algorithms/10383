zzso determination of cancer origin is necessary to guide optimal treatment but remains a diagnostic zzso Gene expression profiling technologies have aided the zzso of tumors and, therefore, could be applied in conjunction with zzso zzso to improve zzso We report an expanded version of the previously described zzso zzso to zzso 30 main tumor types and 54 zzso zzso with coverage of zzso of all solid tumors based on zzso Increased tissue coverage was achieved through expansion of a reference tumor database containing zzso zzso with a median of 62 samples per main tumor zzso The zzso zzso zzso demonstrated sensitivities of zzso and zzso for 30 main types and 54 zzso zzso respectively, in zzso cross zzso and zzso in a test set of zzso tumors representing 28 of the 30 main cancer zzso These findings provide further support that broad and diverse tumor zzso can be performed using a relatively compact gene zzso An additional 300 consecutive cases submitted for clinical testing were zzso to characterize clinical utility in a real-world zzso the zzso zzso confirmed zzso of samples having a single suspected primary tumor and provided a single molecular prediction in zzso of cases with two or more differential zzso Further development of the zzso zzso zzso has resulted in a significant expansion in zzso tumor types and zzso features with strong performance characteristics and supports the use of molecular zzso as an objective standardized adjunct to current zzso
