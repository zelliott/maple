Patient motion remains a significant source of unsatisfactory cardiac zzso zzso The extent to which image recovery can be achieved with correction zzso is zzso 

Nine subjects who had completed zzso zzso zzso zzso subsequently underwent simultaneous zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso point source, while the imaging table was subjected to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso marker reconstructions and zzso dynamic images were generated from the raw data after applying the following correction zzso zzso squares, zzso of the cardiac data and zzso of the zzso 

zzso zzso performed significantly better than all other methods with zzso results in all zzso This compared with zzso results in none of 27 for the raw data, in 13 of 27 for cardiac zzso and in 7 of 27 for zzso squares zzso zzso zzso The superiority of the zzso method was confirmed on analysis of zzso difference maps and zzso of residual motion in the zzso zzso 

Motion artifacts can accurately be detected and corrected using zzso of an external zzso Furthermore, this technique provides useful independent information on the degree of image zzso
