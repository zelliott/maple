The appreciation of zzso structures in digital images can be zzso to the observer, and hence it is necessary to zzso the underlying images in useful parameters by means of zzso that is, ideally, free of zzso This paper proposes a combination of techniques for zzso of zzso images through an optimal zzso zzso zzso and a set of zzso zzso zzso including the determination of the best number of zzso The results, which are validated through Rand Index and a zzso process performed in a laboratory, are similar to the zzso and zzso done by an zzso
