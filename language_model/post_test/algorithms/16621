zzso researchers increasingly use geographic information systems to measure exposure and access in neighborhood food and physical activity zzso This paper proposes a network zzso approach, the zzso zzso This method can be consistently and easily zzso across software versions and platforms, avoiding problems with proprietary systems that use different approaches in creating such zzso 

In this paper, we describe how the sausage zzso approach was developed to be zzso across platforms and zzso We also examine how the sausage buffer compares with existing alternatives in terms of buffer size and shape, zzso of the food and physical activity zzso and associations between environmental features and zzso zzso We test the proposed zzso approach using data from EAT 2010 zzso and zzso in zzso a study examining zzso factors associated with eating, physical activity, and weight status in adolescents zzso in the zzso Paul metropolitan area of zzso 

zzso show that the sausage buffer is comparable in area to the classic zzso zzso network buffer particularly for larger buffer zzso It zzso similar results to other zzso techniques when measuring variables associated with the food and physical activity environments and when measuring the correlations between such variables and outcomes such as physical activity and food zzso 

zzso from various tests in the current study show that researchers can obtain results using sausage buffers that are similar to results they would obtain by using other zzso zzso However, unlike proprietary zzso techniques, the sausage buffer approach can be zzso across software programs and versions, allowing more independence of research from specific zzso
