We examined whether zzso zzso receptors influence the zzso effect of zzso by a spinal or zzso zzso We antagonized zzso receptors by zzso zzso zzso zzso and IV administration of zzso 801 (a zzso zzso zzso and measured the decrease in zzso minimum zzso zzso concentration zzso We also measured zzso 801 tissue zzso in zzso of upper and lower spinal cord, a slice of cerebral cortex, and the whole zzso IT infusion of zzso 801 decreased zzso MAC more zzso than zzso or IV zzso The change in MAC correlated with the zzso 801 concentration in the lower part of the spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso but not with zzso in zzso zzso The zzso effect of IT zzso 801 reached a plateau without achieving zzso IV doses zzso larger than the largest IT dose also did not produce zzso in the absence of zzso These results suggest that the capacity of zzso 801 to decrease the MAC of zzso results from an effect on the spinal zzso but that spinal zzso receptors provide only partial mediation of the zzso produced by zzso Because neither IT nor IV zzso 801 provide complete zzso these findings also call into question the notion that zzso blockade alone zzso to produce zzso as defined by zzso in the face of noxious zzso 

Spinal zzso zzso receptors may mediate a portion of the zzso effect of zzso zzso of zzso receptors in the zzso by zzso 801 has a zzso effect, but zzso 801 does not, by itself, produce complete zzso
