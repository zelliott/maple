zzso zzso zzso is a common disorder that is difficult to diagnose clinically but carries significant morbidity and mortality if zzso Additionally, although demonstrated to be of benefit in cases of proven deep vein zzso zzso and pulmonary embolism zzso zzso therapy is not without zzso Because the clinical exam is known to be unreliable for the detection of both zzso and zzso many imaging zzso have been used in the diagnostic imaging zzso for the detection of zzso including chest zzso zzso zzso zzso pulmonary zzso and recently, spiral zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso findings in acute zzso include focal zzso vascular enlargement, zzso zzso zzso and air space zzso representing pulmonary zzso or zzso The chest zzso can occasionally be suggestive of zzso but is more often zzso zzso The main use of the chest zzso in the evaluation of suspected zzso is to exclude entities that may simulate zzso and to assist in the interpretation of zzso zzso Lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is both sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of zzso zzso and the value of negative zzso results has been established in outcomes zzso However, the reliability of zzso for the detection of isolated calf vein zzso is not well established, and the clinical significance of such zzso is zzso Additional methods such as color and spectral zzso analysis are also useful in the diagnostic evaluation of zzso but are best considered as zzso to the conventional zzso examination rather than as primary diagnostic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso techniques are useful in the evaluation of suspected upper zzso zzso spectral zzso zzso analysis is particularly useful to assess for the zzso of veins that cannot be directly zzso and compressed with conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso has been the initial zzso obtained in patients suspected of zzso for a number of zzso Although many studies have investigated the role of zzso zzso in the evaluation of zzso the Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary zzso Diagnosis zzso study has provided the most useful information regarding the utility of zzso zzso in this zzso A high probability scan interpretation is sufficient justification to institute zzso and a normal zzso scan effectively excludes the diagnosis of zzso A zzso normal scan interpretation also carries a sufficiently low prevalence of zzso proven zzso to withhold zzso Although the prevalence of zzso in the setting of low probability scan interpretations is low and several outcomes studies have demonstrated a benign course in zzso patients with low probability scan results, patients with inadequate zzso reserve do not necessarily have good zzso Such patients deserve more aggressive zzso Patients with intermediate probability scan results have a zzso to zzso prevalence of zzso proven zzso and thus require further zzso The zzso investigation of zzso includes such techniques as zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although these methods have not been as thoroughly evaluated as zzso studies thus far have indicated encouraging results, and further investigations are zzso Pulmonary zzso has been the gold standard for the diagnosis of zzso for zzso Studies have indicated that zzso has probably been zzso by referring physicians for the evaluation of suspected zzso likely because of the perception of significant morbidity and mortality associated with the zzso zzso zzso
