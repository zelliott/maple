The Task Group 23 zzso radiation treatment planning zzso zzso package was used to evaluate the zzso accuracy of two commercially available treatment planning zzso The zzso test package contains zzso measured beam data for two zzso beams (4 and 18 zzso that can be used as input for zzso zzso radiation treatment zzso zzso Once the beam data is entered and zzso a series of test cases are performed that isolate different aspects of the dose zzso zzso The zzso values from the zzso system are compared against the measured zzso data, included in the package, for a set of comparison points within each test zzso Both of the treatment planning systems that were studied provided excellent agreement between zzso and measured zzso The cumulative 4 and 18 zzso zzso test results for the zzso based planning system indicates that zzso of the zzso test points are within zzso and zzso are within zzso of the tabulated zzso zzso The zzso zzso test results for the pencil beam kernel based planning system are similar, with zzso of the test points falling within zzso and zzso falling within zzso of the zzso zzso
