Traditionally, management of exposed hardware has included irrigation and zzso intravenous zzso and likely removal of the zzso Increasingly, the goal of wound closure without hardware removal using plastic surgical techniques of zzso reconstruction has been zzso Identification of parameters for retaining exposed hardware may assist surgeons with management decisions and zzso 

A current literature review was performed to identify parameters with zzso relevance for management of exposed hardware before zzso zzso 

The following parameters were identified as important for the potential salvage of exposed hardware with zzso zzso hardware location, infection, duration of exposure, and presence of hardware zzso 

Management of exposed hardware has included the removal of the zzso However, if certain criteria are zzso stable hardware, time of exposure less than 2 weeks, lack of infection, and location of zzso of the hardware with plastic surgical zzso coverage may be a therapeutic zzso
