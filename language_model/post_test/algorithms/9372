Profile searches of sequence databases are a sensitive way to detect sequence zzso zzso zzso comparison zzso that have been recently introduced increase search sensitivity even zzso 

In this article, a simpler approach than zzso comparison is presented that has a comparable performance to state-of-the-art tools such as zzso zzso and zzso This approach is called zzso zzso zzso Of zzso zzso and is shown to find known relationships between families in the zzso database as well as detect novel distant relationships between zzso Several novel discoveries are presented including the discovery that a domain of unknown function zzso found in zzso proteins is related to zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is freely available under a zzso zzso license from zzso
