To investigate zzso zzso life sciences researchers usually retrieve and zzso proteins with similar zzso into the same zzso A manually constructed database, zzso is believed to be highly zzso however, it is labor zzso Another known method, zzso is also precise but zzso zzso We have developed an efficient algorithm, zzso zzso protein zzso alignment zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso indexing tree to quickly retrieve similar zzso in proteins and suggests possible folds by aligning these zzso 

Compared with known zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso on a sample zzso of zzso proteins from zzso zzso zzso exhibits an efficiency improvement of zzso zzso zzso and zzso times zzso zzso zzso on three different zzso of zzso proteins from zzso average accuracy of zzso is approximately equal to zzso and better than zzso zzso zzso and zzso With reliable accuracy and efficiency, this work will benefit the study of zzso protein zzso zzso 

zzso is publicly accessible at zzso
