To assess the feasibility and utility of high-resolution three-dimensional magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso for the purpose of zzso of zzso contact in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients zzso zzso 20 zzso age range, zzso years; and mean age, zzso zzso with unilateral typical zzso and 36 control subjects (21 zzso 15 zzso age range, zzso years; mean age, zzso zzso underwent high-resolution zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The images were reviewed by two experienced zzso who were blinded to the clinical zzso The imaging results were compared with the operative findings in all the zzso zzso the degree of zzso contact was compared between the two groups based on MR zzso 

In 45 patients with unilateral typical zzso the use of zzso zzso in conjunction with the zzso zzso zzso identified zzso contact in 40 of the 42 symptomatic zzso the contact was verified zzso Based on the surgical findings, the sensitivity and specificity of MR imaging were zzso and zzso zzso Based on zzso the zzso vessel zzso zzso was correctly identified in 32 of the 39 cases verified by zzso zzso There was good agreement zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso between the position zzso zzso superior, and zzso of the zzso vessel relative to the zzso nerve as defined by MR imaging and the surgical zzso The rates of vascular contact with the zzso nerve as observed on zzso were zzso zzso and zzso in the control subjects, zzso and symptomatic side of patients, zzso 

The combined use of high-resolution zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is an extremely sensitive and specific technique for demonstrating vascular contact with the zzso nerve in zzso zzso
