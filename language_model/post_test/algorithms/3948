zzso zzso wave imaging zzso has recently been explored as a technique to evaluate tissue elasticity zzso and has become a valuable tool for tumor zzso The purpose of this study was to develop a novel zzso diagnosis zzso system that can acquire quantitative zzso information from color zzso zzso images automatically and zzso for the purpose of zzso benign and zzso breast zzso Conventional zzso zzso and zzso zzso images of 125 breast tumors zzso benign, 44 zzso in 93 consecutive patients zzso age: zzso age zzso zzso were zzso After reconstruction of tissue elasticity data and automatic zzso of each breast zzso 10 quantitative zzso features of the tumor and zzso areas, respectively zzso zzso mean, maximum and standard zzso zzso degree and elasticity zzso were zzso and zzso A support zzso machine zzso zzso was used for optimum zzso via combination of these zzso The zzso Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System zzso was used to compare zzso US and zzso zzso with respect to diagnostic zzso zzso examination was used as the reference zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso the point zzso correlation zzso and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were performed for statistical zzso As a result, the zzso sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value and negative zzso value of zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso respectively, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso assessment, zzso The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso zzso for the proposed zzso system using the combination of zzso features was significantly higher than the zzso value for visual assessment by the zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso could be used for zzso feature zzso and the proposed zzso method could improve the diagnostic accuracy of zzso of breast tumors to avoid unnecessary zzso Furthermore, zzso features of the zzso area have the potential to provide critical information in differential zzso
