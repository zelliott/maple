zzso zzso of a large collection of protein structures aids the understanding of evolutionary relationships among zzso zzso involving manual steps, such as zzso and zzso face the challenge of increasing volume of available zzso Automatic methods such as zzso or zzso zzso zzso yield divergent zzso for reasons not yet fully zzso One possible reason is that the zzso similarity scores used in automatic zzso do not adequately reflect the judgments made in manual zzso Another possibility is the difference between manual and automatic zzso zzso We explore the degree to which these two factors might affect the final zzso 

We use zzso zzso and zzso zzso scores on the zzso C class zzso to investigate a variety of zzso zzso zzso The constructed zzso is cut in a variety of ways to produce a zzso which is compared to the zzso fold zzso method zzso led to partitions closest to the zzso fold zzso zzso or zzso strategies fell into four categories according to the similarity of resulting partitions to the zzso fold zzso Two strategies which zzso similarity to zzso gave an average of zzso true zzso rate zzso at a zzso false positive zzso Cutting the largest size cluster at each step gave an average of zzso zzso which was one of the best strategies not making use of prior knowledge of zzso Cutting the longest branch at each step produced one of the worst zzso We also developed a method to detect zzso differences between the best possible automatic partitions and zzso regardless of the cutting zzso These differences are zzso Visual examination of zzso proteins confirms our previous finding, that global structural similarity of zzso is not the only criterion used in the zzso zzso 

Different zzso procedures give rise to different levels of agreement between automatic and manual protein zzso None of the tested procedures completely eliminates the divergence between automatic and manual protein zzso Achieving full agreement between these two approaches would apparently require additional zzso
