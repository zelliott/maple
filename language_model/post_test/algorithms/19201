zzso is an important teaching tool in minimally invasive surgery zzso While robotic surgery offers the added benefit of three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso technology does not currently exist for this zzso This project aimed to develop a video zzso to accurately translate a mentor's two-dimensional zzso zzso into a 3-D zzso in the da Vinci visual zzso 

A zzso 3-D zzso system was constructed to translate zzso zzso from a mentor station into 3-D graphics for the zzso at the robotic zzso This system uses fast image correlation zzso to allow zzso images to be placed over the same zzso location in the two separate video channels of the zzso robotic zzso zzso Three subjects of varying surgical backgrounds, blinded to the mode of zzso zzso zzso zzso were tested in the laboratory, using a simulated robotic zzso 

There were few zzso errors zzso only one of which resulted in a task error, in 99 total zzso Only the experienced zzso staff surgeon had a significantly faster task time in zzso than in 3-D zzso zzso zzso The zzso fellow recorded the fastest task times in zzso and 3-D zzso zzso zzso There were nine task zzso six of which were committed by the zzso zzso The zzso zzso had the least number of errors but also had the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso in 3-D is feasible and does not zzso impact performance in laboratory zzso We plan to refine the zzso and investigate its use in zzso
