zzso characterization of continuous pediatric drug zzso 

The dynamics of drug delivery by continuous infusion to pediatric patients have not been systematically zzso This study extends previously described zzso models to zzso and zzso delivery, focusing on infants and zzso We zzso that infusion system dead volume, and drug and carrier flow rates, significantly influence drug zzso 

We studied effects of patient weight, infusion system dead volume, drug and carrier flow rates, along with drug stock concentration and dose, on zzso and zzso delivery to the zzso We calculated the drug mass available for zzso zzso in the dead volume, the volume of fluid supplied by drug zzso and zzso estimates of the range of lag times to achieve a targeted zzso rate of drug zzso 

The drug mass in the dead volume at steady state increased with dead volume size and drug zzso For zzso this drug mass could exceed zzso of commonly used loading zzso zzso lag times to steady state depend on patient size, fluid flow rates, and the mixing behavior of the drug entering the main fluid zzso zzso have the longest lag times to achieve steady zzso zzso quantities delivered by drug infusions increase with drug flow rate and can represent a large fraction of estimated maintenance fluid zzso zzso delivery increases if stock drug zzso are zzso These relationships were zzso similar for zzso and zzso 

Traditional studies focus on drug disposition once a drug enters the zzso Our analysis shows the potential importance of factors influencing drug delivery to the patient's zzso focusing on zzso and zzso administration to small zzso The drug mass available for zzso zzso residing in the zzso of the dead volume at steady state may be large and clinically zzso zzso times to achieve zzso delivery are long, depending on the infusion system's architecture and fluid flow zzso By themselves, drug infusions can deliver significant fluid loads to zzso These observations have practical and perhaps safety implications for infusions of drugs commonly administered to infants and zzso
