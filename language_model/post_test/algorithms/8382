A zzso zzso zzso Carlo zzso simulation technique is proposed for the efficient construction of the early part of the zzso point spread function zzso of visible or near infrared photons transmitted through an zzso thick scattering zzso By assuming a detected zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso the zzso is zzso from a point in the original path where a significant delay in forward propagation zzso A weight is then associated with each subsequently detected zzso to compensate for shorter zzso The technique is shown to reduce the zzso time by a factor of at least 4 when simulating the zzso zzso region of the zzso and hence provides a useful tool for analysis of single zzso detection in zzso zzso
