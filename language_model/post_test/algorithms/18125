zzso zzso disease is strongly correlated with zzso zzso Monitoring circulation health, especially in the peripheral zzso is vital to detecting clinically significant disease at a stage when it can still be addressed through medical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso maps the electrical properties of zzso within the body and has been used to image zzso varying zzso including blood zzso Here, we suggest that peripheral zzso health can be monitored with zzso by imaging the zzso of peripheral vessels and the surrounding zzso during zzso zzso zzso An analysis based on zzso theory is presented that indicates that an zzso system capable of making zzso with a precision of 50 zzso may be able to detect small changes in vessel size associated with variations in blood zzso An zzso system with these precision capabilities is presented that is able to collect data at frame rates exceeding 30 zzso over a broad frequency range up to 10 zzso The system's high speed imaging performance is verified through high contrast phantom experiments and through zzso imaging of induced zzso with a human zzso Region of interest analysis of the induced zzso images shows a marked decrease in zzso over time, changing at a rate of approximately zzso zzso zzso S zzso zzso which is the same order of magnitude as reported in the zzso The zzso analysis suggests that a system such as the one developed here may provide a means to characterize the zzso associated with blood flow through the peripheral zzso
