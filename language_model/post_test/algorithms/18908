The theory of guided waves in zzso zzso zzso structures is applied to reduce the loss and maximize optical zzso for efficient zzso generation in a surface electromagnetic wave by zzso laser zzso confined in a zzso zzso zzso zzso For typical parameters of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the optimal size of the zzso zzso core providing the maximum efficiency of zzso zzso generation is shown to be less than the wavelength of the optical pump zzso
