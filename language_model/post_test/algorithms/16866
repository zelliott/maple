To estimate the proportion of zzso factor zzso zzso caused by zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso from a retrospective study of CT zzso prevalence in zzso cases and controls, adjusted for sensitivity and zzso 

We use published data on sensitivity and specificity to estimate the performance of zzso in zzso women with a previous CT infection without zzso and zzso women with zzso caused by zzso A model was developed and applied to zzso prevalence in zzso cases and controls from 1 published zzso study to estimate the proportion of zzso caused by zzso 

The proportion of zzso episodes that were due to CT infection was estimated to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Models which assume that test sensitivity is higher in women with zzso zzso than women with previous infection and no zzso fit the data significantly better than models that assume the same sensitivity in all those previously zzso 

Greater attention needs to be paid to methods for characterizing the performance of CT zzso zzso zzso studies could be given a greater role both in CT zzso and in monitoring the effects of prevention and control zzso
