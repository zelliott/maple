zzso zzso migration zzso across the surface of a zzso zzso phantom are acquired via an intensified zzso device zzso detection system and used in conjunction with the diffusion approximation to determine the optical zzso The zzso and reduced scattering zzso are determined least accurately when relative zzso of average light intensity zzso are employed either alone or in a combination with relative zzso zzso data zzso and/or relative phase shift data zzso The zzso and reduced scattering zzso are found accurate to within 15 and zzso respectively, of the values obtained from standard zzso zzso when zzso zzso are employed alone or in combination with zzso zzso
