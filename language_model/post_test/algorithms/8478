The literature concerning measurement of spatial resolution in electrical zzso zzso zzso is zzso Different groups often use their own method or a modified version of a better known method, thus hindering a generalized resolution measurement which could be useful for gauging the performance of one system against zzso zzso of spatial resolution in zzso is further complicated by its spatial zzso nature and hence cannot be expressed simply with a single zzso as it can be in other imaging zzso (such as nuclear medicine or zzso for zzso If the performance of each acquisition and image reconstruction system in zzso is to be compared zzso then there needs to be a common zzso In this paper the results of different methods for calculating spatial resolution are compared and an improved method is proposed which aims to zzso this zzso
