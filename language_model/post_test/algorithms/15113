The aim of this study was to assess the extent to which a model with pores having only net negative charges would adequately describe zzso zzso in human zzso membrane zzso at neutral zzso Such information would enhance the zzso value of the modified zzso model for zzso zzso in addition to providing insights regarding the likelihood of significant pore charge distribution in zzso zzso results (the zzso obtained from zzso to zzso V zzso and zzso zzso experiments with synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso and zzso as the model zzso demonstrated that such a membrane system can be modeled by the zzso zzso theory with the assumption of the pores possessing only negative zzso The studies with zzso were carried out at low zzso zzso zzso where zzso in the barrier properties of zzso were minimal and at higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso where significant zzso pore formation in zzso zzso In both the low and high zzso studies, zzso zzso zzso and water were employed as zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results of the low zzso zzso experiments suggest significant pore charge distribution in zzso (a significant zzso between the predictions from the single pore charge type assumption and the experimental zzso Under the higher applied zzso conditions zzso zzso zzso zzso results from zzso and zzso zzso studies were consistent with the model in which the zzso has only pores that are net zzso zzso
