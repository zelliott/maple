Renal transplant patients often require imaging to ensure appropriate graft placement, to assess integrity of transplant vessel zzso and to evaluate for zzso that can be a cause of graft zzso Because there is risk for zzso systemic zzso in the setting of zzso zzso the use of zzso zzso in these patients is zzso In this study, the ability of two zzso zzso methods - zzso zzso linear combination balanced zzso zzso and zzso Cartesian zzso zzso - to zzso the transplant zzso vessels is zzso zzso zzso transplant patients were scanned using the zzso and zzso zzso zzso efficacy of the sequences was scored using a four point zzso scale according to the following criteria: overall image quality, fat suppression, and zzso zzso zzso Average scores for each criterion were compared using the zzso zzso zzso In addition to significantly improved zzso zzso the zzso sequence provided significantly improved fat suppression quality zzso compared to zzso zzso also identified several zzso such as zzso zzso zzso that were not visible on the zzso zzso However, zzso afforded superior quality of zzso zzso zzso These two methods of zzso MR imaging each have significant strengths and are complementary to each other in evaluating the zzso of zzso zzso
