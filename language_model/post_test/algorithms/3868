It is often desirable to monitor zzso events from subjects free to participate in their normal daily zzso This is especially so where clinical symptoms are elusive or zzso by specific zzso Through ambulatory monitoring, evidence of a zzso relationship between recorded parameters and the spontaneous onset of symptoms may be zzso We describe an ambulatory monitoring system which permits continuous 24-hour recording of zzso zzso from three levels within the zzso together with zzso zzso zzso analysis of the recorded data addresses many of the problems associated with processing the information accrued through long-term monitoring by providing an automatic comparison of patient data against either zzso values or those of the program's zzso zzso is zzso in terms of wave frequency, zzso duration and zzso relationship together with an integration of the wave area and mean pressure zzso The corresponding pH data is zzso as frequency, duration and integrated area of pH excursions throughout a range of zzso This system provides access to the entire patient record which may either be viewed on screen, zzso or output to a zzso Analysis yields a tabulated breakdown of zzso and pH events from any section of the patient's zzso Selective analysis readily permits statistical comparison of discrete zzso samples corresponding to different patient zzso
