An important issue in the automation of two-dimensional gel zzso image analysis is the detection and zzso of protein zzso A spot zzso zzso must zzso define the extent of, and measure the integrated density of spots under a wide variety of actual gel image zzso Besides these functions, the zzso must be memory efficient to be able to process very large gel images and do this in a reasonable amount of zzso time on low-cost computers, such as zzso and personal zzso We have developed a fast spot zzso algorithm, extending the zzso zzso which extracts spots in a single zzso scanning pass through the gel zzso The performance analysis of the zzso will be given in the paper as well as a discussion of the zzso
