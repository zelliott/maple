zzso may undergo the zzso zzso interaction to cause an zzso zzso zzso zzso It is interesting to study the influence of zzso zzso as a coating zzso on the stability of zzso zzso The reaction zzso of the solid-state degradation process of pure zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mixture with different weight ratios were zzso The mechanism of solid-state interaction between zzso E and zzso zzso was also zzso 

The cast samples of pure zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso mixture after zzso the zzso were prepared on an aluminum foil and also determined by zzso zzso transform infrared zzso zzso equipped with zzso zzso 

The result indicates that the interaction might occur between zzso zzso and zzso E in the solid state after zzso the zzso The zzso zzso zzso show that not only the formation of zzso but also the zzso zzso zzso occurred in the zzso zzso E mixture in the heating zzso Two pathways for zzso interaction were zzso The stability of zzso zzso was dependent on the weight ratio of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso energy zzso zzso 3) of zzso formation for pure zzso zzso was about zzso zzso but it was reduced significantly to zzso zzso after interaction with zzso E zzso zzso zzso suggesting zzso E might exacerbate the degradation of zzso zzso However, the degradation accelerated by zzso E was reduced in high content of zzso zzso 

When the weight ratio of both components was zzso zzso E might interact with the zzso group of zzso acid to exacerbate the degradation of zzso zzso However, the excess amount of zzso E might somewhat reduce the degradation of zzso due to the interaction that occurred between zzso E and zzso group of zzso
