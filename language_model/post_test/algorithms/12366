zzso zzso which measures the magnetic component of the heart's electrical activity, offers an alternative approach for analyzing changes induced by coronary artery disease zzso This study examines several parameters that zzso spatial and zzso aspects of cardiac magnetic signals in zzso 

zzso were registered at rest in 144 subjects, aged zzso zzso zzso years: 50 healthy subjects, 43 zzso patients without zzso zzso zzso 36 with zzso and 15 with spontaneous episodes of zzso zzso zzso zzso characteristics of magnetic field maps zzso zzso using their centers of gravity, included zzso orientation and trajectory zzso zzso analysis was performed by determining the spatial distribution of the zzso zzso 

In zzso patients, zzso orientation during the zzso zzso deviated from normal in zzso of patients without zzso and in zzso of patients with zzso zzso plots deviated from those of the normal group, with zzso increasing with disease zzso zzso the distribution of zzso zzso duration using a zzso index demonstrated a significant difference between the values for healthy subjects and zzso patients, as well as zzso patients with and without VT zzso zzso zzso 

The results reported demonstrate that disturbances in cardiac zzso resulting from zzso may be assessed using zzso signal zzso
