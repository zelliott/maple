zzso factors, proteins required for the regulation of gene zzso recognize and bind short stretches of DNA on the order of 4 to 10 bases in zzso In general, each factor recognizes a family of zzso sequences rather than a single unique zzso Ultimately, the zzso state of a gene is determined by the cooperative interaction of several bound zzso We have developed a method using Gibbs zzso and the Minimum zzso zzso principle for automatically and reliably creating weight zzso models of binding sites from a database zzso of known binding site zzso zzso the relationship between sequence and binding affinity for a particular factor is an important first step in predicting whether a given zzso sequence is part of a promoter site or other control zzso Here we describe the foundation for the methods we will use to develop weight zzso models for zzso factor binding zzso
