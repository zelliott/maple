To assess the recent literature on effective use of information received from zzso zzso 

Dynamic zzso measures are more effective in assessing cardiovascular status than zzso zzso In this review, we will focus on the application of zzso monitoring to evaluate the effect of zzso 

A systematic approach to an effective resuscitation effort can be incorporated into a zzso cardiovascular management algorithm, which, in turn, can improve zzso outcomes and the cost of zzso systems, by faster and more effective response in order to diagnose and treat zzso unstable patients both inside and outside of intensive care zzso
