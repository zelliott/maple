zzso zzso is a special class of short zzso zzso that serves pivotal function of regulating gene zzso The zzso prediction of new zzso candidates involves various methods such as learning methods and methods using expression zzso This article has proposed a reliable model - zzso which is a supervised machine learning zzso zzso used known zzso as positive set and a novel negative set from human zzso zzso The number of known zzso is now huge and diversified that could cover almost all characteristics of unknown zzso which increases the quality of the result zzso zzso zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso and provides a more reliable zzso zzso performs better than other state-of-the-art approaches and declares to be the most potential tool to predict novel zzso We have also tested our result using a previous negative zzso zzso opens new ground using ANN for predicting zzso with a promise of better zzso
