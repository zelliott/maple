The paper reviews zzso learning rules for minor component analysis and suggests a novel minor component learning zzso In this rule, the weight zzso length is zzso zzso moving towards unit length in each learning zzso In simulations with low- and zzso data, the performance of the novel learning rule is compared with previously suggested zzso
