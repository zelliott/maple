The three zzso zzso distribution of zzso drugs was measured using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Lee, zzso Leisure, zzso Nelson, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso PET evaluation of zzso zzso zzso dose zzso zzso zzso zzso 38 zzso zzso zzso Data analysis was based upon regional ratios or penetration zzso To improve the zzso usefulness and objectivity, labeled drug from dynamic PET images was mapped into 23 airway generations following a general framework from a zzso methodology zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Bailey, zzso , Conway, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moore, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of pulmonary deposition of zzso zzso by airway generation using a conceptual three zzso model of lung zzso zzso zzso zzso 8, zzso A recently developed airway network model was used in this zzso zzso PET scans of zzso zzso distribution in the lung were determined following administration of zzso a commercial zzso dose zzso with an integrated zzso zzso zzso at varying time periods after drug administration were investigated to explore the dynamics and zzso of the zzso zzso Initially, deposition of labeled drug on conducting airways zzso zzso was found to be higher than those on zzso airways zzso zzso zzso versus zzso The distribution pattern changed slowly with zzso By 47 zzso 51% of the dose remaining in the lung was found on conducting airways while zzso was on zzso zzso This study illustrates the value of PET imaging for the evaluation and design of drug zzso
