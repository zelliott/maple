To evaluate the relationship between different noise zzso zzso and radiation dose and to compare the effect of different reconstruction zzso applications for zzso chest zzso zzso zzso on image quality improvement and the accuracy of zzso measurement of zzso zzso zzso zzso using a phantom zzso 

A zzso thick zzso phantom section with a chest wall, zzso and 14 artificial zzso zzso with known volumes zzso was zzso The phantom was scanned on a Discovery CT zzso scanner with five different zzso zzso 30, 40, 50, and zzso All data were reconstructed with a zzso section thickness using the filtered zzso zzso 50% zzso statistical zzso reconstruction zzso and zzso zzso zzso reconstruction zzso Image noise was measured in six regions of interest zzso zzso volumes were measured using a commercial zzso software zzso The image quality and the volume measurement errors were zzso 

Image noise increased dramatically from zzso at zzso 20 to zzso at zzso 60, with zzso zzso zzso zzso reconstruction effectively controlled the noise increase, with an increase from zzso at zzso 20 to only zzso at zzso zzso Image noise at zzso 60 with zzso was even lower zzso than that at zzso 20 with zzso The zzso ratio zzso of zzso at zzso 40 was similar to that of zzso at zzso zzso All artificial zzso zzso were successfully identified and measured with an average relative volume measurement error with zzso at zzso 60 of zzso comparable to a value of zzso with zzso at zzso zzso At zzso 60, the radiation dose was only one-tenth that at zzso zzso 

The zzso reconstruction zzso very effectively reduced image noise compared with the conventional zzso zzso Using zzso CT scanning and zzso zzso zzso can be detected and zzso with an acceptable zzso
