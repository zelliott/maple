zzso diagnostic zzso schemes have been developed for assisting zzso in the detection of various zzso in medical zzso Many evaluation approaches, such as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso methods, have been employed for the assessment of the performance of various zzso zzso For these evaluation methods, some investigators have studied their bias in the estimated performance levels of zzso schemes trained with finite zzso However, zzso study has not been conducted for the comparison of these common evaluation methods in terms of multiple important characteristics such as the bias of the estimated performance, the zzso performance, and the uniqueness of the trained zzso zzso zzso in this study, we examined and compared these important characteristics for various evaluation methods and attempted to provide a zzso for investigators to select appropriate evaluation methods for the assessment of zzso schemes in typical practical zzso
