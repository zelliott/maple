The adapted zzso decision rule zzso for children (one for those younger than 2 years and one for those older than 2 zzso were actively implemented in the zzso of zzso Italy, for a zzso testing zzso zzso and satisfaction of medical staff to the new rule were zzso Data from zzso visits for zzso during zzso rule zzso and those of 288 patients attending the zzso for zzso in the previous 6 months were compared for changes in zzso zzso zzso scan rate, zzso rate zzso as death, zzso zzso for longer than 24 hours, or hospital admission at least for two nights associated with zzso and return visits for symptoms or signs potentially related to zzso The safety and efficacy of the adapted zzso rule in clinical practice were also zzso

The adapted zzso rule was successfully implemented in an Italian zzso care academic zzso achieving high adherence and satisfaction of medical zzso Its use determined a low CT scan rate that was unchanged compared to previous clinical practice and showed an optimal safety and high efficacy zzso zzso monitoring is mandatory to evaluate the long-lasting benefit in patient care and/or resource zzso
