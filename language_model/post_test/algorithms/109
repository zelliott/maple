We have developed a zzso source of zzso scale zzso zzso that can be used for the generation of energetic zzso To demonstrate this potential, a zzso zzso laser focused to 2 zzso zzso zzso was used to irradiate heavy water zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which were generated in the zzso interaction, produced zzso fusion with approximately 2 zzso zzso fusion zzso measured per zzso of incident laser zzso
