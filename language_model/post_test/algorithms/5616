zzso of the zzso is a common manifestation of zzso traumatic brain injury zzso reported among combat casualties in the conflicts in Afghanistan and zzso zzso zzso occurs more zzso and with earlier zzso in zzso patients than in patients with other zzso injury zzso such as blunt force zzso Though zzso is usually associated with the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso is not required for zzso in zzso which suggests that the unique mechanics of blast injury could zzso zzso zzso accounting for the increased zzso Here, using theoretical and in zzso models, we show that a single rapid mechanical insult can induce vascular zzso and zzso indicative of zzso zzso We employed high-velocity stretching of engineered zzso zzso to simulate the mechanical forces of a blast pulse on the zzso An hour after a simulated blast, injured zzso displayed altered zzso calcium dynamics leading to hypersensitivity to zzso stimulus with zzso One day after simulated blast, zzso exhibited blast force dependent prolonged zzso and vascular smooth muscle zzso zzso indicative of zzso These results suggest that an zzso zzso injury is sufficient to induce a zzso genetic switch that zzso vascular zzso and cerebral vasospasm, in zzso zzso
