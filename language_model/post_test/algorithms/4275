Most methods for zzso differential expression from zzso are based on statistics that compare zzso read counts between treatment zzso Unfortunately, reads are in general too short to be mapped zzso to features of interest, such as zzso zzso or zzso zzso There are methods for zzso expression levels that account for this source of zzso However, the uncertainty is not generally accounted for in downstream analysis of gene expression zzso Moreover, at the individual transcript level, it can sometimes be too large to allow useful comparisons between treatment zzso 

In this article we make two proposals that improve the power, specificity and versatility of expression analysis using zzso zzso First, we present a zzso method for model selection that accounts for read mapping ambiguities using random zzso This zzso model selection approach can be used to identify many interesting patterns of gene expression and is not confined to detecting differential expression between two zzso For zzso we use our method to detect zzso different types of regulatory divergence in zzso and in trans and differential zzso zzso but many other applications are zzso Second, we present a novel collapsing zzso for grouping transcripts into zzso units that exploits the zzso correlation between transcript expression zzso The zzso expression levels of these units can be estimated with useful levels of zzso Our zzso can improve the precision of expression estimates when uncertainty is large with only a small reduction in biological zzso 

We have implemented our software in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso programs as part of the zzso zzso package, available on zzso
