It has been hypothesized that known words in the lexicon strengthen newly formed representations of novel words, resulting in words with dense neighborhoods being learned more quickly than words with sparse zzso Tests of this hypothesis in a zzso network showed that words with dense neighborhoods were learned better than words with sparse neighborhoods when the network was exposed to the words all at once zzso zzso or gradually over time, like human zzso zzso zzso This pattern was also observed despite variation in the availability of processing resources in the networks zzso zzso A learning advantage for words with sparse neighborhoods was observed only when the network was initially exposed to words with sparse neighborhoods and exposed to dense neighborhoods later in training zzso zzso The benefits of zzso experiments for increasing our understanding of language processes and for the treatment of language processing disorders are zzso
