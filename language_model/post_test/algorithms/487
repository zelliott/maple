We propose a novel explanation for zzso perception, zzso the collective dynamics of multiple neural populations that are individually zzso zzso representations of sensory input and of zzso state build gradually through zzso transitions in these zzso until the competition between alternative representations is resolved by a threshold zzso The perpetual repetition of this collective race to threshold renders perception zzso This collective dynamics - which is largely zzso from the zzso that govern individual populations or zzso - explains many zzso puzzling observations about zzso zzso the wide range of mean zzso rates exhibited by zzso phenomena, the consistent zzso of successive dominance zzso and the stabilizing effect of past zzso zzso It also predicts a number of previously zzso relationships between zzso quantities characterizing zzso zzso We conclude that zzso perception reflects the collective nature of neural decision making rather than properties of individual populations or zzso
