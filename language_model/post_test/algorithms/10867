zzso biological and zzso research seeks a systems perspective through the analysis of multiple types of zzso and other experimental data for the same zzso zzso analysis requires the integration and fusion of such data, typically through advanced statistics and zzso zzso is a complementary zzso approach that supports integration and analysis of complex data or its zzso We present a zzso zzso prototype, zzso which depicts zzso information derived from or assigned to these diverse data for the purpose of comparing patterns across zzso The zzso allows users to easily discern correlated and anomalous patterns in the zzso These patterns, which might not be detected automatically by zzso may reveal valuable information leading to insight and zzso We describe the zzso and interaction capabilities and demonstrate its utility in a new field, zzso which combines molecular biology and zzso to identify and characterize genetic material from zzso microbial zzso
