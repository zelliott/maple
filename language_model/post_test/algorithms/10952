Selective zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by some zzso zzso has been successfully modeled using zzso charge indexes zzso and genetic neural networks zzso A neural network monitoring scheme evidenced a highly zzso dependence between the zzso zzso blocking activity and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso were selected by means of genetic zzso zzso zzso was implemented in the network training function with the aim of assuring good zzso qualities to the zzso zzso were able to yield a reliable predictor that explained about zzso data zzso with good zzso zzso On the contrary, the best zzso linear equation with zzso selected by linear genetic search, only explained about zzso In spite of when using the zzso from the linear equations to train neural networks yielded higher fitted models, such networks were very unstable and had relative low zzso zzso However, the best zzso zzso 2 had a Q ( 2 ) of zzso of zzso equal to zzso and at the same time exhibited outstanding stability when calculating 80 randomly constructed zzso sets zzso Our model suggested that structural fragments of size three and seven have relevant influence on the zzso potency of the studied zzso zzso channel zzso Furthermore, zzso were well distributed regarding its activity levels in a zzso zzso map zzso built using the zzso of the best neural network zzso
