To establish reference intervals for fetal heart stroke volume and cardiac output with zzso 

Fetal heart zzso volumes were measured using the zzso zzso zzso imaging correlation zzso ultrasound technique in 140 normal singleton zzso at zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso technique was used to obtain a sequence of six sections of each zzso volume in zzso and zzso Each volume was obtained after a 30 degrees rotation from the previous one around a fixed axis extending from the zzso of the heart to the point that divides zzso each zzso zzso The zzso of each zzso was drawn manually and the zzso volumes of the left and right zzso in zzso and zzso were zzso The stroke volume for each zzso was then calculated by zzso the one in zzso from the one in zzso and the cardiac output was calculated by zzso the stroke volume by the fetal heart zzso In 50 cases the stroke volumes were measured by the same zzso twice and the zzso agreement of zzso was zzso 

The left and right stroke volume and cardiac output increased zzso with zzso from respective mean values of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at 12 weeks to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at 20 weeks, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at 34 zzso The ratio of right to left stroke volume increased significantly with gestation from about zzso at 12 weeks to zzso at 34 zzso In the zzso test, the mean percentage difference and zzso limits of zzso agreement for left stroke volume and right stroke volume were - zzso zzso zzso and - zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In normal fetuses the stroke volume and cardiac output increase between 12 and 34 zzso zzso The extent to which, in pathological zzso possible zzso in these zzso from normal prove to be useful in the prediction of outcome remains to be zzso
