In zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso fluid typing has recently gained momentum due to data acquisition and inversion zzso enhancement of zzso logging zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso logging contain information on bulk zzso and pore size zzso However, the accuracy of fluid typing is greatly overshadowed by the overlap between zzso zzso arising from different zzso with similar apparent zzso relaxation zzso Nevertheless, the shapes of zzso zzso from different fluid components are often different and can be zzso zzso with predetermined zzso zzso allows us to perform fluid component decomposition to yield individual fluid volume zzso Another effective method for in zzso fluid typing is two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso which results in zzso population distribution as a function of zzso relaxation time and fluid diffusion zzso (or zzso relaxation zzso Since diffusion zzso (or zzso relaxation zzso for different fluid components can be very different, it is relatively easy to separate oil (especially heavy zzso from water signal in a zzso zzso map and to perform accurate fluid zzso Combining zzso logging with zzso and/or zzso logs provides a third method for in zzso fluid zzso We shall describe these techniques with field zzso
