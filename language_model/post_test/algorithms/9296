zzso methods of predicting protein functions rely on detecting similarities among zzso However, sufficient sequence information is not always available for some protein zzso For example, proteins of interest may be new members of a divergent protein zzso The performance of protein zzso methods could vary in such challenging zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso as an example, we investigated the performance of several protein zzso zzso zzso based on support zzso machines using simple zzso acid compositions were effective in zzso detection even from short fragmented zzso Although it is zzso expensive, a support zzso machine zzso using local zzso alignment scores showed very good balanced zzso More commonly used profile hidden zzso models were generally highly specific and well suited to zzso well-established protein family zzso It is suggested that different types of protein zzso should be applied to gain the optimal mining zzso
