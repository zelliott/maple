In this paper a new zzso search method, called Cat zzso zzso zzso zzso is applied to determine the best optimal impulse response zzso of zzso low pass, high pass, band pass and band stop zzso trying to meet the respective ideal frequency response zzso zzso is generated by observing the zzso of cats and composed of two zzso In zzso one can decide how many cats are used in the zzso Every cat has zzso own position composed of M dimensions, zzso for each dimension, a fitness value which represents the accommodation of the cat to the fitness function, and a flag to identify whether the cat is in seeking mode or tracing zzso The final solution would be the best position of one of the zzso zzso keeps the best solution until it reaches the end of the zzso The results of the proposed zzso based approach have been compared to those of other well-known zzso methods such as Real zzso zzso Algorithm zzso standard zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Evolution zzso The zzso based results confirm the superiority of the proposed zzso for solving zzso filter design zzso The performances of the zzso based designed zzso filters have proven to be superior as compared to those obtained by zzso conventional zzso and zzso The simulation results also demonstrate that the zzso is the best zzso among other relevant techniques, not only in the convergence speed but also in the optimal performances of the designed zzso
