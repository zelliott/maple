The application of zzso zzso as an alternative or complementary approach to the zzso of tobacco products is presented in this work for the first zzso Two hundred fifty samples from five different cigarette brands composed of single and mixed tobacco blends were examined for that purpose on the basis of the zzso spectrum of their zzso zzso Data transformation based on the zzso of zzso zzso as a function of sample weight was employed in order to account for differences in the relative zzso of each zzso Principal components analysis zzso was used to extract zzso cases and sample zzso was then pursued with the aid of zzso analysis zzso suggesting that a reduced number of variables zzso out of seven hundred initially zzso could provide perfect zzso zzso correct zzso of samples containing single tobacco species or different blends and a fair zzso of samples with similar composition zzso correct zzso yielding an overall zzso correct zzso To this zzso zzso and zzso trees were found to afford perfect zzso of all samples using only a few logic rules based on appropriate split conditions at the expense of inserting 15 variables in the zzso
