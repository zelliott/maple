The effects of dominant sequential interactions are investigated in an exactly zzso zzso layered neural network model of zzso units and patterns near zzso in which the interaction consists of a zzso part and a zzso sequential zzso Phase zzso of stationary states are obtained and a phase of zzso correlated states of period two is found for a weak zzso term, independently of the number of condensed patterns zzso
