zzso zzso zzso are one of the important tools of modern drug development zzso The promising achievements of the last 10 years emphasize the need for further improvement, as reflected by several recent publications zzso et zzso J zzso zzso 2006, 49, zzso Warren et zzso J zzso zzso 2006, 49, zzso Our initial approach, zzso showed a good performance in zzso the experimental binding modes for a set of 37 different zzso complexes zzso et zzso zzso 2007, 67, zzso This article presents recent improvements regarding the scoring and sampling aspects over the initial zzso as well as a new seeding procedure based on the detection of zzso opening the door to blind zzso with zzso These enhancements were validated on 260 complexes taken from the high quality zzso zzso Database zzso zzso et zzso J zzso zzso 2001, 44, zzso Two issues were zzso first, the quality of the initial structures cannot be assumed and a manual inspection and/or a search in the literature are likely to be required to achieve the best zzso Second the description of interactions involving metal zzso still has to be zzso Nonetheless, a remarkable success rate of zzso was achieved for a large scale blind zzso zzso when considering only the top ranked binding mode and a success threshold of 2 A zzso to the crystal zzso When looking at the zzso ranked binding zzso the success rate increases up to zzso In a standard local zzso zzso success rates of 75 and zzso were zzso considering only the top ranked binding mode, or the five top binding zzso zzso
