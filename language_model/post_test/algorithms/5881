This paper is concerned with the derivation of a progression of zzso image zzso First, we show that adopting certain assumptions about lights and cameras leads to a zzso zzso image representation which is zzso zzso at each image zzso We show that as a consequence, images represented in this form are zzso We then extend this zzso representation to an equivalent zzso zzso zzso We show that in this zzso zzso it is possible to zzso all the image zzso in the same way, effectively zzso a zzso image representation which is additionally zzso Finally, we show how to recover a zzso full color zzso image representation by first (with the help of the zzso zzso identifying shadow zzso We then remove shadow edges from the zzso of the original image by edge zzso and we propose a method to zzso this zzso edge map, thus zzso the sought-after zzso zzso zzso
