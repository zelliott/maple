A fundamental problem arising in the evolutionary molecular biology is to discover the locations of gene zzso and multiple gene zzso episodes based on the zzso zzso The solutions to the zzso zzso zzso problems can provide useful clues to place the gene zzso events onto the locations of a species tree and to expose the multiple gene zzso zzso In this paper, we study two variations of the zzso zzso zzso problems: the zzso zzso problem and the zzso zzso zzso zzso For the zzso problem, we improve the results of zzso et zzso with an optimal zzso zzso For the ME problem, on the basis of the zzso presented by zzso and zzso we propose an optimal zzso zzso
