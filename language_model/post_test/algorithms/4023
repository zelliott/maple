We developed a zzso method to zzso and zzso characterize the dynamics of brain zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso The method, called envelope spatial zzso independent component analysis zzso zzso the spatial and spectral zzso of zzso energies of a zzso constrained source current zzso We compared this method using a simulated data set against 5 other zzso of independent component analysis and found that zzso performed on par with its zzso zzso zzso and better than other zzso zzso in characterizing dynamics at time scales of the order of zzso We then applied zzso to real zzso data obtained from 9 subjects during zzso The method identified several networks showing zzso and zzso zzso functional connectivity profiles which resemble previously reported zzso networks, such as the bilateral zzso network at zzso the lateral and zzso zzso sources at zzso a subset of the zzso network at zzso and zzso and zzso zzso lobe sources at zzso Finally, we interpreted the estimated networks as zzso filters and applied the filters to obtain the dynamics during a natural stimulus sequence presented to the same 9 zzso We observed zzso alpha zzso to visual zzso bilateral zzso zzso zzso to tactile stimuli and video clips of hands, and the zzso lobe network zzso to speech zzso but no zzso of the sources in the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso the proposed method robustly detects zzso zzso networks at long time zzso zzso the functional relevance of the zzso networks can be zzso by applying the obtained zzso filters to data from zzso with controlled external zzso
