zzso in the zzso zzso volume fraction zzso such as diffuse or focal zzso zzso or zzso are hallmarks of heart zzso zzso zzso changes are difficult to assess or zzso with cardiovascular magnetic resonance zzso using conventional late zzso enhancement zzso or zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso measurement zzso factors that confound zzso images or zzso and has been shown to correlate well with diffuse zzso zzso The goal of this study was to develop and evaluate an automated method for producing a zzso map of zzso that would be adequately robust for clinical work zzso 

zzso maps were automatically generated from zzso acquired zzso and zzso zzso by blood zzso The zzso incorporates correction of respiratory motion that occurs due to insufficient zzso and due to zzso between zzso as well as automated identification of the blood zzso Images were visually scored on a zzso scale from zzso zzso to excellent zzso 

The quality score of zzso maps was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scored for zzso maps from 338 patients with zzso either excellent or zzso zzso of the zzso zzso images improved the image quality for zzso maps in zzso of the zzso zzso of normal zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using motion correction and zzso values and was zzso zzso zzso without motion correction and zzso 

zzso automated motion correction and zzso of zzso significantly improve the quality of zzso zzso thus making the generation of zzso feasible for clinical work zzso
