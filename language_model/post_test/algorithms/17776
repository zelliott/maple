The present paper reports the zzso of the zzso and basic zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso solution to better understand their relevance for the structure of zzso proteins and protein segments and for a variety of protein binding zzso The determination of the zzso angles of the central zzso acid zzso was achieved by analyzing the zzso I band profile of the respective polarized visible zzso zzso transform infrared zzso and zzso circular zzso zzso zzso by means of recently developed zzso zzso zzso (2002) zzso zzso 83, zzso zzso et zzso (2002) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results were validated by measuring the zzso electronic circular zzso zzso zzso of the zzso The analyses revealed that a zzso zzso zzso is zzso at room zzso For zzso and zzso the zzso angles of zzso zzso zzso degrees, zzso zzso 165 degrees and zzso zzso zzso degrees, zzso zzso 160 degrees were zzso zzso A similar zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso degrees, zzso zzso 170 degrees, was obtained for zzso which is at zzso with the earlier reported left-handed turn zzso The zzso spectrum of charged zzso displayed zzso negative and positive zzso at 190 and 210 zzso which are interpreted as indicating a zzso zzso zzso II zzso in agreement with the obtained zzso zzso zzso with literature data shows that the investigated zzso are ideal model systems for understanding the local zzso of functionally relevant zzso zzso zzso and D3 segments in a variety of different zzso
