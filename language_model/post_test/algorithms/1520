A zzso detection zzso for cerebral studies, using the method of zzso has been implemented on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It is based on the zzso by threshold of the brain edge in the zzso and does not depend on the reconstruction zzso Thirteen normal subjects underwent an examination on both zzso zzso zzso and zzso using a head holder to ensure the zzso of the zzso The CT scan zzso of the brain was drawn manually according to the brain zzso zzso The zzso brain zzso was obtained by use of the zzso zzso after the threshold had been determined on an active zzso zzso Using a threshold of 37% of the maximum zzso the length of the zzso as well as the area obtained with zzso and CT were not found to be statistically zzso The method of zzso which is simpler and faster then previous methods, provides contours which zzso very well with CT scan zzso Application to patients with unilateral pathological defects is possible by requiring that the zzso is zzso
