zzso to zzso mobility mass zzso zzso is the ability to provide collision cross section zzso data and the capacity to delineate any zzso and/or unfolding of protein zzso The strong correlation of the zzso determined zzso with theory is indicative of the retention of native structure in the gas phase, which in turn, qualifies as a means in evaluating the zzso zzso The assessment of zzso data, however, is currently zzso due to the lack of appropriate structural coordinates to use as input in the in zzso calculation of zzso To address this issue, this study involves the use of rapid protein zzso predictor zzso to generate zzso structures of closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and, zzso zzso these models to estimate the theoretical zzso Experimental zzso of both the model proteins and zzso correlate well with theory generated by zzso All zzso for zzso zzso zzso of zzso fall within theoretical zzso Of the four zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso appears to adopt an extended zzso while zzso gradually zzso and the extended structures of zzso and zzso increase in abundance upon zzso Combining zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso enables us to interrogate the zzso of zzso proteins with very similar zzso zzso
