We study the dynamics of networks of zzso zzso bursting zzso Linear analysis allows us to understand how the patterns of bursting are determined by network zzso and how they depend on the strength of synaptic connections, when zzso is zzso Two kinds of patterns are found depending on the symmetry of the zzso slow zzso patterns riding on zzso zzso where almost all zzso contribute bursts in a sparse manner and fast patterns of bursts in which only one of two mutually exclusive groups of zzso take zzso We also discuss the properties of the zzso model that zzso the described phenomena, comment on the limitations of the technique of analysis, and point to some possible ways to overcome zzso
