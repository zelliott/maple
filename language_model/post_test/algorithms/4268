Modern biomedical and zzso studies often measure hundreds or thousands of zzso such as gene expression or zzso zzso Although there is an extensive statistical literature on adjusting for zzso zzso when testing whether these zzso are directly associated with a disease, testing whether they are biological zzso between a known risk factor and a disease requires a more complex zzso hypothesis, thus offering additional zzso zzso 

We propose a zzso approach that tests multiple putative zzso and controls the family wise error zzso We demonstrate that, unlike when testing direct associations, replacing the zzso correction with a zzso approach that focuses on the maximum of the test statistics can significantly improve the power to detect zzso even when all zzso are zzso Through simulations, we show the power of our method is zzso larger than the power achieved by zzso zzso Finally, we apply our zzso test to a zzso study of dietary risk factors and zzso zzso to show that, of 149 test zzso zzso is a possible zzso between fish consumption and decreased zzso zzso zzso
