We present and analyze a model for the dynamics of the interactions between a pathogen and its zzso immune zzso The model consists of two differential zzso one for pathogen load, the other one for an index of specific zzso zzso from other simple models in the literature, this model zzso according to the zzso or zzso zzso values, or to the initial infection size, a rich repertoire of zzso immediate clearing of the pathogen through zzso immune zzso or acute infection followed by clearing of the pathogen through specific immune zzso or uncontrolled zzso or acute infection followed by convergence to a stable state of chronic zzso or periodic solutions with intermittent acute zzso The model can also mimic some features of immune response after zzso This model could be a basis on which to build epidemic models including zzso zzso
