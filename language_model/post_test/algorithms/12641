In this paper, a class of impulsive zzso neural networks with discrete and distributed zzso delays is zzso Several new sufficient conditions are obtained ensuring the existence, uniqueness, and global exponential stability of periodic solution zzso stationary zzso for the addressed models based on inequality analysis zzso The obtained results can be checked easily by the linear zzso inequality control zzso in zzso Finally, two zzso examples are given to show the effectiveness of our zzso
