Secondary structure predictions based on the properties of individual zzso and sometimes on local zzso usually fail to exceed zzso zzso zzso zzso long-range interactions seem to be a significant cause of this zzso 

In this paper, we apply approaches to zzso highly interacting zzso and clusters of zzso involved in multiple zzso zzso and test various secondary structure predictions on this separate subset to assess the effect of long-range interactions on the prediction zzso It was found that only a marginal part of the failure of secondary structure predictions results from the presence of long-range zzso Alternative possibilities are also zzso
