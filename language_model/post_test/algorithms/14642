We present an approach for constructing zzso empirical zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso We employ zzso basis functions and skew zzso basis functions for constructing a model using data that are potentially scattered or zzso The zzso zzso zzso adding a new function at each step to refine the zzso The placement of the functions is driven by a statistical hypothesis test that accounts for correlation in the zzso range zzso The test is applied on training and validation data and reveals zzso or geometric structure when it zzso At each step, the added function is fit to data contained in a zzso defined local region to determine the zzso particular, the scale of the local zzso The scale of the function is determined by the zero crossings of the zzso function of the zzso The model parameters and the number of basis functions are determined automatically from the given data, and there is no need to zzso any ad hoc parameters save for the selection of the skew zzso basis zzso zzso supported skew zzso basis functions are employed to improve model zzso order, and convergence zzso The extension of the zzso to zzso ranges produces zzso models by exploiting the existence of correlation in the range variable zzso zzso is tested not just in a single time series but between all pairs of time zzso We illustrate the new zzso using several illustrative problems, including modeling data on zzso and the prediction of chaotic time zzso
