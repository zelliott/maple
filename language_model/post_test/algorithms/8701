A method is discussed for DNA or protein sequence comparison using a finite field fast zzso zzso a digital signal processing zzso and statistical methods are discussed for analyzing the output of this zzso This method compares two sequences of length N in computing time zzso to N log N compared to zzso for methods currently zzso This method makes it feasible to compare very long zzso An example is given to show that the method correctly identifies sites of known zzso
