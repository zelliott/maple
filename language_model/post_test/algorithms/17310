The aim of this study was to assess the results of treatment zzso alone or surgery and zzso zzso for zzso cervical zzso and to determine the morbidity associated with zzso zzso A subset of these patients zzso zzso 10) was zzso zzso for tumor related negative zzso factors only and this retrospective analysis was also performed to determine if this decision was right and if the selection for this treatment was based on the right zzso 

From 1984 to 1996, 233 women underwent radical zzso as primary treatment of stage I or zzso cervical zzso One hundred and zzso patients were treated with surgery alone zzso and 77 patients zzso received zzso zzso for zzso tumor related negative zzso factors: the combination zzso tumor size zzso or zzso 40 zzso and poor differentiation grade or the combination tumor size zzso or zzso 40 zzso and depth of invasion zzso or zzso 15 zzso zzso zzso 10), or zzso positive surgical margins zzso zzso 17), and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso involvement zzso zzso zzso 

For the entire group the most important zzso factor for survival and disease free survival was zzso zzso Additional factors were depth of invasion and positive surgical zzso Thirty-five patients recurred of which 12 after surgery zzso In all these cases the zzso was in the pelvis zzso Of the 23 zzso after surgery and zzso zzso 13 were seen in the pelvis zzso zzso zzso zzso All patients with negative zzso factors and zzso received zzso zzso zzso zzso 10) and none of these patients zzso The zzso of severe gastrointestinal radiation related side effects was low zzso The zzso of zzso of the leg was zzso which was similar in the surgery alone zzso 

The relatively low percentage of radiation related side effects together with zzso recurrence in a zzso of zzso negative patients with high risk of zzso and a relatively low percentage of recurrence in the surgery alone group lead us to the conclusion that zzso zzso in special zzso of zzso negative patients is zzso
