Both image textures and procedural textures suffer from zzso zzso however, unlike image zzso there is no good automatic method to zzso procedural zzso Given a procedural texture on a surface, we present a method that automatically creates an zzso version of the procedural zzso The new procedural texture maintains the original zzso details, but reduces zzso zzso zzso This new zzso creates a pyramid similar to zzso to represent the zzso Instead of storing zzso color, our texture hierarchy stores weighted sums of zzso functions, allowing a wider range of effects to be zzso The stored zzso functions are automatically selected based on an analysis of the different zzso found over the zzso When the texture is viewed at close range, the original texture is used, but as the texture footprint grows, the zzso gradually replaces the zzso result with an zzso zzso
