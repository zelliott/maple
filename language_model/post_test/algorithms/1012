zzso zzso zzso compounds formed in the cooking of certain foods have been shown to be bacterial zzso and animal zzso and may be a risk factor for human zzso To help explain the variation observed in zzso formation under different cooking conditions, we have performed zzso simulations and experiments on the zzso of beef zzso The simulations involve modeling the heat flow within a meat patty using zzso derived zzso transport zzso for the zzso The predicted temperature profiles are used to integrate the zzso rate equation to estimate the concentration of zzso formed in the zzso We find that our simulations accurately model zzso determined temperature profiles, cooking times, zzso spatial zzso and total zzso formation in zzso that are flipped once during the zzso zzso For zzso flipped every 60 zzso the simulations zzso agree with experiment in predicting reduced cooking times and zzso formation relative to the zzso zzso However, the simulations overestimate the effect of rapid flipping on cooking times and underestimate the effect of flipping on total zzso zzso These results suggest that the dramatic reductions in zzso formation due to rapid flipping may be due to factors other than the heating process or that there is a critical feature of the flipping process that is not captured in our zzso
