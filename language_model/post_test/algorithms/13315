An zzso is presented to maintain rigid structures in zzso based zzso molecular dynamics zzso zzso After each zzso MD step, the coordinates of selected particles are corrected to maintain rigid structures through an zzso procedure of rotation zzso zzso This algorithm, named as SHAPE and implemented in zzso program suite, avoids the calculations of zzso zzso so that the complexity of zzso does not increase with the number of particles in a rigid zzso The zzso of this zzso does not require significant modification of propagation zzso and can be plugged into any zzso based MD integration zzso A unique feature of the SHAPE method is that it is interchangeable with zzso for any object that can be constrained as a rigid structure using multiple zzso zzso Unlike zzso the SHAPE method can be applied to large linear (with three or more zzso and zzso (with four or more zzso rigid zzso zzso tests with four model systems including two proteins demonstrate that the accuracy and reliability of the SHAPE method are comparable to the zzso method, but with much more zzso and zzso
