Automatic contextual zzso zzso were developed to zzso identify bone compartments in zzso images of zzso zzso and zzso Principal advantages of this approach over existing techniques such as zzso are as zzso zzso the zzso can be implemented in a fast, uniform, zzso manner across many images, allowing unbiased comparisons of therapeutic zzso zzso much larger volumes in the region of interest can be analyzed to derive true zzso parameters for zzso and cortical bone zzso and zzso zzso can be used to zzso bone effects zzso in zzso An automatic contextual zzso zzso was used to analyze over 600 scans of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from studies with zzso zzso zzso and precision analyses were performed, and correlation to zzso parameters showed that zzso zzso bone density zzso to zzso with r zzso zzso while zzso zzso to zzso with r zzso zzso In other words, zzso zzso as well to zzso as zzso does to zzso We conclude that the developed automatic zzso zzso provides fast, precise, and objective zzso of bone compartments that are highly correlated with zzso zzso
