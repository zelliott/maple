A zzso is continuous space curve with continuous zzso frame that consists of a sequence of connected zzso zzso The main result of this paper is that given zzso points in space, there exist infinitely many zzso passing through these zzso These zzso are by construction continuous with continuous derivatives and are completely specified by zzso numbers, zzso the initial position, the signed zzso zzso and length of each zzso zzso zzso can be zzso by the arc length and easily expressed in terms of product of zzso
