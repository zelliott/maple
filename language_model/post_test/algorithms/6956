zzso zzso includes differential gene expression zzso profiling of drug responses in model systems to generate a set of zzso modulated zzso genes which can serve as a surrogate measure for drug zzso In this manner, expression zzso bridges the fields of zzso and medicinal zzso Additionally, modulated genes can be organized into zzso and signaling pathways that highlight the mechanism of drug activity in a selected zzso Here, we describe the application of expression zzso to characterize a drug response in the clinically relevant in zzso model, the zzso zzso Following oral dosing of rats with zzso a novel synthetic zzso zzso activated zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso indicated for zzso disorders, we applied zzso a differential zzso transcript profiling technique, to rat liver zzso Following zzso treatment, zzso of the rat liver genes were zzso zzso We confirmed the sequence identity of 50 distinctly modulated zzso zzso was observed among genes representative of at least six discrete zzso zzso Furthermore, we observed zzso of 20 genes involved in zzso zzso and zzso fatty acid zzso consistent with molecular biological and clinical data indicating zzso alpha zzso principal efficacy to be through increasing fatty acid zzso Those pathways regulated in our study that are potentially zzso to target effect, zzso adverse effects, or of unknown consequence include zzso zzso and steroid zzso Finally, comprehensive drug response profiling can lead to the serendipitous discovery of novel disease zzso In this case, these results suggest a potential novel indication for zzso in the treatment of zzso zzso We have zzso therefore, that the organization of zzso results into zzso and signaling pathways can zzso mechanisms of zzso desired zzso zzso and, where appropriate, zzso zzso potentially zzso zzso
