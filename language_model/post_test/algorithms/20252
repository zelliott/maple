We assessed the accuracy and ease of use of the zzso zzso zzso portable zzso zzso volume measurement device in a geriatric zzso zzso The Geriatric zzso Clinic nurse and physician each made 73 zzso on 36 zzso Although the correlation zzso between the true and ultrasound zzso were highly significant the mean differences were significantly different from zzso We suggest that, rather than considering the correlation zzso the accuracy required of the device should be described by a function of estimated versus true zzso zzso This function should vary depending on each particular decision-making process in which the estimate of volume is to be zzso This instrument automatically estimates zzso volume once the user has completed the image creation and selection part of the zzso The users in this study had difficulties with this imaging zzso zzso ways in which the zzso automated signal processing and volume calculation zzso could be improved became evident during this study and are zzso
