zzso zzso zzso offer a unique opportunity to isolate and study zzso modes concentrated on zzso marginally unstable periodic zzso Here we show that the openness of the cavity to external electromagnetic fields leads to unanticipated consequences for the zzso radiation pattern, including directional zzso This is zzso by interactions of marginally unstable periodic orbits with chaotic zzso We also show that the zzso modes are robust against zzso to the shape of the zzso despite the lack of structural stability of the corresponding classical zzso
