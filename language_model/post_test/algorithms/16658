We report a zzso straightforward witness that zzso coherent electronic zzso from their zzso counterparts in zzso optical zzso of molecular zzso zzso zzso as a function of waiting time in broadband zzso probe zzso zzso to coherent electronic zzso in the zzso excited zzso zzso in individual zzso of zzso electronic zzso do not necessarily yield this zzso Our witness is simpler to implement than quantum process zzso and potentially resolves a long-standing controversy on the character of zzso in zzso zzso of zzso light harvesting zzso
