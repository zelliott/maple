We report that decreasing zzso length in zzso zzso zzso zzso with internal zzso increases zzso channel stability by three orders of zzso reduces binding activity by four orders of zzso and reduces zzso activity up to zzso These results are further used to evaluate methods employed to characterize zzso and activity of synthetic zzso pores formed by zzso zzso with emphasis on zzso of the zzso model to determine internal diameters and the zzso equation to locate internal active zzso
