Transformation of zzso records that undergo sequential selection can be used with zzso zzso to maximize the restricted likelihood in zzso of zzso zzso as with zzso zzso Data transformation with appropriate parts of the zzso decomposition of the current estimate of the residual zzso zzso results in zzso equations that are easily modified from round to round for calculation of the zzso of the zzso The residual sum of squares is the same for transformed and zzso zzso Most importantly, the zzso of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is an easily determined function of the zzso decomposition of the residual zzso zzso and the zzso of the transformed zzso zzso Thus, the zzso of the likelihood for any combination of zzso zzso can be determined from the transformed zzso zzso of transformation are 1) the zzso zzso equations are easy to set up, 2) the least squares part of the equations does not change from round to round, 3) right-hand sides change from round to round by constant zzso and 4) less memory is zzso An example showed only a slight advantage of the transformation compared with no transformation in terms of solution time for each round (1 to zzso
