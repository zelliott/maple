This paper addresses the problem of detecting axes of bilateral symmetry in zzso In order to achieve zzso to variation in zzso only zzso information is zzso To overcome the problem of edge breaks, a potential field is developed from the edge map which spreads the information in the image zzso zzso of points in the image plane are made to vote for their axes of symmetry with some confidence zzso To make the method robust to overlapping objects, only local features in the form of Taylor zzso are used for zzso zzso We define an axis of symmetry zzso which is used to accumulate the weighted votes for all possible axes of zzso To reduce the zzso complexity of voting, a hashing scheme is proposed, wherein pairs of points, whose potential fields are too zzso are pruned by not being counted for the zzso Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is fairly robust to edge breaks and is able to detect zzso even when only zzso of the possible pairs are used for zzso
