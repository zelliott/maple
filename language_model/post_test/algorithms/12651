The existing approaches to the zzso and zzso of neural networks rely on the strictly zzso zzso of zzso or require constant zzso zzso For periodically oscillated zzso neural networks zzso it is difficult to discuss zzso dynamics when the connection weights are periodically oscillated around zzso By using transient zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso we develop an approach to investigate zzso and zzso of periodically oscillated zzso with zzso and distributed zzso It shows that, under some new criteria, there exist zzso results of periodic solutions which are locally or globally zzso zzso Computer zzso simulations are performed to illustrate the new zzso
