We evaluated the zzso values of first zzso zzso for prediction of delivery date by computing new dating formulas and evaluating them within the same settings in a large zzso 

We studied zzso zzso undergoing first zzso ultrasound examination by a single experimented zzso We used 331 zzso conceived by assisted zzso treatment to build a new dating formula and another zzso normal zzso with spontaneous delivery to test the accuracy of these zzso and zzso The zzso of the two zzso which performed best was zzso 

zzso length zzso had the lowest random and systematic zzso The mean zzso of errors in predicting day of delivery were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso diameter zzso head circumference zzso and abdominal circumference zzso zzso zzso and zzso proved to be highly zzso The percentages of deliveries within zzso and zzso days of the predicted term were comparable for zzso and zzso but were significantly smaller when using zzso zzso 

Both zzso and zzso proved to be highly zzso and able to predict with good precision the date of zzso However, zzso has significantly lower random and systematic errors than all other zzso zzso
