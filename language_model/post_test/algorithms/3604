The life span of a total hip zzso is one of the main points on which the long-term success of zzso zzso It is, by now, widely recognized that hip zzso failure is mainly due to the zzso loosening resulting from the presence of wear debris forming at the contact interface between the zzso head and the cup of the zzso The size of these particles varies from a few zzso to some tens of zzso or zzso The main aim of this study was therefore to investigate the formation of debris in the microscopic size zzso For this purpose, a zzso study was carried out on various mechanisms leading to plastic zzso which can lead to damage and wear in zzso zzso analyses were performed with a laboratory software program zzso on the evolution of the plastic strains involved in various wear mechanisms on the microscopic zzso
