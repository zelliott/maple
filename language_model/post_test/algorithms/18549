zzso mixed effects models have become important tools for growth and yield modeling in zzso To date, applications have concentrated on modeling single growth variables such as tree height or zzso zzso Here, we propose zzso zzso zzso mixed effects models for describing several zzso zzso quantity characteristics zzso We describe how such models can be used to produce future predictions of zzso volume zzso The class of models and methods of zzso and prediction are developed and then illustrated on data from a University of Georgia study of the effects of various site preparation methods on the growth of slash pine zzso zzso zzso
