zzso learning has attracted a significant amount of attention in pattern recognition and machine zzso Most previous studies have focused on designing special zzso to effectively exploit the zzso data in conjunction with labeled zzso Our goal is to improve the zzso accuracy of any given supervised learning zzso by using the available zzso zzso We call this as the zzso improvement problem, to distinguish the proposed approach from the existing zzso We design a zzso learning zzso that wraps around the underlying supervised zzso and improves its performance using zzso zzso This problem is particularly important when we need to train a supervised learning zzso with a limited number of labeled examples and a multitude of zzso zzso We present a boosting framework for zzso learning, termed as zzso The key advantages of the proposed zzso learning approach are: 1) performance improvement of any supervised learning zzso with a multitude of zzso data, 2) efficient zzso by the zzso boosting algorithm, and 3) exploiting both zzso and cluster assumption in training zzso zzso An empirical study on 16 different data sets and text categorization demonstrates that the proposed framework improves the performance of several commonly used supervised learning zzso given a large number of zzso zzso We also show that the performance of the proposed algorithm, zzso is comparable to the state-of-the-art zzso learning zzso
