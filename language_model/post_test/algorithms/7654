This paper proposes a method for aligning image volumes acquired from different imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso based on zzso zzso image zzso A novel method for zzso zzso feature geometry and appearance is developed, based on the assumption of locally linear intensity zzso providing a solution to poor zzso of feature detection in different image zzso The zzso method is incorporated into a zzso zzso model for zzso image zzso The model parameters are estimated via a zzso alignment algorithm, that zzso zzso between zzso a zzso model from feature data, then realigning feature data to the model, zzso to a stable alignment solution with few zzso or zzso zzso The resulting model can be used to align zzso image data with the benefits of zzso feature zzso globally optimal solutions, high efficiency and low memory zzso The method is tested on the difficult zzso data set of CT, zzso zzso zzso and zzso brain images of subjects exhibiting significant zzso zzso due to zzso
