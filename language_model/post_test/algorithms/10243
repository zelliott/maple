This study presents a straightforward approach to zzso zzso detection and explores its advantages and future zzso A straightforward zzso zzso detection zzso scheme was developed that consisted of colon wall zzso a zzso zzso zzso and the counting and zzso of cluster volume zzso 65 patients had undergone the zzso cleaning scheme without zzso tagging and the optical zzso zzso and CT zzso zzso were zzso The zzso sizes determined by OC were used as reference zzso The zzso zzso with 103 zzso were divided into training and test zzso After tuning for the optimal zzso settings, the zzso sensitivities of the developed zzso scheme for clinically relevant zzso zzso 6 zzso were zzso at zzso false zzso zzso using the training zzso and zzso at zzso zzso using the test zzso The developed zzso scheme was found to have a relatively high detection performance, easily zzso zzso settings, and an easily understood internal zzso
