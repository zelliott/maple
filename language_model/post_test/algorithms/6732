The complexity of biological systems provides for a great diversity of relationships between zzso The current analysis of zzso expression data focuses on relationships based on global correlation over a whole zzso identifying clusters of genes whose expression levels simultaneously rise and zzso There are, of course, other potential relationships between zzso which are missed by such global zzso These include zzso where one expects a zzso between related expression profiles, and zzso where one expects an zzso zzso Here, we propose a new method, which we call local zzso for identifying these zzso and zzso zzso It is related to conventional zzso zzso in a fashion analogous to the way local sequence alignment (the zzso zzso is derived from global alignment zzso An integral part of our method is the use of random score zzso to assess the statistical significance of each zzso We applied our method to the zzso zzso expression zzso and were able to detect a considerable number of additional biological relationships between zzso beyond those resulting from conventional zzso We related these new relationships between genes to their similarity in function (as determined from the zzso zzso or their having known zzso interactions (as determined from the large-scale zzso zzso we found that genes strongly related by local zzso were considerably more likely than random to have a known interaction or a similar cellular zzso This suggests that local zzso may be useful in functional zzso of zzso zzso We examined many of the new relationships in zzso Some of them were already well-documented examples of zzso or zzso which provide corroboration for our zzso For instance, we found an zzso expression profile relationship between genes zzso and zzso where the latter has been zzso documented as a bypass zzso of the zzso We also found new relationships involving zzso zzso genes and were able to suggest functions for many of zzso In particular, we found a zzso expression relationship between zzso (which has not yet been functionally zzso and four genes associated with the zzso This suggests that zzso may be involved in the control or zzso of zzso zzso We have also looked at other, less extensive zzso than the zzso zzso and found further interesting zzso Our zzso program and a detailed zzso of zzso results is available at zzso (or zzso
