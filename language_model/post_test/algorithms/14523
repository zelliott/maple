zzso and zzso can coexist in ecological public goods zzso When the game is played in two-dimensional continuous space, a reaction diffusion model produces highly irregular zzso in which zzso and zzso survive in ever-changing zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso dynamics of ecological public zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The dynamics is related to the formation of Turing patterns, but the origin of the irregular dynamics is not well zzso In this paper, we present a zzso of the zzso dynamics based on the zzso zzso which reveals that the spontaneous pattern formation can be attributed to the zzso interplay between two zzso unstable modes: zzso instability arising from a zzso and spatial instability arising from a zzso Moreover, we provide a detailed analysis of the highly irregular dynamics through zzso analysis, the zzso of zzso the maximum zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso All results clearly support that the observed irregular dynamics qualifies as zzso zzso A particularly interesting type of chaotic zzso which we call intermittent zzso clearly demonstrates the effects of the two unstable modes where zzso periods of stasis alternate with rapid changes that may induce local zzso
