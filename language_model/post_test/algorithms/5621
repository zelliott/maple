The extraction of zzso energy from a spinning black hole via the zzso mechanism has long been understood as an important component in models to explain energetic jets from compact zzso zzso Here we show more generally that the kinetic energy of the black hole, both zzso and zzso can be tapped, thereby producing even more luminous jets powered by the interaction of the black hole with its surrounding zzso We study the resulting zzso jet that arises from single zzso black holes and zzso black hole zzso In the latter case, we find that increasing the zzso angular zzso of the system and/or the spins of the individual black holes results in an enhanced zzso zzso
