A broad spectrum of techniques for zzso zzso data zzso have been proposed during the last three zzso Such techniques have been vital in reducing the digital zzso data volume for storage and zzso These techniques are essential to a wide variety of applications ranging from diagnostic to ambulatory zzso Due to the diverse procedures that have been zzso comparison of zzso zzso methods is a major zzso Present evaluation methods zzso any direct comparison among existing zzso zzso zzso The main purpose of this paper is to address this issue and to establish a unified view of zzso zzso zzso zzso data zzso schemes are presented in two major groups: direct data zzso and transformation zzso The direct data zzso techniques are: zzso differential pulse code zzso and zzso coding, zzso zzso zzso Fan and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The transformation methods briefly zzso include: zzso Walsh, and zzso zzso The theoretical basis behind the direct zzso data zzso schemes are presented and classified into three zzso zzso zzso differential pulse code zzso zzso and zzso coding zzso The paper concludes with the presentation of a framework for evaluation and comparison of zzso zzso zzso
