zzso zzso has been widely used to segment various anatomical zzso The success of this technique partly relies on the selection of zzso that are best mapped to a new target image after zzso Recently, zzso learning has been proposed as a method for zzso zzso Each zzso learning technique seeks to zzso a unique objective zzso zzso different techniques produce different zzso even when applied to the same data zzso Previous studies used a single technique in their method and gave no reason for the choice of the zzso learning technique employed nor the theoretical grounds for the choice of the zzso zzso In this study, we compare side-by-side the results given by 3 zzso learning techniques zzso zzso zzso and zzso Linear zzso on the same data zzso We assess the ability of those 3 different techniques to select the best zzso to combine in the framework of zzso zzso First, a zzso experiment is used to zzso our method on a set of 110 manually segmented zzso of zzso and find the zzso learning technique and associated zzso parameters that give the best zzso zzso Then, the optimal parameters are used to automatically segment 30 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease zzso Initiative zzso For our zzso the selection of zzso with zzso Linear zzso gives the best zzso Our findings show that selection of zzso with zzso learning leads to zzso accuracy close to or significantly higher than the state-of-the-art method and that accuracy can be increased by fine tuning the zzso learning zzso
