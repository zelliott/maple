zzso states of the underwater light field were measured by a zzso and zzso zzso and a video zzso under various zzso surface, and water conditions, as well as solar and viewing zzso in clear oceanic waters near Port zzso zzso Some of the first comprehensive comparisons were made between the measured polarized light, including the degree and angle of linear polarization and linear zzso parameters zzso and U), and those from zzso Carlo simulations that used zzso measured water inherent optical properties and particle volume scattering functions as zzso For selected zzso in the visible spectrum, measured and zzso polarization characteristics were found to be consistent in most zzso Measured degree and angle of linear polarization are found to be largely determined by an zzso zzso zzso Model simulations suggest that the degree of linear polarization zzso at horizontal viewing directions is highly dependent on the viewing zzso angle for a low solar zzso This implies that animals can use the zzso signal for zzso
