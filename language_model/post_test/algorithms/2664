This paper studies the problem of 3-D zzso texture discrimination for discrete 3-D textures that are zzso homogeneous by modeling them as stationary zzso random zzso The latter property and our zzso of a 3-D rigid motion of a texture reduce the problem to the study of 3-D zzso of discrete zzso We formally develop the concept of 3-D texture zzso in the 3-D digital zzso We use this novel concept to define a zzso between 3-D textures that remains zzso under all 3-D rigid motions of the zzso This concept of zzso can be used for a zzso or a zzso 3-D zzso testing of the statistical similarity of the 3-D zzso To zzso the zzso between any two zzso zzso and zzso of two given 3-D zzso we use the zzso divergence between 3-D zzso zzso random fields fitted to the rotated texture zzso Then, the 3-D zzso texture distance is the integral average, with respect to the zzso measure of the group zzso of all of these zzso when zzso zzso and zzso vary throughout zzso We also present an zzso enabling the zzso of the proposed 3-D zzso texture distance as well as rules for 3-D zzso texture zzso and experimental results demonstrating the capabilities of the proposed 3-D zzso texture discrimination rules when applied in a zzso setting, even on very general 3-D texture zzso
