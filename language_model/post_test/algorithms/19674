The relation existing between support zzso machines zzso and zzso zzso memories is zzso The design of zzso memories based on the generalized zzso zzso neural model is formulated as a set of independent zzso tasks which can be efficiently solved by standard software packages for zzso zzso Some properties of the networks designed in this way are zzso like the fact that surprisingly they follow a generalized zzso zzso The performance of the zzso approach is compared to existing methods with zzso connections, by some design zzso
