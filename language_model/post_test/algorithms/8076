The purpose of this study was to zzso the zzso features of zzso right zzso zzso zzso The second objective was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the standard and newly proposed diagnostic zzso markers in the presence of a right zzso block zzso 

One hundred patients with zzso zzso zzso aged zzso zzso and 57 controls (21 zzso aged zzso zzso were zzso Among the 100 patients with zzso a complete zzso was present in 17 patients, and 15 patients had an incomplete zzso zzso inversion through zzso demonstrated optimal sensitivity and specificity in both zzso patients without a complete zzso or incomplete zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso zzso and in zzso patients with incomplete zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso zzso Between zzso patients and controls with a complete zzso the only 2 parameters that differed were the prevalence of zzso inversion through zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso and an zzso ratio in zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso In zzso patients with complete zzso the most sensitive and specific zzso was an zzso ratio zzso 

We evaluated zzso the diagnostic value of zzso markers for zzso On the basis of the findings, we propose an algorithm, with examination of zzso zzso being the first step, for zzso evaluation of zzso zzso zzso criteria are then applied on the basis of the presence of no zzso incomplete zzso and complete zzso to obtain the best diagnostic utility of the zzso
