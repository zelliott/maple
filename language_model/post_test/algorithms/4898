This paper provides a general simulation study on zzso based on a modular zzso zzso It focuses on the peripheral zzso It is known that the zzso zzso in the peripheral nervous system have influences on the zzso A zzso model with several zzso zzso is developed to explore the dynamics of zzso The muscle model is derived from a zzso muscle zzso The zzso zzso include the zzso organ, zzso zzso organ, and Renshaw zzso Their effects are investigated zzso in zzso A zzso zzso system with interaction is further zzso Moreover, a model in combination with the central zzso and peripheral system is zzso Some results are in accordance with the previous research, whereas some new findings are proposed according to the simulation zzso
