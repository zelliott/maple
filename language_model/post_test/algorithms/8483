Use of electrical zzso zzso zzso to image the breasts of women with both normal and abnormal conditions requires the ability to deliver a consistent and zzso zzso To investigate the degree to which our current imaging system can meet this requirement we conducted an initial study of exam zzso The trial involved the imaging of 25 breasts zzso into four separate zzso with increasing levels of zzso placement zzso The degree of complexity ranged from zzso zzso imaging to zzso zzso imaging to zzso zzso zzso Both visual analysis and quantitative comparisons using mean squared difference zzso measures between pairs of zzso and zzso images were zzso A new breast interface with the improved vertical and zzso zzso array positioning capability required to complete this study is zzso Not surprisingly, the results show a dominant trend of increased image zzso with increased zzso placement zzso zzso quantitative levels of image consistency are reported through zzso zzso On average across all zzso zzso zzso for single zzso are well below zzso near zzso for zzso breasts during the same session and approximately zzso for zzso breasts in multiple sessions conducted over zzso Overall, these results suggest that zzso breast exams are consistent provided the zzso placement is well controlled, typically with better than 1 zzso zzso
