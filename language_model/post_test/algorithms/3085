zzso and prion proteins are clinically and biologically important zzso whose zzso structures are difficult to determine by standard experimental or zzso zzso In addition, significant zzso zzso is known or suspected to exist in many zzso zzso Recent work has indicated the utility of zzso zzso statistics in zzso zzso We develop here a new strategy for zzso zzso emphasizing the determination of zzso and pairs of zzso as fundamental units of zzso Our program, zzso zzso likelihood scores for potential zzso and zzso based on correlations observed in parallel zzso The program then determines the strands and pairs with the greatest local likelihood for all of the zzso potential zzso zzso suggests multiple alternate folding patterns and assigns relative a zzso probabilities based solely on zzso acid zzso probability tables, and zzso zzso The zzso compares favorably with the results of previous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso prediction and zzso propensity zzso zzso prediction is demonstrated for zzso determined zzso zzso for a set of known zzso and for the parallel zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is able both to detect zzso with higher sensitivity and to detect the edges of zzso in a richly zzso zzso For two proteins zzso and zzso there exist multiple sets of experimental data zzso contradictory zzso zzso is able to detect each competing structure as a potential structure zzso The ability to correlate multiple alternate zzso to experiment opens the possibility of zzso investigation of prion strains and structural zzso of zzso zzso is publicly accessible on the Web at zzso
