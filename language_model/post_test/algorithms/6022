The three zzso zzso zzso of the zzso disc in true zzso will give essential meaning in clinical zzso It is not only useful for clinicians in the evaluation of the condition of the zzso disc, but it also zzso the pathological diagnosis and disease progression zzso This paper describes a complete 3-D zzso disc reconstruction method from a pair of stereo images by a series of robust procedures including camera zzso image zzso depth recovery, and zzso media optical zzso 

Two registration techniques zzso and feature based zzso are combined together to prune the uncertain matching points in order to improve the overall accuracy of zzso The zzso media within the zzso are lump zzso as a single lens and integrated into the reconstruction process to obtain an accurate 3-D zzso disc zzso 

The recovered 3-D zzso disc images show good consistency and zzso when compared with the results from zzso zzso zzso zzso under clinical zzso with an additional advantage of implementing a more economical and conventional mode of retinal image zzso
