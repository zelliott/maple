We address the effect of spatial scale and zzso variation on model zzso when forming zzso models for fish assignment using a new data mining approach, Random zzso zzso to variable biological markers zzso community zzso Models were implemented for a fish zzso system sampled along the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts of Spain and were validated using independent zzso We considered 2 basic zzso problems in evaluating the importance of variations in zzso zzso for assignment of individual fish to their populations of zzso zzso zzso population models, using 2 seasonal replicates from each of the zzso and zzso task zzso 4 seasonal replicates from 1 Atlantic and 1 Mediterranean population zzso The main results are that zzso zzso are well suited for zzso population assignment using zzso communities in zzso zzso zzso zzso provide an efficient means for model zzso on the baseline data and this allows sample size limitations in zzso tag studies to be tackled zzso zzso the performance of zzso is dependent on the complexity and spatial zzso of the problem; and zzso the development of zzso models is strongly influenced by seasonal change and this stresses the importance of both zzso replication and model validation in zzso tagging zzso
