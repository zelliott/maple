In studies of vitamin E effectiveness in diabetes, there are still controversies surrounding negative zzso and positive experimental zzso However, there is no controversy that zzso vitamin E is zzso from its zzso zzso radical by a network of interacting zzso The network of interacting zzso has only been studied zzso The hypothesis we propose is that a vitamin E zzso system zzso model based on the complex interactions of the zzso provides a rationale for vitamin E supplementation as a therapeutic adjunct in zzso Furthermore, the factors considered prior to the use of Vitamin E as a supplement in diabetes research and therapy, the effectiveness of vitamin E supplementation and the limitations have been identified in the zzso There is no single study of vitamin E supplementation or efficacy that has determined vitamin E levels in combination with all of the zzso that interact to zzso zzso vitamin zzso zzso there is a lack of good evidence for or against vitamin E being unilaterally depleted in the zzso zzso There is also lack of rationale for choice of zzso zzso In essence, the normal conditions for effective zzso activity of vitamin E supplementation have yet to be fully zzso We propose a coherent model of zzso and recommend that zzso status needs to be zzso as part of evidence-based clinical practice to determine whether vitamin E should be recommended for the diabetic zzso We also propose an algorithm, based on the zzso activity and zzso factors, to guide the zzso of a credible hypothesis for clinical trials in assessing the function of vitamin E and treatment zzso The proposed model hinges on pertinent questions that have to be addressed to avoid zzso a clinical trial that has been identified as zzso
