Studies of acoustic zzso in zzso particles can provide fundamental insights into the mechanical properties of materials because it is possible to precisely characterize and control the zzso and geometry of such zzso Metal zzso are of particular interest because they allow the use of zzso laser zzso to generate and probe zzso acoustic zzso which have the potential to be used in a variety of sensing zzso So far, the zzso of these zzso has been dominated by zzso due to variations in zzso zzso Such zzso can be eliminated by performing zzso on single zzso deposited on a zzso but unknown interactions between the zzso and the zzso make it difficult to interpret the results of such zzso Here, we show that the effects of zzso zzso can be reduced by using zzso gold zzso with highly uniform zzso The zzso homogeneous zzso is due to the combination of zzso intrinsic to the zzso and the surrounding zzso the latter is zzso described by a zzso zzso
