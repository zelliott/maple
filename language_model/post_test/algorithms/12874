The accurate mapping of reads that span zzso junctions is a critical component of all zzso techniques that work with zzso zzso We introduce a second generation zzso detection algorithm, zzso whose focus is high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of zzso as well as CPU and memory zzso zzso can be applied to both short zzso zzso and long reads zzso 75 zzso zzso is not dependent on zzso site features or zzso zzso consequently it can detect novel zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso the quality and diversity of read alignments of a given zzso to increase zzso We demonstrate that zzso achieves higher sensitivity and specificity than zzso and zzso on a set of simulated zzso zzso Experimental studies also support the accuracy of the zzso zzso junctions derived from eight breast cancer zzso zzso zzso the zzso of alternative zzso on a global level as well as the differences between molecular zzso of breast zzso These combined results indicate that zzso is a highly accurate zzso for the alignment of zzso reads to zzso zzso Software download zzso zzso
