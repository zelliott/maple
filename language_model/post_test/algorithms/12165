zzso is an zzso approach to software development that relies on strong collaboration and automation to keep pace with dynamic zzso We have successfully used agile development approaches to create and maintain biomedical software, including software for zzso This paper reports on a qualitative study of our experiences using these zzso 

We have found that agile methods are well suited to the exploratory and zzso nature of scientific zzso They provide a robust framework for zzso scientific results and for developing clinical support zzso The agile development approach also provides a model for collaboration between software engineers and zzso We present our experience using agile zzso in projects at six different biomedical software development zzso The organizations include academic, commercial and government development teams, and included both zzso and clinical support zzso We found that agile practices were a match for the needs of our biomedical projects and contributed to the success of our zzso 

We found that the agile development approach was a good fit for our organizations, and that these practices should be zzso and valuable to other biomedical software development zzso Although we found differences in how agile methods were used, we were also able to identify a set of core practices that were common to all of the groups, and that could be a focus for others seeking to adopt these zzso
