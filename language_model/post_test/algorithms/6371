This paper proposes a new method for the design of lifting filters to zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso Our approach is stated in the general case, and is illustrated for the zzso zzso and for the zzso zzso zzso are shown for the zzso database and for satellite images acquired on a zzso sampling zzso The design of efficient zzso filters is a difficult challenge which has already been addressed for specific zzso Our approach enables the design of less expensive filters adapted to the signal statistics to enhance the zzso efficiency in a more general zzso It is based on a zzso lifting scheme and joins the lifting theory with zzso zzso The prediction step is designed in order to minimize the zzso of the zzso and the update step is designed in order to minimize a reconstruction zzso Application for zzso zzso shows the performances of the zzso
