The field of much less invasive zzso aesthetic surgery continues to grow, but consistent and truly objective evaluation of the sometimes comparatively small improvements in the treated skin remains a problem for both clinicians and zzso In this work, we present the development of a zzso modular and zzso platform to allow zzso image zzso sampling extraction and zzso evaluation of tissue features in the zzso field of clinical zzso 

The unique characteristic of the platform is the modular extension of the zzso gallery by the use of extended value added services, which enables the easy incorporation of new image processing procedures to zzso the gallery for specific zzso A novel zzso to evaluate skin wrinkles is also presented as a demonstration of this integration zzso The software platform is designed to evaluate zzso zzso and to identify individual or combined zzso which will more accurately represent differences in skin zzso It is based on a set of zzso zzso clinical expert and computer zzso which build up a constantly expanding tissue zzso By means of this zzso the different tissue qualities of photographic samples can be assessed according to the different positions of the samples in the zzso 

This new platform can be used to generate sensitive and objective comparative measurement not only for diagnostic reports on the zzso condition of samples but also for demonstrating the improvement and efficacy of the prescribed treatment to both the zzso and colleagues and the patient, thereby helping to increase the patient satisfaction zzso
