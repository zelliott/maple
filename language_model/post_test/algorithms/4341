zzso magnetic resonance zzso guided wire zzso is a frequently used tool to target zzso visible breast zzso Different techniques are zzso zzso can be performed using automated software or a manual zzso zzso of this study therefore was to compare manually and automated software assisted wire zzso of suspicious breast zzso regarding to image time and accurate zzso 

60 females with suspicious breast zzso underwent zzso wire zzso In 30 patients a manual target calculation and in another 30 patients a software calculated approach was zzso Time zzso for MR imaging as well as calculation of the target coordinates were zzso zzso size zzso of zzso zzso zzso distance to wire anchor as well as, zzso distance to skin were zzso A zzso was used for statistical zzso 

Total imaging time was shorter for the automated software calculated approach but failed to show a statistical significant difference zzso Time for zzso of the zzso was significantly shorter for the software based method zzso zzso sizes, distances to wire anchor and skin showed no statistically significant zzso 

zzso zzso wire zzso of suspicious zzso that are accessible zzso a manually or automated software generated target calculation can be zzso As MR guided wire zzso of breast zzso needs its time in total, a minimal time consuming approach and therefore an automated software calculated targeting (if zzso should be zzso
