Image zzso for detection of vessel walls is necessary for quantitative assessment of vessel diseases by zzso zzso A new zzso method based on zzso zzso flow zzso snake model is proposed in this zzso The main characteristics of the proposed method include two aspects: one is that zzso filtering is performed on zzso field to reduce the critical points, change the zzso structure of the parallel zzso and extend the capture zzso the other is that balloon snake is combined with the zzso Thus, the improved zzso and balloon snake can be automatically zzso and overcome the problem caused by local energy zzso zzso of 20 in zzso cases validated the accuracy and stability of the zzso method for zzso ultrasound zzso
