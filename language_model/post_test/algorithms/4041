There is abundant evidence that the probability of successful establishment in novel environments increases with number of individuals in founder groups and with number of repeated zzso zzso zzso that the zzso and zzso variation among individuals should also be important, but few studies have examined whether founder diversity influences establishment independent of zzso pressure, nor whether the effect is model or context zzso I zzso the results of 18 experimental studies and report on a zzso that provides strong evidence that higher levels of zzso and zzso diversity in founder groups increase establishment success in plants and zzso The effect of diversity is stronger in experiments carried out under natural conditions in the wild than under zzso or standardized laboratory zzso The realization that genetic and zzso variation is key to successful establishment may improve the outcome of zzso and zzso programs used to zzso or restore declining and extinct zzso Founder diversity may also improve the ability of invasive species to establish and subsequently spread in environments outside of their native community, and enhance the ability of pathogens and zzso to colonize and invade the environment constituted by their zzso It is argued that exchange of ideas, zzso approaches, and insights of the role of diversity for establishment in different contexts may further our knowledge, zzso future research, and improve management plans in different zzso
