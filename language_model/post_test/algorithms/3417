The zzso of zzso effects via zzso zzso requires the inverse of the conditional zzso relationship zzso zzso Both zzso of each animal can either be identified zzso by markers or by parental zzso By example, it was shown that the conditional zzso relationship zzso is not unique but depends on the mode of zzso zzso The sum of both zzso effects of each zzso therefore its estimated breeding zzso however zzso A previously known zzso for setting up the inverse of G was generalized in order to eliminate the zzso between columns and rows of zzso In the presence of zzso the rank of G also depends on the mode of zzso zzso A unique transformation of estimates of zzso zzso effects into zzso zzso effects was proven to be zzso The properties of both modes of zzso identification in the fields of application are zzso
