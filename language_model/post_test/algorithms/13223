We present an analysis and demonstration of zzso zzso laser pulse characterization using zzso zzso scans and zzso phase retrieval zzso The sensitivity and zzso of this technique with respect to noise, measurement bandwidth and complexity of the measured zzso is discussed through zzso examples and experimental zzso Using this technique, we successfully demonstrate the characterization of zzso zzso with complex and structured zzso generated from a broadband zzso laser zzso and a zzso hollow fiber zzso
