The aim of the study was to demonstrate and critically discuss the influence of image information on zzso and image zzso The influence of image information on image zzso was demonstrated on the zzso zzso zzso images of a zzso The standard Joint Photographic Expert Group zzso and zzso 2000 zzso methods were used in zzso ratio zzso and in quality factor zzso zzso zzso Image information was estimated by calculating image zzso while the effects of image zzso were evaluated zzso by file size reduction and by local and global mean square error zzso and zzso by visual perception of distortion in high and low contrast test zzso In zzso zzso mode, a strong correlation between image zzso and file size was found for zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso 2000 zzso p zzso zzso while corresponding local zzso was constant zzso or nearly constant zzso zzso For zzso 2000 zzso zzso mode, zzso was nearly constant zzso while local zzso varied considerably zzso and zzso The obtained qualitative and quantitative results clearly demonstrate that image degradation highly depends on image information, which indicates that the degree of image degradation cannot be guaranteed in zzso but only in zzso zzso zzso zzso is therefore not a measure of choice for expressing the degree of image degradation in medical image zzso Moreover, even when using zzso zzso zzso objective zzso and comparison of the zzso methods within and between studies is often not possible due to the lack of zzso of zzso quality zzso
