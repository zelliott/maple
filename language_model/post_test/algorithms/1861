zzso rhythms in zzso cells persist for weeks in constant darkness, while in other types of cells the molecular zzso that zzso zzso rhythms damp rapidly under the same zzso Although much progress has been made in understanding the zzso and cellular basis of zzso zzso the mechanisms leading to zzso or zzso zzso remain largely zzso There exist many mathematical models that reproduce the zzso rhythms in the case of a single cell of the zzso zzso However, not much is known about the mechanisms leading to coherent zzso zzso in clock zzso zzso In this work we have implemented a model for a network of interacting clock zzso to describe the emergence (or zzso of zzso rhythms in zzso fly, in the absence of zzso Our model consists of an array of zzso that interact through the zzso of some parameters by a network zzso The individual zzso are described by a well-known zzso model for zzso zzso to which we have added degradation of PER protein by light and zzso zzso The network feedback is the PER protein level averaged over the whole zzso In particular, we have investigated the effect of zzso of the parameters associated with zzso the control of net entrance of PER into the nucleus and zzso the zzso degradation of zzso Our results indicate that the zzso of PER entrance into the nucleus allows the synchronization of clock zzso leading to coherent zzso zzso under constant dark zzso On the other hand, the zzso of zzso degradation cannot reset the zzso of individual clocks subjected to intrinsic zzso zzso
