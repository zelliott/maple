zzso locally optimal secondary structures provide a concise and exhaustive description of all possible secondary structures of a given zzso zzso and hence a very good representation of the zzso folding zzso In this paper, we present an efficient zzso that zzso all locally optimal secondary structures for any folding model that takes into account the stability of zzso zzso This zzso is implemented in a software called zzso that runs on a publicly accessible web zzso
