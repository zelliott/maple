We are still missing a basic understanding of zzso relationships in zzso zzso prediction zzso remain the only reliable fold prediction zzso New methods, such as zzso and hybrid zzso fold recognition, can often recognize even the most distant zzso and, in some cases, even unrelated proteins with similar overall zzso This knowledge pushed the envelope of zzso function analysis to the point that the majority of newly zzso zzso can be tentatively assigned to already characterized protein zzso However, at this evolutionary distance, fold prediction is no longer equivalent to function zzso Instead of having the same exact function, zzso related proteins might share some functional zzso that is not obvious to the casual zzso The main challenge facing the fold recognition field is to develop tools to follow the structure prediction with function prediction and zzso
