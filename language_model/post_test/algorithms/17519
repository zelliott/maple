zzso zzso transfer is one of the most important building blocks in modern high-resolution zzso It constitutes a very efficient transfer element for the assignment of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Nevertheless, in zzso exceeding approximately 10 zzso zzso can show decreasing sensitivity due to fast zzso relaxation processes that are active during the mixing zzso In this article we propose the zzso multiple pulse zzso originally developed for efficient zzso transfer through residual zzso zzso as a zzso zzso sequence with improved relaxation zzso A theoretical analysis of the zzso transfer via zzso zzso and its relaxation behavior as well as experimental transfer zzso for zzso relative to the zzso zzso multiple pulse sequence are zzso
