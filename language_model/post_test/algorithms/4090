To characterize the voice and vocal fold function of an individual, it is essential to evaluate vocal fold zzso The most widely used method for this purpose has been zzso 

This article proposes a digital image processing zzso to estimate the zzso area zzso the space between the vocal zzso and produce zzso of the opening and closing zzso of the zzso zzso In eight subjects without voice disorders, vocal fold movements were recorded by high-speed zzso at zzso frames per zzso The video data were processed by a combination of image zzso techniques that estimate the zzso zzso The segmented area was used to construct the zzso zzso 

The zzso revealed important properties of vocal fold zzso including zzso zzso and other characteristics that have a major influence on voice zzso 

The combination of the high-speed technology with the proposed method improves the vocal fold analysis given a zzso feedback through zzso representation of the real zzso patterns of the zzso
