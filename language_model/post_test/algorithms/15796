The zzso task of protein structure prediction is believed to require exponential time, but previous arguments as to its zzso have taken into account only the size of a zzso zzso zzso Such arguments do not rule out the possible existence of an algorithm, more selective than exhaustive search, that is efficient and zzso (An efficient zzso is one that is guaranteed, for all possible zzso to run in time bounded by a function zzso in the problem zzso An intractable problem is one for which no efficient zzso zzso Questions regarding the possible zzso of problems are often best answered using the theory of zzso In this treatment we show the zzso of two typical mathematical statements of empirical potential energy function zzso of zzso Unless all zzso problems can be solved zzso these results imply that a function zzso zzso can be efficient for protein structure prediction only if it exploits zzso properties that prohibit the simple geometric constructions that we use in our zzso Analysis of further mathematical statements of molecular structure prediction could constitute a systematic methodology for identifying sources of complexity in protein zzso and for guiding development of zzso zzso
