Advances in image acquisition systems have made it possible to capture high-resolution images of a scene, recording considerable scene zzso With increased resolution comes increased image size and geometric difference between zzso images, complicating image zzso Through zzso zzso we zzso large images into small corresponding regions, and by registering small regions, we register the images in a zzso zzso Image subdivision reduces the geometric difference between regions that are registered and zzso the correspondence zzso The proposed method is a zzso zzso While previous methods use the same block size and shape at a zzso the proposed method adapts the block size and shape to the local image details and geometric difference between the zzso This adaptation makes it possible to keep geometric difference between corresponding regions small and zzso the correspondence zzso zzso details of the proposed image registration method are zzso and experimental results on various types of images are presented and zzso
