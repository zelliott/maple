zzso zzso provides a means for the determination of the spatial distribution of materials with different optical density in a volume by zzso zzso This paper presents results of concentration zzso of gas bubbles in a water column using an optical zzso zzso A zzso flow zzso is used to generate vertical zzso zzso flows with zzso bubble flow zzso Two approaches are zzso The first aims to obtain an average gas concentration at the measurement section, the second aims to obtain a gas distribution profile by using zzso zzso A hybrid zzso zzso is used to calculate concentration profiles from measured sensor values to provide a zzso image of the measurement zzso The zzso combines the characteristic of an optical sensor as a hard field sensor and the linear back projection zzso
