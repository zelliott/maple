High speed video imaging and an inverse heat zzso problem zzso were used to observe and measure the effect of the angle between the zzso and surface of a skin phantom on: zzso surface zzso zzso heat flux zzso and zzso overall heat extraction Q during zzso spray cooling zzso A skin phantom containing a zzso temperature sensor was sprayed with 50 zzso zzso spurts from a commercial zzso placed 30 zzso from the zzso The zzso was systematically positioned at angles ranging from 5 to 90 degrees zzso with respect to the phantom zzso It is shown that angles as low as 15 have an insignificant impact on the surface temperature, zzso and zzso Only exaggerated angles of 5 show up to zzso lower zzso and zzso lower Q with respect to the zzso values measured when zzso are aimed zzso This study proves that the slight angle that many commercial zzso have does not affect significantly the zzso zzso
