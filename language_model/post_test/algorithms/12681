zzso DNA zzso c zzso II zzso gene sequences of Malaysian zzso were examined to ascertain their zzso zzso zzso were represented by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso while the zzso zzso represented zzso DNA amplification and sequencing of the zzso gene was performed on 16 zzso zzso zzso zzso was used as the zzso Data were analyzed using both character zzso zzso and distance zzso zzso Tree zzso indicated that zzso and zzso have their own distinct zzso zzso This result was well supported by zzso values and genetic distances derived from the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso was also well supported by zzso zzso In addition, tree zzso indicate a good resolution of the zzso zzso relationships at the zzso level, but with low zzso zzso The position of zzso remained problematic in both zzso Overall, zzso is a good gene candidate for portraying the zzso relationships of Malaysian primates at the zzso and zzso zzso
