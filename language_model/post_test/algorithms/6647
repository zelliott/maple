Several zzso techniques for the zzso of soft tissue elasticity are currently being zzso Most of them study the medium response to dynamic zzso Such responses are usually modeled in a purely elastic medium using a Green's function solution of the motion zzso However, elasticity by itself is not necessarily a zzso zzso for zzso zzso Modeling viscous properties of zzso could also be of great interest for tumor zzso We report in this paper an explicit derivation of the Green's function in a viscous and elastic medium taking into account zzso bulk, and zzso zzso From this theoretical zzso zzso simulations of mechanical waves in zzso soft zzso are zzso The relevance of the zzso Green's function is validated by comparing simulations with experimental zzso The experiments were conducted using the zzso zzso imaging zzso technique which zzso and remotely excites zzso using acoustic radiation zzso We show that transient zzso waves generated with zzso are modeled very precisely by the Green's function zzso The combined influences of zzso zzso beam shape, and zzso zzso on the shape of transient waves are carefully studied as they represent a major issue in zzso zzso imaging zzso
