The existence of highly spin polarized zzso zzso from zzso zzso as well as from zzso atoms and molecules has been found to be very common in many studies over the past 40 zzso This so-called zzso effect is based upon the influence of the zzso interaction in the zzso or the zzso zzso In a zzso zzso experiment, zzso polarized radiation has to be used to create spin polarized zzso while in zzso zzso even zzso or zzso polarized radiation is sufficient to get a high spin zzso In past years the zzso effect has become very important in the zzso zzso of solid surfaces, also with an observed high zzso spin zzso It is the purpose of the present topical review to zzso the spin polarization zzso found in zzso zzso zzso zzso of condensed matter with that of free zzso to compare it with the zzso effect and zzso zzso to describe the influence and the importance of the zzso interaction and to show and zzso the zzso element and phase shift effects zzso relationship between the energy zzso of these phase shifts and the zzso delay of zzso zzso in zzso zzso is also zzso zzso the influence of zzso structures of the zzso target on the spin zzso the zzso of different spin components in coherent zzso in zzso and a zzso of spin polarization in zzso from zzso zzso with zzso on magnetic materials are zzso these are all based upon the influence of the zzso interaction in zzso zzso
