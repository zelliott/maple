zzso has emerged as an important approach to the analysis of large-scale zzso A zzso technique identifies a subset of rows that exhibit similar patterns on a subset of columns in a data zzso Many zzso methods have been proposed, and most, if not all, zzso are developed to detect regions of zzso zzso These methods perform zzso if the purpose is to identify zzso of a constant zzso This paper presents a zzso zzso method to identify constant level zzso for zzso or quantitative zzso This zzso identifies the zzso zzso zzso such that the proportion of zzso is less than a zzso tolerance zzso The proposed method has much higher sensitivity and slightly lower specificity than several prominent zzso methods from the analysis of two synthetic zzso It was further compared with the zzso method for two real zzso The proposed method was shown to perform the most robust in terms of sensitivity, number of zzso and number of zzso zzso zzso However, zzso using different signal level thresholds usually leads to different sets of zzso this also occurs in the present zzso
