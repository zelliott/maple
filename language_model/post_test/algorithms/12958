A recently introduced zzso zzso microscope with correlated detection promises up to 50% improvement in zzso spatial resolution zzso zzso zzso Express 18, zzso zzso via the use of zzso zzso Here we achieve similar results in a different manner, introducing a zzso correlated microscope which exploits the correlations present in optical zzso zzso It is based on tight focusing of pump radiation onto a thin sample positioned in front of a zzso zzso followed by coincidence detection of signal and zzso zzso each focused onto a zzso This approach offers further resolution enhancement in zzso zzso
