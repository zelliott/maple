zzso circuits have been implicated in reward learning, and emerging findings suggest that frontal white matter structural integrity and zzso reward learning are reduced in older zzso This zzso study examined whether age differences in zzso white matter integrity could account for age differences in reward learning in a community life span sample of human zzso By combining diffusion zzso imaging with a zzso reward learning task, we found that older age was associated with decreased reward learning and decreased white matter integrity in specific pathways running from the zzso to the zzso prefrontal zzso and from the zzso prefrontal zzso to the zzso zzso Further, white matter integrity in these zzso paths could statistically account for age differences in zzso These findings suggest that the integrity of zzso white matter pathways critically supports reward zzso The findings also raise the possibility that interventions that bolster zzso integrity might improve reward learning and decision zzso
