Although mass screening for osteoporosis is not recommended among zzso women, there is no consensus on which women should undergo testing for low bone mineral zzso The objective of this study was to develop and validate a clinical tool to help clinicians identify which women are at increased risk for osteoporosis and should therefore undergo further testing with bone zzso 

Using Ontario baseline data from the Canadian zzso zzso zzso we identified all cognitively normal women aged 45 years or more who had undergone testing with zzso zzso zzso zzso at both the zzso neck and the zzso spine zzso Participants who had a previous diagnosis of osteoporosis or were taking bone active medication other than zzso hormones were zzso The main outcome measure was low bone mineral density zzso score of 2 or more standard zzso below the mean for young Canadian zzso at either the zzso neck or the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and receiver operating characteristic zzso analysis were used to identify the simplest zzso that would identify women at increased risk for low bone mineral zzso 

The study population comprised zzso women, of whom zzso were allocated to the development of the tool and 450 to its zzso A simple zzso based on age, weight and current zzso use zzso or zzso was zzso zzso of this zzso zzso zzso Assessment zzso zzso showed that the tool had a sensitivity of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and a specificity of zzso zzso zzso zzso for selecting women with low bone mineral zzso The sensitivity of the instrument for selecting women with osteoporosis was zzso zzso zzso zzso Use of the zzso represented a zzso reduction in zzso testing compared with screening all women in our zzso 

The zzso accurately identifies the vast majority of women likely to have low bone mineral density and is effective in substantially decreasing the need for all women to undergo zzso zzso
