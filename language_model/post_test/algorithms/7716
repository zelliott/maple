Gene expression is a highly regulated biological process that is fundamental to the existence of zzso of any living zzso The regulatory relations are usually modeled as a zzso simply, every gene is modeled as a zzso and relations are shown as edges between two related zzso This paper presents a novel method for zzso correlation networks, networks constructed by connecting zzso zzso through predicting zzso level from genes zzso zzso According to the results, this method works well on biological data and its outcome is comparable to the methods that use zzso as zzso The method is written in zzso language and is available upon request from the corresponding zzso
