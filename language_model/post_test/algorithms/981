One of the conclusions drawn at the zzso meeting in zzso was that applying various force fields during refinement of zzso models tends to move predictions in the wrong direction, away from the zzso determined zzso We have derived an zzso force field aimed at protein and zzso zzso in zzso zzso which has been specifically designed to avoid this zzso zzso resembles common molecular dynamics force fields but has been automatically zzso with two major zzso zzso not to make high resolution X-ray structures worse and zzso to improve zzso models built by WHAT zzso zzso parameters were not required to be physically zzso instead, they were zzso with random zzso Carlo moves in zzso zzso space, each one evaluated by simulated zzso runs of a zzso zzso zzso Errors inherent to the approximate zzso equation could thus be canceled by errors in zzso zzso Compared with the zzso set, the force field did equally well on an independent validation set and is shown to move in zzso models closer to zzso It can be applied to modeling applications as well as X-ray and zzso structure zzso A new method to assign zzso parameters based on molecular trees is also zzso A zzso server is freely accessible at zzso
