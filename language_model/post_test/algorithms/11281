Although geometric zzso gives a good understanding of how the microscope works, it fails in one critical area, which is explaining the origin of microscope zzso To accomplish this, one must consider the microscope from the viewpoint of physical zzso This chapter describes the theory of the zzso resolution to the highest spatial frequency that a microscope can zzso The chapter illustrates how zzso principle or construction can be used to explain the propagation of a plane zzso It is shown that this limit increases with increasing zzso zzso zzso As a zzso to this, resolution increases with decreasing wavelength because of how zzso depends on zzso The resolution is higher for blue light than red zzso Resolution is dependent on contrast, and the higher the contrast, the higher the zzso This last point relates to issues of zzso and dynamic zzso The use of video and new digital cameras has necessitated redefining classical limits such as those of zzso zzso
