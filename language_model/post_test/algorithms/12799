zzso models of zzso zzso are instrumental for gaining a zzso understanding of cellular zzso zzso these structures is a major challenge for experimental techniques, such as X-ray zzso zzso zzso and electron zzso zzso Thus, zzso modeling techniques, including molecular zzso are zzso The development of most molecular zzso methods has so far been focused on modeling of zzso zzso We have recently introduced the zzso method for modeling the structure of a zzso complex by simultaneously zzso the fit of the model into an zzso density map of the entire complex and the shape zzso between interacting zzso Here, we report zzso advances of the zzso method that result in an efficient and accurate assembly of the input zzso into their density zzso The successful predictions and the increasing number of complexes being characterized by zzso suggests that the zzso challenge could be extended to include zzso modeling of zzso zzso guided by zzso
