zzso analysis with mathematical models has become increasingly important to zzso zzso parameters in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and dynamic zzso zzso zzso The modified zzso model and the zzso zzso model have been widely applied to zzso results in disease processes such as cancer, zzso and zzso In this article, an intermediate model between the modified zzso and zzso models is derived from a mathematical expansion of the modified zzso zzso zzso and an in zzso experiment involving zzso of carotid zzso were used to compare the new extended zzso model with the modified zzso model and the zzso zzso In our simulated circumstances and the carotid artery application, we found that the extended zzso model exhibited lower noise sensitivity and provided more accurate estimates of the volume transfer constant zzso and fractional plasma volume zzso than the modified zzso model for zzso acquisitions of total duration less than zzso zzso depending on kinetic zzso In comparison with the zzso model, we found that the extended zzso model exhibited zzso less bias in estimates of zzso Thus, the extended zzso model may allow kinetic modeling of zzso results with shortened data acquisition zzso without sacrificing accuracy in estimates of zzso and zzso
