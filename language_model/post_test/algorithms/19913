zzso has long been recognized as a hazardous environmental agent highly zzso with zzso Recently, it has been realized that due to the activity of zzso zzso zzso within the cell nucleus, zzso is produced zzso in direct vicinity of zzso zzso Should it lead to extensive DNA zzso We address this question with the aid of a zzso mapping method, analogous to X-ray and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques for observing zzso specific interactions of small organic compounds with a zzso in order to establish important functional zzso We concentrate on the leading reaction of zzso with free zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Our results show that in zzso zzso zzso groups are totally zzso for the zzso zzso Then, we explore the effect of recently discovered transient flipping of zzso zzso pairs into zzso zzso pairs zzso zzso Our results show that the zzso base pair formation dramatically affects the accessibility for zzso of zzso zzso zzso within zzso base pairs adjacent to zzso base zzso The extensive literature on DNA interaction with zzso is analyzed in light of the new zzso The obtained data emphasize the significance of DNA zzso zzso
