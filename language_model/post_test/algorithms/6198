We developed methods to represent cardiac zzso Using an innovative model, we estimated several parameters of cardiac zzso We implemented the zzso super zzso model to zzso the motion of a left zzso zzso with zzso and Visual zzso We displayed zzso wall zzso with a zzso zzso The time frames in this model changed the measured zzso zzso We also zzso zzso using the zzso super zzso zzso We analyzed the zzso of the zzso zzso and tested its criteria using a validation study of seven normal subjects and 26 patients with prior zzso zzso To analyze zzso we used mean and zzso of total motion during a cardiac zzso The average of a normal subject was zzso and zzso was zzso For patients, average and zzso of zzso were zzso and zzso zzso Although the average value did not differ between normal subjects and patients, the zzso differed zzso Thus, we were able to estimate the difference between normal subjects and zzso In patients, zzso was zzso higher than in normal subjects, and the zzso was zzso zzso In the patient study, quantity of motion decreased rapidly in a stressed zzso The zzso for zzso displayed 15 segment zzso we were able to rotate the locations of all points with a mouse zzso We were able to zzso most of the factors for cardiac zzso and cardiac zzso We expect that this model can distinguish between normal subjects and abnormal subjects, and that we can produce an exact analysis of momentum using this zzso
