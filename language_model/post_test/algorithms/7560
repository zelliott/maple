This paper studies the global zzso stability problem of a class of zzso neural networks with zzso zzso To overcome the difficulty caused by the partial differential term, a novel zzso functional is proposed, and a partial differential equation technique together with a linear operator approach are also applied to obtain the zzso stability criteria, which are less conservative than the existing zzso Finally, simulation examples are given to verify and illustrate the theoretical zzso
