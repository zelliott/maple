zzso retention zzso is widely recognized as a consequence of zzso that leads to failed zzso of zzso sequences from zzso zzso Our zzso analyses of zzso and zzso data of normal white blood cell differentiation reveal zzso as a zzso mechanism of gene expression zzso zzso regulates the expression of 86 functionally related zzso including those that determine the nuclear shape that is unique to zzso zzso of zzso in specific genes is associated with zzso of zzso factors and higher zzso zzso zzso zzso between human and zzso led to reduced zzso and protein levels by triggering the zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the prevalent view that zzso is limited to zzso zzso zzso zzso our data establish that zzso coupled with zzso is a zzso mechanism in normal zzso zzso zzso may provide an energetically favorable level of dynamic gene expression control prior to sustained gene zzso
