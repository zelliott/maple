Using zzso and zzso zzso we measured the rate of zzso synthesis zzso zzso zzso zzso gram wet weight tissue zzso in rat heart in zzso during an intravenous infusion of zzso and zzso zzso was observed within 10 zzso of starting and increased zzso throughout a zzso zzso This compared closely with the average activity of zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso measured at zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso (110 zzso When zzso zzso replaced zzso in the zzso after 50 zzso the zzso signal remained stable for another 60 zzso indicating that no turnover of the newly zzso zzso had zzso Despite this zzso a activity in heart extracts from rats given a 1 h zzso and insulin infusion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso greatly exceeded the total zzso activity and if active in zzso should promote zzso We conclude that during zzso and insulin infusion in the zzso zzso the absolute rate of zzso zzso synthesis can be measured in zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso I can account for the observed rates of heart zzso zzso zzso there is no futile cycling of zzso in and out of heart zzso and zzso the activity of zzso a measured in tissue extracts is not reflected in zzso These studies raise the question whether significant regulation of zzso a activity in zzso is zzso by factors in addition to its zzso zzso
