zzso interactions of zzso proteins zzso with their target transcripts are essential for zzso gene expression regulation in zzso However, accurate prediction of zzso motif sites has been difficult because many zzso recognize short and zzso zzso Here we describe a hidden zzso model zzso zzso zzso to predict clustered functional zzso sites by effectively zzso the number and spacing of individual motif sites, their accessibility in local zzso secondary structures and zzso zzso This zzso learns and zzso rules of these features, taking advantage of a large number of in zzso zzso sites obtained from zzso and zzso zzso We applied this zzso to study two representative zzso families, Nova and zzso which regulate zzso alternative zzso through interacting with clustered zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and predicted their binding sites in the mouse zzso Despite the low information content in individual motif zzso our zzso made specific predictions for successful experimental zzso Analysis of predicted sites also revealed cases of extensive and zzso zzso sites important for zzso zzso This zzso can be readily applied to other zzso to zzso their zzso zzso The software is freely available at zzso
