zzso zzso zzso zzso can zzso the phase zzso caused by magnetic field zzso while preserving the chemical shift, so they have been applied to achieve high-resolution MR zzso free of line broadening caused by zzso zzso However, previous zzso high-resolution methods all require two-dimensional zzso sampling of the full range of chemical shifts of zzso evolutions in both zzso and zzso dimensions, resulting in a prolonged scanning time for data zzso In this work, sparse sampling in the zzso dimension and subsequent zzso correction are used to speed up the zzso zzso zzso zzso by up to 50 times on zzso MR zzso Furthermore, three types of zzso with zzso original zzso constants, and doubled zzso zzso respectively are obtained with manipulation of the zzso zzso The water suppression is also improved by the combined use of zzso zzso filter and zzso zzso The zzso of this group of new sequences are demonstrated by experiments using an zzso gel phantom with an air bubble, in zzso pig brain zzso and an intact zzso zzso
