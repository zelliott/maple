Modeling zzso effects and pose variations of a face is of fundamental importance in the field of facial image zzso Most of the conventional techniques that simultaneously address both of these problems work with the zzso assumption and thus fall short of accurately capturing the complex intensity variation that the facial images exhibit or recovering their zzso shape in the presence of zzso and cast zzso In this paper, we present a novel zzso framework for facial image zzso We show that, using this zzso the facial apparent zzso field can be accurately estimated while seamlessly accounting for cast shadows and zzso Further, using local neighborhood information, the same framework can be exploited to recover the zzso shape of the face (to handle pose zzso We zzso validate the accuracy of the zzso zzso model using a more general model based on the mixture of zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique by presenting extensive experimental results for face zzso zzso shape recovery, and face recognition using the zzso Yale B and zzso zzso benchmark data zzso
