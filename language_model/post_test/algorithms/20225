zzso motor control is defined as adapting an zzso to the unique physical properties of its own zzso The zzso arm serves to exemplify that effective low-level motor control demands a zzso zzso inversion of the zzso as well as of the zzso of a limb zzso zzso zzso is, zzso of either actual or predicted zzso zzso thereby assumed to be the principle of the dynamics zzso As regards zzso control, the overall tool transformation is assumed to transform the force pattern of the zzso muscles into speech zzso Like the arm model, the zzso transformation thus defined is also divided into two parts, namely the transformation relating the muscle forces to the zzso states of the vocal tract (which is analogous to the forward dynamics including natural zzso zzso and the transformation relating the zzso states to the speech zzso zzso zzso control, then, needs to zzso both zzso each of which can be learned by means of the zzso zzso zzso learning can fail to zzso zzso zzso and therefore lead to abnormal feedback zzso through the zzso operating neural network, which in turn can cause zzso if zzso zzso is involved in zzso
