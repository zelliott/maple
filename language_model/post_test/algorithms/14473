zzso incomplete or partial fingerprints from a large fingerprint database remains a difficult challenge zzso zzso studies on partial fingerprints focus on zzso matching using local zzso zzso In this paper, we investigate the problem of retrieving candidate lists for matching partial fingerprints by exploiting global zzso zzso Specifically, we propose an zzso approach for reconstructing the global zzso representation from a partial zzso First, we present an inverse orientation model for describing the reconstruction zzso Then, we provide a general expression for all valid solutions to the inverse zzso This allows us to preserve data zzso in the existing segments while exploring missing structures in the unknown zzso We have further developed zzso for zzso the missing orientation structures based on some a zzso knowledge of zzso zzso zzso Our statistical experiments show that our proposed zzso approach can effectively reduce the number of candidates for zzso fingerprint matching, and thus significantly improve the system retrieval performance for partial fingerprint zzso
