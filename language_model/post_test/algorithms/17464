The ability to zzso dynamic motions from an equilibrium zzso zzso of a protein can be essential in establishing zzso zzso In particular, the zzso motions are of functional interest because statistical mechanics predicts these motions will have the largest zzso In this paper, we address the zzso cost of normal mode analysis zzso applied to a zzso elastic network model zzso and present a new zzso zzso analysis zzso This new method represents a protein as a collection of rigid bodies interconnected with harmonic zzso This representation produces reduced zzso zzso equations of motion zzso which, even in the case of large structures zzso zzso enables the zzso of normal modes to be done on a zzso zzso We present the complete theory and analysis of zzso and also include its application to a variety of zzso The results of the new method are compared with zzso and it is shown that zzso produces very good approximations to the lowest modes at a fraction of the zzso zzso
