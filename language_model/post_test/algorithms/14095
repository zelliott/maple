The prostate zzso is conventionally divided into zones or zzso This zzso is of clinical significance as prostate cancer zzso occurs mainly in the peripheral zone zzso We obtained tissue sets consisting of zzso blocks of zzso transition zone zzso and zzso and adjacent zzso from patients zzso zzso 6) who had undergone radical zzso zzso a seventh tissue set of zzso zzso and zzso was obtained from a zzso zzso removed after radical zzso zzso tissue slices were zzso zzso zzso and mounted on suitable windows to facilitate infrared zzso zzso acquisition before being zzso and air zzso zzso were zzso on zzso zzso zzso were collected employing zzso zzso infrared zzso zzso in transmission mode or attenuated total zzso zzso zzso zzso cell and zzso zzso zzso were subjected to principal component analysis to determine whether zzso relationships expressed as single points in zzso might on the basis of zzso distance reveal zzso differences between cells in zzso in different tissue zzso After zzso analysis, plotted clusters and their zzso zzso highlighted marked variation in the spectral region containing zzso bands ( approximately zzso zzso By interrogating the intrinsic zzso of zzso zzso in this small cohort sample, we found that zzso zzso cells appeared to align more closely with those of zzso while exhibiting marked structural differences compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso also suggested that these cells are structurally more different to zzso than those located in the zzso Because the zzso exhibits a higher occurrence of zzso other factors zzso hormone zzso may zzso the growth zzso of initiated zzso cells in this zzso The results of this pilot study surprisingly indicate that zzso zzso cells are more likely to exhibit what may be a zzso spectral zzso Thus, zzso zzso on its own may not be sufficient to identify zzso prostate zzso cells most likely to progress to zzso
