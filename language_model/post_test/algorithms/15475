Global zzso changes in plants in response to environmental stress have been relatively poorly characterized to zzso Here we introduce a novel mass zzso zzso zzso method that zzso systematic profiling plant zzso changes with high efficiency and zzso This method employs synthetic zzso libraries tailored specifically as internal standards for complex zzso samples and zzso a local zzso algorithm, zzso which zzso zzso abundance zzso locally with zzso library zzso zzso was achieved in a small time frame centered to each zzso to compensate for the diverse zzso suppression effect across retention zzso The zzso zzso method was further treated with a linear zzso function to accurately measure zzso responses to zzso stress in zzso Among zzso unique zzso identified and zzso zzso zzso in zzso samples, zzso regulated zzso representing 497 zzso have shown significant zzso Several known and novel components in the zzso stress zzso were identified, illustrating the capability of this method to identify critical signaling events among dynamic and complex zzso Further assessment of those regulated proteins may help shed light on zzso response to zzso stress in zzso
