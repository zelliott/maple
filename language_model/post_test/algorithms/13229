A Near zzso zzso zzso zzso system has been developed and integrated into a commercial Digital Breast zzso zzso scanner to allow structural and functional imaging of breast in zzso The zzso instrument uses an zzso continuous wave zzso zzso scanning source assembly and a zzso silicon zzso solid-state detector panel to produce dense spectral and spatial projection data from which zzso constrained zzso zzso images of tissue zzso are zzso zzso of the optical imaging system into the zzso scanner allows direct zzso of the optical and zzso images, while also zzso the synergistic use of zzso contrast as anatomical zzso in optical image zzso Currently, the total scan time for a combined zzso exam is zzso with data collection from 8 zzso in the optical scan requiring zzso to zzso The system was tested in breast simulating zzso constructed using zzso and blood in an zzso zzso with a 3 zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso inclusion at 1 zzso depth from the zzso zzso image reconstruction of total zzso zzso concentration resulted in accurate recovery of the lateral size and position of the inclusion to within zzso and zzso zzso Use of zzso structural zzso in the zzso reconstruction process improved the quantitative accuracy of the zzso recovery, and led to linear changes in zzso versus actual contrast, zzso the advantages of zzso optical imaging zzso The quantitative accuracy of the system can be further improved with independent zzso of scattering properties through integration of frequency or time domain zzso
