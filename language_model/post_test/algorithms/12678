Different methods have been proposed for assessing a possible zzso link between a drug treatment and an adverse event in individual zzso They approximately belong to three main zzso expert zzso operational zzso and zzso zzso 

To compare, in a set of actual drug adverse event reports, three different methods for assessing drug zzso each belonging to one of the three main zzso expert zzso the zzso used by the French zzso zzso since 1985, and a novel method based on the zzso zzso 

Fifty zzso pairs were randomly sampled from the database of the Bordeaux zzso zzso zzso To serve as the gold standard, the probability for drug zzso from 0 to 1, was first determined for each zzso pair by a panel of senior experts until consensus was zzso zzso was then assessed by members of the Bordeaux zzso zzso by using the French zzso and the zzso zzso zzso expressed as a probability with the zzso method and as a score from 0 to 4 with the French zzso were then compared with consensual expert zzso as were the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative zzso zzso 

zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso mean zzso for experts versus zzso zzso zzso mean zzso for the zzso zzso zzso expert zzso was not zzso zzso in ten zzso For the algorithm, only three of five causality scores were found, doubtful scores being clearly zzso zzso followed by possible zzso and probable zzso zzso zzso and specificity were zzso and zzso respectively, for the zzso method versus zzso and zzso for the zzso Positive and negative zzso values were zzso and zzso respectively, for the zzso method versus zzso and zzso for the zzso 

zzso between the three approaches was poor, and only satisfactory for drug events judged as drug-induced by consensual expert zzso The zzso method showed high sensitivity at the expense of poor zzso zzso the zzso had poor sensitivity but good zzso The comparatively good sensitivity and positive zzso values of the zzso method suggest that it may be more useful in the routine or automated assessment of case reports of suspected but still unknown adverse drug zzso With a substantial rate of false zzso relative to true zzso zzso zzso the zzso method does not zzso but can be zzso by, critical clinical assessment of individual cases in evaluating drug-related zzso
