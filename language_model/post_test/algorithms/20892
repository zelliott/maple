We analyze a general zzso mathematical model of single species population dynamics with the zzso density effect and the zzso zzso We harvest a portion of the population at a moment in each zzso We investigate the condition under which the zzso causes an eventual increase of its population at the zzso and show that such a paradoxical increase could occur for the discrete single species population dynamics with a large family of density effect zzso Some typical models are analyzed in detail according to the possibility of the paradox zzso Our result implies that the contest competition would never cause the paradox, while the scramble competition would be likely to cause zzso
