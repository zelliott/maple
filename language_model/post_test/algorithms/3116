zzso zzso therapy zzso is an effective treatment in zzso zzso zzso However, it has been demonstrated that mechanical zzso is not related to electrical zzso We hypothesized that a new zzso zzso zzso could be easier to use as a first step in the selection of patients with zzso and zzso zzso 

We included 58 patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso dimensions, zzso and zzso function, zzso zzso data were evaluated in all zzso 

According to zzso zzso we divided the study population in two groups: Group 1, 25 patients having a narrow zzso zzso zzso and Group 2, 33 patients having a wide zzso zzso zzso Patients in Group 2 had larger left zzso with similar zzso function and more severe zzso dysfunction than patients with narrow zzso zzso zzso was more frequent in group 2 zzso vs zzso zzso while zzso zzso was highly prevalent in both groups zzso vs zzso zzso A zzso zzso best predicted the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and specificity zzso while a zzso zzso best predicts zzso zzso zzso zzso and specificity zzso 

zzso zzso has a high prevalence in patients with zzso irrespective of the zzso zzso Using a higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso might help in patient selection for zzso zzso and zzso can be combined into a selection zzso for patients receiving zzso zzso
