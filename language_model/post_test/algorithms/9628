zzso 3-D images of the heart during zzso procedures is a significant zzso In addition to real time zzso zzso zzso systems can also now be used to generate zzso CT images on the same zzso One protocol for cardiac CT uses zzso triggered zzso zzso A 3-D volume of the heart at a particular cardiac phase is then reconstructed by applying zzso zzso reconstruction to the projection images with retrospective zzso zzso In this work we introduce a unified framework for heart motion zzso and dynamic zzso reconstruction using motion zzso The benefits of motion correction are 1) increased zzso and spatial resolution by removing cardiac motion which may still exist in the zzso gated data sets and 2) increased zzso ratio zzso by using more projection data than is used in standard zzso gated zzso Three zzso reconstruction methods are introduced that make use of all of the acquired projection data to generate a 3-D reconstruction of the desired cardiac zzso The first averages all motion corrected zzso the second and third perform a weighted averaging according to 1) intensity variations and 2) zzso distance relative to a time resolved and motion corrected reference zzso zzso In a comparison study seven methods are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and motion corrected zzso the three zzso approaches, and temporally aligned and averaged zzso zzso zzso The quality measures used for comparison are spatial resolution and zzso zzso is performed using phantom data and animal zzso We show that data driven and zzso motion zzso combined with motion correction can decrease zzso blurring zzso Furthermore, zzso can be increased by up to zzso while maintaining spatial resolution at the same level as is provided by the zzso zzso The presented framework provides excellent image quality for cardiac zzso zzso
