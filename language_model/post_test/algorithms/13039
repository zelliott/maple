Local field zzso zzso recorded through zzso implanted in the zzso nucleus zzso for deep brain stimulation zzso in patients with Parkinson's disease zzso show that zzso in the beta frequency range zzso zzso decrease after zzso zzso Whether and how zzso influences the beta zzso and whether zzso and zzso changes interact remains zzso We examined the combined effect of zzso and zzso on zzso beta zzso zzso recorded in nine patients with zzso under four experimental conditions: without zzso with zzso turned zzso without zzso with zzso turned on; with zzso with zzso turned on; and with zzso with zzso turned zzso The analysis of zzso zzso showed that whereas zzso abolished beta zzso zzso in all the patients zzso zzso significantly decreased the beta zzso only in five of the nine patients studied zzso Another difference was that whereas zzso completely suppressed beta zzso zzso merely decreased zzso When we combined zzso and zzso the zzso beta disruption prevailed and combining zzso and zzso induced no significant additive effect zzso Our observations suggest that zzso and zzso both zzso zzso beta zzso
