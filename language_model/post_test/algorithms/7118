Independent scoring of the aligned sections to determine the quality of biological sequence alignments enables zzso definitions of the overall alignment zzso This property is not only biologically meaningful but it also provides the opportunity to find the optimal alignments using dynamic zzso zzso Dynamic programming is an efficient problem solving technique for a class of problems that can be solved by dividing into overlapping zzso zzso sequence alignment techniques such as zzso and zzso zzso are applications of dynamic programming on zzso sequence alignment zzso These zzso offer zzso time and space zzso In this chapter, we introduce the basic dynamic programming solutions for zzso zzso and local alignment zzso zzso improvements offering zzso and zzso programs and approximate solutions with zzso and seeding zzso are zzso We finally introduce the application of these techniques on multiple sequence alignment zzso
