It is a challenging problem to establish safe and simple therapeutic methods for various complicated diseases of the nervous system, particularly zzso diseases such as zzso Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's zzso From the viewpoint of zzso zzso systems, a zzso disease can be considered to be caused by a zzso induced by a change in the values of one or more regulating zzso zzso the theory of zzso control may have potential applications in the diagnosis and therapy of zzso zzso In this study, we employ a zzso zzso dynamic feedback controller to control the onset of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Specifically, by the control zzso we can move the zzso zzso to a desired point irrespective of whether the corresponding steady state is stable or zzso In other words, we are able to advance or delay the zzso zzso so as to prevent it from occurring in a certain range of the zzso applied zzso Moreover, we can control the zzso of the zzso and regulate the zzso zzso of the zzso limit zzso In the zzso there are only two terms: the linear term and the zzso cubic zzso We show that while the former determines the location of the zzso zzso the latter regulates the zzso of the zzso zzso According to the conditions of the occurrence of zzso zzso and the zzso stability zzso we can zzso deduce the linear term and the zzso cubic term, zzso In addition, we also show that zzso zzso zzso featuring slow action potential generation, which are frequently observed in both experiments and models of chemical and biological systems, appear in the controlled zzso zzso It is well known that slow firing rates in single zzso models could be achieved only by zzso zzso However, the controlled zzso model is still classified as a zzso zzso as is the original zzso zzso We explain that the occurrence of zzso can be related to the presence of the canard explosion where a small zzso grows through a sequence of canard cycles to a relaxation zzso as the control zzso moves through an zzso of zzso small zzso
