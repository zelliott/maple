Network models that represent the void space of a rock by a lattice of pores connected by throats can predict relative zzso once the pore geometry and zzso are zzso zzso scanning provides a three-dimensional image of the pore zzso However, these images cannot be directly input into network zzso In this paper a modified zzso ball algorithm, extending the work of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso 336 zzso is developed to extract simplified networks of pores and throats with zzso geometry and interconnectivity from images of the pore zzso The parameters of the pore networks, such as coordination number, and pore and throat size zzso are zzso and compared to benchmark data from networks extracted by other methods, experimental data, and direct zzso of zzso and formation factor on the underlying zzso Good agreement is reached in most cases allowing networks derived from a wide variety of rock types to be used for zzso zzso
