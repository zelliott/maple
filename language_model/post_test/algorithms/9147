Image reconstruction from a small number of projections is a challenging problem in zzso Advanced zzso that incorporate prior knowledge can sometimes produce accurate zzso but they typically require long zzso zzso Furthermore, the required prior knowledge can be very specific, limiting the type of images that can be zzso Here, we present a reconstruction method that automatically learns prior knowledge using an artificial neural zzso We show that this method can be viewed as a combination of filtered zzso steps, and, therefore, has a relatively low zzso zzso zzso for two different cases show that the new method is able to use the learned information to produce high quality reconstructions in a short time, even when presented with a small number of zzso
