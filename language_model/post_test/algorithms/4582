zzso is the cause of many life threatening diseases which combine to cause many deaths and high health care zzso The thickness of the zzso wall and the volume of zzso plaque are both used to diagnose zzso Both zzso can be assessed using zzso zzso however wall thickness zzso are typically made on contrast enhanced scans while plaque zzso are usually gathered from zzso zzso A technique is described below that would allow for both diagnostic procedures to be performed using only one type of zzso The proposed technique is able to measure the volume of zzso plaque using contrast enhanced scans by adjusting for differences in contrast intensity on a slice by slice zzso This more robust approach is necessary because the intensity of contrast in the zzso varies by zzso Also, the contrast and zzso plaque have similar zzso The zzso of this new technique was assessed by comparing the results it generated to results from volumes calculated using zzso zzso The volumes of zzso plaque produced by this technique are very similar to those obtained using zzso scans zzso zzso zzso zzso
