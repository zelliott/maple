The purpose of the study was to establish an zzso for the reconstruction of soft tissue defects of the zzso lower leg, ankle and zzso 

81 patients presenting with soft tissue defects in these regions underwent zzso zzso The average age was zzso zzso Small defects (up to 4 zzso 4 zzso were covered by local zzso The zzso zzso zzso was the zzso zzso procedure for medium size defects (up to 10 zzso 15 zzso Free zzso were used for larger defects or in cases of zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed in three cases to improve peripheral zzso zzso 

The zzso goals were achieved in zzso of the cases by performing reconstruction according to the established zzso Minor complications occurred in zzso of the zzso 

The results appear to be very good considering a patient population with complex and predominantly contaminated zzso A zzso zzso represents an important part of the zzso for zzso reconstruction to detect abnormal zzso vascular conditions and thus to plan vascular reconstruction prior to or simultaneously with free zzso zzso Additionally, a zzso of the zzso artery represents a zzso for zzso zzso
