To introduce a method of independent determination of zzso and zzso components of zzso lipids zzso by using long TE for zzso measurement and zzso for zzso zzso to test this technique in controls and zzso subjects, and to compare results at zzso and 3 zzso 

Eight healthy volunteers and 11 patients with type 2 diabetes zzso underwent measurement using a zzso MR zzso six healthy volunteers were measured using a zzso MR zzso zzso from the zzso anterior muscle were acquired by using a point resolved zzso zzso sequence with the following zzso zzso zzso 2000 zzso zzso zzso were processed by zzso zzso software with two types of adopted zzso 

zzso with good separation of both zzso and zzso components of zzso and zzso lipids zzso were obtained and the zzso routine was successfully zzso The zzso comparison zzso 7 at zzso T zzso N zzso 5 at 3 zzso showed that better results can be obtained at higher zzso zzso The comparison of the healthy and zzso subjects proved that both zzso and zzso ratios significantly zzso 

Long TE zzso of the human muscle with zzso zzso using the zzso technique can detect changes in zzso levels as well as help in the study of fatty zzso chain zzso Using a higher field strength increased the zzso zzso by approximately zzso
