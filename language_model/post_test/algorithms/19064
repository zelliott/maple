The corpus zzso zzso is of great interest for zzso models of zzso Volume and structural integrity of the zzso have been examined by zzso and diffusion zzso imaging zzso studies, but results were not consistent across methods or zzso A possible explanation may be varying zzso and accuracy of zzso based on a single slice or small regions of zzso In addition, none of the studies examined volume and diffusion values in the same group of patients, and thus the relationship between these anatomical measures is not zzso We used an automatic zzso to segment seven zzso slices of the zzso from zzso zzso We compared volume and the zzso measures fractional zzso zzso and mean zzso zzso in the zzso and its subdivisions in the schizophrenia patients and matched zzso Patients had decreased volume, decreased zzso and increased MD of the whole zzso The important novel finding is, however, that not all regions were equally affected by anatomical zzso The results emphasize the importance of using different methods in evaluation of white matter zzso in schizophrenia to avoid false negative zzso In addition, the measures were highly correlated with each other, zzso a common pathological process influencing zzso MD and volume of the zzso Although we cannot rule out other mechanisms affecting volume, zzso and MD, zzso evidence from zzso and genetic studies suggests that zzso changes observed in schizophrenia may involve disintegration of healthy, functional zzso and strengthening of zzso connections resulting in increased severity of clinical zzso
