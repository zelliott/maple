Previously, we reported gene amplification at zzso zzso in more than one third of zzso cell zzso of the zzso zzso amplification of zzso translation initiation factor zzso on zzso indicated a possible role of this amplification in translation zzso The analysis of 61 zzso cell lung zzso shows that the percentage of zzso with a zzso amplification increases in higher zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso tumor stages showed similar percentages of amplified and zzso tumors, whereas zzso zzso tumors revealed a statistically significant zzso zzso zzso increased percentage of amplified zzso zzso were used to analyze the expression pattern of genes mapping in the amplified domain and its zzso regions zzso as well as the expression of genes directly or indirectly associated with translation initiation in zzso cell zzso large cell zzso zzso and small cell zzso Three zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso are most frequently zzso in the center of the amplified domain in zzso cell zzso The zzso translation initiation factors zzso zzso and zzso as well as the zzso protein zzso where found to be zzso in all lung cancer zzso We found, however, no zzso of zzso Our results contribute to the understanding of the frequent amplification processes in zzso cell zzso of the lung and to the understanding of the translation initiation that appears not to require zzso in lung zzso
