The question of how perception arises from zzso activity in the visual zzso is of fundamental importance in cognitive zzso To address this question, we adopt a unique experimental paradigm in which zzso zzso zzso stimuli are employed to zzso the visual input from perception while monitoring the cortical neural activity called local field potential zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso is not related to perception but the zzso induced activity of zzso may be zzso In this paper we focus on zzso the zzso features of the induced activity from zzso in a monkey's visual zzso for decoding its zzso zzso zzso We first estimate the zzso activity via a zzso method and remove it from the zzso zzso We then use the common spatial patterns zzso approach to design spatial filters to extract the zzso features from the remaining induced zzso We exploit the linear zzso analysis zzso zzso on the extracted features to decode the reported perception on a zzso zzso We demonstrate that our approach has excellent performance in zzso the zzso activity, outperforming the Wiener zzso least mean square zzso and a local zzso method called the locally weighted zzso smoothing zzso and that our approach is effective in zzso the zzso features of the zzso induced activity from zzso which leads to excellent decoding zzso We also discover that the enhanced gamma band synchronization and reduced alpha band zzso may be the zzso of the induced zzso
