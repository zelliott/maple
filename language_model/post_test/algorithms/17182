An electron beam dose calculation zzso has been developed which is based on a zzso of zzso zzso Carlo electron track zzso zzso are transported through media of varying density and atomic number using electron tracks produced in zzso The zzso of the electron zzso due to each material encountered by the electrons is explicitly accounted for by considering the effect of zzso varying stopping power, zzso scattering power, and zzso radiation zzso For each step of every electron track, these parameters affect the step zzso the step direction, and for energy deposited in that step zzso zzso zzso in both homogeneous water and zzso zzso and zzso zzso show consistent agreement with zzso zzso Carlo zzso For the same statistical uncertainty in broad beam zzso this new calculation method uses a factor of 9 less zzso time than a full zzso Carlo zzso
