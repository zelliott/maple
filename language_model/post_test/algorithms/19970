This paper presents recent experimental results and a discussion of system enhancements made to the real-time autonomous zzso whale zzso zzso first presented by Abbot et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In February 2010, a second-generation system was deployed in an experiment conducted off of zzso zzso during which 26 h of zzso zzso were recorded via zzso and processed in real zzso These data have been analyzed along with 40 h of zzso data collected from the same location during zzso zzso The extensive zzso data set in particular has enabled the zzso of system false alarm rates and the measurement of receiver operating characteristic zzso The performance impact of three enhancements incorporated into the second-generation system are discussed, including zzso a method to eliminate zzso in the kernel library, zzso increased use of contextual analysis, and zzso the zzso of the training data with more recent zzso zzso It will be shown that the performance of the real-time system was improved to yield a probability of correct zzso of zzso and a probability of false alarm of zzso over the 66 h of independent test zzso
