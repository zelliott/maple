The results of a long-established investigation into zzso zzso are used as a zzso data zzso These data are then zzso to all temperatures and zzso by zzso the property of zzso zzso as well as by converting established relationships in terms of constant humidity at fixed temperature, to alternatives in terms of a calculated water zzso In this way a zzso which is a series of very simple, first order, ordinary differential equations is zzso The model is extended to include a variety of zzso species using their relative surface areas, their relative zzso and zzso loss rates and their different 4th zzso zzso The resulting zzso model zzso total, zzso water loss, zzso mortality and zzso zzso fat reserves are a more tenuous zzso The model suggests that, while conventional wisdom is often correct in dismissing zzso in zzso zzso mortality as zzso the effects of zzso can be profound under adverse conditions and for some species, in zzso The model demonstrates how two gender effects, the more significant one at the zzso extremes of zzso fly habitat, might zzso The agreement between calculated and measured critical water losses suggests very little difference in the zzso of the different zzso
