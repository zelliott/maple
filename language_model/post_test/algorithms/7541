Independent component analysis zzso has been widely applied to the analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the number of independent components zzso in zzso data is critical to reduce zzso Various methods based on information zzso criteria zzso have been used to estimate the intrinsic dimension of zzso zzso An important assumption of zzso is that the noise is purely zzso However, this assumption is often violated by the existence of temporally correlated noise in zzso zzso In this study, we introduced a filtering method into the order selection to remove the zzso from the colored noise by using the zzso filter proposed by zzso and zzso zzso of the simulated data show that the filtering method has strong zzso to noise and significantly improves the accuracy of order selection from data with colored zzso Moreover, the zzso method proposed by us was applied to real zzso data to improve the performance of zzso zzso of the real zzso data show that the proposed method can alleviate the zzso due to the zzso of colored zzso We further compared the stability of zzso estimates of real zzso data at order estimated by minimum description length criterion based on the filtered and unfiltered data by using the software package zzso zzso show that zzso yields more stable zzso estimates using the reduced order by zzso
