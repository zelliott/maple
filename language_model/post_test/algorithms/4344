zzso surgery is performed using mechanical dissection that sometimes results in zzso zzso including zzso zzso retinal breaks, incomplete membrane zzso retinal zzso microscopic damage, zzso An zzso laser probe would be an ideal tool for cutting away zzso zzso however, the depth of surgery should be precisely controlled to protect the sensitive underlying zzso The zzso surgical zzso formed by chains of zzso spheres for use with the zzso laser source zzso with extremely short optical penetration depth in zzso was zzso zzso modeling demonstrated a potential advantage of zzso focusing chains of sapphire spheres with index zzso for zzso the tissue with zzso depth around 10 to 20 zzso Novel detachable zzso zzso tips formed by chains of 300 zzso sapphire (or zzso spheres were tested on zzso zzso ex zzso zzso zzso tips could allow for zzso of expensive zzso trunk fibers between procedures, and offer more surgical zzso by zzso various zzso tip zzso An innovative method for aiming beam integration into the zzso zzso to improve the zzso of the surgical site was also zzso Single zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso duration produced zzso craters in cornea zzso for one, three, and five sphere structures with the latter generating the smallest crater depth (10 zzso with the least amount of zzso damage depth (30 zzso zzso zzso laser zzso tips may allow surgeons better precision and safety compared to mechanical zzso when operating on delicate or sensitive areas like the zzso
