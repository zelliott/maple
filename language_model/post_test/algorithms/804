In tissue the Young's zzso cannot be assumed constant over a wide deformation zzso For example, direct mechanical zzso on human prostate show up to a zzso increase in Young's zzso over a zzso zzso In conventional elasticity imaging, these effects produce zzso elastic zzso Ignoring these effects generally leads to zzso contrast zzso zzso at lower strain are contrasted against zzso zzso at higher zzso but measuring the zzso behavior results in enhanced tissue zzso To demonstrate the methods zzso zzso elastic properties, both simulations and zzso were performed on an zzso zzso Multiple frames of zzso ultrasound data are acquired as the phantom is zzso by zzso All zzso displacement data are brought back to the geometry of the first frame to form a three-dimensional zzso data set zzso zzso and zzso zzso Data are fit to a 3-D second order zzso model for each zzso that adjusts for deformation zzso For the phantom geometry and elastic properties considered in this paper, reconstructed zzso strain images using this model result in improved contrast to noise ratios zzso at all zzso levels, without any sacrifice in spatial zzso From the same model, strain zzso at all zzso levels can be zzso This is an independent contrast zzso Its maximum zzso occurs at zzso zzso and it is a zzso improvement over the best case zzso zzso zzso for zzso strain zzso zzso phantom zzso confirm the essential features of the zzso zzso show that modeling of the zzso elastic behavior has the potential to both increase zzso in elasticity imaging and provide a new independent mechanism for tissue zzso
