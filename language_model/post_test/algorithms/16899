To introduce a novel technique, based on a zzso model and zzso inversion recovery zzso for the zzso evaluation of the fractional pulmonary blood volume zzso 

Ten healthy volunteers and one patient with focal lung destruction underwent examination with conventional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso was evaluated zzso analyzing three consecutive measurement zzso In order to evaluate the sensitivity of zzso the influence of gravitation on zzso values along the zzso direction was zzso zzso two zzso zzso maps of each volunteer in zzso and prone position were acquired and zzso A comparison of patient images from zzso dynamic zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed zzso 

The statistical evaluation showed significant similarity within the volunteer group, proving zzso The detected slope of the zzso values in zzso direction for both zzso and prone position demonstrated the sensitivity of zzso to the zzso effect on the pulmonary blood zzso The comparison between CT, zzso and zzso patient zzso showed high similarity in dimension and location of the pathological part of the lung zzso 

The introduced zzso is able to provide zzso maps of the zzso without the application of intravenous contrast zzso
