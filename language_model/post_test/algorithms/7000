According to improvement of zzso system, zzso zzso with zzso have been applied to the left zzso zzso In this study 24 patients without zzso demonstrated by stress zzso and rest zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso To evaluate left zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso data, the left zzso end zzso volumes zzso were compared between zzso zzso zzso zzso and Emory zzso zzso zzso as well as between zzso based on the same zzso zzso The zzso values with zzso data zzso using zzso were well correlated with those using zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso demonstrated well correlation between zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and the zzso value with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso However, zzso processing induced significantly lower zzso compared with zzso In contrast, zzso were significantly higher than zzso in zzso zzso The zzso errors zzso zzso from zzso were more evident according to the left zzso volume zzso On the other hand, zzso error showed no tendency associated with the left zzso zzso From these results, a careful strategy for selection of zzso and zzso should be necessary to assessment of quantitative values derived from zzso zzso data because of interaction with zzso zzso and zzso
