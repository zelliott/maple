A zzso rhythm band in zzso blood zzso in awake human subjects was studied in zzso time series of five subjects relaxing zzso or practicing zzso relaxation zzso training, or zzso Time series analysis used zzso zzso zzso distribution zzso zzso scan zzso method, and linear fast zzso transform zzso zzso This zzso rhythm band caused phase synchronization with zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso number zzso ratios for extended zzso During wave zzso the zzso rhythm band was zzso causing the zzso rhythm band to also appear in zzso intervals and zzso blood pressure zzso If phase synchronization of the zzso rhythm band with zzso was established at a zzso zzso number ratio, it was maintained and resulted in zzso of all zzso zzso at this zzso zzso cardiovascular and respiratory zzso at about zzso zzso did not affect the appearance of the zzso rhythm band in the zzso zzso zzso Recent evidence suggests the emergence of the zzso rhythm band and zzso phase synchronization to result from zzso phase transitions operational in the network of lower zzso zzso and associated zzso zzso zzso These findings corroborate our notion of the zzso rhythm band as a marker of the zzso mode of zzso
