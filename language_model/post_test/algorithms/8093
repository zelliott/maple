zzso can be kept for times longer than zzso if it is maintained in a zzso state, from which transitions are not zzso Another, more zzso way to slower the relaxation process consists in the use of zzso zzso Here both methods have been applied and the zzso zzso by zzso zzso rate has been measured at two different magnetic zzso earth field and zero zzso While relaxation is very slow at earth field, it becomes faster at zero field: this rather unexpected finding has been explained on the basis of zzso mixing between zzso and zzso
