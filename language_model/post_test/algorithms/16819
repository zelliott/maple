zzso and chain length effects on structural behaviors of liquid crystal zzso were examined by a zzso model and the zzso zzso Carlo zzso zzso The zzso investigated in this study are composed of the zzso zzso liquid crystal zzso and its zzso zzso of the study show that the average energy decreases zzso more zzso as the cluster size zzso the number of zzso zzso With the increasing cluster size, the equilibrium zzso of the zzso changes gradually from a zzso structure (for the smaller systems) to a zzso cluster (for the larger zzso The order zzso of the system reduces with the transition of the equilibrium zzso Regarding the chain length effect, the zzso equilibrium zzso (for the smaller systems) was observed more close to a pipe as the length of the tail zzso chain of the derivatives zzso However, due to the flexibility of the tail zzso chain, the pipe zzso of the system zzso slightly about its zzso group as the tail extends zzso
