Independent component analysis zzso is a family of zzso learning zzso that have proven useful for the analysis of the electroencephalogram zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso data set into a basis of zzso temporally independent components zzso that are learned from the zzso As with any zzso a concern with using zzso is the degree to which the estimated zzso are zzso An zzso may not be reliable if zzso was trained on insufficient data, if zzso training was stopped prematurely or at a local minimum (for some zzso or if multiple global zzso were zzso zzso evidence of zzso reliability is critical for the credibility of zzso zzso In this paper, we present a new zzso for assessing the reliability of zzso based on applying zzso separately to zzso of a data zzso This zzso improves upon existing methods in that it considers both zzso scalp zzso and zzso uses a zzso zzso threshold for accepting zzso as reliable, and requires applying zzso only three times per data zzso As evidence of the zzso zzso we show that the method can perform comparably to more time intensive zzso zzso and depends in a reasonable manner on the amount of training zzso Finally, using the method we illustrate the importance of checking the reliability of zzso by demonstrating that zzso reliability is dramatically increased by removing the mean zzso at each channel for each zzso of data rather than the mean zzso in a zzso zzso
