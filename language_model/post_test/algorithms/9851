We have carried out a dynamic nuclear polarization zzso study of zzso spins of zzso solid zzso containing zzso at zzso By the aid of zzso free zzso produced by the zzso the zzso sample was zzso polarized up to the polarization of zzso at zzso K and zzso zzso which is about zzso times larger than that at the zzso equilibrium at an ambient zzso Unlike persistent free zzso such as zzso and zzso free zzso commonly used for zzso the zzso free zzso immediately zzso by zzso We propose that free zzso produced by zzso are zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso samples should remain longer than that of the samples having persistent free zzso because of the absence of the free zzso after the melting in the zzso zzso
