We propose a method for quantitative characterization of spatial zzso patterns with zzso such as surface fracture patterns, leaf vein networks, and patterns of urban zzso Such patterns are not well characterized by purely zzso zzso also patterns that both look different and result from different zzso processes can have similar zzso A local geometric zzso angles formed by the different branches at zzso complement zzso information and allow the zzso of the large scale spatial zzso of the zzso For patterns that grow over time, such as fracture lines on the surface of zzso the rank assigned by our method to each individual segment of the pattern zzso the order of appearance of that zzso We apply the method to various zzso patterns and find a continuous but sharp zzso between two classes of spatial zzso zzso and zzso The former class results from a sequential growth process and presents large scale organization, and the latter presents local, but not zzso zzso
