zzso hazard models with zzso random effects zzso acting zzso on the baseline hazard have recently become a topic of an intensive zzso One of the main practical problems related to the models is the zzso of zzso To this aim, several approaches based on the zzso zzso have been zzso The major difference between these approaches is the method of the zzso of conditional expectations required at the zzso In this paper an alternative zzso of the zzso zzso is proposed, in which the expected values are zzso with the use of the zzso zzso The method is zzso less demanding than the approaches developed zzso Its performance is assessed based on a simulation study and compared to a zzso based zzso approach proposed by zzso and zzso zzso
