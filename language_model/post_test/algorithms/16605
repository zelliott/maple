zzso is inevitable in membrane zzso zzso due to the complex nature of activated zzso which contains a broad variety of potential zzso zzso cakes that build up from sludge particles are traditionally highly zzso due to both the deformation of the individual sludge particles and the zzso of these particles in the zzso However, this phenomenon has been little examined in studies of zzso mechanisms in zzso zzso This study examines the properties of the cake layer, modeling the cake buildup and specific cake resistance zzso including zzso in terms of zzso zzso The changes in zzso resistance during zzso pressure zzso zzso in an zzso setup were simulated using an empirical pressure dependence of the specific cake resistance and a simple mass balance zzso The total change in zzso resistance in each zzso step could be divided into an initial rapid change in specific cake resistance due to filter cake zzso followed by simple cake zzso By including cake zzso in this simple model, the model fitted the data with high zzso We demonstrated that zzso should be considered when describing cake zzso in zzso
