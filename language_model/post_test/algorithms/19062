zzso zzso zzso zzso has been widely used to investigate brain zzso changes in pathological conditions as well as for normal development and zzso In particular, zzso changes are vital to the understanding of progression but these studies are typically designed for specific regions of zzso To analyze changes in these regions traditional statistical methods are often employed to zzso group differences which are measured against the zzso found in a control zzso However, in some cases, rather than collecting multiple subjects into two groups, it is necessary and more zzso to analyze the data for individual zzso There is also a need for understanding changes in a single subject without prior information regarding the spatial distribution of the pathology, but no formal statistical framework exists for these zzso analyses of zzso In this study, we present zzso zzso zzso analysis of diffusion zzso a whole brain analysis method for detecting localized zzso changes between two separate points in time of any given subject, without any prior hypothesis about where changes might zzso zzso the nature of zzso that it is calculated from multiple zzso images of each region, zzso testing, a zzso hypothesis testing technique, was modified for the analysis of serial zzso data and implemented for zzso hypothesis tests of diffusion metric changes, as well as for zzso cluster analysis to correct for multiple zzso We describe zzso in detail and present results from zzso Carlo simulation supporting the zzso of the technique as well as illustrative examples from a healthy subject and patients in the early stages of multiple zzso
