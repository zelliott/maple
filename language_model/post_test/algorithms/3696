We present an analysis of the representation of images as the zzso of their transform with zzso zzso zzso Such a representation is a model for complex cells in the early stage of visual processing and of high technical usefulness for image understanding, because it makes the representation insensitive to small local zzso We show that if the images are band limited and of zero mean, then reconstruction from the zzso is unique up to the sign for almost all zzso
