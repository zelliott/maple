zzso systemic therapy zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso has resulted in a zzso complete response zzso in zzso of primary breast cancer zzso This study was aimed at the identification of a gene expression signature in diagnostic core biopsy tissue samples that predicts zzso 

Core biopsy samples from patients with zzso primary breast cancer, zzso enrolled onto two phase I and II trials evaluating zzso zzso zzso zzso and GE zzso followed by Doc zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso were snap frozen and subjected to zzso expression zzso A signature predicting zzso was discovered in the training set zzso applying a support zzso machine algorithm, and performance of this zzso was validated on the independent test set zzso by receiver operator characteristics zzso 

We identified a signature consisting of 512 zzso which was enriched in genes involved in transforming growth factor beta and zzso signaling zzso that predicts zzso with a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso and an overall accuracy of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso Apart from our signature, only zzso zzso was an independent predictor of zzso in zzso zzso 

In conclusion, our gene expression signature allows prediction of zzso to zzso containing G, zzso and Doc with unprecedented high overall accuracy and zzso
