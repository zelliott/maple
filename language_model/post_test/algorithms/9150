zzso zzso zzso was developed to use zzso from zzso sources for high-resolution imaging of the internal structure of a flat zzso from a series of zzso projection zzso The projections are acquired by zzso of the sample under different rotation angles where the object rotation axis is inclined with respect to the beam zzso This yields for zzso extended objects a more uniform average transmitted intensity during sample rotation compared with zzso zzso zzso The reconstruction problem of zzso cannot be reduced to a zzso zzso case (as for zzso zzso since each single slice perpendicular to the rotation axis requires a zzso region on the detector as input data for all projection zzso This paper describes a zzso efficient reconstruction procedure based on filtered zzso zzso adapted to the zzso acquisition zzso From the zzso slice zzso we derive a framework for zzso image reconstruction and outline zzso details of the generic zzso zzso Different approaches reducing the reconstruction time by means of parallel and distributed zzso are considered and zzso
