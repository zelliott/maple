The Composite International zzso zzso zzso has been developed as a state-of-the-art, structured diagnostic zzso designed to diagnose psychiatric disorders across cultures and zzso Partly because it has been validated in a number of countries and cultural settings, the zzso has become widely accepted as a diagnostic instrument in zzso and clinical zzso 

As part of a larger study of psychiatric disorders in a zzso primary care setting, we tried to clarify the limitations of the zzso in diagnosing zzso symptoms among Latino zzso 

zzso sections of the zzso were administered in English or Spanish to new patients seeking primary care services at an zzso zzso community zzso Interviews were tape recorded and pertinent passages were transcribed for qualitative zzso 

One zzso four hundred and fifty six new patients, zzso 4 ethnic groups: Central zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso diagnostic zzso for zzso were examined in relation to the transcriptions of interviews for Latino patients whom the zzso diagnosed as zzso 

The zzso led to the inaccurate identification of zzso symptoms resulting from such issues as financial barriers to zzso access, cultural syndromes that were not recognized by Western medicine, and language differences between patients and zzso Like other structured instruments, the zzso also forced a range of complex experience into a zzso interview zzso 

Despite the advantages of such structured instruments as the zzso their capacity to reach accurate psychiatric diagnoses in some cultural groups and clinical settings requires zzso These findings also call into question the relatively high rates of zzso among Latino patients reported in previous studies that have used structured psychiatric diagnostic zzso
