During normal kidney function, there are routinely wide swings in zzso zzso fluid flow and zzso changes in zzso zzso across zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso occurs in the absence of any substantial change in cell volume, and is thus a challenge to coordinate zzso membrane zzso entry with zzso membrane zzso zzso In this work, linear optimal control theory is applied to generate a zzso of regulated zzso that could achieve this zzso A previously developed model of rat zzso zzso zzso is zzso about a zzso reference zzso the approximate linear system is recast as a zzso system; and a zzso equation is solved to yield the optimal linear feedback that zzso zzso zzso cell volume, and cell zzso The first observation is that optimal feedback control is largely zzso to three zzso zzso cell volume, cell electrical potential, and lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by cell volume zzso cell zzso zzso zzso by electrical potential or zzso pressure act to stabilize zzso flux and cell zzso This feedback control is zzso in a tracking problem, in which zzso zzso flux varies over a factor of two, in order to represent a substantial excursion of zzso zzso The resulting control parameters consist of two terms, an autonomous term and a feedback term, and both terms include zzso on both zzso and zzso cell zzso Overall, the increase in zzso flux is achieved with zzso of zzso zzso exchange and zzso zzso with increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso and with increased zzso zzso zzso The zzso of activated zzso emerges as a testable hypothesis of the molecular basis for zzso zzso It is suggested that the autonomous control component at each cell membrane could represent the zzso effects of zzso zzso
