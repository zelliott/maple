A measurement device for zzso and simultaneous control of antennas during regional zzso zzso zzso and, zzso the zzso of the power distribution in the interior of patients are essential zzso for further technological zzso zzso at this, the feasibility of an zzso electric field sensor was investigated during clinical zzso zzso 

The zzso electric field zzso sensor is based on zzso zzso and the zzso zzso structure, and was tested in an earlier phantom zzso For this study, a mechanical scanning device was developed allowing the registration of the zzso during clinical zzso Data were recorded along a curve in the water zzso of the zzso 60 zzso of the zzso zzso system zzso zzso Medical zzso Salt Lake City, zzso close to the base points of the flat zzso zzso zzso The results were compared with modeling calculations using the zzso zzso zzso zzso For the latter, different antenna models were zzso For systematic registration of the zzso zzso in zzso and phase, we employed an elliptical lamp phantom with zzso ring zzso with saline zzso and an elliptical zzso phantom with acrylic glass zzso Further zzso were carried out during the treatment of 5 patients with 20 zzso zzso 

Data of both phantom and patient zzso can be zzso described by the zzso method, if the antenna model is refined by taking into account the zzso form of the zzso and the special zzso environment of the feeding zzso Phase zzso can be entered ex zzso for correction in the calculation zzso A comparison of amplifier power measurement zzso and backward power) and zzso zzso scans near the antenna base points demonstrates that zzso zzso between antennas and patient are a necessity for the appropriate characterization of antenna radiation zzso These zzso are sensitive to variations of the zzso medium in position and shape, and can be correctly predicted with current zzso However, the differences between different patients are moderate and unspecific in both calculations and zzso with fluctuations at maximum of 30 degrees in zzso and zzso in zzso 

The measurement method presented here turned out to be a practical tool for online registration of zzso in zzso and zzso along arbitrary zzso in a water zzso or zzso It can be zzso to evaluate antenna design and modeling calculations and zzso thus, to a better understanding of complicated zzso zzso In clinical routine, it can be employed as input for zzso zzso planning and, finally, for the realization of online control with subsequent zzso of the power distribution in the zzso
