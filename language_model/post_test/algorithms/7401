In recent years, both zzso zzso zzso array and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso have been widely used for the study of schizophrenia zzso In addition, a few studies have been reported zzso both zzso data and zzso data for comprehensive zzso 

In this study, a novel sparse representation based variable selection zzso method has been proposed and tested on a simulation data set to demonstrate its zzso zzso Then the zzso method was applied to an zzso analysis of two different zzso data sets, a zzso zzso zzso data set and a functional resonance imaging zzso data set, including 92 cases and 116 zzso zzso for the disease were identified and validated with a zzso zzso approach followed by a leave one out zzso zzso Then we compared the results with that of a previously reported sparse representation based feature selection zzso 

zzso showed that zzso from our proposed zzso method gave significantly higher zzso accuracy in discriminating zzso patients from healthy controls than that of the previous reported sparse representation zzso Furthermore, using zzso from both data sets led to better zzso accuracy than using single type of zzso which suggests the advantage of zzso analysis of different types of zzso 

The proposed zzso zzso is effective in identifying significant zzso for complicated disease as zzso zzso different types of data zzso zzso and zzso zzso may identify complementary zzso zzso the diagnosis accuracy of the zzso
