zzso infection of old zzso zzso zzso zzso is frequent among zzso zzso It is a recognized cause of zzso and other infectious zzso Additionally, old zzso zzso may be zzso of other zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate whether zzso infection of old zzso zzso is a cause of a chronic inflammatory state in zzso zzso 

This study was performed in two zzso In the first phase zzso 1), 22 patients with clinically proven zzso infection of old zzso zzso were identified, and data on zzso weekly zzso dose, and zzso levels were collected zzso Comparisons were made between values obtained zzso and zzso zzso In the second phase zzso zzso we examined whether the presence of a chronic inflammatory state is associated with zzso zzso infection in old zzso zzso Twenty zzso patients were identified with chronic inflammatory state based on zzso dose zzso zzso serum zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Among these patients, we found eight with old zzso zzso We then performed zzso white blood cell zzso scans on the eight patients to screen for zzso infection of old zzso zzso The zzso with positive zzso scan were zzso and zzso Data on zzso zzso zzso serum zzso zzso and zzso were obtained at 2 months following zzso zzso and compared to zzso zzso 

In study 1, the 22 patients with zzso infection of old zzso zzso exhibited profound anemia and zzso Their mean zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso which improved to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 months after zzso zzso Their mean serum zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso which improved to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 months after zzso zzso Their mean zzso zzso zzso fell from zzso zzso 350 to zzso zzso 455 zzso zzso zzso In study 2, among the 8 patients with chronic inflammatory state and old zzso zzso 6 zzso had positive zzso scans and underwent surgical zzso that proved bacterial zzso Upon zzso the zzso data showed a remarkable improvement in the following zzso weekly zzso zzso ratio from zzso zzso 137 to 254 zzso 28 zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso values from zzso zzso 126 zzso to 247 zzso 42 zzso zzso zzso zzso and plasma zzso from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values also improved from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plasma iron zzso did not appreciably differ from baseline zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso infection of old zzso zzso is a common cause of zzso resistance and chronic inflammatory state among zzso zzso zzso of old zzso zzso with zzso infection is associated with resolution of markers of chronic inflammatory zzso
