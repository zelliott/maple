zzso analysis has proven to be a valuable tool for revealing features used to perform visual tasks in zzso We use this methodology to investigate how the magnitude of noise influences detection mechanisms, and more specifically, to examine whether observers use a consistent zzso template across noise magnitude as is often assumed in zzso The experiments consist of zzso detection of a zzso target profile in white noise with zzso contrast levels ranging from zzso to zzso Target contrast was manipulated to maintain a performance level of approximately zzso correct at each noise zzso The estimated zzso images are presented along with a spatial frequency analysis that consists of zzso averages of the frequency zzso The resulting frequency weights show significant zzso differences across noise levels, as do sampling efficiencies derived from these frequency zzso At low levels of external noise, the zzso images are attenuated at low spatial zzso giving rise to a more zzso zzso At high noise levels, the spatial frequency weights have much less zzso zzso making them closer to an ideal matched zzso Our results provide direct evidence against the notion of a single consistent zzso template zzso detection across different levels of zzso
