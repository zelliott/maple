We study zzso zzso current zzso and chaotic dynamics in zzso zzso zzso carbon zzso using the zzso drift diffusion zzso The current zzso under a zzso zzso bias originates from the negative differential zzso of carbon zzso which zzso the motion and recycling of unstable zzso zzso simulation indicates that different zzso zzso modes appear when an external zzso zzso zzso is superimposed to the zzso zzso bias and its driving zzso zzso The appearance of different zzso zzso zzso including periodic and chaotic, is attributed to the competition between the natural zzso and the external driving zzso The transitions between periodic and chaotic states are carefully studied using zzso methods, such as zzso zzso phase portraits, first return map, and zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso displays an interesting and complex transition picture with the driving zzso as the control zzso
