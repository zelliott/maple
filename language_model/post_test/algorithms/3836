zzso status from both zzso and mixed zzso blood was analyzed by reliable methods in 39 zzso zzso These measured data were checked with zzso oxygen parameters by new calculation zzso zzso oxygen contents were higher than directly measured values but there was a highly significant correlation between zzso zzso and measured zzso mean values were not significantly different but there was no correlation between zzso A large difference was observed between measured and zzso evaluation of zzso affinity without correlation between zzso In hyperkinetic patients, no correlation was observed between zzso zzso and the increase of cardiac zzso So, in these patients the new zzso equations were not valid to determine traditional oxygen parameters from only zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the new zzso parameters appeared frankly zzso
