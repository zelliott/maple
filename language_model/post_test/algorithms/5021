It is shown that a form of the zzso equations representing large-scale activity in interacting neural populations can implement a form of the zzso zzso for color zzso It has also been shown recently that a color enhancement zzso closely related to zzso can be derived from a zzso zzso It follows that a zzso principle exists for equations of zzso zzso Thus the zzso equations are the zzso solution of the zzso of an energy zzso This result suggests many interesting neural zzso
