Liver iron zzso by zzso has become zzso zzso zzso fitting to the zzso signal zzso has some advantages but is slower and more vulnerable to noise than zzso zzso We present a fast, zzso mapping zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso divides the entire liver into zzso groups of zzso sorted by rapid relative zzso zzso zzso within each group of zzso were zzso and fit using a zzso zzso 

The developed zzso worked about 30 times faster than the traditional zzso approach and generated zzso maps zzso and zzso zzso No systematic difference was observed in median zzso values with a zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso errors were also under zzso Small systematic differences were observed in the right tail of the zzso distribution resulting in slightly lower mean zzso values zzso of zzso and moderately lower zzso of zzso values for the zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso provided the best zzso giving a lower error of zzso zzso 

The zzso yielded comparable zzso and higher accuracy than the zzso The method is suitable for zzso maps in other zzso and zzso
