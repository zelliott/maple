This paper describes the zzso zzso zzso of power system stabilizer zzso by using the reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso The zzso model estimates the zzso partial derivatives of the zzso zzso after identifying the trajectory sensitivities, which can be zzso from the hybrid system modeling with a set of zzso zzso structure for a power zzso Then, any zzso controller in the power system can be zzso by achieving a desired performance measure, zzso represented by an objective function zzso In this paper, the output zzso zzso of the zzso which is used to improve zzso zzso zzso performance during a large zzso is zzso tuned exploiting the zzso estimated by the zzso zzso Its performances are evaluated with several case studies on both zzso infinite bus zzso and zzso power system zzso by zzso zzso In particular, all zzso parameters of multiple zzso on zzso benchmark zzso zzso power system are zzso to be robust against various disturbances by using the weighted sum of the zzso
