To zzso evaluate the use of lean body weight zzso as the main zzso of the volume and rate of contrast material administration during zzso row zzso zzso of the zzso 

This zzso study had institutional review board zzso All patients gave written informed zzso Four protocols were zzso Standard protocol involved 125 zzso of zzso injected at 4 zzso Total body weight zzso protocol involved zzso g zzso per zzso of zzso zzso zzso and measured zzso protocols involved zzso g of zzso per zzso and zzso g of zzso per zzso calculated or measured zzso for men and women, zzso zzso rate used for the three experimental protocols was determined zzso on the basis of the calculated volume of contrast zzso zzso zzso zzso during portal zzso phase were obtained in liver, portal zzso and zzso for each group and were summed for each zzso zzso enhancement zzso in same group was measured with zzso zzso zzso zzso test was used to compare the three experimental protocols with the standard zzso 

Data analysis was performed in 101 patients zzso or 26 patients per group), including 56 men and 45 women zzso age, 53 zzso Average summed zzso values for standard, zzso calculated zzso and measured zzso protocols were zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 51, 433 zzso zzso 50, and zzso zzso zzso 33, respectively zzso zzso not significant for zzso zzso test results for summed zzso data for standard, zzso calculated zzso and measured zzso protocols were 40 zzso 29, 38 zzso 33 zzso zzso zzso 35 zzso 35 zzso zzso zzso and 26 zzso 19 zzso zzso zzso zzso 

By excluding highly variable but poorly zzso zzso tissue from calculation of contrast medium dose, the measured zzso protocol may zzso zzso enhancement zzso while maintaining satisfactory zzso and vascular zzso
