In a recent retrograde tracing study in the zzso zzso we found that regions in the zzso zzso gray zzso producing different call types when zzso zzso receive their input largely from the same zzso The aim of the present study was to find out, whether there are quantitative differences in this zzso For this reason, we counted zzso labeled zzso in various brain regions after injections of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into three different zzso zzso sites: one site producing zzso contact calls zzso a second site producing slightly aversive social zzso calls zzso and a third site producing highly aversive defensive threat calls zzso Cell counting was carried out by the help of the optical zzso zzso Six zzso monkeys were used, two for each call zzso In some regions, marked differences in the number of zzso labeled cells between the three call type groups zzso Such regions are the zzso zzso zzso area, zzso zzso anterior zzso cortex, zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso In some of these regions, the number of zzso labeled cells correlated positively zzso zzso or zzso zzso area, zzso zzso zzso with the zzso of the zzso call zzso Other regions of interest, zzso the zzso prefrontal and zzso cortex, zzso and zzso regions surrounding the zzso revealed no clear differences in their zzso projections to the different zzso zzso zzso The results make clear that distinct zzso regions in the zzso receive a zzso similar but zzso differentiated zzso
