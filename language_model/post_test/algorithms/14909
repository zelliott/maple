It has recently been shown that orientation and zzso position, both of which are mapped in primary visual cortex, can show correlated jumps zzso & Gilbert, zzso This is not consistent with maps generated by zzso zzso zzso zzso where changes in mapped variables tend to be zzso We show that it is possible to obtain correlated jumps by introducing a zzso component zzso zzso into zzso zzso This zzso to a volume learning mechanism where synaptic zzso depends not only on the spread of a signal from a zzso active zzso but also requires zzso activity at a zzso The maps generated by this zzso show zzso across which both orientation and zzso position change zzso but these regions, which include the orientation zzso are also aligned with the edges of zzso dominance zzso and this is not a realistic feature of cortical zzso We conclude that cortical maps are better modeled by standard, zzso volume learning, perhaps coupled with some other mechanism zzso that of zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso to produce receptive field zzso
