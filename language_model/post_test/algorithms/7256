The effects of the atomic basis set and of the zzso zzso functional on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been investigated by considering the zzso zzso zzso These studies have been completed by tackling the reliability of the same methods for predicting the zzso zzso spectrum of the same zzso The main conclusions are zzso the zzso zzso functional is suitable to predict the relative zzso zzso zzso provided a zzso factor is used, the root mean square error on the zzso zzso goes down to 18 zzso zzso zzso basis sets and in particular the zzso basis set is a good compromise between accuracy and zzso needs, zzso basis set effects on the zzso zzso are larger than those of the zzso functional, and zzso the zzso zzso and zzso basis sets provide consistent zzso zzso
