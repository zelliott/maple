Shaped by evolutionary zzso sensory systems often represent zzso relevant stimuli with higher zzso than other zzso The stimulus dependence of neural reliability could therefore provide an important clue in a search for relevant sensory zzso We explore this relation and introduce a novel zzso zzso that allows one to find stimuli that are reliably represented by the sensory system under zzso To assess the quality of a neural zzso we use stimulus reconstruction zzso The zzso starts with the presentation of an initial stimulus zzso white zzso The evoked spike train is recorded and used to reconstruct the stimulus zzso Within a zzso setup, this reconstruction is then played back to the sensory zzso zzso this zzso the newly generated stimuli can be better and better zzso We demonstrate the feasibility of this method by applying it to auditory zzso zzso in zzso Our data show that the optimal stimuli often exhibit pronounced zzso periods that are interrupted by short, yet intense zzso Similar results are obtained for simple model zzso and suggest that these stimuli are zzso with high reliability by a large class of zzso
