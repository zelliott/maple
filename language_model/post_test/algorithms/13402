The direct zzso sequencing of zzso material from complex zzso of bacteria, zzso viruses and zzso has yielded new insights into the structure of microbial zzso For example, analysis of zzso data has revealed the existence of previously unknown microbial zzso whose spatial zzso are limited by environmental conditions, ecological competition, and zzso zzso However, differences in zzso that might lead biologists to designate two microbes as zzso distinct need not necessarily imply differences in ecological zzso zzso there is a growing need for large-scale analysis of the distribution of microbial function across zzso Here, we present a framework for investigating the zzso of microbial function by analyzing the distribution of protein families zzso from environmental sequence data across a global collection of zzso We map over zzso protein sequences from zzso reads from the Global Ocean zzso zzso to zzso see zzso protein families, generating a protein family relative abundance zzso that describes the distribution of each protein family across zzso We then use zzso zzso zzso zzso to approximate these protein family profiles as linear combinations of a small number of ecological zzso Each component has a characteristic functional profile and site zzso Our approach identifies common functional signatures within several of the zzso We use our method as a filter to estimate functional distance between sites, and find that an zzso measure of functional distance is more strongly correlated with environmental distance than a comparable zzso zzso We also find that functional distance is more strongly correlated with environmental distance than with geographic distance, in agreement with prior zzso We identify similar protein functions in several components and suggest that functional zzso across zzso samples could lead to future methods for zzso functional zzso We conclude by discussing how zzso and other dimension reduction methods, can help enable a zzso functional description of marine zzso
