The mathematical structure of Sudoku puzzles is akin to hard constraint satisfaction problems lying at the basis of many applications, including protein folding and the zzso problem of glassy spin zzso Via an exact mapping of Sudoku into a zzso zzso zzso system, here we show that the difficulty of Sudoku translates into transient chaotic behavior exhibited by this zzso We also show that the escape rate zzso an zzso of transient chaos, provides a zzso measure of the zzso zzso that zzso well with human difficulty zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be used to define a zzso scale for puzzle zzso with easy puzzles having 0 zzso zzso zzso 1, medium ones 1 zzso zzso zzso 2, hard with 2 zzso zzso zzso 3 and zzso with zzso zzso zzso To our best knowledge, there are no known puzzles with zzso zzso zzso
