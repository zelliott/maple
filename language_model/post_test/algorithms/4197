This paper proposes a zzso control system that uses a tracking error constraint and zzso fuzzy neural networks zzso to achieve a prescribed tracking performance for a zzso zzso dynamic zzso A new constraint variable was defined to generate the virtual control that forces the tracking error to fall within prescribed zzso An zzso zzso was also used to obtain the required improvement on the approximation performances in order to avoid calculating the explosive number of terms generated by the zzso steps of traditional zzso zzso The zzso and convergence of the zzso system was confirmed based on the zzso stability zzso The prescribed performance of the proposed control scheme was validated by using it to control the prescribed error of a zzso system and a robot zzso
