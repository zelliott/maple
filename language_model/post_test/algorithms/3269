A system of two coupled zzso zzso is zzso zzso of complex zzso is governed by differential equations with periodic zzso continuous dependence of the zzso on zzso The zzso map is derived zzso With the exclusion of the overall phase, on which the evolution of other variables does not zzso the zzso map is reduced to three-dimensional zzso zzso It possesses an zzso of zzso located on an zzso zzso Computer zzso of the cone criterion confirms the zzso nature of the zzso in the zzso zzso Some results of zzso studies of the dynamics for the coupled zzso are zzso including the zzso portraits, zzso zzso and the power spectral zzso
