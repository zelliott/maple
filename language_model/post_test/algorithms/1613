zzso zzso cells migrate with directional persistence by alternating left and right turns, even in the absence of external zzso For example, zzso zzso cells crawl by extending distinct zzso in an alternating zzso zzso The mechanisms underlying this zzso behavior, however, remain zzso Here we propose a new zzso zzso and Memory zzso model for understanding the zzso zzso extension of zzso zzso elements of previous models, we consider the cell zzso as an excitable system and include global zzso of new zzso while a zzso is zzso With the novel hypothesis that zzso activity makes the local zzso temporarily more zzso creating a memory of previous zzso zzso model reproduces zzso observed zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso model makes four new predictions concerning zzso zzso To test these predictions we develop an zzso that detects zzso via zzso zzso of individual membrane zzso Data from zzso experiments agrees with all four predictions of the model, revealing that zzso placement is a zzso process affected by the dynamics of previous zzso The model is also compatible with known limits of zzso zzso In addition to providing a zzso approach to studying zzso cell motion, the zzso model provides a general framework for future models, and suggests directions for new research regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying directional zzso
