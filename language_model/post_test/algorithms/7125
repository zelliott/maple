The use of near infrared zzso zzso combined with zzso methods have been widely used in petroleum and zzso industry and provides suitable methods for process control and quality zzso The zzso support zzso machines zzso has demonstrated to be a powerful zzso tool for development of zzso models due to its ability to zzso modeling and with high zzso capability and these characteristics can be especially important for treating near infrared zzso zzso data of complex zzso such as petroleum zzso zzso In this work, a study on the performance of the support zzso machines zzso for zzso was carried out, using zzso and zzso applied to near infrared zzso zzso data of different types of zzso that make up the diesel pool in a petroleum zzso light gas oil, heavy gas oil, zzso zzso zzso heavy zzso and external zzso In addition to these six streams, the diesel final blend produced in the zzso was added to complete the data zzso zzso and zzso zzso models with 2, 4, 6 and 7 classes were developed for comparison between its results and also for comparison with the soft independent modeling of class zzso zzso models zzso It is demonstrated the superior performance of zzso models especially using zzso for development of zzso models for 6 and 7 classes leading to an improvement of sensitivity on validation sample sets of zzso and zzso respectively, when compared to zzso models, providing better identification of chemical compositions of different diesel pool zzso zzso
