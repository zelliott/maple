Many studies have shown that zzso changes the zzso zzso properties of the vessel wall and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso slope could therefore provide an early indication of zzso and the differentiation between low, mild and zzso plaque within the zzso However, the traditional reference phantom method that fits the power spectrum in a region of interest fails to accurately estimate the zzso zzso for small irregular shaped zzso plaque zzso This zzso was primarily due to partial volume effects and the unknown zzso zzso of the plaque zzso We have developed a method based on the zzso method that zzso the difference in the acoustic power above and below the sample to accurately zzso values of the zzso zzso ex zzso Our results demonstrate that this approach overcomes the two drawbacks mentioned earlier and provides accurate estimates of the zzso zzso slope for small excised tissue zzso
