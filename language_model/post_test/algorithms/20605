A new method based on the zzso transform has been used for the quantitative zzso of the zzso characteristics of the zzso Images of the zzso were acquired into the digital format using the optical zzso zzso camera, and frame zzso For each zzso in the image, the region of interest for the zzso of the zzso head was selected using the density difference between the zzso head and zzso The boundary of the zzso head was zzso with an zzso and represented by five zzso These five parameters representing an zzso have been investigated by applying the zzso transform zzso During the searching procedure using the zzso zzso we restricted the searching volume minimally and moved the next searching volume to the direction showing the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Also, we increased the zzso resolution from the three zzso distance to the one zzso zzso For the tested images, head boundaries of the zzso were estimated with an error of 1/2 zzso distance, and zzso parameters were calculated by the equations without further image zzso This new method separates zzso head based on the geometrical characteristic of the zzso and zzso zzso parameters simply from the derived zzso
