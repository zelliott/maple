This paper introduces a novel statistical method that can identify relevant zzso features in brain signals to distinguish between zzso The feature of interest is the spectrum which characterizes the distribution of a given zzso zzso (or power) across frequency zzso Brain signals are generally zzso in that the distribution of the zzso power across frequency changes over zzso The classical zzso analysis is not formally suitable for time series signals with zzso zzso This paper zzso the zzso zzso zzso Complex zzso basis function to capture the transient features of brain zzso The zzso basis consists of a set of localized zzso zzso zzso with a built-in mechanism for representing localized spectral zzso The best basis is first chosen that zzso group zzso in the zzso zzso However, not all spectral features extracted from the best basis may be useful for discrimination and zzso zzso A zzso scheme is further developed to remove irrelevant features from the best basis to improve accuracy for zzso In simulations the proposed zzso zzso method was able to consistently identify the most zzso zzso features and was able to correctly zzso signals at a high zzso The method was then applied to zzso data from a standard zzso zzso Discrimination between individuals with schizophrenia and a healthy comparison group confirmed the utility of the zzso
