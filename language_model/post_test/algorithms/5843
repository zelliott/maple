An extension of a previously proposed theory for the zzso of AIDS is presented and analyzed using a mathematical zzso zzso This theory is based on the observation that human zzso virus type 1 zzso predominantly zzso and replicates in zzso cells, and that the infection process within an infected individual is characterized by ongoing generation and selection of zzso zzso with increasing zzso zzso This evolutionary process is considered to be the reason for the gradual loss of zzso and the final destruction of the immune system observed in most zzso The extension presented here incorporates the effect of the permanently increasing zzso of zzso cell zzso as a result of the evolutionary zzso The presented model reproduces and possibly explains a wide variety of findings about the zzso infection zzso zzso results indicate that the effect of the initial dose is zzso and restricted to the primary phase of zzso According to the model predictions the impact of the zzso evolutionary speed is crucial for the progression to zzso An important progression zzso is the initial infection rate, being a component of the viral zzso zzso An influential role in disease progression seems to be played by the initial zzso cell zzso
