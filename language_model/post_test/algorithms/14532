This paper presents a new functional image fusion zzso which is the combination of zzso and zzso using zzso zzso zzso we designed the zzso experiments and obtained the zzso image data from different experimental zzso The brain activated regions were extracted by the zzso and zzso methods zzso zzso by constructing the zzso zzso of the source image, a new fusion rule based on the zzso and matching measure is proposed in various zzso Finally, the fused functional images are reconstructed by the inverse zzso pyramid zzso The results show that the zzso can retain the details of the source images and pinpoint exactly the brain functional area associated with the hand action, thus outperforming zzso or zzso for functional regions zzso
