The ability to search for and precisely compare similar zzso appearances within and across species has vast potential in plant science and genetic zzso The difficulty in doing so lies in the fact that many visual zzso data, especially visually observed zzso that often times cannot be directly measured zzso are in the form of text zzso and these descriptions are plagued by semantic zzso zzso and low zzso Though several zzso have been developed to zzso zzso (and zzso information and permit comparisons across species, these semantic issues persist and prevent precise analysis and retrieval of zzso A framework suitable for the modeling and analysis of precise zzso representations of such zzso appearances is zzso 

We have developed a new framework called the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso This work provides a novel quantitative view of descriptions of plant zzso that zzso existing zzso and zzso a zzso approach to capture and represent domain knowledge in a zzso zzso This is accomplished by means of a robust and accurate semantic mapping module that automatically maps high-level zzso to low-level zzso zzso from zzso zzso The framework was applied to two different plant species with semantic rules zzso and an zzso zzso Rule quality was evaluated and showed high quality rules for most zzso This framework also zzso automatic zzso of zzso images and can be adopted by different plant communities to aid in their zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for plants has been developed for more efficient and accurate management of visually observed zzso which play a significant role in plant zzso zzso The uniqueness of this framework is its ability to bridge the knowledge of zzso and plant science researchers by translating descriptions of visually observed zzso into zzso zzso zzso thus enabling the development of advanced information retrieval and zzso zzso analysis tools for the plant science zzso
