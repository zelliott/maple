zzso periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction zzso zzso imaging acquisitions, such as zzso and zzso remain subject to phase errors inherent to a zzso echo zzso which ultimately limits the applied zzso factor zzso of zzso echoes between each pair of zzso zzso zzso and, thus, scan time zzso This study introduces a new phase correction to zzso called zzso This technique employs zzso zzso which generate zzso phase error maps and are rotated in accordance with the data zzso to correct phase errors arising from zzso and system zzso The results demonstrate that with a small increase in scan time for collecting zzso zzso zzso had a superior immunity to the zzso artifacts when compared to standard zzso and recently proposed zzso with the high zzso factor zzso factor zzso zzso Thus, low specific zzso rate and short scan time can be achieved in zzso using a high zzso factor, whereas zzso related artifacts are zzso
