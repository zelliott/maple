An zzso image reconstruction procedure is described which is able to calculate zzso images within eight zzso zzso High initial zzso parameters are used which drop down towards about one during continuing zzso The parameters are determined zzso zzso gain of image quality during a sequence of zzso zzso zzso with simulated and measured data show that parameters derived from one data set may be widely used for other data zzso The acceleration of zzso reconstruction achieved by the zzso of optimum zzso parameters is important for large data sets, especially for fully zzso zzso
