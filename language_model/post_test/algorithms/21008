When zzso zzso travel through a short path that includes a relatively high concentration of aerosols, scattering phenomena can alter the power and zzso properties of the zzso significantly, causing zzso effects in the received zzso In many applications the design of the zzso zzso and receiver must consider adverse environmental zzso conditions to ensure the desired zzso We present an zzso model of zzso system operation when the optical path includes zzso for use in support of instrument design, simulations, and system zzso The model considers an optical path terminated with a solid object, although it can also be applied, with minor zzso to cases where the expected zzso occurs from zzso zzso The optical path zzso are characterized by their zzso and zzso zzso derived by the zzso theory from the concentration and particle size distribution of the zzso Other zzso include the zzso system parameters and instrument response function, and the model output is the zzso received zzso The model is demonstrated and zzso validated with military fog oil smoke for short ranges (several zzso The results are obtained with a zzso system operating at a wavelength of zzso zzso within and outside the zzso The model goodness of fit is evaluated using the statistical zzso of determination whose value ranged from zzso to zzso in this zzso
