zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and consecutive acquisition zzso scheme is zzso This zzso method allows the number of zzso points to be reduced by a factor of zzso without any broadening of the zzso Furthermore, the zzso ratio zzso can be increased up to zzso which can further save experimental time by another factor of zzso This method has been demonstrated with model samples and the zzso zzso In all cases, the total experimental time can be reduced by a factor of zzso without any loss of resolution and zzso with respect to what is necessary with the zzso zzso
