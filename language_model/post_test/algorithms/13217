zzso zzso zzso is a state-of-the-art zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso technique with multiple echo acquisitions, but its clinical utility remains to be zzso We compared the utility of zzso sequences among zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso and conventional zzso zzso zzso in routine clinical zzso Our results indicate that zzso can achieve zzso weighting more effectively than conventional zzso zzso and as effectively as zzso and requires a much shorter scan time than zzso
