Although the program zzso was originally intended for the experimental phasing of zzso it can also prove useful for expanding a small protein zzso to an almost complete zzso trace of the structure, given a zzso combination of native data resolution zzso than about zzso zzso and zzso zzso A correlation zzso zzso of more than zzso between the native structure factors and those calculated from the zzso trace appears to be a reliable indicator of success and has already been exploited in a number of zzso Here, a more detailed account of this usage of zzso for zzso solutions is zzso
