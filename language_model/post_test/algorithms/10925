zzso liver zzso on zzso zzso zzso images is a challenging task especially at sites where surrounding zzso zzso stomach, zzso have zzso similar to that of the liver and zzso reside at the liver zzso We have developed a method for semiautomatic zzso of the liver contours on zzso CT zzso The method zzso a snake zzso with a zzso zzso flow zzso field as its external zzso To improve the performance of the zzso snake in the zzso of the liver zzso an edge map was obtained with a zzso edge zzso followed by modifications using a liver template and a zzso removal zzso With the modified edge map, for which unwanted edges inside the liver were zzso the zzso field was zzso and an initial liver zzso was zzso The snake zzso was then applied to obtain the actual liver zzso This zzso was extended to segment the liver volume in a zzso fashion, where the result of the preceding slice constrained the zzso of the adjacent zzso zzso two-dimensional liver images from 20 zzso images with zzso zzso spreading throughout the zzso were delineated using this method, and also manually by a zzso for zzso The difference ratio, which is defined as the percentage ratio of zzso volume between the computer and the zzso results, ranged from zzso to zzso with a median value of zzso
