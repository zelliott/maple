In this study, a zzso carousel process based on a proper molecular imprinted zzso zzso zzso was developed for continuous separation of zzso from zzso and zzso For this task, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso first and used to pack the zzso columns of a zzso carousel zzso Prior to the experiment of the carousel process based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso a series of zzso experiments were performed to estimate the intrinsic parameters of the three heavy metal zzso and to find out the appropriate conditions of zzso and zzso The results from these zzso experiments and the additional computer simulations were then used for determination of the operating parameters of the zzso process under zzso Based on the determined operating zzso the zzso experiments were carried zzso It was confirmed from the experimental results that the proposed zzso process was markedly effective in separating zzso from zzso and zzso in a continuous mode with high purity and a relatively small zzso Thus, the zzso process developed in this study deserves sufficient attention in materials processing industries or zzso industries, where the selective separation of heavy metal zzso with the same charge has been a major zzso
