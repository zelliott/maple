As a matter of fact, in zzso dissolution is well known to be the method of choice for the pharmaceutical industry to develop effective zzso However, many experiments must be performed all along a new product life and they represent an zzso of work for zzso The purpose of this paper was to assess the relevance of new parameters obtained during zzso stage by Nuclear zzso zzso zzso experiments to better understand drug release zzso This study was carried out with three cellulose derivatives currently used as carrier zzso zzso cellulose zzso zzso cellulose zzso and zzso cellulose zzso zzso and zzso were produced with these three zzso zzso zzso and zzso as drug model zzso On the one hand, in zzso dissolution studies were performed with the rotating paddle method displaying the different release zzso of these three zzso zzso release for zzso steady release for zzso and sustained release for zzso On the other hand, the evolution of the zzso zzso relaxation time in zzso experiments during zzso zzso was zzso zzso findings shore up dissolution data, both depending on interactions between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso appears to be a valuable tool for zzso at an earlier stage of drug development, more information about drug release zzso
