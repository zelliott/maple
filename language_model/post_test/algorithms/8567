A new series of iron zzso with the same coordination sphere as the zzso zzso zzso but featuring a variable zzso balance, have been obtained by zzso zzso chains of variable length on a zzso zzso zzso The X-ray structure of a zzso complex exhibiting zzso coordination and solution zzso properties zzso of the zzso stability zzso of the zzso zzso have been zzso The zzso ability zzso zzso of the zzso are similar to that of zzso Partition zzso between water and zzso or zzso have been measured and transport across a membrane has been zzso zzso zzso The results of biological zzso zzso zzso with free zzso or iron nutrition with zzso zzso could not be correlated with the partition zzso These results call into question the role of distribution zzso (of the zzso and/or zzso in the biological activities of iron zzso
