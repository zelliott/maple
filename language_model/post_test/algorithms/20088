The objective of this study was to develop a zzso zzso for the management of the unanticipated difficult airway in zzso and to use this zzso for the assessment of zzso residents' performance during zzso zzso 

An zzso for unanticipated difficult airway in zzso outlining the management of six generic clinical situations of zzso and cannot zzso possibilities in three clinical zzso zzso zzso section, emergency zzso section for fetal distress, and emergency zzso section for maternal distress, was used to create a critical skills zzso The authors used four of these scenarios for zzso simulation for zzso Their critical and crisis resource management skills were assessed independently by three zzso using their checklist and the Ottawa Global rating zzso 

Sixteen residents zzso The checklist scores ranged from zzso and improved from scenario 1 to zzso zzso Global rating scale scores were marginal and not significantly different between zzso The zzso correlation zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a good zzso reliability for the zzso Multiple critical errors were identified, the most common being not calling for help or a difficult airway zzso 

Aside from identifying common critical zzso the authors noted that the residents' performance was poorest in two of our zzso zzso distress and cannot zzso cannot zzso and zzso distress and cannot zzso but can zzso More teaching emphasis may be warranted to avoid commonly identified critical errors and to improve overall zzso Our study also suggests a potential for experiential learning with successive zzso
