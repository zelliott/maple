As originally proposed, the fewest switches surface hopping zzso zzso does not allow for zzso between zzso zzso on different zzso zzso In this paper, we propose an inexpensive correction to standard zzso dynamics wherein we explicitly model the zzso of nuclear wave packets on distinct electronic zzso Our zzso fewest switches surface hopping approach is zzso simple and, thus far, it has allowed us to capture several key features of the exact quantum zzso Two points in particular merit zzso First, we obtain the correct branching ratios when a quantum particle passes through more than one region of zzso zzso Second, our zzso provides a new and natural approach for zzso nuclear zzso after a surface zzso Both of these features should become increasingly important as surface hopping schemes are applied to zzso zzso
