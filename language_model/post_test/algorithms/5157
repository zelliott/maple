Six zzso controlled trials totaling 352 participants were zzso The median survival time was reported in four zzso controlled zzso The results between the zzso group and the control group (the zzso or best supportive care zzso were as zzso zzso versus zzso months, zzso versus zzso months, zzso versus zzso months, and zzso versus zzso zzso Three zzso controlled trials reported zzso survival rates and 12-month survival rates and zzso results in these two outcomes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were not found to be statistically significant by zzso zzso When we analyzed zzso survival rates by zzso model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso result reached statistical zzso 

As for the limitations of the included trials, the result may not demonstrate a significant superiority of zzso administration in participants with advanced zzso zzso from the available zzso
