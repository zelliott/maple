In this paper we develop a comprehensive approach to determining the zzso structure of zzso This involves considering whether a model is zzso redundant or not and investigating model zzso The approach adopted makes use of exhaustive zzso quantities that uniquely define the zzso We review and zzso previous work on evaluating the symbolic rank of an appropriate zzso zzso to detect zzso zzso and then develop further tools for use within this zzso based on a zzso zzso Complex models, where the symbolic rank is difficult to zzso may be simplified structurally using zzso and by finding a zzso exhaustive zzso The approach of the paper is illustrated using examples from zzso compartment zzso and zzso zzso This work is topical as models in the zzso and elsewhere are becoming increasingly zzso
