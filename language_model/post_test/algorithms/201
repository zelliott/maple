Gene ranking problem in time course zzso experiments is challenging since gene expression levels between different time points are zzso This is because, expression values at successive time points are usually taken from the same zzso tissue or zzso Moreover, time dependency of gene expression values is usually of interest and often is the biological problem that motivates the zzso We propose a zzso growth curve model for ranking genes and zzso mean gene expression profiles in zzso time course zzso zzso The approach takes the within individual correlation as well as the zzso ordering into zzso Moreover, time is incorporated as a continuous variable in the model to account for the zzso zzso zzso profiles are assumed to describe the time dependence and a transformation incorporating information across the genes is zzso A moderated likelihood ratio test is then applied to the transformed data to get a statistic for ranking genes according to the difference in expression profiles among biological zzso The methodology is presented in a general setup and could be used for one sample as well as more than one sample zzso The zzso is done in a zzso framework in which information from all the groups involved is used for better zzso Moreover, the within individual correlation as well as information across genes entered in the zzso through a moderated zzso zzso We assess the performance of our method using simulation studies and illustrate the results with publicly available real time course zzso zzso
