The key to success for zzso tools used in zzso drug design is the ability to accurately place or zzso a zzso in the binding pocket of the target of zzso In this report we examine the effect of several factors on zzso zzso including zzso and protein zzso To examine zzso flexibility in an unbiased fashion, a test set of 41 zzso zzso X-ray structures were assembled that represent a diversity of size, flexibility, and polarity with respect to the zzso Four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were applied to the test set, and the results were examined in terms of the ability to reproduce X-ray zzso positions within zzso heavy atom zzso zzso Overall, each method performed well zzso zzso but for all methods it was found that zzso accuracy decreased substantially for zzso with eight or more zzso zzso Only zzso was able to accurately dock most of those zzso with eight or more zzso bonds zzso accuracy zzso A second test set of structures was gathered to examine how protein flexibility influences zzso zzso zzso was applied to X-ray structures of zzso zzso and zzso using protein structures bound to several zzso and also the zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments of each zzso to one zzso structure and to the zzso form were carried out, and the results were compared to zzso each zzso back to its originating zzso The results show that zzso accuracy falls off dramatically if one uses an average or zzso zzso In fact, it is shown that the drop in zzso accuracy mirrors the degree to which the protein moves upon zzso zzso
