zzso serve as the precursors of potent zzso zzso peptides and also function as zzso zzso zzso 

Given its potential role in blood pressure zzso a tagging single zzso zzso zzso based zzso study was conducted to explore the association between zzso 1 gene common zzso and essential hypertension in Chinese Han zzso Four tagging zzso were selected on the basis of the zzso database and further zzso in zzso patients with essential hypertension and zzso controls from the International Collaborative Study of zzso Disease in Asia zzso in zzso 

A significant zzso association between the zzso 1 gene common zzso and essential hypertension was zzso In male, but not female participants, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were significantly related to hypertension zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso were significantly associated with essential hypertension in the male population with adjusted OR zzso zzso zzso zzso and OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was in significant association with essential hypertension zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso as well as zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso and zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso 

This is the first association study of the zzso 1 gene with essential zzso Both zzso and zzso analyses indicated the zzso 1 gene was associated with essential hypertension and blood pressure traits in the Chinese male zzso
