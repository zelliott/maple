To develop and evaluate a zzso zzso for the zzso of the fetal heart rate baseline zzso frequency line) during zzso 

zzso zzso zzso 

Fetal heart rate signals were obtained from women in zzso using the Nottingham fetal zzso zzso The zzso zzso for the baseline zzso was developed for zzso applications and is based on averaging modal fetal heart rate zzso zzso was carried out on sixty zzso recordings by 12 experts and by the zzso These estimates were compared with those obtained from the zzso system using paired differences and zzso zzso 

The study showed that it is possible to produce a low frequency line from data obtained from zzso zzso The system could not estimate the low frequency line in four records, whereas experts were also unable to estimate between one and seven zzso The zzso zzso for the paired differences between computer and experts was zzso to 15 zzso whereas between the experts this was zzso to zzso With the exception of one expert, there was a high zzso between experts and between computer and experts zzso correlation zzso zzso 

The performance of this zzso zzso cannot be distinguished from that of experienced zzso There were no significant differences between baseline values obtained by the zzso zzso and those by the zzso
