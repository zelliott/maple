zzso zzso is used as a zzso probe for zzso zzso zzso 3A activity and requires multiple plasma samples to measure drug zzso Limited sampling is a useful strategy for zzso sampling and reducing costs and zzso We studied limited sampling models using multiple linear zzso to predict the area under the concentration versus time curve zzso of zzso using either zzso plasma zzso or the ratio of zzso zzso zzso to zzso plasma zzso zzso baseline activity data for oral zzso from previous studies were used zzso healthy adults for models using zzso plasma zzso and 41 healthy adults for models using the ratios of zzso zzso to zzso plasma zzso Limited sampling models were zzso zzso and evaluated for precision and zzso Two equations using the time points at zzso and 6 hours and zzso 2, and 6 hours were acceptable and zzso of zzso zzso using zzso plasma zzso No zzso zzso to zzso plasma concentration ratios accurately predicted zzso zzso
