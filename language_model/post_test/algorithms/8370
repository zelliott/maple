We present a novel approach to deal with the problem of reconstructing the zzso history of zzso repeated genes that are supposed to have arisen from unequal zzso We first describe the mathematical model of evolution by tandem zzso and introduce zzso histories and zzso zzso We then provide a simple zzso zzso which determines whether or not a given rooted zzso can be a zzso history and another zzso that simulates the unequal zzso process and searches for the best zzso trees according to the maximum zzso zzso We use real data sets of human zzso and zzso receptors to validate our methods and zzso zzso between most zzso zzso trees and most zzso zzso for the same data, combined with the agreement with additional knowledge about the zzso such as the presence of zzso shows strong evidence that our reconstruction procedure provides good insights into the zzso histories of these zzso
