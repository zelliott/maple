We propose a model of social cognitive development based not on a single modeling framework or the hypothesis that a single model accounts for children's developing social zzso Rather, we advocate a zzso Model approach zzso zzso zzso in which models of social cognitive development take the same position as theories of social cognitive development, in that they generate novel empirical zzso We describe this approach and present three examples across various aspects of social cognitive zzso Our first example focuses on children's understanding of pretense and involves only considering assumptions made by a zzso zzso The second example focuses on children's learning from zzso It uses a modeling framework based on zzso random fields as a zzso description of a set of empirical phenomena, and then tests a prediction of that zzso The third example considers zzso zzso of action learned from zzso Here, we use a modified version of the zzso Model of zzso to explain children's zzso Taken together, these examples suggest that research in social cognitive development can be assisted by considering how zzso modeling can lead researchers towards testing novel zzso
