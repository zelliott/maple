The evolving technology in trauma management today permits salvage of many severe lower zzso injuries previously even considered to be zzso An essential component for any such treatment protocol must be adequate soft tissue coverage that often will use zzso zzso Traditionally, calf muscles have been used zzso and free zzso for the zzso leg and zzso The zzso of reliable local zzso zzso has challenged this zzso proving to be a simpler and yet versatile zzso 

The role of both muscle and zzso zzso in lower zzso injuries has been zzso reviewed from a zzso zzso Soft tissue deficits requiring some form of zzso zzso occurred in 160 limbs in 155 zzso The frequency of use of zzso types, specific complications and benefits, effect of timing of wound closure, and rate of limb salvage were zzso 

zzso coverage after significant lower zzso trauma in these 160 limbs required 60 local muscle zzso 50 local zzso zzso and 74 free zzso These zzso had been selected on a zzso basis according to wound location, its severity, and zzso zzso zzso were directly related to the severity of injury, and for free zzso as a group zzso although these were not independent zzso Local muscle zzso or zzso zzso zzso were similar with regard to this zzso zzso was more likely to be zzso if coverage were accomplished during the acute period after injury, regardless of zzso zzso Muscle zzso were still used in two thirds of all cases, with the zzso muscle used as often for the zzso leg as the zzso Local zzso zzso were most valuable for smaller zzso especially in the zzso leg or foot, and often as a reasonable alternative to a free zzso 

The traditional role of the zzso muscles for zzso coverage of knee and zzso leg defects and the zzso muscle for the middle third of the leg was zzso The zzso muscle often also reached zzso leg defects as could local zzso zzso where zzso otherwise, a free zzso would have been zzso The largest or most severe wounds, irrespective of limb location, required free zzso zzso Local zzso zzso proved to be a valuable zzso
