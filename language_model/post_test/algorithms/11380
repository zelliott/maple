We demonstrate a technique to improve structural data obtained from zzso zzso zzso zzso using Image Fusion zzso and contrast zzso This enables the zzso of molecular expression patterns in biological specimens with highly variable contrast zzso In the approach, termed zzso different zzso are fused by assigning weighted contrasts to zzso When applied to projection images from mouse zzso and digital zzso our results demonstrate the capability of zzso to reveal high and low signal intensity details in challenging zzso We further provide zzso to highlight the benefits of the new zzso in comparison to other similar zzso
