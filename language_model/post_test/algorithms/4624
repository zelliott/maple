zzso imaging systems provide the zzso with zzso low-cost, and real-time images that can help them in diagnosis, planning, and zzso However, although the human eye is able to derive the meaningful information from these images, automatic processing is very difficult due to noise and artifacts present in the zzso The zzso reducing zzso diffusion filter was recently proposed to adapt the zzso diffusion filter to the characteristics of the zzso noise present in the ultrasound images and to facilitate automatic processing of zzso We analyze the properties of the zzso scheme associated with this zzso using a zzso zzso We then extend the filter to a zzso zzso zzso allowing different levels of filtering across the image contours and in the principal zzso zzso We also show a relation between the local directional zzso of the image intensity and the local geometry of the image, which can justify the choice of the zzso and the principal zzso directions as a basis for the diffusion zzso Finally, different filtering techniques are compared on a zzso synthetic image with two different levels of zzso noise and on a 3-D synthetic image of a zzso and the new filter is applied on a 3-D real ultrasound image of the zzso
