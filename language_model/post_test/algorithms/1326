zzso zzso with zzso varying focal lengths are used in single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to improve the imaging sensitivity and to reduce the reconstruction artifacts resulting from the zzso of projection zzso An angular representation of the detector coordinates for the projection data is adopted to investigate several aspects of the reconstruction problem for this type of zzso A zzso reconstruction zzso is zzso We prove a conjecture posed by Zeng and zzso and obtain a simplified form of their zzso filtering zzso Some computer simulations are presented to investigate the performance of the zzso zzso
