In this paper, a class of neutral zzso zzso zzso neural networks with zzso jump parameters and mixed time delays is zzso The jumping parameters are modeled as a zzso zzso zzso zzso At first, the existence of equilibrium point for the addressed neural networks is zzso By utilizing the zzso stability theory, zzso analysis theory and linear zzso inequality zzso technique, new zzso stability criteria are presented in terms of linear zzso zzso to guarantee the neural networks to be globally zzso stable in the mean zzso zzso simulations are carried out to illustrate the main zzso
