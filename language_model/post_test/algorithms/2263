In principle, the zzso free energy of a small circular DNA will be enhanced by increasing the zzso of its zzso potential at constant persistence zzso The magnitude of this effect is investigated by zzso Carlo simulation using an extension of a previously proposed zzso The zzso free energy at zzso K is simulated for circular zzso containing N zzso zzso with zzso constant alpha zzso zzso X zzso zzso zzso persistence lengths P zzso 500 A and 10,000 A, and a range of zzso of the zzso potential from zzso zzso zzso to zzso The apparent zzso constants, zzso from these zzso free energies by assuming an zzso zzso potential, are found to increase by less than zzso as the input zzso increases from zzso to zzso When P zzso 500 A, the apparent zzso constant never rises significantly above the input value over the entire range of input zzso When P zzso 10,000 A, the apparent zzso constant rises only about zzso above the input value for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso potential cannot account for the fact that the zzso zzso reported for small circular zzso exceed those reported for long linear zzso by a factor of zzso or zzso
