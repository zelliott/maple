To achieve higher volume coverage at improved zzso in zzso zzso zzso systems with a large number of detector rows are zzso However, handling an increased number of detector zzso as compared to today's zzso zzso requires to accounting for the cone geometry of the zzso Many so-called zzso reconstruction zzso have been proposed during the last zzso None met all the requirements of the medical spiral zzso CT in regard to the need for high image quality, low patient dose and low reconstruction zzso We therefore propose an approximate zzso zzso which uses virtual reconstruction planes zzso to zzso fit 180 degrees spiral zzso zzso the advanced zzso zzso zzso zzso Our zzso is a modification of the zzso zzso zzso proposed by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 44, zzso zzso since we use zzso reconstruction slices instead of zzso slices to approximate the spiral zzso zzso considerations as well as the reconstruction of simulated phantom data in comparison to the gold standard 180 degrees zzso zzso spiral zzso were carried zzso Image artifacts, zzso as well as noise levels were evaluated for all simulated zzso Even for a high number of detector rows the artifact level in the reconstructed images remains comparable to that of 180 degrees zzso zzso zzso of the zzso phantom show none of the typical zzso artifacts usually appearing when going to larger cone zzso Image noise as well as the shape of the respective slice sensitivity profiles are equivalent to the zzso spiral zzso zzso is slightly zzso The zzso has the potential to become a practical tool for medical spiral zzso zzso Its zzso complexity lies in the order of standard zzso CT and it allows to use available zzso zzso zzso
