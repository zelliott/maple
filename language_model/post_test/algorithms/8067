zzso supports the zzso zzso and efficient zzso of zzso assignments of zzso chemical shifts to specific atoms in the zzso structure of a protein in the context of experimental zzso zzso zzso is based on the very popular zzso package for visualizing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Goddard and zzso zzso zzso zzso 3, University of California, San zzso zzso consists of a zzso zzso which takes the output from an automated zzso analysis and zzso it into zzso zzso plus a number of zzso zzso zzso and their probabilities obtained in the zzso step are zzso as labels in zzso spectrum zzso Three zzso extensions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the Best by zzso serve to manipulate the labels that signify the assignments and their zzso zzso zzso lists all possible assignments for a peak selected in the zzso box and enables the user to choose among zzso A window in zzso zzso zzso shows all atoms in a selected zzso along with all atoms in its adjacent zzso in addition, it displays a ranked list of zzso connectivity assignments to any selected zzso zzso the zzso allows the user to choose a probability threshold and to automatically accept as zzso all assignments above that zzso following this operation, only the less certain assignments need to be examined zzso Once assignments are zzso the output files generated by zzso can be used as input to zzso for further zzso 

The program, in the form of source code and zzso code along with tutorials and reference zzso is available at zzso
