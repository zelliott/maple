The state of a zzso population segregating for two zzso at each of zzso zzso is described by zzso zzso zzso or zzso by zzso zzso and by zzso moments or zzso of various zzso These measures of linkage zzso cannot usually be determined, both because one cannot tell whether a gene came from the maternal or paternal zzso and because such a large number of parameters cannot be estimated even from large zzso zzso assumptions must therefore be zzso This paper sets out methods for zzso zzso zzso zzso which are appropriate for zzso neutral zzso and for populations that are ultimately derived by mixing of two source zzso In such a hybrid population, all zzso associations depend primarily on the number of zzso involved that derive from the maternal zzso and the number derived from the paternal zzso zzso zzso may differ across zzso and the contribution of each locus to zzso associations may be scaled by the difference in zzso frequency between source populations for that locus zzso zzso zzso For example, the zzso describing the association between genes zzso zzso k from the maternal zzso and genes zzso zzso from the paternal zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The state of the population is described by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and by a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Expressions for these zzso under zzso and long-range migration are zzso Two methods for zzso the zzso are zzso a simple method based on zzso moments, and a maximum likelihood zzso which uses the zzso zzso Both methods perform well when tested against simulations with two or four zzso
