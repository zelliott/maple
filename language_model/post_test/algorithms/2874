We present the zzso of optimal control into the open source simulation package zzso for development and zzso of nuclear magnetic resonance experiments for a wide range of applications, including zzso and solid-state zzso magnetic resonance imaging, quantum computation, and combinations between zzso and other zzso zzso control enables efficient zzso of zzso experiments in terms of zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso of zzso to fully exploit the zzso available high degree of freedom in pulse sequences to combat zzso in experimental or spin system parameters or design experiments with specific properties typically not covered as easily by standard design zzso This zzso straightforward zzso of experiments under consideration of zzso and zzso field zzso limitations in available or desired zzso field strengths zzso for reduction of sample zzso spread in resonance zzso or zzso zzso variations in spin systems zzso to meet the actual experimental conditions as close as zzso The paper provides a brief account on the relevant theory and in particular the zzso interface relevant for zzso of zzso transfer (on the density operator zzso and the effective zzso on the level of zzso along with several representative examples within zzso and solid-state zzso zzso
