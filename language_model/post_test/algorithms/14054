zzso of gene expression often results in zzso or zzso genes and the most common analysis strategies look for such zzso expressed zzso However, molecular disease mechanisms typically constitute abnormalities in the regulation of genes producing strong zzso in the expression zzso The search for such deregulation states in the zzso expression profiles will help to identify zzso genes zzso 

We have developed an zzso that searches for the genes which present a significant zzso in the zzso of their expression profiles, by comparing an altered state with a control zzso The zzso provides groups of genes and assigns a statistical measure of significance to each group of genes zzso The method also includes a zzso tool to select genes with a threshold of differential expression that can be set by the user ad zzso The method is evaluated using an experimental set of zzso of human control and cancer samples from patients with acute zzso zzso
