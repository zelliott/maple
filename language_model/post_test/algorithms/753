Many current parameters to zzso vascular beds using zzso zzso zzso are based on zzso settings and often fail to consider vessel diameter and/or pulse zzso This study attempts to define the minimal effective dosage zzso of energy and pulse zzso for specific vessel diameters in an animal zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso was used in 15 zzso zzso zzso extended zzso skin zzso were elevated and vessel diameters from zzso to 1 zzso were zzso Pulse zzso zzso in a range of zzso milliseconds and zzso between zzso zzso with contact cooling at 5 degrees C zzso were zzso zzso were determined clinically and zzso 

zzso pulse zzso and zzso for each vessel diameter were determined using a 6 zzso spot zzso zzso showed early zzso and subsequent zzso which are consistent with clinical zzso 

This model allows in zzso monitoring of vessel zzso zzso pulse zzso and zzso levels versus vessel diameter determined in this animal model provide a useful zzso that may allow for more effective treatment of vascular targets utilizing the zzso zzso zzso zzso
