zzso the community structure of complex networks is a key challenge in many scientific zzso Very diverse zzso and methods have been proposed to this end, many working reasonably well in specific zzso However, no consensus has emerged on which of these methods is the best to use in zzso In part, this is due to the fact that testing their performance requires the generation of a comprehensive, standard set of synthetic zzso a goal not yet fully zzso Here, we present a type of benchmark that we call zzso in which an initial network of known community structure is progressively converted into a second network whose communities are also zzso This approach differs from all previously published ones, in which networks evolve toward zzso The use of this type of benchmark allows us to monitor the transformation of the community structure of a zzso Moreover, we can predict the optimal behavior of the variation of information, a measure of the quality of the partitions zzso at any moment of the zzso This enables us in many cases to determine the best partition among those suggested by different zzso Also, since any network can be used as a starting point, extensive studies and comparisons can be performed using a zzso set of structures, including random zzso These properties make our benchmarks a general standard for comparing community detection zzso
