We report an approach to the increase of signal channels in zzso optical communication based on composed optical zzso zzso In the zzso process, conventional zzso employed for the generation of zzso superimposed zzso is combined with a genetic zzso to achieve high-volume zzso zzso At the receiver end, a novel zzso vortex grating is used to analyze the zzso beams with a large number of zzso We zzso demonstrate a digitized system which is capable of zzso and receiving 16 zzso channels zzso This system is expected to be compatible with a high-speed zzso zzso technique, with zzso to extremely high-volume information density in zzso zzso
