The accuracy of the Burns et zzso equation zzso zzso 23, zzso zzso for the zzso water to air zzso ratio as a function of depth in a water phantom and electron beam quality in terms of zzso is investigated by comparison to the original data on which this fit was zzso It is shown that using this equation provides dose estimates on the central axis in a clinical electron beam that are accurate to within zzso of dose maximum for all 24 clinical beams investigated except very close to the surface in swept zzso In contrast, the error in the dose as a percentage of the local dose is much higher for values of the zzso greater than zzso
