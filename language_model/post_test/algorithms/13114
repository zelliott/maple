zzso plasma total homocysteine zzso is a risk factor for a variety of human zzso zzso is formed from zzso and has two primary zzso zzso zzso to form zzso or commitment to the zzso zzso by the action of zzso zzso zzso We have examined the zzso response in mice of a shift from a zzso to a zzso zzso 

We found that shifting zzso zzso mice to a zzso diet caused a transient increase in zzso and an increase in the zzso zzso Because CBS is a key regulator of zzso we examined CBS protein levels and found that within 3 d on the zzso diet, animals had a 50% reduction in the levels of liver CBS protein and zzso zzso zzso of CBS zzso and studies of transgenic animals that express CBS from a zzso promoter indicated that this reduction is occurring zzso Loss of CBS protein was unrelated to zzso levels of zzso a known regulator of CBS activity and zzso 

Our results imply that zzso deprivation zzso a zzso state in which zzso is effectively zzso in tissue by shutdown of the zzso zzso by an zzso mechanism that signals a rapid zzso of CBS zzso
