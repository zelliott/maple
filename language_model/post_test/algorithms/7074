To determine the value of screening for zzso in infants with special emphasis on the natural course of zzso zzso zzso zzso growth, and zzso zzso 

Prospective six year follow up of infants with zzso on screening in an zzso infant zzso 

zzso zzso zzso 

50 zzso zzso girls, 36 zzso with zzso on screening verified by zzso aspiration from an zzso population of zzso infants in a defined area of zzso 

Children with zzso zzso and normal findings on initial zzso were zzso although other infections were zzso 

Culture of urine and determination of C zzso protein concentration every six weeks for the first six months after diagnosis, every three months from six months to two years, and every six months between two and three years; thereafter yearly urine zzso zzso of zzso concentrating capacity with a zzso zzso zzso examination, including first and follow up zzso and zzso zzso without zzso zzso and measurement of zzso zzso thickness and zzso surface zzso 

Of the original 50 zzso 37 (12 girls, 25 zzso were followed up for at least six zzso Two infants developed zzso within two weeks after zzso was zzso the others remained free of zzso 45 zzso were zzso the zzso cleared spontaneously in 36 and in response to antibiotics given for infections in the respiratory tract in zzso zzso of zzso were observed in 10 of the 50 children, of whom one had zzso No child had more than one zzso At follow up zzso in 36 of the 50 children (9 girls, 27 zzso after a median of 32 months no child had developed zzso zzso First samples tested for zzso concentrating capacity showed significantly higher values than those from a reference population zzso zzso score zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso p less than zzso but the last samples showed no significant difference zzso zzso score zzso zzso to zzso p greater than zzso 

Mass screening for zzso in infancy results primarily in detection of innocent zzso episodes and is not zzso
