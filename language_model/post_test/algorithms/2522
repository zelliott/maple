Profile Hidden zzso Models zzso are widely used to model zzso or protein sequence zzso In many applications, a sequence family classified into several zzso is given and each zzso is modeled separately by one zzso A major drawback of this approach is the difficulty of coping with zzso composed of very few zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso sequences is one of the most crucial zzso tasks affected by this problem of small zzso zzso zzso zzso with a small number of known zzso To deal with small samples for particular zzso of zzso we employ a machine learning zzso More precisely, we make use of an existing zzso architecture and its associated zzso engine, while replacing the zzso zzso of zzso probabilities by a supervised zzso For that purpose, we use zzso linear zzso learning together with a balancing scheme to account for the widely varying sample zzso After training the zzso linear zzso the corresponding weights are transformed to valid probabilities using a zzso zzso apply this modified zzso to zzso zzso sequence data (in the form of zzso zzso sequences and zzso zzso and show that the performance of zzso can be significantly improved by the proposed zzso
