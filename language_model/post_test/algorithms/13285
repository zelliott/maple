zzso often occurs in zzso very low zzso infants zzso due to zzso of zzso regulatory systems and the stress of their zzso zzso in zzso has been linked to increased zzso and mortality and occurs at increasing rates with decreasing zzso In this zzso the emerging use of insulin to manage zzso has carried a significant risk of zzso The efficacy of blood zzso control using a computer zzso system model to determine insulin infusion rates was assessed in zzso zzso 

zzso short-term 24-hour trials were performed on 8 zzso infants with zzso followed by long-term trials of several days performed on 22 zzso Median zzso was zzso g and 760 g for short-term and long-term trial zzso and median zzso age at birth was zzso and zzso weeks zzso Blood zzso control is compared to 21 retrospective patients from the same unit who received insulin infusions determined by sliding scales and zzso zzso This study was approved by the Upper South A Regional Ethics Committee, New Zealand zzso registration zzso 

Reduction in zzso towards the target zzso band was achieved safely in all cases during the short-term trials with no zzso zzso Lower median blood zzso concentration was achieved during clinical zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso achieved in similar infants previously zzso zzso zzso No significant difference in zzso of zzso during long-term trials was observed zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso Percentage of blood zzso within the zzso - zzso zzso range was increased by zzso compared to the retrospective cohort zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso 

A computer model that accurately captures the dynamics of zzso metabolism can provide safe and effective blood zzso control without increasing zzso
