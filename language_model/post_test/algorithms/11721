zzso is an economical air pollution control zzso technology, particularly suitable for the treatment of zzso having high flow rates and low zzso of volatile organic compounds zzso This technology zzso zzso zzso at ambient conditions to zzso such pollutants to zzso zzso and zzso A zzso study conducted for more than 4 years investigated the development of a new zzso technology employing trickle bed air zzso zzso Following the completion of this experimental study, additional data analysis was performed to develop a simple zzso zzso model, assuming zzso zzso This model related the observed zzso performance to the principle independent physical, zzso and zzso zzso The initial model has subsequently been expanded to incorporate zzso zzso In this paper, the development and use of the final explicit zzso zzso model and design zzso incorporating zzso zzso are zzso To facilitate the application of this model, practical procedures are also presented for the determination of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the maximum practical zzso inlet zzso zzso
