zzso structure tracing on zzso is a significant way to obtain zzso zzso zzso analysis is divided in two categories, manual and automatic zzso The manual approach is limited in accuracy and zzso due to differences in zzso and zzso zzso In this paper, we have attempted to develop and test a novel method for automatic zzso of zzso structures based on the detected edges in the region of zzso Before edge detection of the particular region, the region was filtered by zzso non local filter for noise removal by keeping the edge information zzso According to the zzso feature at the different regions of the zzso modified zzso edge detection zzso for obtaining tissue zzso was zzso With the application of zzso opening and edge linking approaches, an improved zzso zzso tracing methodology was proposed by an interactive selection of the starting edge zzso the tracking process searches zzso for an edge zzso at the neighborhood of previously searched edge zzso to segment images, and then zzso structures are zzso The effectiveness of the zzso is demonstrated by the preliminary experimental results obtained with the proposed zzso
