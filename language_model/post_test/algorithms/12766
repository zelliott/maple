Our objectives were to develop and test a new system for the potential for stable, real-time cancellation of residual stimulation zzso zzso using surface zzso zzso zzso functional electrical zzso zzso This type of zzso zzso could be used to provide more natural, continuous control of lower zzso zzso zzso We built upon work that has been done in the field of zzso with one major technological innovation, an zzso zzso filtering algorithm, which allowed us to digitally cancel zzso in zzso This filtering zzso resulted in a stable real-time zzso of the zzso intent of the zzso muscle, which then acted as the direct signal for continuously controlling zzso muscle zzso As a first step toward clinical application, we tested the viability of our zzso system to continuously control ankle zzso in a healthy zzso Our results indicate positively that an zzso device with zzso filtering can respond zzso to voluntary zzso and activate forceful movements to assist zzso during controlled zzso zzso at the zzso We also verified that normal ankle joint range of movement could be maintained while using the zzso zzso We suggest that real-time cancellation of both primary and zzso is possible with surface zzso zzso in healthy subjects and shows promising potential for future clinical application to gait zzso such as drop foot related to zzso zzso
