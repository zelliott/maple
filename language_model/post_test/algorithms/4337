To provide a better understanding of the relationship between primary tumor growth rates and zzso burden, we present a method that bridges tumor growth dynamics at the population level, extracted from the zzso database, to those at the tissue zzso Specifically, with this method, we are able to relate estimates of tumor growth rates and zzso burden derived from a zzso model to estimates of the primary tumor vascular response and the circulating tumor cell zzso fraction derived from a zzso zzso Variation in the zzso model parameters produces differences in zzso survival and cure zzso Variation in the zzso model parameters produces different primary tumor dynamics that subsequently lead to different growth dynamics of the zzso Our method to bridge the population and tissue scales was applied to lung and breast cancer zzso and the results were zzso The population model suggests that lung tumors grow faster and shed a significant number of lethal zzso cells at small sizes, whereas breast tumors grow slower and do not significantly shed lethal zzso cells until becoming zzso Although the zzso model does not explicitly model the zzso population, we are able to disengage the direct dependency of the zzso burden on primary tumor growth by introducing the zzso population as an zzso and assuming zzso We zzso the zzso model to produce results consistent with the population model while also revealing a more dynamic relationship between the primary tumor and the zzso This leads to exponential tumor growth in lung and power law tumor growth in zzso We conclude that the vascular response of the primary tumor is a major player in the dynamics of both the primary tumor and the zzso and is significantly different in breast and lung zzso
