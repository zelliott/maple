The reconstruction problem for a combined parallel beam zzso and cone beam zzso imaging geometry has been zzso The general zzso zzso of zzso and zzso has been applied to this geometry and shown to provide accurate images as zzso A second zzso specifically tailored to the zzso geometry was zzso It uses the general principles of the zzso method to combine a zzso filtering of the zzso data with a standard reconstruction of the CB data using the zzso of zzso Davis and zzso zzso This zzso zzso has the advantage of fewer zzso steps, thereby reducing reconstruction time and providing more accurate zzso The zzso were applied to zzso data from a computer-generated zzso zzso zzso Both the zzso zzso and the mixed zzso successfully combine the CB and the zzso data to correct the well known zzso observed when reconstructing CB data acquired with a circular zzso The mixed zzso is about twice as fast as zzso and results in better image quality, due to decreased zzso zzso However, the two zzso yield comparable image quality when applied to a disc phantom measured with a zzso zzso zzso
