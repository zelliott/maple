The evaporation rate of zzso alcohol from the human zzso zzso under controlled conditions in zzso shows a similar dependence on zzso and time to that seen in earlier in zzso zzso After an initial time lag associated with the apparatus, evaporation rate over a zzso time period zzso was zzso described by a single exponential zzso with a rate constant zzso to zzso over the skin, zzso The cumulative percentage of dose evaporated after 2 h ranged from zzso at zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso to zzso at zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso The zzso rate constant determined by an analysis of the in zzso data was equivalent to that determined in zzso whereas the evaporation rate zzso were related by the inverse ratio of the zzso zzso The latter finding suggests that a simple zzso flow model can zzso describe evaporation in both systems over the range of zzso zzso
