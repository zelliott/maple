In this paper, for joint zzso zzso of redundant zzso subject to physical constraints, we show that zzso and zzso zzso schemes both can be formulated as a zzso programming zzso problem subject to equality and zzso zzso To solve this zzso problem online, a zzso zzso system solver is further presented based on linear zzso zzso Compared to previous zzso the presented zzso has simple zzso zzso does not entail real-time zzso zzso and could also provide zzso information for zzso zzso control in the zzso zzso zzso The proposed zzso zzso system approach is simulated based on the zzso robot arm with efficiency and effectiveness zzso
