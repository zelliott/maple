A dynamic texture is a zzso zzso model for video, which represents video sequences as observations from a linear zzso zzso This work studies the mixture of dynamic zzso a statistical model for an ensemble of video sequences that is sampled from a finite collection of visual zzso each of which is a dynamic zzso An zzso zzso zzso is derived for learning the parameters of the model, and the model is related to previous works in linear systems, machine learning, zzso zzso control theory, and computer zzso Through zzso it is shown that the mixture of dynamic textures is a suitable representation for both the appearance and dynamics of a variety of visual processes that have traditionally been challenging for computer vision zzso fire, steam, water, vehicle and pedestrian traffic, zzso When compared with state-of-the-art methods in motion zzso including both zzso texture methods and traditional representations zzso optical flow or other localized motion zzso the mixture of dynamic textures achieves superior performance in the problems of zzso and zzso video of such zzso
