The possibilities of zzso polarizing zzso spin system via the zzso zzso spin system in low magnetic field are zzso The increase of the zzso zzso is zzso The polarization rate of the zzso spin system is related to the transition probabilities per unit time between the zzso zzso energy levels and zzso energy zzso The experiments performed in zzso confirm the results of the theoretical zzso A new double resonance technique is proposed for the measurement of nuclear zzso resonance zzso zzso of the order of zzso and zzso The technique is based on magnetic field cycling between a high and a low zzso magnetic field and observation of the zzso zzso signal in the high magnetic zzso In the low magnetic field the zzso zzso and zzso zzso interact at the zzso zzso frequency zzso The zzso zzso are simultaneously excited by a resonant zzso magnetic field oriented along the direction of the low zzso magnetic zzso The experimental procedure is described and the sensitivity of the new technique is zzso Some examples of the measurement of low zzso and zzso nuclear zzso resonance zzso are zzso
