The method of constructing low-energy zzso using template joining can provide an efficient means of searching the zzso space of zzso The simplest zzso to perform this task would construct each potential zzso from zzso However, new zzso some of which use techniques from zzso Intelligence, have been developed which can greatly improve the efficiency of this zzso
