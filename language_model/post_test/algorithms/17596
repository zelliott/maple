zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso and a zzso zzso To zzso the potency and speed of zzso of zzso and explore putative sex dependency, the authors studied the zzso and zzso of zzso in volunteers using a zzso randomized, zzso study zzso 

Ten men and 10 women received zzso zzso intravenous zzso and zzso zzso thirds of the dose as zzso one third as a continuous infusion over 1 zzso on separate zzso For 7 zzso pain tolerance was measured using gradually increasing zzso electrical zzso and blood samples were zzso A population zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to analyze zzso changes in tolerated stimulus zzso The improvement in model fits by inclusion of zzso sex was tested for zzso P values less than zzso were considered zzso Taking into account previous zzso data, a zzso zzso model was constructed to determine the contribution of zzso to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso did not differ between men and zzso zzso caused analgesia significantly greater than that observed with zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso analgesia data were well described by the zzso zzso The zzso effect site concentration causing a zzso increase in current zzso was 275 zzso 135 zzso zzso estimate zzso zzso the blood effect site zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso for zzso and zzso for the effect zzso None of the model parameters showed sex zzso 

A cumulative dose of zzso zzso zzso given over 1 zzso produces long-term analgesia greater than that observed with zzso with equal dynamics zzso and speed of zzso in men and zzso zzso causes for the great zzso response zzso such as genetic zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso phenomena, are zzso The zzso zzso model was applied successfully and was used to estimate zzso analgesia after zzso in patients with normal and impaired zzso zzso
