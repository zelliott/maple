zzso proteins expressed by genetically modified food crops are evaluated for their potential zzso properties prior to marketing, among others by identification of short identical zzso acid sequences that occur both in the transgenic protein and zzso zzso A strategy is proposed, in which the positive outcomes of the sequence comparison with a minimal length of six zzso acids are further screened for the presence of potential linear zzso This double track approach involves the use of literature data on zzso and an zzso prediction zzso 

zzso transgenic proteins have been screened for identities of at least six zzso zzso acids shared with zzso zzso Twenty-two transgenic proteins showed positive results of zzso or zzso zzso acids zzso Only a limited number of identical stretches shared by transgenic proteins zzso zzso virus coat zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso proteins could be identified as zzso zzso potential linear zzso 

Many transgenic proteins have identical stretches of six or seven zzso acids in common with zzso zzso Most identical stretches are likely to be false zzso As shown in this study, identical stretches can be further screened for relevance by comparison with linear zzso zzso described in zzso In the absence of literature data on zzso zzso prediction by computer aids to select potential zzso binding sites that will need zzso of zzso binding by zzso binding zzso Finally, the positive outcomes of this approach warrant further clinical testing for potential zzso
