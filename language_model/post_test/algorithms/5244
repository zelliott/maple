zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso is a powerful technique for analyzing zzso zzso In the various zzso tracing zzso in use nowadays, the competing goals of zzso efficiency and zzso are generally traded off against each zzso We present a novel method for tracing the zzso of a zzso from zzso image zzso which provides an optimal balance between these zzso Using only local information, thin zzso layers of zzso zzso are zzso carved out of the structure, and clustered based on zzso Each cluster contributes a zzso along the zzso which is created by connecting successive zzso until all object zzso are zzso While data zzso is independent of this algorithm, we illustrate the use of the zzso method to achieve dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso at each zzso is calculated using the zzso zzso algorithm, and zzso end zzso caused by surface irregularities are then zzso On standard computing hardware the zzso can process hundreds of thousands of zzso per second, easily handling the zzso zzso resulting from high-resolution zzso zzso imaging of zzso This method provides an accurate and efficient means for zzso extraction that is suitable for interactive zzso tracing zzso
