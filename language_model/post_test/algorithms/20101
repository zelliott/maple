zzso modeling of dynamic zzso zzso zzso data provides measures of the zzso volume fraction zzso ) and the volume transfer constant zzso ) in a given zzso These zzso estimates may be zzso however, by zzso issues such as contrast agent and tissue water zzso or assumptions of zzso and zzso made by the commonly used zzso In contrast to zzso zzso imaging with zzso is insensitive to water zzso A quantitative zzso zzso technique was developed to obtain an estimate of zzso in a rat zzso model for comparison with the corresponding estimates obtained using zzso with a vascular input function and reference region zzso Both zzso methods produced consistently larger estimates of zzso in comparison to the zzso estimates, and several experimental sources were zzso to contribute to these zzso
