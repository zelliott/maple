A long-standing problem in magnetic resonance imaging zzso is the zzso bias in the magnitude zzso This problem is particularly pressing in diffusion zzso at high zzso In this paper, we present a zzso scheme to solve this problem by transforming noisy zzso Chi signals to noisy zzso zzso A special case of zzso Chi distribution is the zzso zzso In general, the zzso signals are of interest rather than the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso signals because the zzso signals are generally more amenable to statistical treatment through the principle of least zzso zzso Carlo simulations were used to validate the statistical properties of the proposed zzso This scheme opens up the possibility of investigating the low signal regime (or high zzso regime in the case of diffusion zzso that contains potentially important information about zzso processes and structures of the zzso
