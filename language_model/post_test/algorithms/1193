zzso chamber systems are currently implanted in an increasing number of patients with a pacing indication and zzso zzso zzso zzso To avoid tracking of high zzso rates during zzso while providing zzso zzso pacing during zzso rhythm and zzso block, automatic mode switching zzso to a zzso mode has been zzso Several concepts of zzso zzso have been introduced differing in sensitivity and specificity of zzso zzso delay between zzso onset and zzso pacing mode during zzso zzso of zzso termination upon detection of zzso rhythm, and special zzso pertinent to zzso This review zzso and analyzes zzso that are integrated into zzso concepts and outlines considerations on optimal zzso zzso Based on simulations and clinical studies, fast zzso concepts avoiding high paced zzso rates seem preferable but require special functions to avoid loss of zzso zzso by inappropriate zzso Similarly, fast return to tracking mode after zzso zzso seems preferable but requires zzso to prevent mode zzso zzso zzso rate changes have to be avoided by rate smoothing functions, and an appropriate zzso rate during zzso mode has to be provided by rate responsive zzso zzso of the device includes individual zzso of zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso times, and zzso detection zzso In addition, a high zzso ratio by careful zzso lead zzso narrowly spaced bipolar zzso leads and a good sensing amplifier, together with special zzso for zzso sensing adjustment improve the performance of zzso zzso
