The purpose of this study was to develop a quantitative zzso relationship zzso for the prediction of the apparent volume of distribution zzso in man for a zzso series of zzso The relationship of many zzso and some zzso structural zzso with zzso and the zzso corrected for protein binding zzso zzso was zzso Models were constructed using zzso zzso analysis for all the 70 drugs in the zzso as well as for zzso drugs and basic drugs zzso The zzso power of the models was assessed using half the chemicals as a test set, and revealed that the models for zzso yielded lower prediction errors than those constructed for the zzso zzso zzso fold error of zzso for zzso compared with zzso for zzso zzso Moreover, the separation of the compounds into acids and bases did not reduce the prediction error zzso
