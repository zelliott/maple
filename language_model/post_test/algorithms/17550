zzso zzso is a zzso feature that enables the zzso to both track the capture threshold and automatically adjust the output on a zzso zzso Although zzso safely and significantly reduces the current zzso some authors have argued that the longevity benefit of such a system is zzso This study aims to estimate the longevity extension that can be zzso in the clinical routine, by turning the zzso on in comparison to zzso programmed to operate at the shipped and manually zzso zzso 

We selected 83 consecutive patients who received implanted St zzso zzso zzso zzso months zzso Eight patients died or were lost to follow-up and in 9 subjects the zzso could not be turned zzso In the remaining 66 patients, current drain and estimated longevity were compared in 3 situations: zzso zzso on; zzso zzso off, zzso programming zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso off, shipped output zzso zzso 

Five patients had large variations zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Current drainage was zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group, zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso off and zzso programming, and zzso zzso zzso zzso at shipped output zzso zzso zzso longevity was significantly extended zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when compared to shipped zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso programming zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso the zzso output significantly enhanced its estimated zzso zzso added a moderate but significant extension over manual zzso and was associated with increased safety in patients with large zzso threshold zzso
