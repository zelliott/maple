We report a scheme for the detector system of zzso zzso in which the pinhole and a zzso detector are zzso by a zzso zzso The zzso integration of the zzso acquired by the active zzso zzso the signal passing through the zzso We demonstrate the imaging capability and the optical zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso can be implemented in a simple manner, providing zzso and improving optical zzso
