This study aimed to describe the influence on zzso zzso expected longevity of zzso zzso 

Data from patients implanted with dual chamber devices zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from 2003 to 2006 were collected in zzso zzso files were zzso zzso zzso assessed through zzso zzso was analyzed according to device zzso 

One thousand zzso recipients of dual chamber zzso in zzso rhythm zzso years, zzso male, zzso block zzso zzso syndrome zzso and zzso zzso dysfunction zzso were followed up to zzso months zzso from first zzso zzso zzso months to fourth zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso with automatic mode conversion and minimized zzso pacing zzso modes were programmed in zzso zzso and zzso of the patients, zzso The mean total longevity estimated by the device was zzso months zzso zzso zzso increase in longevity was observed in devices undergoing at least one zzso zzso zzso versus device presenting no zzso zzso months, zzso The parameters associated with the major increase in mean longevity were the mode zzso longevity increase of zzso months in zzso as compared to zzso mode, zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso longevity increase of zzso and zzso months for a decrease of less than zzso in A and V zzso respectively, zzso 

This study provides information on dual chamber zzso longevity and highlights the impact of zzso zzso on expected zzso
