Although it is known that low zzso ratio zzso can affect zzso zzso few studies reporting disease or treatment effects on fractional zzso zzso report zzso the implicit assumption is that zzso is zzso However, the level at which low zzso causes bias in zzso may vary with tissue zzso field strength and zzso zzso We determined the zzso thresholds at zzso T zzso 3 T in regions of white matter zzso with different zzso and compared zzso derived using manual zzso zzso analysis to zzso spatial statistics zzso an zzso zzso analysis zzso Using zzso analysis, zzso thresholds on our zzso magnetic resonance platforms were 25 at zzso T and 20 at 3 T in the zzso zzso zzso 40 at zzso and 3 T in the anterior zzso zzso zzso and 50 at zzso T and 70 at 3 T in the zzso zzso Using zzso zzso thresholds were 20 at zzso T and 3 T in the zzso and 35 at zzso T and 40 at 3 T in the zzso Below these zzso the mean zzso increased zzso and the standard zzso zzso Achieving zzso zzso in the zzso required at least nine acquisitions at zzso T and six acquisitions at 3 zzso In the zzso and zzso zzso zzso was achieved with at least three acquisitions at zzso T and one acquisition at 3 zzso Using diffusion zzso imaging zzso to study regions of low zzso zzso zzso zzso cerebral cortex, and zzso in the abnormal brain, zzso should be zzso zzso thresholds below which zzso is biased varied with the zzso technique, inherent tissue zzso and field zzso Studies using zzso to study zzso injury should document that zzso zzso has been achieved in the region of the brain being studied as part of quality zzso
