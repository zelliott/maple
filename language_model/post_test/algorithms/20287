The significance of a zzso transient component in the overall zzso response of the zzso zzso zzso is brought into zzso First, a simulated example is presented that shows how this transient component can bias current zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso Second, new zzso are proposed that are able to estimate zzso parameters regardless of the presence of zzso Third, the new zzso are applied to experimental data, and the results are compared with those from current zzso The results clearly show that the transient component can significantly alter the apparent zzso time constant, particularly when the zzso has been zzso The zzso open new areas of research on the possible role of zzso in enhancing the zzso function of the zzso
