It has been shown that a single standard linear zzso zzso zzso under a general zzso stimulus cannot possess chaotic dynamics despite the zzso zzso Here we address the issue of whether zzso zzso network interactions can induce chaos in an IF zzso zzso Using zzso methods, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso IF zzso networks can indeed give rise to chaotic dynamics under an external periodic current zzso We also provide a precise characterization of the largest zzso zzso for these high zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, we present a stable and accurate zzso zzso for evaluating the largest zzso zzso which can overcome difficulties encountered by traditional methods for these zzso zzso systems with zzso induced by, zzso zzso of zzso
