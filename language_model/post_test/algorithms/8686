With increasing research interest in displaying and analyzing biomedical images, a practical personal computer based zzso image processing software would be zzso This paper describes the zzso of an image processing work station on a Macintosh II which features a novel edge detection capability useful for biomedical zzso The boundary finding zzso is coded in zzso Pascal, and operates at a speed comfortable for interactive zzso Depending on the complexity of the problem, it usually takes less than a minute for the measurement of an zzso The edge detection zzso has an built-in edge detector with decision-making zzso and can be efficiently controlled by a zzso In this way, the local accuracy of an automatic edge detection operator, and the global accuracy of the human eye (through manual control of a zzso are zzso
