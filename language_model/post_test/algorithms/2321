zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is usually based on acquisition of alternating series of images under rest and an zzso task zzso Brain zzso maps can be generated from zzso data sets by applying several mathematical zzso Two methods of image zzso have been zzso zzso simple difference of mean values between rest and zzso and zzso zzso zzso The comparison shows that the difference method is very sensitive to arbitrary signal fluctuations as seen mainly in large vessels zzso in the zzso zzso leading to zzso activated spots in brain zzso zzso In contrary, zzso zzso maps show strongly reduced sensitivity for fluctuations and have the advantage of giving zzso thresholds by setting significance zzso This allows the comparison of zzso strength between patient zzso by using a grid overlay technique leading to an observer independent zzso of the stimulation zzso The method was able to reproduce previous findings of zzso differences between healthy volunteers and schizophrenic zzso Moreover, a simple zzso for the correction of slight head movements during the functional imaging task is zzso The zzso is based on shifting the zzso data set relative to a reference image by maximizing the linear correlation zzso This leads to a further reduction of insignificant brain zzso and to an improvement in brain zzso map zzso
