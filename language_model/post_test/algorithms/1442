We used zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso adults from the zzso Heart Study to evaluate the performance of 10 zzso criteria in detecting left zzso zzso before and after adjustment for zzso age and zzso 

zzso improvement in the sensitivity and specificity of zzso zzso criteria for detection of zzso left zzso zzso using zzso criteria adjusted for age and obesity has been zzso 

zzso correlation and zzso analyses were used to identify the five most sensitive zzso criteria and to adjust them for age and zzso Standard and truncated receiver operating characteristic zzso were used to compare the selected zzso 

Linear zzso of left zzso mass on zzso zzso body mass index and age yielded considerably stronger relations for women than for men because of the greater correlation between zzso mass and body mass index in zzso zzso and age adjustment of the five zzso criteria produced considerable improvement in their zzso The zzso sum of the R wave in lead zzso and the S wave in lead zzso alone and in combination with zzso zzso had a sensitivity at zzso specificity of zzso and zzso respectively, in men and zzso and zzso respectively, in women after zzso zzso of critical zzso for the adjusted criteria and representative performance values are zzso 

zzso of obesity and age in zzso zzso consistently improves their performance in the detection of zzso The development of such criteria will enhance the utility of this inexpensive screening zzso Such zzso approaches should be used in clinical trials to assess the efficacy of zzso treatment to effect zzso of left zzso zzso A search for further improvements in the efficacy of zzso criteria for this purpose is zzso Independent validation of this approach is zzso
