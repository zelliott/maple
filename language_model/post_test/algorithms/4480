zzso cancer zzso are part of a legacy of safety testing that has not changed significantly over the past 30 zzso The zzso are expensive, time zzso and use hundreds of zzso Fewer than 1500 chemicals have been tested in a zzso cancer zzso compared to the thousands of environmental and industrial chemicals that remain untested for zzso zzso In this study, we used existing data generated by the National zzso Program zzso to identify gene expression zzso that can predict results from a zzso cancer zzso A set of 13 diverse chemicals was selected from those tested by the zzso Seven chemicals were positive for increased lung tumor zzso in female zzso mice and six were zzso Female mice were exposed zzso to each of the 13 zzso and zzso analysis was performed on the zzso zzso zzso analysis using the gene expression profiles identified a set of eight probe sets corresponding to six genes whose expression correctly predicted the increase in lung tumor zzso with zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity were zzso and zzso zzso Among the six genes in the zzso signature, most were zzso involved in zzso and zzso zzso and one gene was a growth factor zzso involved in lung zzso The results demonstrate that increases in chemically induced lung tumor zzso in female mice can be predicted using gene zzso from a zzso exposure and may form the basis of a more efficient and economical approach for evaluating the zzso activity of zzso
