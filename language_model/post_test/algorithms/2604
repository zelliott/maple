Air quality is a major concern for the public; therefore, the reliability of accurate models in predicting the air quality is of a major zzso In this study, a zzso air zzso model, known as the Air zzso model for Road Sources in Urban zzso zzso was developed to predict the ground level zzso for a contaminant of zzso It was demonstrated that this model could be used successfully in place of or in conjunction with ambient air monitoring stations in determining the local Air Quality Index zzso The zzso model was validated against the US zzso zzso model before it was used to conduct two studies in this zzso These two studies simulated weekday morning rush-hour tailpipe emissions of CO and predicted ground level zzso The first study used the zzso model to predict ground level zzso of CO from the tailpipe emissions for roads and highways located in the vicinity of the Toronto West ambient air monitoring zzso The second study involved an expansion of the domain to predict ground level zzso of CO from tailpipe emissions from highways in the City of Toronto, Ontario, zzso The predicted zzso were then compared to the data collected from the Toronto West ambient air monitoring zzso The results of the zzso model indicated that the air quality in the immediate vicinity of roads or highways is highly impacted by the tailpipe zzso Higher zzso were observed for the areas adjacent to the road and highway zzso The tailpipe emissions of CO from highways had a higher contribution to the local air zzso The predicted ground level zzso from the zzso model zzso when compared to the observed data from the monitoring zzso however, despite this, the zzso model is zzso
