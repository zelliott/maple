In the zzso nerve terminals of the zzso sympathetic zzso repetitive nerve firing evokes zzso zzso that zzso zzso An zzso based on an zzso expansion method was used for fitting these zzso zzso zzso The data were fitted by a linear combination of two to four exponential zzso A mathematical model with three zzso zzso compartments was developed to describe the observed zzso zzso The model predicts that the number of exponential functions, zzso contained in the zzso data zzso to zzso zzso zzso stores that release zzso during the zzso Moreover, when a store stops releasing or starts to release zzso the zzso data should be fitted by functions that contain one less exponential component for the former and one more for the latter than do the fitting functions for control zzso Because of the current lack of a zzso by which quantitative comparisons can be made between two zzso processes when at least one of them contained more than one exponential zzso we defined a zzso the overall rate zzso of zzso as the trace of the zzso zzso of the differential equation systems of our zzso We used the mathematical properties of the model and of the OR to interpret effects of zzso and of a zzso zzso on zzso zzso The results of the analysis were consistent with the zzso store, zzso and another, yet unidentified store release zzso into the zzso of the zzso nerve terminals during zzso zzso Our model also predicts that zzso zzso zzso accounted for more than zzso of all the flux rates across various zzso combined and that there are type 3 and type 1 and/or type 2 zzso receptors in these zzso
