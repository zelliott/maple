In many research areas it is necessary to find differences between treatment groups with several zzso For example, studies of zzso data seek to find a significant difference in location parameters from zero or one for ratios zzso for each zzso However, in some studies a significant zzso of the difference in locations from zero (or 1 in terms of the zzso is biologically zzso A relevant difference or ratio is sought in such zzso 

This article addresses the use of zzso tests on ratios for a zzso parallel zzso group zzso Two empirical procedures are proposed which zzso the zzso test on zzso As both procedures test a hypothesis for each zzso the resulting multiple testing problem has to be zzso zzso the procedures include a zzso zzso Both procedures are extensions of available procedures for point zzso hypotheses achieving exact control of the zzso error zzso Whereas the shift of the zzso hypothesis alone would give zzso solutions, the problems that are the reason for the empirical considerations discussed here arise by the fact that the shift is considered in both directions and the whole zzso space in between these two limits has to be accepted as zzso zzso 

The first zzso to be discussed uses a zzso algorithm, and is appropriate for designs with a moderately large number of zzso However, many experiments have limited sample zzso Then the second procedure might be more appropriate, where zzso is corrected according to a concept of zzso order of zzso
