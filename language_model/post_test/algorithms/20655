We describe an zzso for the automated generation of molecular structures subject to geometric and connectivity zzso The method relies on simulated zzso and zzso zzso of a penalty function that contains a variety of conditions and can be useful in zzso drug design zzso The procedure controls the diversity and complexity of the generated zzso zzso selection filters are an integral part and drive the zzso Several procedures have been developed to achieve reliable zzso A number of template sets can be defined and combined to control the range of molecules which are zzso Ring systems are zzso Normally, the zzso complexity is on of the most elusive and difficult factors to control when zzso zzso and zzso are built by joining zzso Here this is not an issue; the decision about which systems are acceptable, and which are not, is made before the run is zzso zzso for inclusion and exclusion spheres are incorporated into the objective function, and, by using a flexible zzso the structure generation can be directed and more zzso zzso zzso is a reliable zzso and zzso zzso to the global zzso The objective functions used here are zzso so it is likely that each run will produce a different set of good zzso
