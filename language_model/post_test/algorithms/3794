Often zzso is measured in a few slightly different conditions to investigate the functionality of the human zzso This kind of data sets show similarities, though are different for each zzso When solving the inverse problem zzso performing the source zzso one encounters the problem that this zzso is zzso constraints are necessary to solve and stabilize the solution to the zzso Moreover, a substantial amount of data is needed to avoid a signal to noise ratio zzso that is too poor for source zzso In the case of similar conditions, this common information can be exploited by analyzing the data sets zzso The here proposed coupled zzso model zzso provides an integrated method in which these similarities between conditions are used to solve and stabilize the inverse zzso The coupled zzso model is zzso when data sets contain common sources or common source time zzso The coupled zzso model uses a set of common sources and a set of common source time functions zzso to model all conditions in one single zzso The data of each condition are zzso described as a linear combination of these common spatial and common zzso zzso This linear combination is specified in a zzso zzso for each data zzso The coupled zzso model was applied in two simulation studies and in one experimental zzso The simulations show that the errors in the estimated spatial and zzso parameters decrease compared to the standard separate zzso A decrease in position error of a factor of 10 was shown for the zzso of two nearby zzso In the experimental application, the coupled zzso model was shown to be necessary to obtain a plausible solution in at least 3 of 15 conditions zzso Moreover, using the zzso a direct comparison between parameters in different conditions is possible, whereas in separate models, the zzso of the zzso parameters varies in general from data set to data zzso
