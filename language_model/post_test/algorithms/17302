zzso PET scanning for an zzso study produces a large number of zzso images by data acquisition over multiple bed zzso The zzso and zzso zzso images are often used for better understanding of zzso zzso We reduced the number of PET images by calculating projection images and evaluated the merit of additional data processing for the zzso and detection of zzso After reconstructing zzso zzso PET images zzso bed zzso of eight cancer patients, zzso and lateral projection images were calculated by the maximum intensity projection zzso algorithm, the standard zzso projection zzso zzso and the summed zzso projection zzso zzso The projection images were compared with zzso zzso images for visualizing zzso The focal zzso of various positions in original zzso PET data zzso zzso zzso were zzso on only two zzso zzso images when zzso of hot spots did not zzso Even if one hot spot was superimposed over the other hot spot, we could recognize the existence of at least one focus and determine the true positions of the hot spots from corresponding zzso zzso The zzso image was found inferior for showing a contrast of small zzso to the corresponding zzso images in the neck, zzso and zzso The zzso image failed to zzso many zzso zzso zzso is a promising technique for the easy preliminary assessment of tumor distribution in zzso zzso PET zzso
