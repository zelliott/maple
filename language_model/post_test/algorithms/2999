zzso are the genetic markers of choice for many population genetic studies, but must be isolated de zzso using zzso approaches where prior genetic data are zzso Here we zzso zzso zzso sequencing technology to produce millions of base pairs of short zzso reads, which were screened with zzso zzso to identify zzso that amplify zzso zzso zzso Using this approach we isolated 13 zzso zzso for the blue duck zzso zzso a species for which limited genetic data were zzso Our zzso approach eliminates zzso genetic steps, significantly reducing the time and cost requirements of marker development compared with traditional zzso While this application of zzso sequencing may seem obvious to many, this study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first attempt to describe the use of zzso sequencing for the development of zzso markers in a zzso zzso or indeed any zzso
