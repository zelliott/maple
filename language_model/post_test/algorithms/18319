A computer based simulation method was developed to assess the relative effectiveness and availability of various zzso compensation zzso in single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The effect of the zzso of zzso zzso distribution in the body, the errors in determining a body zzso and the statistical noise on reconstruction accuracy and the zzso time in using the zzso were zzso The zzso were classified into three groups: zzso post correction and zzso correction zzso Furthermore, a hybrid method was devised by combining several zzso This study will be useful for understanding the zzso limitations and strengths of the zzso and searching for a practical correction method for zzso zzso in zzso
