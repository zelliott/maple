zzso zzso is a novel sensitive approach for recognition of distant similarity between proteins based on consensus alignments of zzso zzso Specifically, zzso compares sequence profiles combined with predicted secondary structure by utilizing several scoring systems and alignment zzso In our zzso tests, zzso zzso many individual zzso including fold recognition zzso and it can compete with zzso zzso that base their strength on the structural comparison of zzso In addition, zzso which enables detection of very distant relationships even if the zzso structure for the reference protein is not known, has a zzso zzso This new method is applied to 860 zzso protein families with unknown function zzso and provides many novel zzso assignments available zzso at zzso zzso discussion is provided for two of the most interesting zzso zzso and zzso are predicted to be a zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
