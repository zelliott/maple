zzso plays a crucial role in the formation, progression and zzso of zzso zzso zzso these mechanisms is important to improve current diagnosis and treatment of zzso zzso In this study we simulate and analyze the pressure zzso and the blood flow fields in growing zzso zzso zzso the pressure zzso are obtained according to the blood zzso zzso at the axis of the inlet to the artery, which can be acquired by zzso zzso zzso Then, blood flow fields are calculated by solving the zzso zzso equations and continuity equation using the zzso series zzso zzso show that the higher the aneurysm zzso degree is, the lower the maximum zzso zzso will zzso zzso the zzso zzso may be used to analyze the characteristics of blood flow signals from aneurysm and to forecast the size of zzso This sensitive zzso can be zzso for the detection of vessel diseases, which is promising to provide a useful reference in clinical zzso
