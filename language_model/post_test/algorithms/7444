This paper introduces a novel method for zzso zzso varying zzso in zzso zzso This is achieved through full zzso zzso on a zzso registration model, where the prior on transformations is zzso as a weighted mixture of zzso zzso zzso Such an approach has the advantage of allowing the registration to be more zzso driven by the data than a more traditional global zzso zzso such as zzso zzso The proposed method zzso determines the influence of the prior in a local zzso The importance of the prior may be reduced in areas where the data better supports zzso or can enforce a stronger constraint in less zzso zzso zzso the use of such a zzso zzso prior may reduce the unwanted impact of zzso on the zzso deformation zzso This is especially important for applications such as zzso based zzso where the features of interest are directly derived from the deformation zzso The proposed approach is demonstrated with application to zzso based zzso analysis of subjects with Alzheimer's disease and healthy zzso The results show that using the proposed zzso zzso prior leads to deformation fields that have a substantially lower average complexity, but which also provide more accurate zzso of statistical group zzso
