The head pose zzso problem is well known to be a challenging task in computer vision and is a useful tool for several applications involving zzso zzso This problem can be stated as a zzso one where the input is an image and the output is pan and tilt zzso Finding the optimal zzso is a hard problem because of the high zzso of the input zzso of image zzso and the large variety of zzso and zzso We propose a new method combining a boosting strategy for feature selection and a neural network for the zzso Potential features are a very large set of zzso zzso which are well known to be adapted to face image zzso To achieve the feature selection, a new zzso zzso zzso zzso is introduced which is able to evaluate the link between a feature and the output without any zzso of the joint probability density function as in the Mutual zzso The boosting strategy uses this criterion at each zzso features are evaluated by the zzso using weights on examples zzso from the error produced by the neural network trained at the previous zzso Tests are carried out on the commonly used Pointing 04 database and compared with three state-of-the-art zzso We also evaluate the accuracy of the zzso on zzso a database with a high angular zzso Our method is compared positively to a zzso zzso Network, which is well known to incorporate feature extraction in its first zzso
