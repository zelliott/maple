This paper presents a solution to an aiming problem in the remote sensing of vital signs using an integration of two zzso The problem is that to collect meaningful data with a zzso zzso the antenna must be pointed very precisely at the zzso zzso Even small movements could make the data zzso To solve this problem, we attached a camera to the zzso zzso and mounted this combined system on a zzso zzso Our zzso initially finds a zzso face and then tracks zzso through subsequent zzso while calculating the position of the zzso zzso For each frame, the camera sends the location of the chest to the zzso base, which zzso accordingly to make the antenna point at the zzso zzso This paper presents a system for concurrent tracking and data acquisition with results from some sample zzso
