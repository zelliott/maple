A new automated and rapid zzso method for determining the effect of zzso composition on zzso has been zzso It is based on the zzso of pH values of buffer solutions of variable zzso compositions using a combined glass zzso zzso of small volumes of one precisely zzso solution into another, both containing exactly the same zzso zzso of the buffer zzso can produce continuous changes in the zzso zzso Two sequences of potential zzso one of increasing and the other of decreasing zzso content, are sufficient to obtain the zzso values of the zzso compound within the complete zzso range in about zzso The experimental design, procedures, and calculations needed to convert the measured pH into the zzso zzso values are thoroughly zzso This rapid and automated method allows the systematic study of the effect of zzso compositions and temperatures on the zzso It has been applied to study the zzso zzso of two zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso in zzso zzso within the range from 0 to zzso zzso at temperatures between zzso and zzso These volatile compounds are frequently used to control the pH of the mobile phase in zzso especially in methods coupled to zzso zzso The obtained zzso values are in excellent agreement with those previously zzso The results were fitted to empirical functions between zzso and temperature and zzso These zzso which can be used to estimate the zzso of these substances at any composition and temperature, would be highly useful in practical work during zzso method zzso
