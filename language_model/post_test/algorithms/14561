Whole zzso and whole zzso sequencing are likely to be potent tools in the study of common diseases and complex zzso Despite this promise, some very difficult issues in data management and statistical analysis must be squarely zzso The number of rare zzso identified by sequencing is apt to be much larger than the number of common zzso encountered in current association zzso The low zzso of rare zzso alone will make association testing zzso This article extends the penalized zzso framework for model selection in zzso association data to sequencing data with both common and rare zzso Previous research has shown that lasso penalties discourage irrelevant zzso from entering a zzso The zzso penalties dealt with here group zzso by gene or zzso zzso biological information can be incorporated by zzso penalties by zzso The current paper examines some of the tradeoffs in using pure lasso penalties, pure group penalties, and zzso of the two types of zzso All of the zzso and statistical advantages of lasso penalized zzso are retained in this richer zzso The overall strategy is implemented in the free statistical zzso analysis software zzso and illustrated on both simulated and real zzso
