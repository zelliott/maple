This study reports on the novel use of a portable system to measure gait cycle zzso zzso were made by a zzso zzso over the lower trunk during timed walking over a range of self-administered zzso zzso from each trial were transformed to a zzso coordinate system and analyzed by an unbiased zzso procedure to obtain zzso step zzso and measures of gait zzso and zzso By zzso zzso zzso gait parameters could be compared at a zzso zzso It was demonstrated that analysis of gait cycle parameters which previously required fixed laboratory equipment and paced walking procedures, now can be made from data obtained by a timing device and a portable sensor at free walking zzso
