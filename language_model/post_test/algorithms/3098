zzso zzso is an important and widely zzso cellular function in zzso zzso The zzso zzso complex zzso plays an important role in zzso as it connects the zzso respiratory chain to the zzso acid zzso cycle where it zzso the zzso of zzso to zzso Cellular response to the zzso dysfunction zzso impaired zzso thus has important implications not only for zzso applications but also for understanding cellular physiology underlying zzso diseases such as zzso We therefore explored the zzso and zzso response of zzso zzso to the deletion of zzso that codes for an essential zzso of the zzso 

Although the zzso has no direct role in zzso regulation and the flux through the corresponding reaction under the studied conditions is very low, deletion of zzso resulted in significant changes in the expression of several genes involved in various cellular processes ranging from metabolism to the zzso By using various zzso tools we explored the organization of these zzso changes in the zzso and other cellular functional interaction zzso 

Our results show that the zzso regulatory response resulting from the impaired respiratory function is linked to several different parts of the zzso including fatty acid and zzso zzso
