Finding the electrical zzso of tissue is highly important for understanding the zzso structure and zzso However, the inverse problem of zzso spatial zzso from data is highly zzso and zzso zzso In this paper, we propose a novel method to solve the inverse problem of zzso tissue zzso from a set of zzso potential and stimuli zzso made by zzso zzso zzso We first formalize the discrete forward model of zzso potential zzso based on a zzso model with an zzso zzso electrical zzso zzso Then, we propose a novel parallel zzso zzso for solving the complex inverse problem of zzso the electrical zzso zzso Specifically, we propose a zzso approximation with a parallel zzso zzso routine that zzso the joint zzso field zzso problem into a set of zzso zzso zzso allowing the use of efficient standard zzso zzso Finally, using zzso examples of several electrical zzso field zzso and noise levels, we analyze the performance of our algorithm, and discuss its application to real zzso obtained from zzso cardiac zzso using data collected with a high-resolution zzso zzso
