The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso is a marker of zzso plaque deposition in brain, and binding potential is usually zzso using the zzso as a reference where the specific binding is zzso The use of the zzso as a reference, however, has been questioned by the reported zzso zzso retention in familial Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso In this work, we developed a supervised zzso procedure for the automatic extraction of a reference region in zzso zzso zzso zzso models each gray matter zzso as the linear combination of three zzso kinetic classes, normal and zzso gray matter, and blood pool, and extract reference zzso in which the contribution of the normal gray matter class is zzso In the validation with idiopathic zzso subjects, supervised zzso extracted reference zzso mostly in the zzso that indicated little specific zzso zzso and total distribution volumes of the extracted region were lower than those of the zzso Next, the methodology was applied to the familial zzso cohort where the zzso zzso load had been demonstrated zzso resulting in higher binding potential compared with that obtained with the zzso zzso The supervised zzso method is a useful tool for the accurate zzso of zzso zzso
