This paper presents an improvement in the zzso image zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The authors propose to inject zzso a zzso zzso in the Red Green Blue zzso space to increase the class separation in the HS zzso The goal of the work is the development of an zzso to obtain the optimal zzso zzso for injection that zzso the separation between the classes in the HS zzso The chromatic zzso zzso zzso (of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is used to obtain the optimal zzso to zzso The proposal is applied on each frame of a zzso image sequence in zzso It has been tested in applications with reduced contrast between the zzso of the background and the object, and particularly when the size of the object is very small in comparison with the size of the captured zzso Numerous tests have confirmed that this proposal improves the zzso process, considerably reducing the effects of the variation of the light intensity of the zzso Several tests have been made in skin zzso in applications for sign language recognition via computer vision, where an accurate zzso of hands and face is zzso
