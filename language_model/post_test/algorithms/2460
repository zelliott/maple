Changes in the density of zzso zzso receptors in the zzso membrane are critical for zzso whereas malfunction of precisely regulated zzso zzso activity may be involved in zzso In cultured rat zzso zzso we have studied the regulation of the surface density of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Application of 5 zzso zzso for 24 h followed by a zzso period of 24 h decreased the response of zzso receptors for at least zzso The reduction was caused by a decrease in the surface density of zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso remained zzso Our data indicate that long but zzso low level zzso of zzso receptors can cause long-term changes in their zzso composition in cultured zzso
