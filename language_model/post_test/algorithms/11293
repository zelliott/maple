The zzso fungus zzso zzso played a central role in the development of zzso zzso zzso and molecular biology, and continues to serve as a model zzso for zzso zzso Here, we have reconstructed a zzso model of its zzso This model consists of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 cellular zzso and is supported by extensive manual zzso of zzso literature zzso To aid our zzso we developed three zzso zzso which together comprise Fast zzso Reconstruction of zzso zzso These zzso are: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis zzso which predicts flux while zzso accounting for zzso zzso zzso functional zzso zzso which removes blocked reactions with a single compact linear program; and zzso zzso Of zzso zzso zzso which zzso differences between in zzso and experimental gene zzso faster than previous zzso Against an independent test set of more than 300 zzso genes that were not used to train the model, the model displays zzso sensitivity and zzso We also used the model to simulate the zzso zzso experiments originally performed on zzso by zzso predicting zzso rescue of essential genes and synthetic lethal zzso and we provide detailed zzso zzso explanations of our zzso Our model provides a reliable zzso framework for the integration and interpretation of ongoing experimental efforts in zzso and we anticipate that our methods will substantially reduce the manual effort required to develop high-quality zzso zzso models for other zzso
