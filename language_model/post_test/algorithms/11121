zzso codes assume that neural systems represent sensory zzso through the firing rates of populations of differently tuned zzso However, zzso zzso and noise correlations are known to affect the information capacity of neural zzso Although recent studies have shown that stimulus presentation reduces both zzso and rate correlations with respect to their spontaneous level, possibly improving the zzso zzso whether these second order statistics are tuned is zzso If so, zzso statistics could themselves carry information, rather than being invariably zzso Here we show that rate zzso and noise correlation vary systematically with stimulus direction in zzso selective middle zzso zzso zzso leading to characteristic tuning zzso We show that such tuning emerges in a zzso zzso network, for a set of connectivity parameters that zzso with a zzso scenario and zzso Information zzso analysis shows that zzso statistics carry information that can improve the accuracy of the population zzso
