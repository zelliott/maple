This chapter discusses the fundamental physics of zzso The application of zzso to zzso represents an important transition in the development of zzso particularly as it applies to zzso It enables zzso the amounts of specific molecules within a cell, determining whether molecules are zzso on a molecular level, measuring changes in zzso zzso within cells and zzso and measuring molecular zzso This chapter also discusses the issues important to quantitative measurement of zzso and focuses on four of quantitative zzso of zzso zzso streak cameras, zzso zzso and phase zzso Although quantitative measurement presents many pitfalls to the zzso it also presents significant opportunities to one skilled in the zzso This chapter also examines how zzso is measured in the steady state and time domain and how zzso is applied in the modern zzso zzso
