The process of drug discovery and development is time-consuming and costly, and the probability of success is zzso zzso there is rising interest in repositioning existing drugs for new medical zzso When successful, this process reduces the risk of failure and costs associated with de zzso drug zzso However, in many cases, new indications of existing drugs have been found zzso Thus there is a clear need for establishment of rational methods for drug zzso 

In this study, we have established a database we call zzso which zzso data associated with disease zzso drug development, and associated zzso and known interactions extracted from various established zzso To explore linkages of known drugs to diseases of interest from within zzso we designed the Shared Neighborhood zzso zzso zzso And to facilitate exploration of zzso zzso network, we developed a zzso data zzso software program called zzso which allows us to browse zzso data in an interactive and dynamic zzso We validated this zzso tool zzso by identifying a potential application of a hypertension drug, zzso zzso to induce lung cancer cell zzso 

By combining zzso an integrated zzso database, with Shared Neighborhood zzso zzso algorithm, we developed a knowledge platform to rationally identify new indications for known zzso approved drugs, which can be customized to specific projects using manual zzso The data in zzso is open access and can be easily explored with zzso and zzso via zzso web service zzso zzso
