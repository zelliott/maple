zzso oxide zzso plays an important role in zzso and zzso manner in numerous zzso zzso including regulation of blood pressure and blood flow, zzso zzso and zzso zzso In vascular wall, most of the zzso NO is believed to derive from zzso cell NO zzso zzso Recently, zzso zzso zzso has been identified as a source of NO in the vicinity of zzso and has been shown to participate in vascular zzso Thus NO can be produced and transported to the vascular smooth muscle cells from zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso nerve zzso mast cells, and other zzso zzso In this study, a mathematical model of NO zzso in a zzso zzso segment was zzso The model zzso the relative contribution of these NO sources and the smooth muscle availability of NO in a tissue containing an zzso blood zzso The results indicate that a source of NO derived through zzso in the zzso region can be a significant contributor to smooth muscle zzso zzso smooth muscle NO zzso are as high as 430 zzso which is consistent with reported experimental zzso ( approximately 400 zzso In addition, we used the model to analyze the smooth muscle NO availability in zzso zzso and zzso knockout experiments, zzso the presence of zzso and zzso the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso oxygen zzso The results show that NO release by zzso would significantly affect available smooth muscle zzso Further experimental and theoretical studies are required to account for distribution of zzso zzso and determine NO availability in zzso of different zzso
