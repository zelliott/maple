An increasing body of literature shows that zzso of zzso can contain clusters of functionally related zzso Most approaches to identify gene clusters zzso zzso data or zzso zzso databases to find groups of genes on zzso that are linked by common zzso A generalized method that can find gene clusters regardless of the mechanism of origin would provide researchers with an unbiased method for finding clusters and studying the evolutionary forces that give rise to zzso 

We present an zzso to identify gene clusters in zzso zzso that zzso functional categories defined in zzso zzso such as the Gene zzso zzso zzso identified in this manner need only have a common function and are not constrained by gene expression or other zzso We tested the zzso by analyzing zzso of a representative set of zzso We identified zzso variation in percentage of clustered genes as well as in properties of gene clusters including size distribution and functional zzso These properties may be diagnostic of the evolutionary forces that lead to the formation of gene zzso 

A software zzso of the zzso and example output files are available at zzso
