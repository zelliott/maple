zzso right zzso pacing has deleterious effects and becomes more significant when cumulative percent zzso pacing zzso exceeds zzso of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso mode has been shown to significantly reduce the percent zzso pacing compared to the zzso zzso This study assessed the percent of zzso pacing in a standard zzso population programmed to zzso and for which patients it is possible to achieve a zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso consecutive patients were implanted with a dual chamber zzso with a mean follow-up period of 76 zzso The zzso was calculated from device zzso between zzso discharge zzso and the zzso post implant zzso The median zzso of 107 patients (age zzso zzso 14 years; zzso zzso who were programmed to zzso was zzso The median zzso was zzso in patients with zzso zzso disease zzso and zzso in patients with zzso block zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso was observed in zzso of all patients, in 50% of zzso patients, and in zzso of zzso zzso 

The zzso mode is capable of achieving a low percent of zzso pacing in a standard zzso population with zzso and zzso In addition, zzso of patients in zzso mode demonstrated zzso zzso or zzso zzso
