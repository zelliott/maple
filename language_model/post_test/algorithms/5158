The contribution of the zzso to the spectrum of the generalized zzso constant or zzso of molecular zzso liquids is zzso both in theoretical terms and zzso by means of molecular dynamics simulation of the concrete system zzso zzso at 300 zzso As a central quantity the simulated current zzso function is modeled by a carefully designed fit zzso This not only gives a satisfactory zzso representation but yields the correct zzso upon zzso In addition the fit function can be zzso transformed zzso Both, the real and imaginary parts of the transform show expected behavior, in particular, the right limits for zero zzso This altogether demonstrates that the components of the fit function are of physical zzso
