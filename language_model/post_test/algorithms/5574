Current feature selection methods for supervised zzso of tissue samples from zzso data generally fail to exploit complementary zzso power that can be found in sets of zzso Using a feature selection method with the zzso architecture of the zzso method, including an additional preliminary step ensuring a lower bound on the number of times any feature is considered, we show when testing on a human zzso zzso data set that there are a significant number of genes that perform well when their complementary power is zzso but zzso under the zzso of popular feature selection methods that only assess genes individually on a given zzso zzso We also show that this phenomenon becomes more apparent as diagnostic specificity of the tissue samples zzso zzso
