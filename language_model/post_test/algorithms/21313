The rapid zzso technique developed in our laboratory has been employed in the study of the mechanism of promoter binding by zzso coli zzso zzso zzso We have previously reported on the zzso of the one-dimensional diffusion zzso zzso for zzso along the DNA template zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we describe the effect of salt concentration and temperature on the zzso of promoter search by zzso using zzso zzso DNA, which contains the zzso early promoter from zzso zzso as zzso Over a range of zzso zzso from 25 to 200 zzso the apparent zzso rate constant zzso for the association of zzso with the zzso promoter on this DNA template varied approximately zzso achieving a zzso value between 100 and 125 zzso zzso More significantly, the transient distribution of zzso among zzso DNA binding sites changed markedly as a function of salt zzso indicative of gross changes in the average number of base pairs covered by sliding during a zzso zzso Using the mathematical treatment outlined in our earlier report, the zzso zzso rate constant zzso was calculated from the binding zzso for the zzso as well as zzso zzso The observed variations in zzso as a function of zzso zzso concentration zzso were due primarily to changes in zzso as D1 was found to be essentially independent of zzso Interestingly, D1 decreased by one-third as the concentration of zzso was lowered from 10 to 1 zzso In addition, the dependence of zzso (and consequently the zzso equilibrium association constant, zzso on zzso agreed zzso with the results of zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Burgess, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 17, zzso though we consistently measure a weaker zzso The association rate constant was also measured between 4 and 37 degrees C, and was found to vary approximately zzso over that zzso An zzso energy for the zzso association of zzso to the zzso promoter was calculated to be zzso zzso zzso zzso while the zzso energy for one-dimensional diffusion was zzso zzso zzso zzso
