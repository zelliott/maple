zzso imaging is a very sensitive imaging zzso used in zzso molecular zzso However, in its zzso projection form, it is zzso and has poor spatial zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso promises to provide three zzso quantitative source zzso Currently, nearly all BLT reconstruction zzso in use employ the diffusion approximation theory to determine light propagation in zzso In this process, several approximations and assumptions that are made severely affect the reconstruction quality of zzso It is therefore necessary to develop novel reconstruction methods using zzso approximation models to the zzso transfer equation zzso as well as more complex zzso for the zzso of small zzso However, these zzso introduce significant challenges not only in terms of reconstruction speed but also for the overall reconstruction zzso In this paper, a novel zzso reconstruction framework is proposed which uses a simplified zzso zzso approximation zzso Using this zzso a simple linear relationship between the unknown source distribution and the surface measured zzso density can be zzso The distributed storage and parallel operations of the finite zzso zzso make zzso zzso resolved reconstruction feasible at the small animal whole body zzso Performance zzso of the major steps of the framework remarkably improves reconstruction zzso Experimental reconstructions with zzso zzso and real mice show the effectiveness and potential of this zzso This work constitutes an important advance towards developing more precise BLT reconstruction zzso that zzso zzso zzso particularly zzso zzso forms to the zzso for in zzso small animal zzso
