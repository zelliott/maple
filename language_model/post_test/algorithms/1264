zzso zzso represent a clinical problem with considerable zzso especially in the elderly zzso Standard treatment is the use of leg zzso zzso to improve the underlying zzso hypertension, but not every zzso zzso in a timely fashion with this treatment zzso zzso are needed to predict the outcome of standard treatment as soon as possible to institute alternative zzso 

To zzso study the rate of healing in a group of elderly patients with zzso ulcers, based on a previously described equation that takes into account the size and perimeter of the zzso 

We studied by computerized zzso 15 elderly patients with zzso zzso treated with leg zzso zzso for up to 24 weeks or until complete zzso We determined weekly healing rate by comparing zzso size at each visit to initial baseline size zzso healing zzso Also, we used a novel way to calculate the healing rate at a given week by taking the mean of all previous healing rates between each visit zzso healing zzso 

When using the zzso healing rate, we noted what we describe as a healing rate instability from week to week, which decreases the ability to predict complete zzso However, the zzso healing rate allowed us to predict complete healing as early as 3 weeks from starting therapy zzso 

In this prospective study of elderly patients with zzso ulcers, we describe a novel and more powerful method for predicting complete healing of zzso zzso with zzso therapy zzso
