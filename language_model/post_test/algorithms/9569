The parameters characterizing tissue distribution refer to the zzso partition zzso zzso which can be used to derive volume of distribution at zzso zzso The effort for predicting drug distribution in human has been further expanded to calculation methods using in zzso zzso The objective of the present study was to develop a novel prediction method to estimate human zzso for zzso zzso The zzso performance of the novel method was compared with other well established in zzso methods available in the zzso zzso information collected from previous prediction studies of zzso facilitated the development of the novel zzso This was based on the calculation of zzso from data on zzso which were estimated by zzso the zzso zzso ratio in zzso zzso with the zzso red blood cells zzso zzso determined in zzso The comparative assessment of the novel correlation method with existing prediction methods of human zzso was done using a literature zzso of 61 basic drugs (at least one zzso zzso or zzso zzso The five existing zzso prediction methods published in the literature are comprised of four versions of tissue zzso models along with the model of zzso using the principle of zzso The statistical analysis of the prediction performance indicated that the novel method demonstrated a greater degree of accuracy compared to all other published zzso The maximum percentage of predicted values that fall within a zzso range is zzso for the basic drugs zzso Overall, the present study describes the development and the assessment of the zzso performance of the novel prediction method of human zzso based upon in zzso data, which appears to be superior based on the current zzso studied for basic zzso
