We present an efficient new zzso that zzso all possible zzso of a protein that satisfy a given set of distance zzso Rapid growth of all possible zzso zzso on the diamond lattice provides construction of zzso representations of a protein zzso We investigated the dependence of the number of zzso on zzso distance restraints for the proteins zzso pancreatic zzso zzso and zzso zzso of between one and two contacts per zzso is shown to be sufficient to restrict the number of candidate structures to approximately 1,000 zzso zzso zzso zzso of atomic position comparisons between pairs of these 1,000 structures revealed that these zzso can be grouped into about 25 families of zzso These results suggest a new approach to assessing alternative protein folds given a very limited number of distance zzso Such restraints are available from several experimental techniques such as zzso zzso energy transfer zzso zzso and zzso zzso This work focuses on exhaustive zzso of protein structures with emphasis on the possible use of zzso distance zzso
