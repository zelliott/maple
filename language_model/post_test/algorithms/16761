We present here the 2011 update of the zzso Service zzso zzso that predicts the wide selection of 88 different types of the single zzso acid zzso modifications zzso in protein zzso The selection of zzso confirmed modifications is acquired from the latest zzso and zzso databases for zzso The sequence vicinity of each modified zzso is represented using zzso acids zzso features zzso using high quality zzso zzso obtaining by automatic zzso of known zzso extracted from zzso zzso For each type of the zzso zzso the method builds the ensemble of zzso zzso zzso pattern zzso each zzso different objectives during the training (for example the recall, precision or area under the zzso curve zzso The consensus is built using zzso technology, which combines zzso instances of machine learning algorithm, and the data fusion of different training objects zzso in order to boost the overall prediction accuracy of zzso short sequence zzso The performance of zzso zzso is compared with the accuracy of previous versions, which were constructed using single machine learning methods zzso neural networks, support zzso zzso Our software improves the average zzso score of the earlier version by close to 7 % as calculated on the test zzso of all 88 zzso zzso Moreover, for the selected zzso sequence motifs types it is able to improve the prediction performance by almost 32 zzso when compared with previously used single machine learning zzso zzso the zzso consensus zzso methodology on the average boosts the zzso score up to around 89 zzso averaged over all 88 zzso zzso zzso results for single machine learning methods and the consensus methodology are also zzso together with the comparison to previously published methods and state-of-the-art software zzso The source code and zzso zzso of zzso tool are available at zzso under zzso zzso zzso
