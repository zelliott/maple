Although zzso zzso imaging zzso with zzso stress is the standard method for screening coronary artery disease zzso in patients with left bundle branch block zzso controversies remain about its correct zzso We sought the best interpretation approach in these patients to achieve higher zzso zzso patients with zzso underwent zzso with zzso stress and the criteria for positive results with four patterns of interpretation were as zzso zzso zzso any zzso or irreversible zzso zzso in the zzso irrespective of the location or extension was considered zzso zzso B: any zzso or irreversible zzso abnormalities except in the zzso region were defined as zzso zzso zzso in the absence of fixed zzso cavity zzso the scan was interpreted the same as pattern A, while in the presence of fixed zzso cavity zzso only the abnormalities outside the zzso territory was defined as zzso zzso zzso as in pattern C, except that in the absence of fixed zzso cavity zzso the scan was read according to pattern zzso For all patients, the zzso results were considered as gold standard of zzso zzso Our results showed that the false positive rate of zzso in patients with fixed zzso zzso was zzso while in cases with normal zzso size or transient zzso was zzso This difference was more prominent in the female zzso The accuracy for screening zzso for patterns A, B, C and D were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso D was the better approach in female cases and patients with fixed zzso zzso In conclusion, a) in the male population without fixed defects in the zzso region, the specificity and accuracy are high in all patterns and the pattern of reading does not significantly influence the diagnostic value of zzso for zzso zzso b) in zzso patients, fixed defects limited to the zzso region should be considered a significant finding only when zzso cavity is not zzso
