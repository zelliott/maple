The balance between exploration and exploitation is one of the key problems of action selection in zzso zzso exploitation causes the agent to reach the locally optimal policies quickly, whereas excessive exploration degrades the performance of the zzso zzso even if it may accelerate the learning process and allow avoiding the locally optimal zzso In this paper, finding the optimum policy in zzso is described as search for the optimum solution in zzso zzso The zzso criterion of simulated zzso zzso is introduced in order to balance exploration and exploitation of zzso and the modified zzso zzso based on this zzso zzso is zzso zzso show that zzso zzso more quickly than zzso or zzso zzso and that the search does not suffer of performance degradation due to excessive zzso
