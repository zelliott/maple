We propose a criterion for optimal zzso selection in zzso models of proteins and develop a refined elastic network model zzso of bovine zzso The zzso zzso distribution of the zzso zzso disagrees with the zzso distribution obtained from an zzso zzso however, the zzso distribution is recovered by strengthening interactions between atoms that are backbone zzso We use the zzso model to analyze zzso mechanisms of zzso and find relatively strong communication between the regulatory and active zzso
