zzso for primary prevention recommend calculation of lifetime risk for cardiovascular disease zzso in addition to zzso zzso We aimed at evaluating the distribution of zzso lifetime risk and the percentage of Italians having low zzso but high zzso zzso 

zzso general zzso cohort zzso 

We included zzso zzso zzso cardiovascular zzso individuals aged zzso years, among those randomly recruited in the framework of the zzso zzso Participants were zzso into three groups: low zzso zzso zzso and non zzso zzso low zzso zzso and high zzso zzso zzso risk was evaluated by the equation provided by the Italian zzso zzso Lifetime risk was evaluated using the zzso derived from the zzso zzso 

High zzso risk was prevalent in zzso population zzso of men and zzso of zzso Among individuals with low zzso risk, zzso had high lifetime risk zzso men and zzso zzso The proportion of individuals with very low lifetime risk due to all optimal risk factors was zzso only zzso men and zzso zzso 

A large proportion of Italian adults not qualified for zzso primary prevention because of their very low zzso predicted zzso risk, are in fact at high risk to develop a zzso event in their zzso therefore zzso approaches should be sought to modify the overall distribution of individual risk zzso These findings offer helpful information for policy makers involved in contrasting the burden of zzso especially in women and young zzso
