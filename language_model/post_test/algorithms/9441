The pipeline for zzso and zzso analyses zzso is a set of scripts with a web interface developed to analyze DNA array data generated by array image zzso zzso zzso is designed for use with zzso or zzso array data and to work as a pipeline in five classes zzso format, zzso data analysis, zzso and array zzso It can also be used as a zzso in the zzso Software zzso an zzso database for array analysis, or used in a local version of the web zzso All scripts in zzso were developed in the zzso programming language and statistical analysis functions were implemented in the R statistical zzso zzso our package is a zzso zzso Our zzso can correctly select almost zzso of the zzso expressed zzso showing a superior performance compared to other methods of zzso The pipeline software has been applied to zzso expressed sequence tags zzso public data of zzso exposed to cold for 3 to 48 zzso zzso identified thirty zzso genes previously unidentified in this public zzso Fourteen genes were zzso two had a variable expression and the other zzso were zzso in the zzso These new findings certainly were a consequence of using a superior statistical analysis approach, since the original study did not take into account the dependence of data zzso on the average signal intensity of each zzso The web zzso supplementary information, and the package source code are available, free, to zzso users at zzso
