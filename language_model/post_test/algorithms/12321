Numerous feature selection methods have been applied to the identification of zzso expressed genes in zzso zzso These include simple fold change, classical zzso and moderated zzso Even though these methods return gene lists that are often zzso few direct comparisons of these zzso We present an empirical study in which we compare some of the most commonly used feature selection zzso We apply these to 9 publicly available zzso and compare, both the gene lists produced and how these perform in class prediction of test zzso 

In this study, we compared the efficiency of the feature selection zzso significance analysis of zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso empirical zzso zzso template matching, zzso between group analysis zzso Area under the receiver operating characteristic zzso curve, the Welch zzso fold change, rank products, and sets of randomly selected zzso In each case these methods were applied to 9 different zzso zzso class) zzso zzso zzso we found little agreement in gene lists produced by the different zzso Only 8 to zzso of genes were in common across all 10 feature selection zzso zzso we evaluated the class prediction efficiency of each gene list in training and test zzso using four supervised zzso 

We report that the choice of feature selection method, the number of genes in the zzso the number of cases zzso and the noise in the zzso substantially influence zzso zzso zzso are made for choice of feature zzso Area under a zzso curve performed well with zzso that had low levels of noise and large sample zzso Rank products performs well when zzso had low numbers of samples or high levels of zzso The zzso zzso zzso performed well across a range of sample zzso
