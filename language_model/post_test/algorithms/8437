General zzso can zzso the zzso type 3 zzso zzso which may be involved in processes zzso zzso and zzso and peripheral zzso The effects of the new volatile zzso zzso and the gaseous zzso nitrous oxide zzso and xenon zzso on the zzso zzso have not been zzso 

zzso zzso zzso receptors were expressed in zzso zzso The effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso currents were studied using a zzso zzso clamping zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso currents to 182 zzso 12 and 117 zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibited zzso currents to 76 zzso 1, 77 zzso 4, and 34 zzso zzso zzso The zzso effects were zzso for zzso and competitive for zzso and zzso None of these zzso effects showed zzso zzso 

zzso general zzso produce diverse effects on the zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso enhanced zzso zzso function in a zzso manner, which is consistent with previous zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso suggesting the zzso mechanism of zzso might be different from those of zzso and zzso
