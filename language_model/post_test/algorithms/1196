In computer simulations of zzso CT systems one can either use continuous geometrical descriptions for zzso or a zzso zzso The zzso approach allows arbitrary zzso to be defined without being confined to geometrical zzso The disadvantage of the zzso approach is that inherent errors are introduced due to the phantom zzso To study effects of phantom zzso zzso CT simulations were run for a zzso geometry with phantom zzso sizes ranging from zzso to 2 times the reconstructed zzso size and noise levels corresponding to zzso - zzso photons per detector zzso prior to zzso The number of rays traced per detector element was varied from 1 to zzso zzso in the filtered zzso images caused by changing the phantom zzso sizes and number of rays traced were assessed by calculating the difference between reconstructions based on the finest zzso and zzso zzso zzso In noise free simulations, all phantom zzso sizes produced a measurable difference in comparison with the finest phantom zzso zzso When even a small amount of noise was added to the projection data, the differences due to the phantom zzso were masked by the noise, and in all cases there was almost no improvement by using a phantom zzso that was more than twice as fine as the reconstruction zzso No substantial improvement was achieved by tracing more than 4 rays per detector zzso
