A common method of increasing zzso response zzso in functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso is to average signal zzso across zzso This technique is potentially problematic because the zzso response may vary across the zzso Such averaging may destroy significant features in the zzso evolution of the zzso response that stem from either differences in vascular zzso to neural tissue or actual differences in the neural response between two averaged zzso Two novel techniques are presented in this paper in order to aid in an improved zzso estimate of the zzso response while preserving statistically significant zzso zzso The first technique is signal zzso zzso for periodic stimulus zzso that involves a simple zzso zzso This increases zzso via zzso zzso The second technique that we call clustered components analysis is a novel zzso zzso method based upon an explicit statistical data zzso It includes an zzso method for zzso the number of zzso Our methods are applied to simulated data for zzso and comparison to other zzso A human experiment was also designed to stimulate different functional zzso Our methods separated zzso response signals into clusters that tended to be classified according to tissue zzso
