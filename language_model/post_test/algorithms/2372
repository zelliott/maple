The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of equations developed by the American College of Sports Medicine and by Latin et zzso zzso zzso Sports zzso zzso 1993) for zzso the oxygen cost of cycle zzso in obese zzso zzso zzso subjects, aged zzso zzso performed a zzso zzso 50, and 100 zzso zzso cycle zzso test while their oxygen zzso was zzso zzso indicated that the zzso equation significantly zzso zzso zzso underestimated oxygen consumption at all three zzso The Latin zzso by contrast, correctly predicted oxygen consumption at the 50- and zzso zzso although not at 0 zzso The mean bias for all three zzso was zzso zzso for the zzso equation and zzso zzso for the Latin zzso These data suggest that the Latin equation is more accurate than the zzso formula for zzso oxygen consumption of loaded cycling in obese zzso However, caution must be used when attempting to predict the caloric cost of unloaded zzso
