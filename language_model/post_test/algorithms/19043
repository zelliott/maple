We present a zzso theory to describe phase zzso in zzso of a zzso liquid crystal and a zzso zzso The theory takes into account an zzso ordering of liquid zzso and a zzso ordering of zzso zzso We calculate phase zzso on the zzso plane, depending on interactions between a liquid crystal and a zzso surface and a zzso between zzso and zzso zzso We find various phase separation zzso such as a zzso phase separation and zzso triple zzso Inside zzso curves, we find new unstable and zzso regions which are important in phase ordering zzso We also find a stable zzso zzso phase, where zzso particles dispersed in a zzso phase can form a zzso zzso The coexistence between two NC zzso with different zzso can be appear though the zzso between zzso and zzso zzso
