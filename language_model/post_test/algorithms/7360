In the United States of America, zzso million individuals are using elliptical motion trainers in fitness zzso However, graded exercise test protocols to estimate peak oxygen consumption zzso using elliptical motion trainers have not been developed for the general zzso 

zzso subjects zzso age: zzso zzso zzso zzso were randomly divided into a validation zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Peak oxygen consumption zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured via indirect zzso on an elliptical motion trainer for both zzso zzso exercised at 150 strides zzso zzso against a resistance of four and a zzso of zzso The resistance was increased every two minutes by two units until zzso For the zzso group, a zzso zzso analysis was used to predict zzso from resistance, zzso heart rate zzso body mass index zzso height and gender zzso zzso 0, male zzso zzso 

The prediction equation derived from this study was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso - zzso zzso - zzso zzso - zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso p zzso zzso Using this zzso the predicted zzso of the zzso group was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while the measured zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No significant difference was found between the measured and predicted zzso in the zzso zzso zzso it appears this protocol and equation will allow individuals to accurately estimate their zzso without using direct zzso However future studies should investigate the zzso of this protocol with diverse zzso
