Historically, early management of the blunt trauma victim with zzso instability and cervical spinal zzso injury has been hampered by the zzso inability to perform an accurate physical zzso zzso and time-consuming diagnostic tests are often run to check for the presence of zzso zzso zzso For this reason, we decided to study these patients by reviewing a clinical registry to assess the frequency of zzso injuries in cases of cervical spinal zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso injury would occur infrequently in cases of blunt trauma to the cervical spinal zzso In fact, data from the Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services Systems revealed that blunt trauma victims with cervical zzso injury rarely zzso sustained zzso zzso Further analysis of this population revealed that specific mechanisms of trauma and the presence of zzso instability and other major injuries were factors strongly associated with zzso zzso zzso In light of these findings, we have outlined a protocol for management of these patients that is geared toward more rapid stabilization of the injured spinal zzso
