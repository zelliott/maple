We present results for the comparison of six zzso zzso The methods we consider are based on zzso zzso system zzso constrained zzso the use of cubic zzso basis functions, maximum zzso and a genetic zzso We compare the performance of these techniques by applying them to simulated noisy data, in order to extract an input function when the unit impulse response is zzso The simulated data are generated by zzso the known impulse response with each of five different input functions, and then adding noise of constant zzso of zzso Each zzso was tested on 500 data sets, and we define error measures in order to compare the performance of the different zzso
