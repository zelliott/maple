zzso is widely used as a spice throughout the world for the culinary value of its flavor and zzso which are created by the chemical transformation of a series of organic sulfur zzso To analyze the zzso of zzso zzso and discover the genes involved in sulfur zzso zzso derived from the total zzso of zzso zzso buds were analyzed by zzso zzso zzso zzso million zzso zzso clean reads were achieved in two zzso A total of zzso zzso were generated by de zzso assembly and were compared with the sequences in public zzso Of these, zzso zzso had significant hits to the sequences in the zzso database, zzso showed significant similarity to known proteins in the zzso database and, zzso and zzso zzso had significant similarity to existing sequences in the zzso and zzso databases, zzso Moreover, genes involved in organic sulfur zzso were zzso These zzso data will provide the foundation for research on gene zzso zzso and functional zzso in zzso zzso Key message The obtained zzso will provide the foundation for research on functional zzso in zzso zzso and its closely related species, and fill the gap of the existing plant zzso zzso
