The growing population of elderly people living alone increases the need for automatic zzso monitoring systems for elderly zzso Automatic vision zzso systems are increasingly used for human activity recognition zzso in recent zzso This study presents an improved model, tested using actors, of a zzso zzso system to recognize daily life activities of elderly people at home and generate an alert in case of abnormal zzso 

zzso consisting of six abnormal activities zzso backward, falling forward, falling zzso falling zzso chest pain, and zzso and four normal activities zzso rushing, sitting down, and standing up) are generated from different view angles zzso zzso zzso zzso Feature extraction and dimensions reduction are performed by zzso followed by generalized zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso extracts zzso scale, and zzso features from the sequences of zzso zzso increases the discrimination between different classes of highly similar zzso zzso sequences are zzso by the zzso zzso and recognized by hidden conditional random zzso 

Experimental results provide an average recognition rate of zzso for abnormal activities and zzso for normal zzso 

The recognition rate for the highly similar activities from different view angles shows the flexibility and efficacy of the proposed abnormal zzso and alert generation system for elderly zzso
