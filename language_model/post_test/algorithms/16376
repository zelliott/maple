zzso is one of the most commonly used techniques in drug zzso It is used for both identifying correct poses of a zzso in the binding site of a protein as well as for the zzso of the strength of zzso zzso Because millions of compounds must be screened, before a suitable target for biological testing can be identified, all calculations should be done in a reasonable time zzso Thus, all programs currently in use exploit zzso based zzso avoiding systematic search of the zzso zzso Similarly, the scoring is done using simple zzso which makes it possible to speed up the entire zzso zzso zzso results have to be verified by subsequent in zzso zzso The purpose of our work was to evaluate seven popular zzso programs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the extensive zzso composed of zzso zzso complexes from zzso 2007 database, where zzso measured binding affinity values were also zzso We compared independently the ability of proper posing zzso to Root mean square zzso (or Root mean square distance) of predicted zzso versus the corresponding native zzso and scoring (by calculating the correlation between zzso score and zzso binding zzso To our knowledge, it is the first large-scale zzso evaluation that covers both aspects of zzso programs, that is, predicting zzso zzso and calculating the strength of its zzso More than 1000 zzso pairs cover a wide range of different protein families and inhibitor zzso Our results clearly showed that the zzso binding zzso could be identified in most cases by using the existing software, yet we still observed the lack of universal scoring function for all types of molecules and protein zzso
