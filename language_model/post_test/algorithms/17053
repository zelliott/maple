To assess the value of zzso zzso with zzso blood flow imaging in detecting early zzso cancer in women with a family history of the zzso 

Study of self referred zzso women with a close relative who had developed the zzso Each woman was screened to detect persistent zzso and defined changes in zzso zzso zzso score and zzso index were zzso 

zzso screening zzso 

zzso self referred zzso 

Women with a positive screening result were recommended to have further zzso 

zzso at surgery and zzso of abnormal zzso zzso score zzso or zzso 5 and zzso index zzso zzso at last zzso 

Women were aged 17 to 79 zzso zzso years; 959 zzso were zzso 469 zzso were naturally zzso and 173 zzso had had a zzso 157 women had a pedigree suggestive of the site specific zzso cancer syndrome and 288 of multiple site zzso 61 women had a positive screening result zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso six of whom had primary zzso cancer detected at surgery (five stage zzso one stage zzso Use of a high zzso score or a low zzso index increased the odds of finding zzso cancer from zzso to about zzso zzso in the highest risk zzso Five zzso zzso were reported (three zzso and two zzso Eight of the 11 zzso developed in women with zzso suggestive of inherited zzso 

zzso zzso with zzso flow imaging can effectively detect early zzso cancer in women with a family history of the zzso The screening zzso should be less than two zzso
