zzso noise from zzso zzso makes the detection of flaws present in highly scattering materials zzso Several techniques have been applied to improve the zzso ratio zzso in order to make flaw detection zzso Linear filtering does not provide good results because both structure noise and flaw signal concentrate energy in the same frequency zzso zzso filtering can be used to reduce the structure noise of zzso zzso zzso neural networks are applied in this work for this zzso In order to use neural networks for zzso zzso dynamic structures must be zzso The easiest way to implement a neural network with the capability of processing zzso patterns is to consider them spatial ones, applying the signal into a tapped delay line of finite extension, that is the input of a zzso neural network (for example, a zzso zzso In this work, a dynamic neural network has been built to filter zzso signals with structure noise, and has been trained with the real-time zzso algorithm, using as zzso zzso synthetic zzso signals of zzso samples zzso Target signals for training are the same as the ones used as zzso but without zzso The neural network is trained in order to generate as output the target signal when the noisy input one is zzso For testing the performance of the zzso zzso a new set of 500 noisy signals has been zzso The zzso improvement is about 6 zzso zzso The results show that this zzso filtering method is quite useful as zzso stage in flaw detection zzso
