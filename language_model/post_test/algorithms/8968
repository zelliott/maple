We consider a pedestrian tracking system where sensor zzso are placed only at specific points so that the monitoring region is divided into multiple smaller regions referred to as zzso In the proposed pedestrian tracking system, sensor zzso composed of pairs of zzso sensors can detect pedestrian arrival and departure zzso In this paper, we focus on pedestrian tracking in zzso First, we investigate actual pedestrian zzso in a zzso on the basis of observations using video zzso after which we prepare a pedestrian mobility zzso Next, we propose a method for pedestrian tracking in zzso based on the developed pedestrian mobility zzso In the proposed method, we extend the zzso zzso to account for zzso information to estimate the correspondence between pedestrian arrival and departure zzso Through simulations, we show that the tracking success ratio of the proposed method is increased by zzso compared to a zzso zzso tracking zzso
