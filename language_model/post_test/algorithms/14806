A zzso is composed of a zzso an associated recognition zzso and a signal zzso that can selectively detect target substances for zzso DNA based zzso zzso zzso molecules that allow zzso with the target zzso However, most DNA zzso research uses zzso as the target zzso and does not address the potential problems of real zzso The identification of recognition molecules suitable for real target zzso samples is an important step towards further development of DNA zzso This study examines the characteristics of DNA used as zzso and proposes a hybrid zzso DNA sequence generating algorithm, based on DNA zzso to identify suitable DNA zzso recognition molecules for stable zzso with real target zzso The Traveling zzso Problem zzso approach is applied in the proposed zzso to evaluate the safety and fitness of the generated DNA zzso This approach improves efficiency and stability for enhanced and zzso DNA sequence generation and allows extension to generation of zzso DNA sequences with diverse zzso recognition zzso
