Here, we describe partial zzso of a zzso mathematical model of growth hormone zzso zzso From first principles, we derived a model of the effects on zzso zzso from zzso zzso of stimulation by zzso factor zzso or zzso zzso and of zzso by zzso We obtained a concise model by collapsing the many processes of the signal zzso cascade into a single step broadly reflecting the initial binding of zzso to its zzso In the model, zzso zzso is zzso to the rate of binding of zzso to zzso zzso zzso occurs because of reduction of free zzso zzso units, and zzso occurs as those lost are zzso This replacement is zzso up in the presence of zzso which also zzso zzso zzso by reducing the constant of zzso between the rate of zzso zzso and the rate of zzso zzso We derived simple mathematical equations for the rate of zzso zzso and cumulative zzso Using these, we tested the model against data obtained from experiments performed in zzso and made it quantitative using rigorous statistical approaches to zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso model matches experimental observations zzso
