In this paper, we present an optical stimulation based approach to induce zzso zzso zzso in a network of coupled zzso wherein each zzso expresses the light sensitive protein zzso zzso We begin with a transition rate model for the channel zzso of zzso in response to light zzso We then define zzso optical time response curve zzso as a measure of the response of a periodically firing zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso to a periodic light pulse zzso We specifically consider the case of zzso coupled zzso network and propose an open loop control architecture that uses light as an zzso signal to induce zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Using general properties of the spike time response zzso zzso for zzso zzso model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso we estimate the zzso zzso optimal zzso signal parameters required to induce zzso zzso zzso We then propose a closed loop controller architecture and a controller zzso to robustly sustain stable zzso zzso zzso in the presence of unknown zzso in the network zzso Finally, we test the performance of this zzso controller in a network of mutually coupled zzso zzso
