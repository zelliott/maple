This paper considers a general learning problem akin to the field of learning zzso zzso in which the learning mechanism attempts to learn from a zzso teacher or a zzso compulsive zzso More specifically, unlike the traditional LA model in which LA attempts to learn the optimal action offered by the Environment (also here called the zzso this paper considers the problem of the learning mechanism zzso an zzso or in general, an zzso attempting to learn a zzso within a closed zzso The problem is modeled as zzso The learning mechanism is trying to locate an unknown point on a real zzso by interacting with a zzso Environment through a series of informed zzso For each guess, the Environment essentially informs the zzso possibly erroneously zzso with probability zzso which way it should move to reach the unknown zzso When the probability of a correct response is p zzso zzso the Environment is said to be zzso and thus the case of learning from a zzso zzso When this probability p zzso zzso the Environment is deemed zzso and is called a zzso compulsive zzso This paper describes a novel learning strategy by which the unknown zzso can be learned in both zzso These results are the first reported results, which are zzso to the latter zzso The most significant contribution of this paper is that the proposed scheme is shown to operate equally well, even when the learning mechanism is unaware of whether the Environment zzso is zzso or zzso The learning strategy proposed zzso called zzso partitions the search zzso into d zzso evaluates the location of the unknown point with respect to these zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the search space in each iteration by eliminating at least one zzso The zzso zzso is shown to zzso zzso to the unknown point with an arbitrary degree of accuracy with probability as close to unity as zzso Comprehensive experimental results confirm the fast and accurate convergence of the search for a wide range of values for the zzso feedback accuracy zzso zzso and thus has numerous potential zzso
