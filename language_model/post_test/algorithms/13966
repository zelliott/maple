zzso is a program that will simulate the evolution of zzso sequences along a zzso using common models of the substitution zzso A range of models of molecular evolution are zzso including the general zzso zzso zzso zzso and other parameters of the model may be given and zzso rate zzso can also be incorporated in a number of zzso Any number of trees may be read in and the program will produce any number of data sets for each zzso Thus, large sets of replicate simulations can be easily zzso This can be used to test zzso hypotheses using the zzso zzso 

zzso can be obtained by zzso from zzso + or by zzso from zzso The package includes the source code, manual and example zzso An Apple Macintosh version is available from the same zzso
