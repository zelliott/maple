zzso schemes have been recently shown to speed up zzso diffusion in zzso images while increasing the accuracy of subsequent zzso in zzso zzso Here, we show how zzso schemes can be used to implement a truly zzso diffusion method for zzso images, and we test the performance of different zzso in terms of zzso overhead, speed, zzso zzso and zzso mapping zzso In addition, truly zzso zzso diffusion zzso besides a more precise steering of the diffusion zzso also allow zzso by means of local oriented zzso zzso We show how the zzso with the highest zzso accuracy can be also the simplest and fastest while still increasing the zzso zzso
