The zzso zzso distribution and sound zzso distribution in the breast can be used to complement zzso ultrasound imaging in the detection of breast zzso This study investigated an approach for reconstructing the zzso zzso distribution in the breast using a linear zzso The imaging setup was identical to that for conventional zzso breast imaging, and the same setup has been used for reconstruction of sound zzso zzso in previous zzso In this study, we further developed a reconstruction method for the zzso zzso zzso In particular, the proposed method incorporates the zzso information from zzso images and uses the sound zzso distribution to compensate for refraction zzso zzso were conducted with a setup consisting of a zzso zzso linear zzso a zzso digital array system, a zzso and a zzso The constructed phantom contained materials mimicking the following breast zzso zzso zzso fat, zzso zzso tumors, and irregular zzso Application of the proposed technique resulted in all the zzso and tumors (including zzso and irregular zzso being distinguished by zzso the reconstructed zzso zzso We have demonstrated that it is possible to use the same imaging setup to acquire data for zzso image, sound zzso distribution, and zzso zzso distribution zzso Moreover, the experimental data indicate its potential in improving the detection of breast zzso
