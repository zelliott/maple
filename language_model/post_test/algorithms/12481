In social insects, both zzso and communication play a crucial role for the accomplishment of many tasks at a collective zzso Communication is performed with different zzso which can be roughly classified into three zzso indirect zzso communication, direct interactions and direct zzso The use of zzso communication is zzso in social insects zzso the zzso trails in zzso where, however, direct interactions zzso zzso in zzso and direct communication zzso the zzso dance in honey zzso can also be zzso Taking inspiration from insect societies, we present an experimental study of zzso zzso for a group of robots, which exploit communication to coordinate their zzso In particular, the robots are placed in an arena presenting holes and open borders, which they should avoid while moving zzso zzso evolution is responsible for the synthesis in a simulated environment of the zzso neural zzso which are subsequently tested on physical zzso We study different communication strategies among the zzso no direct communication, zzso zzso and a completely evolved zzso We show that the latter is the most efficient, suggesting that artificial evolution can produce zzso that are more zzso than those obtained with conventional design zzso Moreover, we show that the evolved controllers produce a zzso system that is robust enough to be tested on physical robots, notwithstanding the huge gap between simulation and zzso
