Let zzso zzso be gap times corresponding to two consecutive events, which are observed subject to random zzso In this paper, a zzso zzso of the zzso distribution function of zzso zzso and, more generally, of a functional E zzso is zzso We assume that the probability of zzso for zzso given the zzso zzso gap times belongs to a zzso family of zzso zzso zzso We investigate the conditions under which the introduced zzso is zzso We explore the finite sample behavior of the zzso and of its zzso standard error through zzso The main conclusion of this paper is that the zzso zzso may be much more efficient than purely zzso zzso Real data illustration is zzso
