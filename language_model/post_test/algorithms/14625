zzso and averaging of zzso can improve the zzso and resolution of structures obtained by electron zzso Here we present a three-dimensional zzso maximum likelihood zzso is characterized by zzso zzso alignment and zzso into a single, unified processing zzso The novelty of our approach lies in the way we calculate the probability of observing an individual zzso for a given reference zzso We assume that the reference structure is affected by a zzso zzso resulting from the zzso of many individual missing wedges in distinct zzso The distance metric underlying our probability calculations effectively zzso zzso components that are observed less zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso clearly zzso the zzso zzso approach and has advantages over existing approaches in cases where the zzso adopt preferred zzso Application of our approach to zzso zzso data of zzso zzso revealed distinct zzso that are in good agreement with results obtained by previous single particle zzso
