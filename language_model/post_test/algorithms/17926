Using synchronization between observations and a model with zzso parameters is a natural way to complete the zzso of the zzso The quality of the zzso a cost function to be zzso typically is evaluated by a least squares difference between the data time series and the model time zzso If the zzso between the data and the model is too strong, this cost function is small for any data and any model and the variation of the cost function with respect to the parameters of interest is too small to permit selection of an optimal value of the zzso We introduce two methods for balancing the competing desires of a small cost function for the quality of the synchronization and the zzso ability to determine parameters zzso One method of zzso synchronization adds to the synchronization cost function a requirement that the conditional zzso zzso of the model system, zzso on being driven by the data remain negative but small in zzso The other method allows the zzso between the data and the model to vary in time according to the error in zzso This method succeeds because the data and the model exhibit generalized synchronization in the region where the parameters of the model are well zzso Examples are explored which have deterministic chaos with and without noise in the data zzso
