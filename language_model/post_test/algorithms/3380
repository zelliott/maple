zzso beam zzso for the calculation of electron beam dose zzso have come into widespread zzso These zzso however, have generally exhibited difficulties in zzso dose zzso for small field dimensions or, more specifically, for those conditions in which lateral scatter equilibrium does not zzso The work described here has determined that this difficulty can arise from the manner in which the zzso of the pencil beam is zzso A unique approach for determining the pencil beam zzso required to accurately reproduce small field dose zzso in a homogeneous phantom is described and compared with zzso and the results of other zzso This method has also been extended to calculate electron beam dose zzso in zzso media and the results of this work are zzso Suggestions for further improvements are zzso
