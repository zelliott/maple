zzso zzso registration is a prerequisite for effective exploitation of passive zzso zzso In this paper, the zzso bound is employed to determine the limits of registration precision in the presence of scene polarization diversity, channel noise, and random zzso registration errors between zzso The effects of zzso on zzso image zzso are also explored in zzso The derived bound is then used to determine when joint zzso is preferable to zzso provided registration zzso Finally, case studies are presented for polarization insensitive imagery (a special zzso and linear polarization imaging systems with three and four zzso An optimum polarization channel arrangement is also proposed in the context of the zzso
