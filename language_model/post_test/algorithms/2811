zzso resonance zzso imaging is promising for monitoring and guiding zzso zzso The goal of this work is to investigate the stability of an zzso for online MR zzso image guided steering and focusing of heat into the target zzso The control platform comprised a zzso zzso phased array zzso zzso operating at 140 zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and a GE zzso Excite zzso T MR system, both of which were driven by a control zzso MR zzso resonance frequency shift images acquired during heating were used to zzso update a model of the heated object, starting with an initial finite element zzso model zzso At each zzso step, the current model was used to zzso a focusing zzso which was then used to drive the next zzso until zzso zzso of the driving zzso was used to prevent the process from zzso away from the desired zzso Experimental validation of the performance of the automatic treatment platform was conducted with two zzso phantom studies, one homogeneous and one muscle equivalent with tumor tissue zzso 50% zzso zzso with initial focal spots being intentionally rotated 90 degrees and 50 degrees away from the desired focus, mimicking initial setup errors in zzso zzso The integrated zzso treatment platform steered the focus of heating into the desired target volume in two quite different phantom tissue loads which model expected patient treatment zzso For the homogeneous phantom test where the target was intentionally offset by 90 degrees rotation of the zzso convergence to the proper phase focus in the target occurred after 16 zzso of the zzso For the more realistic test with a muscle equivalent phantom with tumor inserted with 50 degrees zzso zzso only two zzso were necessary to steer the focus into the tumor zzso zzso improved the heating efficacy (the ratio of integral temperature in the tumor to integral temperature in normal zzso by up to zzso compared to the first zzso The integrated zzso treatment zzso successfully steered the focus of heating into the desired target volume for both the simple homogeneous and the more challenging muscle equivalent phantom with tumor insert models of human zzso zzso after 16 and 2 zzso zzso The zzso method for MR zzso image guided focal steering shows promise when tested in phantom experiments on a zzso phased array zzso
