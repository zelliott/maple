zzso quantitative cell traits zzso to underlying molecular defects is a central challenge in cancer research because zzso at all biological zzso from genes to cells to zzso is recognized as the main driver of cancer progression and treatment zzso A major roadblock to a zzso framework linking cell to signaling to genetic cancer zzso is the dearth of zzso zzso data on zzso as zzso death sensitivity, zzso zzso and other hallmarks of zzso zzso zzso data can be used to represent zzso genetic and zzso zzso zzso in cancer cell populations as averages, zzso and statistical zzso By matching the abundance of available data on cancer genetic and molecular zzso zzso data should enable quantitative mapping of zzso to zzso in zzso This challenge is being met by zzso automated zzso zzso based on the convergence of several technologies including computerized zzso image processing, computation, and zzso zzso In this chapter, we describe an zzso zzso that can be set up in a medium size interdisciplinary laboratory, and its application to produce zzso zzso data for cancer cell zzso and zzso This type of data is zzso suited to populate zzso zzso and mathematical models of cancer progression for zzso and zzso evaluating cancer drug discovery and zzso
