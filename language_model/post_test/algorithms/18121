zzso zzso significant movement of zzso in the vicinity of zzso and abdominal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso aims to adapt radiation delivery to zzso motion during zzso One of the main problems for achieving this objective is the presence of time lag between the acquisition of zzso position and the radiation zzso Such time lag causes significant beam positioning errors and affects the dose zzso A method to solve this problem is to employ an zzso that is able to predict future zzso positions from available zzso position zzso This paper presents a multiple model approach to zzso zzso motion prediction using the interacting multiple model zzso zzso A combination of two models, constant zzso zzso and constant acceleration zzso is used to capture zzso zzso zzso A Kalman filter is designed for each of the local models and the zzso filter is applied to combine the predictions of these Kalman filters for obtaining the predicted zzso zzso The zzso zzso likewise the Kalman zzso is a zzso zzso that is suitable for real-time zzso In addition, this paper proposes a confidence zzso zzso criterion to evaluate the performance of zzso motion prediction zzso for zzso The proposed zzso criterion provides a relevant measure for the prediction performance in terms of clinical applications and can be used to specify the margin to accommodate prediction zzso The prediction performance of the zzso filter has been evaluated using 110 traces of zzso zzso motion collected from 24 zzso zzso The simulation study was carried out for prediction time zzso s with sampling rates 3, 5 and 10 zzso It was found that the prediction of the zzso filter was consistently better than the prediction of the Kalman filter with the zzso or CA zzso There was no significant difference of prediction errors for the sampling rates 5 and 10 zzso For these sampling rates, the errors of the zzso filter for zzso s prediction time were less than zzso zzso in terms of the zzso zzso criterion or zzso zzso in terms of the standard zzso zzso or root mean squared errors zzso zzso For the prediction time of zzso s the errors were less than zzso zzso in terms of the zzso zzso criterion or zzso zzso in terms of the zzso zzso The prediction error analysis showed that the average percentage of the target lies outside the zzso zzso margin was zzso and outside the zzso margin was zzso This indicates the effectiveness of the zzso zzso criterion as a zzso strategy to accommodate prediction zzso
