zzso organization of cell surface proteins plays a key role in the process of zzso zzso zzso zzso and changes in their cell surface distribution are often determining factors in the final outcome of zzso zzso There are several techniques for assessing the distribution of protein zzso Fluorescence resonance energy transfer zzso is an excellent tool for determining distance relationships of cell surface zzso However, it does not provide information on the distribution of molecular zzso Different kinds of zzso fill this zzso The evaluation of the images provided by the listed techniques is often zzso zzso we show the zzso of Ripley's zzso function as a tool for analyzing the cell surface zzso patterns zzso Nakamura, et zzso Nature 1994, zzso zzso We have implemented an effective image processing zzso for fast zzso of gold labels on biological zzso We investigated spatial organization of zzso alpha and zzso alpha zzso alpha and zzso zzso on a human zzso zzso line, zzso zzso by using transmission electron zzso zzso zzso analysis showed zzso of the two types of zzso even on the zzso zzso The analysis of our data may contribute to our understanding the action of the zzso zzso system in zzso zzso
