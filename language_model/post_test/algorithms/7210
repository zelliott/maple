A modulated acoustic radiation force, produced by two zzso zzso ultrasound beams of slightly different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso where zzso is the difference zzso can be used to remotely generate modulated zzso zzso zzso 500 zzso zzso waves in attenuating zzso By appropriately selecting the duration of the two beams, the energy of the generated zzso waves can be concentrated around the difference frequency zzso zzso zzso zzso In this manner, neither their zzso nor their phase information is distorted by zzso effects, zzso enabling a more accurate reconstruction of the zzso zzso Assuming a zzso zzso model, this paper describes the use of a zzso model to simulate three-dimensional zzso zzso propagation in zzso media containing a zzso zzso zzso propagation is assumed for the two ultrasound beams, so that higher zzso are developed in the force and zzso zzso Finally, an inverse reconstruction zzso is used to extract 3-D maps of the local zzso zzso and zzso from the simulated zzso fields based on the fundamental and zzso zzso The quality of the reconstructed maps is evaluated using the contrast between the inclusion and the background and the zzso ratio zzso It is shown that the zzso zzso can be accurately reconstructed based on the fundamental zzso such that the observed contrast deviates from the true contrast by a zzso zzso of only zzso and the zzso is greater than 30 zzso If the zzso component is used, the zzso becomes zzso and the corresponding zzso decreases by approximately zzso zzso The reconstructed zzso zzso maps based on the second harmonic are shown to be of higher quality than those based on the zzso The effects of noise are also investigated and a fusion operation between the two spectral components is applied to enhance the reconstruction zzso Finally, a modified zzso zzso technique, shown to be more robust to noise, is described for the zzso of the zzso properties inside and outside the zzso inclusion under conditions of increased zzso
