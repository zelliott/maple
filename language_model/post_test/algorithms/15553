A three-dimensional zzso reconstruction zzso based on contours identification from zzso zzso is zzso It requires, as technical zzso a method to zzso the zzso zzso environment and a surface generic object zzso zzso zzso representing the structure to be zzso The reconstruction steps consist of: the definition of anatomical regions, the identification of zzso contours associated to these regions, the calculation of zzso contours and projection onto the zzso the associations between points of the zzso contours and points of the projected zzso zzso the zzso of the initial solution and the zzso object deformation to minimize the distance between zzso contours and projected zzso zzso The evaluation was performed on 8 zzso zzso comparing the zzso models obtained to zzso zzso Mean error for each zzso zzso was 1 zzso
