zzso zzso of surface zzso are useful in the mapping and zzso of the cerebral cortex, the outer layer of the human zzso We propose two new methods to zzso approximations of the optimal zzso and apply these methods to human cortical surface zzso extracted from magnetic resonance zzso Our methods approximate the zzso in a zzso zzso spanned by the coordinate zzso of an initial zzso and the zzso zzso of a mesh zzso This zzso approximation reduces the zzso complexity while minimizing the zzso
