In this study, a new zzso zzso method named zzso has been developed to build zzso loop zzso In this method, a loop zzso zzso is generated by sampling zzso zzso angles from a restrained zzso set, and the zzso zzso are built zzso The zzso zzso force field was used to evaluate the loop zzso Soft core zzso were used to treat the zzso zzso and a designed zzso technique was used to close and zzso the loop zzso It is shown that the two strategies improve the zzso efficiency and the zzso rate substantially compared to normal zzso zzso zzso was used to construct the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso test zzso The average zzso zzso zzso obtained in 1,000 trials for the 10 different zzso of each size are zzso zzso and zzso A, zzso zzso can build zzso loop zzso with a sampling accuracy comparable with previous loop zzso construction zzso zzso see zzso
