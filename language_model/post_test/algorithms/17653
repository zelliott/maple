Cellular networks are subject to extensive regulation, which zzso the availability and efficiency of connections between components in response to external zzso Thus far, studies of large-scale networks have focused on their zzso but have not considered how the zzso of this connectivity might also determine network zzso To address this issue, we analyzed how the coordinated expression of zzso shapes the zzso network of zzso zzso By zzso large-scale expression data with the structural description of the zzso network, we systematically characterized the zzso regulation of zzso zzso The analysis revealed zzso patterns, which may represent design principles of zzso gene zzso First, we find that zzso regulation biases zzso flow toward zzso by zzso only distinct branches at zzso zzso Second, individual zzso were often separately zzso with distinct zzso providing a means of reducing zzso between pathways using a common zzso Finally, zzso regulation defined a zzso organization of zzso pathways into groups of varying expression zzso These results emphasize the utility of incorporating regulatory information when analyzing properties of large-scale cellular zzso
