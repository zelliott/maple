Some failure time data come from a population that consists of some subjects who are susceptible to and others who are zzso to the event of zzso The data typically have heavy zzso at the end of the follow-up period, and a standard survival analysis would not always be zzso In such situations where there is good scientific or empirical evidence of a zzso population, the mixture or cure model can be used zzso 1982, zzso 38, zzso It assumes a zzso distribution to model the zzso probability and a zzso failure time distribution to model the zzso zzso and Chen zzso zzso 79, zzso extended the model by using Cox's zzso hazards zzso for the zzso We develop maximum likelihood techniques for the joint zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso parameters in this model using the zzso form of the likelihood and an zzso zzso A zzso constraint is used to reduce the near zzso of the zzso The inverse of the observed information zzso is used to zzso the standard zzso A simulation study shows that the methods are competitive to the zzso methods under ideal conditions and are generally better when zzso from loss to follow-up is zzso The methods are applied to a data set of zzso cancer patients treated with radiation zzso
