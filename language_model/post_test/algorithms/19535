Counting zzso and temporally overlapping events in image sequences and zzso their zzso and duration features are important issues in some zzso We propose a zzso model, a particular case of the zzso zzso zzso model, for performing this analysis: the zzso zzso zzso Some zzso properties are derived and a methodology for zzso zzso from zzso image sequences is proposed using an explicit treatment of the zzso zzso We estimate the mean number of germs per unit area and time, the mean grain size and the duration zzso A wide simulation study in order to assess the proposed zzso showed promising zzso The model was applied on biological image sequences of zzso cells in order to estimate new parameters such as the mean number and duration distribution of zzso zzso Our results show that the proposed zzso zzso model is effective for obtaining information about dynamic processes which exhibit short-lived, but zzso and temporally overlapping zzso
