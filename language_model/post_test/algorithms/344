Many important problems in cell biology require the consideration of dense zzso interactions between functional zzso The requirement of computer simulation for the understanding of cellular processes is now widely accepted, and a variety of zzso zzso have been designed to meet this zzso Here, we present a novel public release of the Gene zzso Network simulation suite zzso a software designed for the qualitative zzso and analysis of regulatory zzso The main zzso of zzso are illustrated through the analysis of a logical model for the core network controlling the zzso zzso cell zzso The last public release of zzso zzso zzso as well as development versions, can be downloaded from the dedicated zzso zzso which further includes a model library, along with detailed tutorial and user zzso
