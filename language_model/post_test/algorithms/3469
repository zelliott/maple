The commonly used solid-state reaction models (for zzso zzso describe the zzso transformation data only over a certain range, alpha from zzso to zzso zzso based on a fit to a fraction of the data are inadequate because we ignore the early induction phase of the reaction, which is important for zzso zzso A zzso zzso equation describes the data over the entire curve for zzso transformation at high zzso We use the parameters of the zzso equation to predict the transformation zzso The predicted zzso agree with the experimental zzso
