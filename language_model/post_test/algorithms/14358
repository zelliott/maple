zzso aspiration biopsy zzso is zzso in up to zzso of patients with solitary zzso zzso In these cases, zzso is necessary, but only zzso of the zzso prove to be zzso zzso The aim of this study was to explore the potential of zzso PET to reduce the number of unnecessary zzso in the zzso assessment of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso consecutive patients, scheduled for zzso because of zzso zzso findings, participated in this prospective zzso zzso PET of the zzso region was performed before zzso and standardized zzso values were zzso The final zzso diagnosis served as a standard of zzso 

zzso examination of the surgical specimens revealed 7 zzso zzso zzso in 6 patients, all accumulating zzso zzso zzso value, zzso zzso accumulated in 13 of 38 benign zzso The zzso probability for cancer in this study population was zzso zzso and the zzso probability increased to zzso zzso The percentage of unnecessary zzso in a hypothetical zzso using zzso PET was only zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso without zzso zzso zzso PET reduced the number of futile zzso by zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso exact test, P zzso zzso zzso analysis using standardized zzso values did not help to further reduce this zzso 

In addition to data in the literature demonstrating accurate detection of zzso cancer by zzso zzso this study showed that zzso PET should play an important role in the management of patients with zzso zzso diagnosis of a zzso zzso zzso PET reduced the number of futile zzso by zzso Although PET is a relatively costly zzso this cost outweighs the costs and risks associated with unnecessary zzso zzso
