Conventional methods for cardiovascular disease risk zzso are based on zzso of recognized risk factors or assessment of zzso during the wake zzso We evaluated an zzso on the basis of a zzso pulse wave recording during sleep for cardiovascular risk zzso 

Five hundred and zzso individuals zzso men, age zzso zzso zzso years, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with suspected sleep zzso were randomly recruited at five sleep zzso Individual cardiovascular risk scores were calculated in accordance with established cardiovascular risk zzso zzso Framingham, zzso zzso zzso A digital zzso pulse wave signal was continuously recorded during the night using an zzso zzso An zzso based on eight separate hypoxic and pulse wave derived parameters was trained in 130 individuals and validated in 390 individuals for zzso cardiovascular risk zzso 

All derived parameters were associated with elevated zzso risk in zzso analysis and five in the multiple zzso zzso model zzso index C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 69, P zzso zzso The combined zzso detected high-risk patients zzso set, zzso risk classes 4 and 5) with a sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value and negative zzso value of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso associations were also found for the Framingham, SCORE and zzso zzso The zzso risk scores in individuals zzso zzso zzso zzso a previous history of cardiovascular event zzso zzso zzso zzso attack or zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso derived from modified pulse zzso during sleep may provide information on cardiovascular zzso Combined signal analysis may be used for recognition of individuals with established cardiovascular risk in a sleep laboratory zzso
