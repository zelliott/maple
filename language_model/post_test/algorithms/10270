The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using a single zzso device for comprehensive, efficient daily zzso of a linear accelerator zzso and three zzso zzso positioning systems zzso The Sun Nuclear Daily zzso 3 zzso device was used to perform daily zzso and mechanical accuracy tests for an zzso zzso as well as daily image geometric and zzso coincidence accuracy tests for three zzso the zzso surface imaging system; the zzso zzso optical tracking System zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso can also be used for couch zzso zzso and zzso tests during the monthly zzso Based on phantom imaging, the zzso coordinate system determined using zzso was within zzso zzso of that of the zzso zzso The difference is attributable to the different zzso methods that are zzso for these two zzso The laser alignment was within zzso zzso of the zzso location determined with the three zzso The zzso constancy was zzso zzso zzso For zzso and table angles of zzso the mean zzso displacement zzso determined using the three systems were within zzso zzso and zzso of one zzso zzso zzso zzso measured with the systems were all zzso zzso For zzso and electron beams tested over a period of eight months, the output was verified to remain within zzso energy variations were within zzso and the symmetry and zzso were within zzso The field size and zzso coincidence were within zzso zzso 1 zzso For zzso zzso the standard zzso was within zzso for all tests and all zzso except for zzso energy variation which was zzso The total measurement time for all tasks took less than 15 minutes per zzso session compared to 40 minutes with our previous zzso which zzso an individual zzso device for each zzso The zzso can be used for accurate and efficient zzso and zzso daily zzso It shortens zzso device setup time, eliminates errors introduced by changing zzso to perform different tests, and zzso the task of performing zzso zzso
