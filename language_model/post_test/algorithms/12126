Many applications of synthetic biology require the balanced expression of multiple zzso Although zzso facilitate coordinated expression of multiple genes in zzso and zzso zzso the many zzso processes that determine the relative levels of gene expression in zzso by a zzso design remains a zzso We describe a method for tuning the expression of multiple genes within zzso by generating libraries of zzso zzso regions zzso zzso various zzso control elements and screening for the desired relative expression zzso zzso can vary the relative expression of two reporter genes over a zzso range and balance expression of three genes in an zzso that encodes a zzso zzso zzso pathway, resulting in a zzso increase in zzso zzso This technology should be useful for zzso the expression of multiple genes in synthetic zzso both in zzso and zzso
