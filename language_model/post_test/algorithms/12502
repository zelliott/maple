zzso chemistry has become an invaluable tool in medicinal chemistry for the identification of new drug zzso For example, libraries of predetermined sequences and zzso zzso peptides are routinely zzso in our laboratory using the zzso zzso Such libraries are used as molecular zzso that enable the development of zzso that define activity and specificity at zzso zzso These libraries can be quite large and difficult to handle, due to physical and chemical constraints imposed by their zzso zzso smaller zzso are often targeted for zzso The number of zzso reactions required can be greatly reduced if the peptides having common zzso acids are grouped into the same zzso zzso This paper describes a schedule zzso to minimize the number of zzso reactions by rotating and aligning sequences while simultaneously zzso The zzso descent method thereby reduces the number of zzso reactions required for zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that the zzso results in a zzso reduction in the number of zzso reactions for a typical zzso zzso zzso
