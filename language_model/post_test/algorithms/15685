To assess the MR imaging zzso findings in symptomatic tamoxifen zzso with abnormal zzso zzso 

From zzso 1997 to zzso 2000, 32 consecutive symptomatic tamoxifen zzso with abnormal zzso zzso were zzso studied by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and dynamic zzso zzso sequences were zzso All patients underwent zzso sampling within one month of zzso 

zzso thickness at zzso ranged from 5 to 48 zzso zzso thickness 19 zzso and on zzso imaging ranged from 3 to 50 zzso zzso zzso Three zzso patterns were zzso zzso 1 (13 zzso was defined as homogeneous high signal intensity of the zzso on zzso images, and signal void in the zzso on zzso zzso zzso 2 (8 zzso was defined as zzso zzso signal on zzso images, and zzso enhancement zzso the zzso canal on zzso zzso zzso 3 (11 zzso was defined as zzso signal on zzso images with masses or zzso which were better seen on dynamic zzso zzso In pattern 1 we found 13 zzso zzso in addition there were 4 zzso zzso proliferation zzso and 1 zzso In pattern 2 we found 3 zzso 4 zzso and 1 zzso without zzso The 2 zzso and the zzso with zzso were found in pattern 3 (11 zzso 

In our experience zzso allows differentiation of zzso which may require surgery from other zzso in which zzso follow-up is zzso
