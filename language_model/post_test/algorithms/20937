Growth competition zzso have been developed to zzso the relative fitness of zzso zzso In this article, we develop mathematical models to describe zzso dynamic interactions in the zzso system from which the competitive fitness zzso or parameters are zzso In our previous zzso fitness experiments, the concentration of zzso target cells was assumed to be constant zzso et zzso zzso But this may not be true in some zzso In addition, dual infection may frequently occur in viral fitness experiments and may not be zzso Here, we relax these two assumptions and extend our earlier viral fitness model zzso et zzso zzso The resulting models then become zzso zzso systems for which zzso solutions are not zzso In the new model, the viral relative fitness is a function of time since it depends on the target cell zzso First, we studied the structure zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso analysis showed that all parameters in the proposed models are identifiable from the zzso experimental data that we zzso We then employed a global zzso approach (the differential evolution zzso to directly estimate the kinetic parameters as well as the relative fitness index in the zzso zzso models using zzso least square zzso based on the experimental zzso zzso zzso was investigated via zzso Carlo zzso
