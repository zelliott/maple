We have developed a new method for zzso zzso reconstructions with missing data obtained by electron zzso zzso The method is based on principal component analysis zzso combined with expectation zzso The missing data, together with the principal zzso are treated as hidden variables that are estimated by maximizing a likelihood zzso zzso in zzso is similar to zzso for zzso image zzso A lower zzso zzso of significant features is selected, into which the data are projected, and if zzso subsequently zzso In addition, our new zzso estimates the missing data for each individual volume within the lower zzso zzso Application to both a large model data set and zzso zzso experimental data demonstrates the good performance of the zzso and illustrates its potential for studying zzso zzso with continuous zzso zzso
