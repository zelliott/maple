To describe and evaluate the performance of an zzso that automatically zzso images with zzso features commonly found in diabetic zzso zzso and age-related zzso zzso zzso 

zzso digital photographs (N zzso zzso of three fields of view zzso were obtained of the eyes of zzso patients at two zzso The zzso Institute of South Texas zzso San Antonio, zzso and The University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio zzso Ground truth was provided for the presence of zzso conditions, including zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso disc and elsewhere, zzso abnormal zzso and geographic zzso The zzso was used to report on the presence or absence of zzso A detection threshold was applied to obtain different values of sensitivity and specificity with respect to ground truth and to construct a receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso 

The system achieved an average area under the zzso curve zzso of zzso for detection of DR and of zzso for detection of zzso DR zzso With a fixed specificity of zzso the system's sensitivity ranged from zzso for all DR cases to zzso for clinically significant zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso was trained to detect different types of zzso retinal zzso The cases of hard zzso within 1 disc diameter zzso of the zzso zzso for zzso were detected with very high accuracy zzso zzso 1, specificity zzso zzso whereas mild zzso DR was the most challenging condition zzso zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso The zzso was also tested on images with signs of zzso achieving a performance of zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso
