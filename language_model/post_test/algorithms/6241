This work studies retinal image registration in the context of the National Institutes of Health zzso Early Treatment zzso zzso Study zzso zzso The zzso imaging protocol specifies seven fields of each zzso and presents three major challenges for the image registration zzso First, small zzso between adjacent fields lead to inadequate landmark points for zzso zzso Second, the zzso zzso zzso due to imperfect data acquisition will deteriorate the performance of zzso zzso Third, high-resolution images contain large homogeneous zzso regions that weaken the capabilities of both zzso and zzso zzso In this work, we propose a hybrid retinal image registration approach for zzso images that effectively combines both zzso and zzso zzso Four major steps are zzso First, the vascular tree is extracted by using an efficient local zzso zzso zzso Next, zzso translation is estimated by maximizing mutual information based on the zzso image pair zzso Then image quality assessment regarding the zzso field definition is performed based on the translation zzso If the image pair is accepted, zzso transformations will be zzso Specifically, we use two types of features, landmark points and sampling points, for zzso model zzso Three empirical conditions are derived zzso to control the zzso progress, so that we can achieve the lowest registration error and the highest success zzso zzso results on 504 pairs of zzso images show the effectiveness and zzso of the proposed zzso
