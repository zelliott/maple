In this paper, a fiber zzso based sensor capable of fault detection in both zzso and network overhead transmission power line systems is zzso Bragg wavelength shift is used to measure the fault current and detect fault in power zzso zzso fields generated by currents in the overhead transmission lines cause a strain in zzso material which is then detected by zzso Bragg zzso zzso The zzso Bragg interrogator senses the reflected zzso signals, and the Bragg wavelength shift is calculated and the signals are zzso A broadband light source in the control room scans the shift in the reflected zzso Any surge in the magnetic field relates to an increased fault current at a certain zzso Also, fault location can be precisely defined with an artificial neural network zzso zzso This zzso can be easily coordinated with other protective zzso It is shown that the faults in the overhead transmission line cause a zzso wavelength shift on the reflected signal of zzso and can be used to detect and zzso different kind of zzso The proposed method has been extensively tested by simulation and results confirm that the proposed scheme is able to detect different kinds of fault in both zzso and network zzso
