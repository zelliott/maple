zzso zzso produces zzso and zzso zzso zzso in male zzso rats following 2 years of oral zzso Female zzso and zzso rats are comparatively resistant to these zzso zzso and zzso have been associated with a minor zzso zzso zzso following the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso The majority of administered doses zzso consists of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso An initial zzso based zzso model was developed to characterize the role of zzso in the strain differences observed in zzso zzso toxicity and zzso Partition zzso zzso and zzso rate zzso were determined directly or estimated from a series of in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso was confined to the liver and zzso zzso The total flux through the zzso zzso represented the zzso zzso of zzso for zzso zzso were compared to a variety of data from male and female zzso rats, male zzso rats, and a single male human zzso zzso of zzso administration resulted in higher amounts of zzso zzso than comparable oral zzso This was consistent with zzso and toxicity studies and emphasized the importance of zzso zzso tract zzso In addition, male zzso rats were predicted to form more total zzso zzso than zzso rats at equivalent dose levels, which was also consistent with the observed strain differences in zzso zzso This model represents the first stage in the development of a biologically based zzso model for improving the scientific basis for human health risk assessments of zzso
