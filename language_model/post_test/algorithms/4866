We develop and compare two zzso of the zzso method, zzso and zzso to simulate the zzso zzso response of zzso contained in various models of porous zzso The zzso approach uses a zzso grain pack as zzso where the solid surface is zzso defined without an zzso In the zzso approach, the input is a zzso or computer-generated image of reconstructed porous zzso Implementation of the two approaches is largely the same, except for the representation of porous zzso For comparison, both approaches are applied to various zzso and digitized models of porous zzso isolated zzso zzso simple cubic packing of zzso and random zzso of zzso and zzso zzso We find that spin zzso zzso much faster in the digitized models than in their zzso zzso The difference in zzso rate relates to the zzso of surface area due to the zzso of the zzso it cannot be eliminated even if the zzso size zzso However, once considering the effect of zzso increase in the simulation of surface relaxation, good quantitative agreement is found between the two zzso Different grain or pore shapes entail different rates of increase of surface area, zzso we emphasize that the value of the zzso zzso may not be zzso Using an example of zzso image of zzso rock sample, we show that zzso size has a significant effect on the calculated surface area and, therefore, on the zzso simulated zzso zzso
