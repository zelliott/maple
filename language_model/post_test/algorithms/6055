In this work we analyzed zzso maps obtained from zzso which were treated with 14 zzso A similarity index was introduced as a robust measure of similarity between two maps or between two selections of spots within the zzso A searching zzso was used to identify the spots that may play an important role in toxicity zzso The highest correlation zzso obtained between the similarity index and biological zzso were larger than zzso
