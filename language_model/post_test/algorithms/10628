zzso boundary prediction is an important step in both experimental and zzso protein structure zzso We have developed two fully automated domain parsing zzso the first, zzso which we have described zzso zzso information from zzso sequences and structures, while the second, zzso which has not been described zzso uses only information in the query zzso zzso zzso assigns zzso by zzso to structures and sequence families using successively less confident zzso zzso uses the zzso de zzso structure prediction method to build three-dimensional models, and then applies Taylor's structure based domain assignment method to parse the models into zzso zzso boundaries observed repeatedly in the models are predicted to be domain boundaries for the zzso Interestingly, zzso produced quite good domain predictions for proteins of a size typically considered to be beyond the reach of de zzso structure prediction zzso For remote fold recognition targets and new zzso both zzso and zzso produced promising results, and in some cases where one method failed to detect the correct domain boundary, it was correctly identified by the other zzso We describe here the successes and failures using both methods, and address the possibility of incorporating both protocols into an improved hybrid zzso
