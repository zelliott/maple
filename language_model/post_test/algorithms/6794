The suitability of zzso sheets as passive samplers of zzso zzso in water bodies was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sheets were contaminated with zzso zzso and zzso sheets were deployed simultaneously and collected at intervals over 32 zzso The exposed sheets and water samples were analyzed for zzso The initial zzso zzso in the contaminated and zzso sheets differed by two to three orders of zzso but approached a common equilibrium concentration during zzso The two- to zzso zzso achieved zzso within the zzso exposure period, whereas the five- and zzso zzso did zzso The estimated zzso partition zzso were approximately three times higher for zzso than for zzso and they were similar in magnitude to the zzso values (the partition zzso between zzso and zzso The zzso rate zzso were approximately four times higher for zzso than zzso which was attributed to the four times higher specific surface zzso The zzso and elimination in zzso followed linear zzso zzso whereas for zzso very slow elimination rates were observed that could not be zzso The results show that zzso is a simple, effective, and inexpensive material for sampling trace organic zzso in zzso
