The basic models of infectious disease dynamics (the zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso attention is paid to the number of infected individuals that recovered and its relationship with the final epidemic zzso We investigate this zzso both until the extinction of the epidemic and in transient zzso zzso and efficient methods to obtain the distribution of the number of recovered individuals and its moments are proposed and discussed with respect to the previous zzso The methodology could also be extended to other zzso epidemic zzso The theory is illustrated by zzso experiments, which demonstrate that the proposed zzso methods can be applied zzso In particular, we use the distribution of the number of individuals removed in the zzso model in conjunction with data of outbreaks of zzso observed in the intensive care unit of a Spanish zzso
