We present an approximate conditional and joint association analysis that can use zzso statistics from a zzso of zzso association studies zzso and estimated linkage zzso zzso from a reference sample with zzso zzso zzso Using this method, we analyzed zzso summary data from the GIANT zzso for height and body mass index zzso with the zzso structure estimated from zzso data in two independent zzso We identified 36 zzso with multiple associated zzso for height zzso leading and 49 additional zzso 87 in total) via a zzso zzso selection zzso The 49 new zzso explain approximately zzso of zzso nearly doubling the zzso explained at the 36 zzso We did not find any locus showing multiple associated zzso for zzso The method we present is zzso fast and is also zzso to zzso data, which we demonstrate in an example from zzso of type 2 diabetes by the zzso zzso
