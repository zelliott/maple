Very frequently the same biological system is described by zzso sometimes competing mathematical zzso This usually creates confusion around their zzso zzso which one is zzso However, this is unnecessary since zzso of a model cannot be zzso model validation is actually a zzso In principle the only statement that one can make about a system model is that it is zzso zzso zzso a fact which can be established given appropriate experimental zzso zzso models of high dimension and with many parameters are impossible to invalidate through simulation and as such the zzso process is often overlooked or zzso 

We develop different approaches for showing how competing ordinary differential equation zzso based models of the same biological phenomenon containing zzso and zzso uncertainty can be zzso using experimental zzso We first emphasize the strong interplay between system identification and model zzso and we describe a method for obtaining a lower bound on the error between candidate model predictions and zzso We then turn to model zzso and formulate a methodology for zzso and zzso model zzso The methodology is zzso and uses zzso zzso as the zzso zzso It is emphasized that trying to invalidate complex zzso models through exhaustive simulation is not only zzso intractable but also zzso 

Biological models derived from experimental data can never be zzso In fact, in order to understand biological function one should try to invalidate models that are incompatible with available zzso This work describes a framework for zzso both continuous and zzso zzso models based on convex zzso zzso The methodology does not require any simulation of the candidate zzso the zzso presented in this paper have a worst case zzso time complexity and can provide an exact answer to the zzso zzso
