zzso zzso offers several advantages in comparison to conventional zzso Most zzso for regional zzso zzso are based on zzso and calcium zzso infusion coupled in a fixed proportion to the blood flow without considering the zzso zzso flow or the filter clearance of zzso and zzso 

The aim of this study was to develop an zzso for zzso zzso zzso in zzso therapies such as zzso A mathematical model was developed to calculate the volume of zzso infusion required to achieve a desired zzso calcium zzso target level in the zzso circuit and to restore the total calcium level to a zzso zzso 

The model was validated by correlation analyses for different blood zzso values and shows an excellent fit to the laboratory zzso 

The results for both zzso target zzso namely those after zzso and calcium infusion, proved that the software zzso adapts well to variable treatment zzso
