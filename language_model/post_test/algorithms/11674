The volume of the primary zzso and secondary zzso circulatory system in the Atlantic cod zzso zzso was determined using a modified dye dilution zzso Cod zzso were chronically zzso in the second zzso zzso artery with zzso zzso Evans Blue dye was bound to harvested fish plasma at a concentration of 1 zzso dye zzso zzso and injected at a concentration of 1 zzso zzso body zzso zzso sampling from the zzso produced a dye dilution curve, which could be described by a double exponential zzso zzso zzso analysis enabled the calculation of the primary circulatory and total distribution zzso The difference between these volumes is assumed to be the volume of the zzso From the dilution curve, it was also possible to calculate flow rates between and within the zzso The results of these experiments suggest a plasma volume in the zzso of zzso zzso 100 zzso body mass, and in the zzso of zzso zzso 100 zzso body mass zzso zzso zzso or approximately 50% that of the zzso zzso rates to the zzso were calculated as zzso of the resting cardiac zzso There was an zzso relationship between body mass and blood zzso zzso condition factor showed a tendency towards smaller blood volumes of the zzso expressed as percentage body mass, but this was not evident for the volume of the zzso
