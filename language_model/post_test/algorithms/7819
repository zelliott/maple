zzso with schizophrenia demonstrate zzso of sensory processing within primary auditory zzso We have previously identified lower zzso of zzso spines and zzso zzso and smaller mean zzso zzso zzso volume, in layer 3 of the primary auditory zzso in subjects with zzso all of which might reflect fewer layer 3 zzso zzso in zzso To examine this hypothesis, we developed a robust zzso method based upon unbiased principles for zzso of total volume and zzso zzso numbers for each layer of a cortical zzso Our method generates both a zzso zzso random set of mapping sections as well as a set of randomly rotated sections cut zzso to the zzso surface, within the region of zzso We applied our approach in twelve subjects with zzso each matched to a normal comparison zzso zzso auditory zzso volume was assessed using zzso zzso The relative and absolute volume of each cortical layer and, within layer 3, the number and density of zzso zzso were estimated using our novel zzso zzso groups did not differ in regional volume, layer volumes, or zzso zzso number, although zzso zzso density was significantly greater in subjects with zzso These findings suggest that previously observed lower zzso of zzso spines and zzso zzso reflect fewer numbers per zzso and contribute to greater zzso density via a reduced zzso Our approach represents a powerful new method for zzso zzso of features of interest within individual layers of cerebral cortex, with applications beyond the current zzso
