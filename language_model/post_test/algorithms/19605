A zzso experimental design was employed to zzso a zzso blend for the preparation of zzso zzso zzso with maximum zzso and was thereafter modified for achieving controlled drug zzso The quantitative effects of the zzso used zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso on zzso could be predicted using zzso zzso A zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was identified for zzso zzso and obtaining a controlled drug release zzso zzso of the optimal zzso in terms of zzso and controlled drug release was zzso The optimal zzso was zzso in terms of zzso release zzso zzso zzso dynamics and surface zzso From the model fitting zzso drug release was found to be zzso zzso relaxation and erosion based with the former two being more dominant over zzso This was in agreement with the erosion and swelling studies which showed swelling and erosion occurring in the tablet zzso zzso profiling showed initial rapid zzso which could be beneficial for enhanced zzso Surface pH of the zzso zzso was similar to zzso pH and did not show extremes in changes over the test zzso The optimal preparation of zzso zzso zzso identified in this study shows potential for zzso zzso
