We try a new approach with zzso zzso zzso to separate optical signals originated in the upper layer from those in the lower layer and to selectively determine the zzso zzso zzso of each layer in a zzso zzso zzso The difference curve in the zzso profiles of light zzso between a target and a reference medium is divided into segments along the time zzso and a slope of each segment is calculated to determine the zzso zzso The zzso zzso values are estimated under various conditions in which zzso and the reduced scattering zzso zzso of each layer are changed with a zzso Carlo simulation and in phantom zzso zzso variation of them represents the difference in zzso between two layers when zzso of a reference is the same as that of the upper layer of the zzso The discrepancies between calculated zzso and the real zzso depend on the ratio of the real zzso of the upper layer to that of the lower layer, and our approach enables us to estimate the ratio of zzso between the two zzso These results suggest the potential that zzso of the lower layer can be determined by our zzso
