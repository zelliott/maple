Although risk assessment models for specific adult populations such as the elderly have been developed, little work has focused on developing zzso zzso The lack of pediatric models may result in incorrect estimates of relative disease severity among children, in reduced reimbursement for health plans and providers, and in inadequate health care for chronically ill zzso 

To develop and to evaluate a pediatric risk assessment model using automated pharmacy zzso 

zzso zzso study using automated zzso 

All children continuously enrolled in Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound during 1992 and zzso 

The zzso zzso Disease zzso zzso an zzso that classified children into chronic disease categories by prescription drug zzso was compared with the zzso Ambulatory Care Groups zzso model and a demographic model for prediction of total, zzso or primary care costs and primary care zzso Forecast models were estimated using linear zzso and they were evaluated with zzso mean prediction error, mean squared prediction error, and zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso performed significantly better on each of the four forecasting accuracy tests than did a demographic model zzso zzso averaging fourfold zzso Compared with the zzso model, the zzso model performed similarly on mean squared prediction error tests; however, the zzso generally had higher validation zzso zzso 

A zzso pediatric risk assessment model performs better than a demographic model and represents a viable alternative to zzso zzso Further research is necessary to determine if children must be considered separately from adults when conducting zzso risk zzso
