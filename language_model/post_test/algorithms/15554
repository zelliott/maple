recently, a new zzso for zzso zzso zzso ultrasound detection of zzso signals zzso was zzso In the present study, we investigated its zzso performance in zzso monitoring after carotid zzso zzso and assessed zzso its accuracy in detecting zzso 

first, the feasibility of zzso detection in zzso monitoring after zzso in a routine clinical setting was evaluated in 50 zzso Second, to test the reliability of the software a zzso digital audio study tape was made and zzso by the zzso and five human zzso The zzso zzso was defined as the agreement between human zzso a zzso was considered to be present if at least three human observers zzso 

zzso monitoring for zzso detection after zzso was well tolerated by the patients and could be performed zzso In the study tape, the human gold standard detected 107 zzso with 93 zzso having an intensity of zzso or zzso zzso The software detected 81 and 77 zzso zzso Using the 7 zzso intensity zzso the software had no false zzso and 16 false zzso The zzso value between the human gold standard and the software was zzso the proportion of specific agreement was zzso 

the tested zzso provides a reliable method for automated zzso zzso detection after zzso This makes monitoring of the effectiveness of zzso agents in the prevention of stroke after zzso more zzso
