Comparing and zzso the zzso interaction zzso networks of different organisms is important to zzso knowledge about conservation across zzso Known methods that perform these tasks operate zzso zzso they do not assign a distinct role to the input zzso zzso However, in most cases, the input networks are indeed distinguishable on the basis of how the corresponding zzso is biologically well zzso In this paper a new idea is developed, that is, to exploit differences in the characterization of organisms at hand in order to devise methods for comparing their zzso zzso We use the zzso network (called zzso of the best characterized zzso as a fingerprint to guide the alignment process to the second input network (called zzso so that generated results preferably retain the structural characteristics of the Master zzso zzso this is obtained by generating from the Master a finite zzso called alignment model, which is then fed with (a zzso zzso the zzso for the purpose of zzso via the zzso algorithm, matching zzso We propose an approach able to perform global alignment and network zzso and we apply it on zzso zzso We tested our method showing that the results it returns are biologically zzso
