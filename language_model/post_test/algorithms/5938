The zzso factor zzso is zzso in the human zzso zzso syndrome zzso which is characterized by enteric zzso and pigmentation zzso zzso directly regulates genes expressed in neural crest zzso including the enteric zzso and zzso Although some zzso target genes have been reported, the mechanisms by which zzso expression is regulated remain zzso Here, we describe a zzso zzso mouse line zzso that displays partial enteric zzso a loss of zzso and decreased zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso coding sequences was negative, suggesting that zzso regulatory sequences are zzso To isolate the zzso molecular zzso zzso zzso sequences were collected from multiple species, comparative sequence analysis was performed and software was designed zzso to identify identical sequences shared among zzso zzso analysis of zzso sequences revealed a zzso zzso deletion located zzso zzso upstream of zzso in zzso zzso zzso revealed three clusters of highly zzso sequences within the zzso one of which shows strong zzso potential in cultured zzso These zzso zzso present a novel zzso zzso zzso that results in a zzso zzso in zzso zzso demonstrate that a zzso zzso deletion zzso the observed zzso and likely removes sequences essential for zzso zzso zzso combine a novel in zzso method for comparative sequence analysis with in zzso functional zzso to identify candidate regulatory sequences deleted in this zzso These studies will direct further analyses of zzso regulation and provide candidate sequences for zzso detection in zzso patients lacking a zzso zzso
