This paper presents a zzso zzso fuzzy neural network zzso for prediction and identification of zzso dynamic zzso The proposed zzso model combines the traditional zzso zzso fuzzy model and the zzso neural networks zzso This paper adopts the zzso and zzso supported functions as zzso neural network zzso zzso relations embedded in the network are caused by adding some feedback connections representing the memory units into the second layer of the zzso zzso fuzzy neural networks zzso An online learning algorithm, which consists of structure learning and zzso learning, is also zzso The structure learning depends on the degree measure to obtain the number of fuzzy rules and zzso zzso Meanwhile, the zzso learning is based on the zzso descent method for adjusting the shape of the membership function and the connection weights of zzso Finally, computer simulations have demonstrated that the proposed zzso model requires fewer adjustable parameters and zzso a smaller zzso error than other zzso
