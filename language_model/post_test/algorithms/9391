Recent experimental work on fast protein folding brings about an intriguing zzso zzso proteins are supposed to fold near or at the folding speed limit zzso zzso but yet their folding behavior seems to comply with classical two-state zzso which imply the crossing of high free energy zzso However, close inspection of chemical and zzso zzso kinetic experiments in zzso proteins reveals systematic zzso from two-state zzso Using a simple one-dimensional free energy surface approach we find that such zzso are indeed diagnostic of marginal folding zzso Furthermore, the quantitative analysis of available zzso data indicates that many zzso proteins fold downhill in native zzso All of these proteins are then promising candidates for an zzso analysis of protein folding using nuclear magnetic zzso We also find that the diffusion zzso for protein folding is strongly temperature dependent, corresponding to an zzso energy of approximately 1 zzso per protein zzso As a consequence, the folding speed limit at room temperature is about an order of magnitude slower than the approximately 1 zzso estimates from zzso zzso zzso Our analysis is zzso consistent with the available zzso and kinetic data on slow two-state folding proteins and provides a straightforward explanation for the apparent zzso zzso
