zzso screens have begun to reveal protein interaction networks in several zzso To understand the general properties of these protein interaction networks, a systematic analysis of zzso structure and zzso was performed on the protein interaction networks of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso It shows that the three protein interaction networks have a zzso and zzso zzso nature as the consequence of their zzso zzso It also shows that they have the zzso property with similar diameter at zzso zzso of the consequences of random removal of both proteins and interactions from the protein interaction networks suggests their high degree of zzso zzso of a zzso removal shows that the protein interaction network's error tolerance is accompanied by attack zzso These fundamental analyses of the networks might serve as a starting point for further exploring complex biological networks and the coming research of zzso zzso
