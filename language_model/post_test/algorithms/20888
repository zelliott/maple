In the zzso and statistical analysis of zzso zzso it is of great importance to handle random closed sets of different (though zzso zzso dimensions, usually smaller than the full dimension of the relevant zzso Here an original approach is reported, based on random generalized zzso zzso zzso la zzso and corresponding mean generalized zzso The above approach also suggests methods for the statistical zzso of geometric zzso of the zzso zzso system that characterize the zzso of a real vascular zzso A quantitative description of the evolution of zzso zzso requires the mathematical zzso of a strongly coupled system of a zzso zzso process of zzso zzso the network of blood vessels, and a family of underlying fields, zzso zzso zzso zzso for reducing complexity include homogenization at zzso thus leading to hybrid models zzso at the larger scale, and zzso at lower zzso in zzso zzso the two scales can be bridged by introducing a zzso at which one locally averages the microscopic zzso process, in presence of a sufficiently large number of vessels zzso
