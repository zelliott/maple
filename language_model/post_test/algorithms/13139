To investigate the zzso variations of three-dimensional zzso zzso at zzso landmarks by different zzso zzso we applied principal axes of inertia to the zzso zzso The principal zzso were determined directly from the zzso zzso produced by a zzso zzso joint zzso As a preliminary study, the principal zzso for a pilot group of patients with zzso zzso were correlated with the zzso 

zzso zzso movements from the patients with zzso zzso were tracked based on a zzso zzso and an optical tracking zzso The dental zzso recorded on the zzso provided synchronization for initial movement in the tracking and the simulation zzso The translation and rotation recorded during tracking were applied zzso to the zzso model in relation to a fixed zzso zzso The sequential positions of the points of interest based on the reference coordinate system could also be simulated and traced by the same zzso The landmarks selected for analysis were the points of the bilateral zzso and of the zzso zzso The moment of inertia zzso was calculated with respect to the zzso trajectory zzso Using the unit zzso along the principal axes derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and frontal zzso around the zzso zzso and zzso respectively, were determined to represent the principal directions as principal zzso 

The measured zzso were correlated with the zzso in 3 zzso zzso Under the influence of the zzso zzso the zzso of the principal axis at the zzso increase zzso in the horizontal plane and zzso in the frontal zzso At the zzso point, the horizontal and frontal angles increase counterclockwise, but the zzso angles increase zzso The zzso between different zzso and between landmarks, defined as a correlation zzso between principal zzso decrease as the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso at selected landmarks based on the reference coordinate system were evaluated using principal axes of inertia to investigate the functional characteristics of the zzso with a zzso The movement asymmetry between the zzso increases as the zzso increases in all zzso The principal zzso at the zzso can be explained by those at the zzso with varying degrees despite the zzso
