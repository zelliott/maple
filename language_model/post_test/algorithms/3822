zzso unfolding of protein is simulated by using a zzso Carlo simulation with a lattice model for protein and zzso Following the binding theory for zzso zzso the zzso molecules are modeled to interact with protein by zzso zzso By analyzing the zzso states on the unfolding zzso of zzso the zzso unfolding zzso is compared with the zzso unfolding zzso under the same zzso that is, the free energies of unfolding under two different pathways are zzso The two zzso show markedly different zzso zzso in unfolded zzso From the calculation of the free energy of protein as a function of the number fraction zzso of native contacts relative to the total number of zzso it is found that the free energy of the largely unfolded state corresponding to low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso under zzso unfolding is lower than that under zzso zzso whereas the free energy of the unfolded state close to the native state zzso zzso zzso is lower in zzso unfolding than in zzso zzso A comparison of two unfolding pathways reveals that the zzso unfolding shows a wider zzso distribution than the zzso zzso while the zzso unfolding shows a more compact unfolded state than the zzso unfolding especially in the low zzso region zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
