The leaky zzso model for zzso zzso events driven by a periodic stimulus is studied by using the zzso zzso To this purpose, an essential use is made of the zzso behavior of the zzso probability density function of a time homogeneous diffusion process through an zzso periodic zzso zzso comparisons with some recently published results derived by a different approach are zzso Use of a new zzso approximation is then made in order to design a zzso zzso of zzso type to solve the integral equation in the unknown zzso probability density zzso Such algorithm, characterized by a reduced zzso zzso time, is seen to provide a high zzso zzso Finally, it is shown that such an approach yields excellent approximations to the firing probability density function for a wide range of zzso including the case of high stimulus zzso
