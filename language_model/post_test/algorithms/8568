Recently we introduced the zzso cell analysis system, in which samples are prepared based on a combination of zzso selection, zzso and alignment of cells along zzso zzso Here we describe the underlying magnetic principles and considerations made in the magnetic field design to achieve the best possible cell selection and alignment of zzso labeled zzso Materials and zzso Computer simulations, in combination with experimental data, were used to zzso the design of the magnets and Ni lines to obtain the optimal magnetic zzso 

A homogeneous cell distribution on the upper surface of the sample chamber was obtained with a magnet where the pole faces were zzso towards each zzso The spatial distribution of zzso aligned objects in between the Ni lines was dependent on the ratio of the diameter of the aligned object and the line zzso which was tested with zzso and zzso labeled 6 zzso polystyrene zzso The best result was obtained when the line spacing was equal to or smaller than the diameter of the aligned zzso 

The magnetic zzso of the designed permanent magnet extracts zzso labeled cells from any cell suspension to a desired plane, providing a homogeneous cell zzso In addition, it zzso zzso Ni lines in this plane whose additional local zzso adds to the zzso of the permanent zzso The zzso zzso zzso the zzso labeled cells first brought to this zzso This combination makes it possible, in a single step, to extract and align cells on a surface from any cell zzso
