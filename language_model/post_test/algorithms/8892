zzso reads to a reference zzso is a routine yet zzso intensive task in research based on zzso zzso In recent years, the sequencing reads of the zzso platform have become longer and their quality scores zzso According to our zzso this allows perfect zzso seed match for almost all reads when a close reference zzso is available subject to reasonable zzso Our other observation is that the majority reads contain at most one short zzso zzso Based on these zzso we propose a zzso approach, referred to as zzso which has two core steps: First it scans a read zzso in a specific order for a zzso exact match zzso next it extends the alignment on both sides zzso at most, one short zzso each using a novel method called zzso zzso We decompose the evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity into two parts corresponding to the seed and extension step, and the composite result provides an approximate overall reliability estimate of each zzso We compare zzso with some existing mapping methods on several zzso and zzso shows better performance in terms of both running time and mapping zzso
