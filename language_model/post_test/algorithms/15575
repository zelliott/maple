A weakness of many animal models of diabetes zzso is the failure to use insulin therapy, which typically results in severe body zzso Data collected from such studies must be interpreted cautiously to separate the effects of zzso from those of zzso We provide several zzso that were used by us in two long-term zzso experiments in which zzso zzso to 400 zzso zzso zzso zzso to 405 zzso and zzso zzso to 106 zzso zzso and positive energy balance were maintained in zzso zzso miniature zzso groups included control, zzso diabetes zzso diabetes zzso plus zzso zzso and zzso diabetic zzso zzso The zzso were developed for the zzso model because of several similarities to humans, zzso cardiac anatomy and zzso propensity for sedentary behavior, and metabolism of dietary carbohydrates and zzso Acute toxic effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso were minimized by preventive fluid loading and by use of zzso in which insulin, food, and fluid therapy were zzso zzso insulin and food maintenance zzso zzso normal body weight gain in all three diabetic groups zzso zzso and zzso greater body weight gain in pigs of an obesity zzso zzso pigs of both experiments zzso significantly increased work performance and did not experience medical zzso We conclude that these zzso can be used in zzso or similar zzso can be developed for other animal species to maintain zzso and/or zzso while avoiding zzso zzso zzso animal models of diabetes zzso that maintain positive energy balance and poor zzso control provide a marked improvement over other models by more closely mimicking the human presentation of diabetes zzso
