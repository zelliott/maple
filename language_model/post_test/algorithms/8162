The tumor zzso zzso plays a crucial role in cellular response to various zzso Recent experiments have shown that zzso level exhibits a series of zzso after DNA damage caused by zzso radiation zzso However, how the zzso zzso govern cell survival and death remains zzso Here, we develop an integrated model with four zzso for the zzso network and explore the mechanism for cell fate decision based on the dynamics of the zzso By zzso simulations, the following processes are zzso First, DNA repair proteins bind to zzso zzso breaks, forming complexes, which are then detected by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso to produce zzso zzso the target genes of zzso are selectively induced to control cell zzso We propose that zzso promotes the repair of minor DNA damage but suppresses the repair of severe zzso We demonstrate that cell fate is determined by the number of zzso zzso relying on the extent of DNA zzso At low damage levels, few zzso zzso evoke cell cycle arrest by inducing zzso and promote cell survival, whereas at high damage levels, sustained zzso zzso trigger zzso by inducing zzso We find that zzso can effectively maintain zzso integrity by regulating the efficiency and zzso of DNA zzso We also show that zzso in the generation and repair of DNA damage leads to zzso in cell zzso These findings are consistent with experimental observations and advance our understanding of the dynamics and functions of the zzso zzso
