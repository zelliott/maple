An zzso for generating zzso zzso that reflects the peculiarities of the dynamic mode of operating of the zzso zzso created on the base of zzso simulations of the sensor zzso is zzso The most important steps are: selection of the zzso quantity about the sensor current versus time relationship and the zzso curve zzso Five different zzso quantities are tested as well as two ways of representation of zzso zzso The object of study is zzso zzso selective zzso The values of the kinetic zzso used reflect the conversion of zzso to zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results show that sensors with different zzso characteristics can be created by means of a selection of zzso quantity of the signal of one zzso zzso In addition there appears to be a possibility of zzso the zzso procedure and zzso the life of the zzso
