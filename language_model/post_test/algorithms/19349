The zzso Ark Problem zzso is a comprehensive zzso methodology for zzso conservation that was introduced by Weitzman zzso and zzso the zzso tree containing the zzso of interest to assess zzso Given a set of zzso each of which has a particular survival probability that can be increased at some cost, the zzso seeks to allocate limited funds to zzso these zzso so that the future expected zzso is zzso Finding optimal solutions using this framework is a zzso difficult problem to which a simple and efficient zzso zzso has been proposed in the literature and applied to conservation zzso We show that, although zzso of this type cannot produce optimal solutions for the general zzso there are two restricted scenarios of the zzso for which a greedy zzso is guaranteed to produce optimal zzso The first scenario requires the zzso to have equal conservation zzso the second scenario requires an zzso zzso The zzso assumes a linear relationship between the funding allocated to conservation of a zzso and the increased survival probability of that zzso This relationship is briefly investigated and one variation is suggested that can also be solved using a greedy zzso
