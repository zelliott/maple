The general purpose zzso Carlo zzso radiation transport computer code zzso was used for the simulation of zzso zzso in diagnostic zzso and zzso The electrons were transported until they slow down and stop in the zzso Both zzso and characteristic zzso production were considered in this zzso We focus on the simulation of various zzso combinations to investigate the effect of tube zzso target material and filter thickness on zzso zzso in the diagnostic zzso and zzso energy zzso The simulated zzso zzso were compared with experimental zzso and zzso calculated by zzso report number zzso In addition, the zzso heel effect and zzso zzso zzso were assessed for different zzso angles and target materials and the results were compared with zzso zzso Carlo simulations and measured zzso zzso evaluation of the differences between our zzso Carlo simulated and comparison zzso was performed using student's zzso statistical zzso Generally, there is a good agreement between the simulated zzso and comparison zzso although there are systematic differences between the simulated and reference zzso especially in the zzso zzso zzso Nevertheless, no statistically significant differences have been observed between zzso zzso and the simulated zzso It has been shown that the difference between zzso simulated zzso and zzso zzso in the low energy range is the result of the zzso of characteristic photons following the zzso zzso The transmission zzso produced by zzso have good agreement with the zzso report especially for tube zzso of 50 zzso and 80 zzso The systematic zzso for higher tube zzso is the result of systematic differences between the corresponding zzso
