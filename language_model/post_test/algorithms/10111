In zzso data analysis, zzso zzso zzso is often used to group samples or genes according to their gene expression profiles to study their zzso In a typical zzso zzso zzso structures can be quickly identified in a zzso The relationship between objects is lost, however, because clusters rather than individual objects are zzso This results in a tree that is hard to zzso 

This study proposes an ordering method, zzso which zzso bilateral zzso distance of two adjacent clusters in a tree so that similar objects in the clusters are located in the cluster zzso The performance of zzso was evaluated by both supervised and zzso approaches and compared zzso with other ordering zzso 

The intuitive relationship between objects and flexibility of the zzso method can be very helpful in the exploratory analysis of not only zzso data but also similar zzso zzso
