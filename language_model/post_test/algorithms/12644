This paper investigates the problem of zzso lag synchronization for a kind of competitive neural network with discrete and distributed delays zzso zzso as well as uncertain zzso external and zzso zzso zzso zzso A simple but robust zzso controller is designed such that the response system can zzso with a drive zzso Based on the zzso stability theory and some suitable zzso zzso several sufficient conditions ensuring the lag synchronization are zzso Our synchronization criteria are easily verified and do not need to solve any linear zzso zzso Some existing results are improved and zzso Moreover, the designed zzso controller has better zzso capacity and is more practical than the usual zzso zzso zzso simulations are exploited to show the effectiveness of the theoretical zzso
