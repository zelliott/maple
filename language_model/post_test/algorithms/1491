Attempts to zzso zzso zzso have recently been focused on the zzso orifice flow zzso A complete description of the zzso orifice flow field is provided in this zzso A steady state in zzso model accessible by both color zzso ultrasound zzso and laser zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso for varying flow rates and zzso were calculated by finite element modeling zzso by zzso and by zzso The steady flow model was composed of circular zzso of 3, 5 and 10 zzso diameters at flow rates from zzso to 10 zzso zzso flow rates were calculated from the zzso zzso data by two separate zzso The first approach zzso angle corrected zzso while the second approach zzso only zzso which did not require angle correction zzso zzso Both methods correlated well with known flow rates zzso zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso p zzso zzso and y zzso zzso + zzso r zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso and were superior to results obtained by assuming a zzso geometry as is done in the zzso zzso The methodology provides a complete analysis of the zzso flow field and involves fewer geometric assumptions than the zzso zzso This may prove to be an advantage when analyzing in zzso flow fields with complex, uncertain zzso
