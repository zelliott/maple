zzso is essential for continuous cellular zzso zzso insights have come from studies of budding zzso zzso which consists of a zzso core in association with two regulatory zzso ever shorter zzso 1 and 3 zzso and zzso We report here a high-resolution structure of the zzso zzso zzso determined using a recently developed strategy that combines minimal zzso experimental data with zzso de zzso structure prediction zzso zzso adopts an overall protein fold which is structurally similar to that adopted by the zzso component zzso However, the characteristics of the surface of the zzso determined zzso structure are substantially different from those predicted by prior zzso models of zzso zzso zzso of the complete surface of the zzso protein reveals two adjacent patches on a zzso face of the protein that zzso mediate zzso zzso zzso these two patches on the zzso structure defines a set of shared features between zzso and zzso suggesting an analogous zzso surface on zzso
