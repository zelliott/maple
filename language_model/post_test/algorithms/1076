The mechanism underlying the zzso of the hydrogen bond with zzso zzso was zzso zzso interactions of the zzso of the hydrogen bond zzso with the electrical field of the zzso bond of zzso were zzso It was shown that the electrical field of the zzso bond of zzso excites zzso of the zzso in the complex with the hydrogen bond zzso and zzso it from the equilibrium towards the zzso zzso The distortion of the potential curve depends on a change in the length of the zzso bond of zzso zzso zzso zzso and UN of the zzso system were zzso which zzso to the ground and excited states of the zzso zzso It was found that as the length of the bond of zzso zzso increases, the branches of the zzso potential zzso and zzso zzso At the intersection point, the system can transit to the branch zzso which can lead to a reduction of the barrier and a break of the zzso bond of zzso Presumably, this mechanism is universal for processes of transformation of the chemical energy of zzso to the energy of excited hydrogen bond, a mechanism for the maintenance of heat balance and reduction of zzso in a living zzso
