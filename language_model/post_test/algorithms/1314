The approaches usually used for building large genetic maps consist of dividing the marker set into linkage groups and provide local orders that can be tested by zzso linkage zzso To deal with the limitations of these approaches, a strategy taking the marker set into account globally is zzso 

The paper presents a new approach called zzso Scaling zzso zzso for zzso marker orders and distances in genetic maps based on the use of an additional dimension zzso to the map into which markers are zzso zzso forces based on a zzso analysis are applied to tend to zzso the marker locations in zzso The efficiency of the approach is exemplified on real data (16 and 70 markers on zzso 6 and 2, zzso and simulated data zzso maps of 70 zzso
