zzso leads to changes in the allocation of nitrogen among different pools and zzso however, a detailed quantitative analysis of these changes has been zzso Here, we demonstrate that a mass zzso zzso acquisition approach known as zzso combined with a novel zzso to zzso heavy atom enrichment in zzso is able to zzso zzso changes in protein amounts and zzso flux in a high zzso zzso The reliable zzso of rabbit zzso b protein spiked into leaf protein extract was zzso The linear dynamic range, zzso of technical and biological zzso and differences between measured and expected zzso into the small zzso and large zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso of zzso zzso plants grown in zzso culture at different known zzso of zzso nitrate were used to further evaluate the zzso The utility of the method for zzso studies in ecologically realistic contexts was demonstrated by using zzso protocols on plants growing in soil under unknown zzso zzso Additionally, we zzso the amounts of zzso 2 zzso zzso an zzso important in zzso defense responses, demonstrating that the approach allows for in-depth quantitative zzso and zzso flux analyses of the zzso dynamics zzso during zzso zzso
