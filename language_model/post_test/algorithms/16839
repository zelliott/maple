In order to automate cervical cancer screening tests, one of the most important and longstanding challenges is the zzso of cell zzso in the stained zzso Though zzso of isolated cells in high-quality acquisitions often are easy to segment, the problem lies in the zzso of large numbers of zzso with various characteristics under differing acquisition conditions in high-resolution scans of the complete microscope zzso We implemented a system that enables processing of full resolution images, and proposes a new zzso for zzso the zzso under adequate control of the expert zzso The system can work automatically or zzso zzso to allow for zzso within the whole range of slide and image zzso It zzso data storage and interaction of technical and medical experts, especially with its zzso zzso The proposed zzso zzso cell zzso using a voting scheme and prior knowledge, before it determines the exact shape of the zzso by means of an elastic zzso zzso After noise removal with a zzso and a median filtering takes place, edges are extracted with a zzso edge detection zzso zzso by the observation that cell zzso are surrounded by zzso and their shape is roughly zzso edges adjacent to the background are zzso A zzso zzso transform for zzso finds candidate zzso which are then processed by a level set zzso The zzso is tested and compared to other zzso on a database containing zzso images acquired from two different microscope zzso with promising zzso
