We have developed a new zzso technique, called zzso reaction dynamics zzso that makes it possible to simulate zzso networks at the particle level and in both time and zzso In this zzso a maximum time step is chosen such that only single particles or pairs of particles have to be zzso For these zzso the zzso equation can be solved zzso using Green's zzso The main idea of zzso is to exploit the exact solution of the zzso equation to set up an zzso algorithm, which combines in one step the propagation of the particles in space with the reactions between zzso The zzso nature allows zzso to make large jumps in time and space when the particles are far apart from each zzso Here, we apply the technique to a simple model of gene zzso The simulations reveal that spatial fluctuations can be a major source of noise in zzso zzso The calculations also show that zzso is highly zzso Under biologically relevant conditions, zzso is up to five orders of magnitude faster than conventional zzso techniques for simulating zzso networks in time and zzso zzso is not limited to zzso zzso It can also be applied to a large number of other zzso zzso
