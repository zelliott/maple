When closed manipulation fails to restore zzso zzso in zzso displaced fractures of the zzso zzso open reduction and internal fixation is zzso zzso of surgical stabilization and zzso reconstruction of these injuries are reviewed in this retrospective study of 49 patients with 52 zzso zzso zzso radius zzso zzso patients zzso with a mean age of 37 years zzso of 17 to 79 zzso were available for zzso The mean follow-up time was 38 months zzso zzso zzso When rated according to the Association for the Study of Internal zzso zzso 19 were type C2 and 21 were type zzso We devised an zzso zzso System based on the initial injury zzso to zzso severely zzso zzso fractures and to identify those associated with zzso injury (3 zzso zzso fracture zzso zzso zzso and zzso length were significantly improved following surgery zzso zzso zzso Grip strength averaged zzso zzso zzso of the zzso side, and the range of motion averaged zzso zzso zzso of the zzso side zzso A combined outcome rating system that included grip strength, range of motion, and pain relief averaged zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso There was a statistically significant decrease in the combined rating with more severe fracture patterns as defined by the zzso system zzso zzso zzso Malone zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso System zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso System presented here, and in particular the number of fracture fragments, correlated most closely with outcome of all the zzso systems zzso zzso treatment of these zzso radius fractures with reconstruction of the zzso zzso and correction of the zzso surface alignment with internal fixation and/or external zzso can significantly improve the zzso alignment and functional zzso Furthermore, the degree to which zzso zzso gap between fragments, and zzso zzso are improved by surgery is strongly correlated with improved outcome, even when the results are corrected for severity of initial injury, whereas correction of zzso tilt or zzso tilt did not correlate with improved zzso
