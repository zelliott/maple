zzso zzso zzso have been widely used to zzso neurological system zzso Changes in zzso zzso may indicate impending neurological zzso Traditional zzso analyses are developed under the condition that the background noise in zzso analysis are zzso zzso This paper proposes a zzso change detection and zzso zzso under zzso noise condition, a zzso of zzso noise zzso An analysis shows that the zzso model fits the noises found in the impact acceleration experiment under study better than the zzso zzso The zzso of the proposed zzso is demonstrated through computer simulations and experimental data analysis under both zzso and zzso noise zzso
