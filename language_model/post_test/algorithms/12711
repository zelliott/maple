zzso is widely used to understand neural development and model various neurodegenerative zzso zzso zzso are zzso transparent, have a short development period, and can be kept alive in zzso for days, making them amenable to zzso microscopic zzso As a result of zzso experiments, a large number of images can be generated in a single experiment, posing a challenge to researchers to analyze them efficiently and zzso In this work, we develop an image processing focused on detecting and zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso automatically detects a region of interest zzso enclosing an area around the zzso and then segment the zzso for zzso In this process, the zzso identifies the head and torso at first, and then finds the boundaries corresponding to the back and abdomen by taking advantage of a zzso information about the anatomy of zzso zzso The method is robust in terms that it can detect and zzso zzso even when the zzso have different zzso and zzso We used real data to demonstrate the performance of the method to extract zzso information from zzso zzso images and compared its results with manual analysis for zzso
