A novel strategy that combines the zzso zzso method based on the zzso decomposition zzso with high performance liquid zzso with zzso array detector zzso was developed to zzso separate the overlapped zzso and to zzso zzso in honey zzso The zzso data were obtained within a short time in zzso zzso The developed method could be applied to determine 12 zzso at the same time even in the presence of zzso interfering components in complex zzso To access the performance of the proposed strategy for the determination of zzso in honey samples, the figures of merit were zzso The limits of zzso for all zzso were within the range zzso zzso zzso The work presented in this paper illustrated the suitability and interesting potential of combining zzso zzso method with zzso zzso instrument for zzso analysis in honey zzso
