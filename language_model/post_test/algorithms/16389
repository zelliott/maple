A zzso zzso zzso has been found in all major zzso classes except zzso Since the zzso light zzso zzso of the fresh water turtle takes between 5 and 10 zzso to achieve maximum zzso and since zzso retinal zzso cells zzso in zzso use zzso to control their slow sustained zzso responses, we hypothesized that a zzso zzso exists in the zzso of the zzso To identify its presence, retinal tissue was dissected from seven zzso and total zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reactions zzso were carried out to amplify gene sequences using zzso targeting the highly zzso core region of zzso and zzso products were analyzed by gel zzso and zzso zzso derived from a zzso zzso product were compared to those stored in zzso by the basic local alignment search tool zzso zzso and returned significant matches to several zzso from other zzso including zzso zzso real-time zzso zzso was also carried out to compare expression levels of zzso in different zzso The zzso expression level of zzso in the zzso was higher in comparison to other tissue zzso zzso liver, zzso and skeletal zzso The results suggest that zzso exists in the zzso of the turtle and provides a possible explanation for the presence of a slow zzso The turtle is likely to be a useful model for further understanding the zzso mechanisms in the zzso which control the dynamics of the zzso
