zzso theory can be used to derive the lower bound on the spatial resolution achievable with zzso zzso detectors as a function of the detector geometry and the pertinent physical properties of the zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso lower bound zzso can for example be used to zzso the detector design and to test the performance of the method used to derive position information from the detector zzso Here, this approach is demonstrated for monolithic zzso detectors for zzso zzso zzso Two detector zzso are zzso a 20 zzso 10 zzso 10 zzso and a 20 zzso 10 zzso 20 zzso monolithic zzso crystal read out by one or two zzso zzso avalanche zzso zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that in these detectors the zzso is primarily determined by the zzso excess noise factor and the number of zzso photons zzso Furthermore, it is shown that the use of a zzso neighbor zzso zzso for position zzso allows the zzso obtained spatial resolution to closely approach the zzso The approach outlined in this work can in principle be applied to any zzso detector in which position information is zzso in the distribution of the zzso light over multiple zzso zzso
