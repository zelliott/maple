In this paper we consider the spatial orientation of zzso We take the view that, in determining their rotation angles from X-rays, the procedure applied by zzso yields the most reliable empirical results, zzso the three angles through which a vertebra zzso about its own symmetry axes in a specific zzso With a view to the further use of this information to analyze zzso or the motion of a spine we recommend that the zzso angles be converted into the well-known zzso zzso How this can be done is the subject of this zzso
