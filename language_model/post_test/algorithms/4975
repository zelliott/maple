Different expression of zzso and zzso inherited zzso at certain genes is called genetic zzso Despite its great importance in trait formation, development, and evolution, it remains unclear how genetic zzso operates in a complex network of interactive genes located throughout the zzso zzso mapping has proven to be a powerful tool that can estimate the distribution and effects of imprinted zzso While traditional mapping models attempt to detect imprinted quantitative trait zzso based on a linkage map constructed from molecular zzso we have developed a statistical model for zzso the zzso effects of zzso composed of multiple zzso zzso zzso The new model provides a characterization of the difference in the effect of zzso and zzso derived zzso which can be used as a tool for genetic association studies at the candidate gene or zzso zzso The model was used to map imprinted zzso effects on body mass index in a random sample from a natural human population, leading to the detection of significant imprinted effects at the zzso zzso The new model will be useful for characterizing the genetic architecture of complex quantitative traits at the zzso zzso
