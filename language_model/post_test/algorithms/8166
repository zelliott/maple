This article gives a natural decomposition of the suspension of a generalized zzso complex or partial product space which arises as the zzso product zzso described zzso The introduction and application of the smash product zzso complex provides a precise identification of the stable zzso type of the values of the zzso product zzso One direct consequence is an analysis of the associated zzso For the special case of the zzso of certain zzso arrangements, the geometrical decomposition implies the zzso decomposition in earlier work of others as described zzso Because the splitting is geometric, an analogous zzso decomposition for a generalized zzso complex applies for any zzso zzso zzso therefore, is a decomposition for the zzso ring of a finite zzso complex, and natural zzso
