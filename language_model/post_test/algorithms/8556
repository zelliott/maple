To determine patent zzso zzso zzso closure rates, and zzso zzso toxicity rates in zzso zzso with zzso using an individualized zzso zzso dosing zzso In addition, develop zzso zzso evaluating zzso and zzso relationships for closure and zzso zzso especially in select zzso historically known as zzso zzso zzso g and zzso or zzso 10 days zzso zzso 

zzso cohort zzso 

Level III zzso intensive care zzso 

One hundred zzso patients receiving 151 courses of zzso for zzso closure were zzso 

Patients initially received zzso zzso of zzso followed immediately by 1 zzso of zzso zzso zzso were obtained 2 zzso and 8 zzso after the dose and were zzso using zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso parameters were calculated with subsequent zzso dosing based on the individualized zzso variables to increase trough serum zzso by zzso zzso 

zzso closure was successful in zzso patients zzso Renal toxicity occurred in 21 zzso patients and was temporary and zzso No significant differences in response rates based on treatment weight or zzso age were zzso zzso zzso were similar for zzso zzso g zzso zzso or zzso 1000 zzso zzso zzso were also similar for zzso with zzso age zzso days zzso zzso or zzso 10 zzso zzso significant differences were noted between zzso zzso for zzso age zzso days zzso zzso or zzso 10 days in total days of therapy zzso zzso zzso zzso total number of doses required to close zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso critical zzso dose zzso zzso zzso zzso critical zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso zzso and critical zzso concentration ratio zzso zzso zzso 

These findings support the hypothesis that the poor zzso closure rates with zzso for zzso zzso days zzso age are the result of zzso differences only and that weight does not impact response zzso zzso zzso dosing of zzso continues to achieve higher closure rate than current dosing zzso Patients historically known as poor zzso significantly benefit from this dosing zzso
