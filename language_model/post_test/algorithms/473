The purpose of this study was to develop a quantitative skin zzso test that could be used to diagnose spinal zzso injury zzso if any, especially in unconscious and/or zzso zzso zzso To achieve this goal, initially skin zzso of the sensory key points of the zzso (between zzso and zzso zzso was measured in 15 traumatic zzso patients (13 zzso and 2 zzso and 15 control zzso In order to zzso zzso values and to observe whether there would be a significant difference between patient and subject zzso an artificial neural network zzso with zzso zzso was zzso zzso results of the ANN showed promising zzso It could zzso traumatic zzso patients with a success rate of zzso By assessing the experimental protocols and the validation results, the proposed method seemed to be a simple, objective, zzso zzso and zzso way of assessing zzso in such zzso
