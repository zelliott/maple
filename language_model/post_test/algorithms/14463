Noise disturbances and time delays are frequently met in cellular genetic regulatory zzso This paper is concerned with the zzso analysis of a class of genetic regulatory networks described by zzso differential equation zzso The mechanisms of genetic regulatory networks to amplify zzso external zzso are zzso and a simple measure of the amplification zzso level is developed from a zzso robust control point of zzso It should be noted that the conditions used to measure the zzso level are zzso or zzso and are expressed within the framework of linear zzso inequalities, which can be characterized as convex zzso and zzso by the zzso zzso zzso Finally, by the proposed method, a zzso example is provided to illustrate how to measure the zzso of proteins in the presence of external zzso
