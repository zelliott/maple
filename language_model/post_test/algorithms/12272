Monitoring and control of production processes for zzso have become standard requirements to support consistency and zzso In this paper, a constant specific growth rate in zzso zzso of zzso zzso is achieved by a newly designed specific growth rate zzso The performance of standard control methods is limited because of the zzso characteristics due to the zzso increasing biomass and zzso To cope with the changing zzso a stable model reference zzso controller is designed which adapts the controller settings as volume and biomass zzso An important asset of the design is that dissolved oxygen is the only required online zzso An original design without considering the dissolved oxygen dynamics resulted zzso in zzso zzso zzso in contrast to common believes, it is essential to include dissolved oxygen zzso The zzso of this novel design was tested in zzso The zzso of the design was confirmed by laboratory experiments for small-scale production of zzso zzso The controller was able to regulate the specific growth rate at the desired set point, even during a long zzso zzso time with zzso increasing demands for zzso and zzso
