To understand the functioning of living cells, it is often helpful or even necessary to exploit inherent zzso disparities and focus on long-term dynamic zzso In the present study, we explore this type of zzso for the zzso network of the zzso zzso We show that, during the slow phase that follows a fast initial zzso the network reaction rates are zzso into clusters corresponding to connected parts of the reaction zzso Rates within any of these clusters assume essentially the same value: differences within each cluster are vastly smaller than that from one cluster to zzso This rate zzso zzso an analogous zzso of the zzso zzso only the molecular zzso on the interface between these clusters are produced and consumed at substantially different rates and hence change considerably during the slow zzso The remaining zzso essentially assume their zzso values already by the end of the transient zzso Further, we find that this zzso phenomenon occurs for a large number of zzso values and also for models with different zzso to each of these models, there zzso a particular network zzso Our results show that, in spite of its complexity, the zzso system tends to behave in a rather simple zzso zzso zzso The persistence of zzso for the zzso models we examined suggests that it is likely to be encountered in various environmental conditions, as well as in other signal zzso pathways with network structures similar to that of the zzso zzso
