For organisms with limited zzso and/or occupying zzso zzso we often encounter zzso patterns of genetic affinity over relatively small spatial zzso zzso zzso genetic zzso Both the extent and zzso rate of that pattern can be expected to depend on numerous interesting zzso zzso zzso and mating system factors, and it would be useful to be able to compare different zzso There is, however, no zzso test currently available for zzso genetic structure that would provide us with any guidance on whether the differences we encounter are statistically zzso Here, we develop a general zzso zzso test, zzso on standard zzso methods for pairs of zzso We first develop a zzso zzso zzso where the distance classes zzso can be defined as functions of zzso Using that pooled zzso as our zzso reference frame, we then develop a zzso test of the zzso among different zzso zzso From these zzso tests, we construct an analogous test of zzso for zzso zzso We illustrate with a pair of biological examples, one involving the Australian zzso zzso the other involving zzso zzso The Australian zzso rat has limited zzso and sometimes occupies zzso zzso We show that the zzso pattern zzso somewhat between continuous and zzso habitat zzso For zzso zzso zzso replication in Piedmont populations substantially increases zzso for short zzso but zzso replication is less pronounced in mountain zzso zzso of zzso replicates reduces the zzso for short lags and reverses the sign of the difference between mountain and Piedmont zzso
