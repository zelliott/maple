The purpose of this study was to zzso whether St Jude zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso capture confirmation, automatic pacing threshold determination and output adjustment can be applied to paced patients with zzso heart disease zzso 

30 patients with zzso received a zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso B: zzso single zzso or dual chamber zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso As a safe zzso function is ensured only if a sufficient evoked response zzso and a low lead polarization zzso zzso are present, these parameters were reevaluated from 112 follow-up studies with respect to zzso In all but one zzso system zzso correctly zzso zzso was recommended in zzso patients with zzso leads but correct zzso function was preserved in only 3 zzso 

These data suggest that the application of the zzso zzso is safe in patients with zzso when zzso leads are zzso Whether appropriate zzso function is possible with zzso leads needs individual zzso
