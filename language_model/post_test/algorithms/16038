We have examined the dissolution of zzso zzso gels in a zzso dissolution apparatus under stirred conditions, and simultaneously monitored the release of model drugs from these zzso The drugs selected were zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our results show that drug release is zzso and is controlled by the dissolution of the gel for all the drugs, under various conditions of temperature, zzso zzso drug zzso and for stirring speeds between 20 and 80 zzso The addition of zzso zzso has no significant effect on dissolution rate or drug zzso zzso zzso concentration in the gel decreases gel dissolution and drug release zzso We have developed a zzso mathematical model based on the assumption that zzso of water into the gel and subsequent zzso of zzso zzso control gel zzso There is good agreement between experimental results and model predictions for stirring speeds above 20 zzso As stirring speed is decreased to 20 zzso and below, there are discrepancies between actual and predicted values, presumably due to a significant diffusion component that contributes to drug zzso
