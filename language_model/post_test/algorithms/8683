There are several MR imaging procedures that result in three-dimensional data of moving zzso One way to evaluate these data is a sequential observation of zzso zzso A more common and efficient approach is to zzso calculate two-dimensional projection images at different angles representing individual views of the zzso zzso The display of different views from the same data set will allow a realistic zzso of the blood vessel zzso
