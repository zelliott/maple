In the development of zzso interference zzso merely selecting short interfering zzso zzso sequences that are complementary to the zzso target does not guarantee target zzso Current zzso for selecting zzso rely on many zzso one of which is zzso often predicted through calculation of the relative zzso zzso of the two ends of the zzso However, we have previously shown that highly active zzso sequences are likely to have particular zzso at each zzso independently of their zzso zzso Here, we describe an zzso for predicting highly active zzso sequences based only on these two asymmetry zzso The zzso uses zzso zzso preferences and predicted zzso zzso each weighted on the basis of training data from the literature, to rank the probability that an zzso sequence will have high or low zzso The zzso successfully predicts zzso and highly active sequences for enhanced green fluorescent protein and protein zzso Use of these two parameters in combination improves the prediction of zzso activity over current approaches for predicting zzso Going forward, we anticipate that this approach to zzso asymmetry prediction will be incorporated into the next generation of zzso selection zzso
