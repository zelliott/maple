Some authors consider that evolutionary search may be positively influenced by the use of redundant zzso whereas others note that the addition of random zzso to a representation could be useless in zzso Given this lack of consensus, two new families of redundant zzso representations are developed in this zzso The first family is based on linear transformations and is considered zzso The second family of representations is designed to implement neutrality, and is based on the mathematical zzso of error control zzso A study aimed at assessing the influence of zzso and neutrality on the performance of a simple evolutionary zzso is zzso The zzso is modeled using zzso chains and is applied to zzso fitness zzso The results indicate that the zzso neighborhood induced by a redundant representation dominates the behavior of the algorithm, affecting the search more strongly than neutrality, and the representations with better performance on zzso fitness landscapes do not exhibit extreme values of any of the indicators of representation quality commonly adopted in the zzso
