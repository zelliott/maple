In this letter, we propose a new zzso for zzso sparse zzso sources from a set of noisy linear zzso In particular, we consider difficult situations with high noise levels and more sources than sensors zzso zzso We show that when sources are very sparse in time and overlapped at some locations, they can be recovered even with very low zzso ratio, and by using many fewer sensors than zzso A theoretical analysis based on zzso zzso tools is included showing strong connections with zzso in related areas of research such as zzso zzso zzso and sparse representation of data with zzso zzso Our zzso uses a zzso approach by modeling sparse signals through zzso random zzso This new model for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We start our analysis for the case of zzso sources zzso which allows us to simplify the search of the zzso maximum avoiding a zzso zzso General zzso for overlapped cases, such as zzso and zzso sources, are derived by using the zzso for zzso signals zzso Additionally, a combination of our zzso zzso with the zzso zzso is proposed for zzso the mixing zzso and the sources simultaneously in a real blind zzso A complete set of simulation results is included showing the performance of our zzso
