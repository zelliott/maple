Genome sequencing has revolutionized our view of the relationships among zzso particularly in revealing the zzso effects of lateral genetic transfer zzso zzso techniques have been used to construct zzso trees of microbial zzso Although such trees are easily interpreted and allow the use of a subset of zzso as zzso for the full set, zzso and other phenomena impact the positioning of different groups in zzso trees, zzso and potentially zzso attempts to construct a zzso zzso of zzso Network and graph approaches can reveal complex sets of zzso but applying these techniques to large data sets is a significant zzso Notwithstanding the question of what exactly it might zzso generating and interpreting a Tree or Network of All zzso will only be feasible if current zzso can be improved zzso 

Complex relationships among even the zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso approaches to simplifying large sets of zzso are not alone sufficient to solve the analysis zzso A zzso analysis of zzso zzso bacterial and zzso zzso generated zzso trees for zzso distinct zzso gene zzso The relationships zzso from this set can be heavily dependent on the inclusion of other zzso for example, zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso are recovered as cohesive groups or split depending on the presence of other specific zzso Furthermore, named groups such as zzso zzso and zzso show a multitude of affiliations that are more consistent with their ecology than with small zzso zzso zzso zzso Network and graph representations can illustrate the multitude of conflicting zzso but all methods impose constraints on the input data and create challenges of construction and zzso 

These complex relationships highlight the need for an inclusive approach to zzso data, and current methods with minor zzso will likely scale to allow the analysis of data sets with 10,000 or more zzso The main challenges lie in the zzso and interpretation of zzso zzso and the zzso of microbial zzso when zzso of zzso data are so evidently in conflict with one another, and with the zzso molecular zzso
