We characterized the zzso zzso and quantitative zzso relationship zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso by measuring zzso inward currents using a zzso zzso zzso At membrane zzso between zzso and zzso zzso sodium zzso of zzso transport was zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso for zzso and a Hill zzso of zzso independent of membrane zzso We measured the Imax and zzso for zzso at zzso zzso for the zzso analog drugs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Imax for zzso were dependent on membrane potential (both increasing as the membrane became more zzso for all four zzso zzso also exhibited zzso zzso The quantitative zzso relationship zzso was examined using comparative molecular field analysis and comparative molecular similarity zzso analysis of the inward currents induced by 27 zzso zzso with zzso at both the zzso and the zzso Two statistically significant zzso models identified zzso interaction as the major force in zzso transport and attributed a critical role to the zzso position of zzso zzso zzso hindrance at the zzso and positive charge at the zzso of the zzso ring were favorable for zzso Two zzso zzso models revealed the minimal features required for zzso transport as two hydrogen bond zzso at zzso and zzso and the zzso center occupied by the base zzso
