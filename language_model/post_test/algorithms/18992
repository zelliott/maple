To evaluate the predictability of zzso lens zzso power calculations using the zzso zzso zzso and different zzso power calculation formulas in eyes with a long zzso length zzso 

Department of zzso Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, Taipei, zzso 

This study included 68 eyes with an zzso longer than zzso zzso that had zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso index zzso were obtained with the zzso zzso 1) or, respectively, with zzso ultrasound and automatic zzso zzso zzso The power of the implanted zzso was used to calculate the predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso by various zzso zzso zzso II, and zzso 1 zzso 1 and 2) and zzso zzso zzso The zzso accuracy of the formula was analyzed by comparing the mean difference between the actual and predicted zzso SE; that is, the mean absolute error zzso 

The mean zzso was significantly longer in Group 1 than in Group 2 zzso zzso zzso The zzso calculated by the zzso zzso II, and zzso 1 formulas were comparable between the 2 groups zzso The lowest zzso was obtained using the zzso data in the zzso formula zzso 

Although zzso measured by the zzso was longer than that measured by zzso use of optical or ultrasound zzso data in the zzso zzso II, and zzso 1 formulas resulted in similar accuracy of zzso power prediction in eyes with higher zzso The zzso power calculated using the zzso formula predicted the best zzso outcome in long zzso
