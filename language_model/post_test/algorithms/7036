This article describes an automated system designed to study the complete flexibility functions of the knee in zzso The system allows five degrees of freedom with zzso angle being zzso though adjustable from 0 to 45 zzso zzso corresponding to each of the five motions can be applied independently and in any zzso The effect of weight bearing on knee flexibility can also be studied by including zzso force as one of the five zzso The relative motions are measured with zzso and zzso and the loads are measured with strain zzso zzso The system is digitally controlled with a closed feedback loop, allowing for any combination of programmed zzso A control zzso on an zzso zzso monitors the loads on each axis and continuously adjusts stepping zzso to correctly follow programmed zzso The machine coordinate system zzso to clinically accepted definitions of motion yet retains sequence independence for zzso zzso are presented demonstrating the zzso of using a functional definition of axis placement to align the leg within the zzso zzso are also presented demonstrating the utility of the full flexibility functions of the knee, notably in the determination of significant load interactions between zzso force and zzso torque, and zzso zzso and zzso zzso
