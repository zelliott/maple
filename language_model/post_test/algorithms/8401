A quantitative analysis of experimental data for zzso zzso into the zzso zzso is zzso This analysis reveals that zzso involves a single zzso step, which is zzso to be the release of the signal sequence from the zzso zzso Next, the zzso zzso and power stroke models of zzso are compared against the zzso The data sets are simultaneously fit using a zzso zzso and both models are found to accurately reproduce the experimental zzso A zzso test reveals that the optimal fit of the zzso zzso model, which contains one fewer free zzso does not differ significantly from that of the power stroke zzso zzso the data considered here cannot be used to reject this import zzso The models are further analyzed using the estimated parameters to make zzso testable zzso
