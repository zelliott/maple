Current models of zzso patterning assume that zzso undergo normal, or zzso zzso although the zzso of this assumption has never been zzso Here we argue that the interaction of zzso with the complex zzso surrounding may lead to anomalous zzso We present a zzso model that captures this interaction, and derive the properties of the zzso profile under conditions of anomalous zzso zzso In this context we consider the continuous time random walk zzso and extend its application to account for degradation of zzso zzso We show that within the anomalous diffusion model, zzso profiles are fundamentally distinct from the corresponding zzso zzso zzso were found in several key aspects, including the role of degradation in determining the profile, the rate by which it spreads in time and its long-term zzso We analyze the effect of an abrupt change in the zzso environment on the concentration zzso Furthermore, we discuss the zzso of the zzso distribution to fluctuations in zzso production rate, and describe a feedback mechanism that can buffer such zzso Our study also provides rigorous criteria to distinguish zzso between zzso and anomalous modes of zzso zzso
