To assess diagnostic performance of zzso CT zzso for distinguishing zzso from benign solitary pulmonary zzso zzso 

zzso consecutive subjects with zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso dynamic volume zzso The zzso maximum slope CT zzso analysis was employed to calculate the pulmonary flow zzso zzso flow zzso and zzso index zzso see zzso zzso in zzso parameters between zzso and benign zzso were assessed with zzso diagnosis as the gold zzso zzso value of the zzso parameters was calculated using the zzso characteristic zzso curve zzso 

zzso 56 zzso statistically significant differences in all three zzso parameters were revealed between zzso and benign zzso The zzso demonstrated the biggest difference between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso , zzso The area under the zzso zzso curve was zzso the largest of the three zzso zzso producing a sensitivity of zzso specificity of zzso positive likelihood ratio zzso of zzso and negative likelihood ratio zzso of zzso in identifying zzso 

The zzso derived from the zzso maximum slope CT zzso analysis is a valuable zzso for identifying zzso in zzso zzso may be potentially useful for lung cancer treatment planning and forecasting the therapeutic effect of zzso zzso 

zzso Modern CT equipment offers assessment of vascular parameters of solitary pulmonary zzso zzso zzso zzso vascular supply was investigated to differentiate zzso from benign zzso zzso Different dual vascular supply patterns were found in zzso and benign zzso zzso The zzso index is a useful zzso for differentiate zzso from zzso
