This paper deals with the application of the zzso transport theory in order to zzso zzso Carlo based zzso treatment zzso The technique is applied to zzso zzso zzso zzso where most often mixed beams of zzso and zzso are zzso In normal forward zzso Carlo simulations the particles start at a source and lose energy as they travel towards the region of interest, zzso the designated point of zzso zzso with zzso zzso Carlo simulations, the so-called zzso particles start at the region of interest and gain energy as they travel towards the source where they are zzso In this respect, the particles travel backwards and the real source and real detector become the zzso detector and zzso source, zzso At the zzso zzso an zzso function is obtained with which zzso the same result, zzso dose or flux in the zzso can be derived as with forward zzso zzso In many cases, the zzso method is more efficient and by that is much quicker when, for example, the response in the tumor or organ at risk for many locations and zzso of the treatment beam around the patient is zzso However, a problem occurs when the treatment beam is zzso as the probability of detecting zzso zzso Carlo particles zzso the beam exit zzso plane in zzso zzso in the negative direction of the incident beam is zzso This problem is addressed here and solved first with the use of next event zzso and second with the application of a zzso expansion technique of the angular zzso zzso In the first approach, zzso particles are tracked zzso through a tube to a zzso point detector far away from the geometric zzso The zzso particles will traverse the disk shaped entrance of this tube (the beam exit in the actual zzso zzso This method is slow whenever many events are involved that are not contributing to the point zzso zzso zzso in a scattering zzso In the second approach, zzso particles that traverse an zzso shaped detector plane are used to estimate the zzso zzso for expansion of the angular zzso zzso This provides an estimate of the zzso function for the direction normal to the detector zzso In a realistic head model, as described in this paper, which is surrounded by zzso zzso zzso beams and from which the best ones are to be selected, the example zzso the zzso and gamma zzso in ten tumors and ten zzso at zzso For small diameter beams (5 zzso and with comparable relative zzso forward zzso Carlo is seen to be zzso times faster than the zzso zzso Carlo zzso For larger diameter zzso beams (10 and 15 zzso the zzso technique is found to be 6 and 20 times faster, zzso In the case of zzso alone, for the 10 and 15 zzso zzso beams, both zzso zzso Carlo zzso and point detector techniques are respectively 2 and 3 times faster than forward zzso zzso
