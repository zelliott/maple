The spectrum of disease causing zzso is zzso It just so happens that the overwhelming majority of genetic zzso in the zzso gene with leads to zzso zzso coli generate truncated gene zzso This observation lead to the development of the in zzso synthesis protein zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a sensitive method to detect these truncated gene products from patient zzso This article describes the zzso to detect truncated proteins for the zzso zzso which can also be applied to other disease causing genetic zzso which commonly lead to zzso such in zzso von zzso osteogenesis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B, zzso and Becker muscular zzso
