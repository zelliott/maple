zzso zzso imaging is widely used in research and clinical applications, but this zzso is highly sensitive to zzso We developed an zzso extension of the original diffusion zzso model to account for zzso noise in diffusion zzso imaging using measures of peripheral physiology zzso and zzso the so-called extended zzso zzso Within the framework of the extended zzso model two types of zzso which respectively modeled small zzso and strong zzso variations in the diffusion zzso were derived from peripheral zzso We tested the performance of four extended zzso models with different zzso noise zzso on zzso and gated diffusion zzso imaging data, and compared it to an established zzso robust fitting zzso In the zzso and zzso the extended zzso models reduced the noise in the zzso by up to zzso in accordance with previous studies on zzso zzso The extended zzso model addresses both zzso zzso and zzso zzso The framework of the extended zzso model also zzso further investigation into zzso noise in diffusion zzso zzso The proposed extended zzso model can be readily combined with other zzso correction methods such as robust fitting and zzso current zzso
