A direct method for calculating the average number of replication zzso per zzso in an zzso growing bacterial culture and the fraction of zzso after an zzso treatment of the initiation step is zzso This method has allowed the development of zzso a computer program designed for the resolution of the zzso and simulation of the bacterial zzso zzso Using zzso the following parameters can be zzso average number of replication zzso per zzso time required for the complete replication cycle, average amount of DNA per zzso gene frequency of any zzso locus and zzso zzso The use of this analysis also permits the determination of the zzso or zzso of zzso
