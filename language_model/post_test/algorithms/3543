To determine the optimum duration of follow-up for the assessment of drug efficacy against zzso zzso malaria, 96 trial arms from zzso controlled trials zzso with follow-up of 28 days or longer that were conducted between 1990 and 2003 were zzso These trials enrolled zzso patients, and participating patients comprised zzso of all patients enrolled in zzso over the past 40 years; 61 zzso trial arms were conducted in areas where the rate of malaria transmission was low, and 58 zzso trial arms were supported by zzso zzso to distinguish true zzso from zzso The median overall failure rate reported was zzso zzso 0 to zzso The widely used day 14 assessment had a sensitivity of between 0 and 37% in identifying treatment failures and had no zzso zzso Assessment at day 28 had a sensitivity of zzso overall zzso to zzso in individual zzso but could be used to predict the true failure rate if either zzso zzso was performed zzso zzso zzso or if the entomological zzso rate was zzso In the assessment of drug efficacy against zzso malaria, 28 days should be the minimum period of zzso
