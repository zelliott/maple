Two different studies were conducted to assess the accuracy and precision of an zzso developed for automatic reconstruction of the cerebral zzso from zzso magnetic resonance zzso brain zzso zzso scans of three different brains were used to zzso the precision of the algorithm, and manually selected landmarks on different zzso regions throughout the zzso were used to analyze the accuracy of the three reconstructed zzso zzso central, and zzso We conclude that the zzso can find these surfaces in a robust fashion and with zzso zzso typically with an accuracy of one third of a zzso although this varies with brain region and cortical zzso zzso were adjusted on the basis of this analysis in order to improve the zzso overall zzso
