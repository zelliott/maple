zzso for the management of acute zzso support empirical zzso zzso however, up to half of symptomatic women have negative urine zzso 

To determine whether empirical treatment leads to unnecessary zzso prescriptions in women with symptoms of acute zzso 

A cohort of 231 women zzso as females aged 16 years and zzso presenting to family zzso offices with symptoms of zzso underwent a standardized clinical assessment, urine dip testing, and zzso zzso for urine testing and zzso treatment under 3 empirical strategies were compared with observed physician management and a zzso zzso model for the outcomes of zzso prescriptions, urine culture testing, and unnecessary zzso defined as a prescription where the subsequent urine culture was zzso 

There were 123 positive urine cultures zzso Physicians prescribed antibiotics to 186 women zzso of whom 74 zzso were culture zzso zzso zzso use was similar for 2 guidelines recommending empirical zzso treatment without testing for zzso zzso and zzso Treating women with classic zzso symptoms and zzso would have decreased unnecessary zzso use zzso P zzso but resulted in fewer women with confirmed urinary tract infection receiving immediate antibiotics zzso vs zzso usual care; zzso A derived prediction model incorporating testing for zzso and zzso would also have reduced unnecessary zzso use zzso P zzso but more women with confirmed urinary tract infection would have received immediate antibiotics zzso P zzso 

zzso zzso treatment of acute zzso in women without testing for zzso promotes unnecessary zzso zzso A simple decision rule provides for prompt treatment of infected women while reducing zzso overuse and unnecessary urine zzso
