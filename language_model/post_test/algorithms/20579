The conversion from polar to Cartesian coordinates can be carried out with zzso zzso The paper describes two different methods based on concentric square frames and zzso frames and their results, obtained with accurate zzso based on the zzso window Shannon zzso zzso The embedding of these zzso in direct zzso methods zzso of zzso reconstruction is zzso With respect to zzso methods and to the use of zzso zzso the square frame method makes it possible to carry out the first pass, a zzso zzso in the direct space, before computing zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of clinical images from the raw data of a third-generation zzso zzso are presented and compared with those obtained with zzso zzso and with the zzso zzso method zzso performed by the zzso The simple zzso using square frames yields results in complete agreement with other zzso protocols and the zzso On a zzso computer, the execution of zzso protocols based on zzso and zzso coordinate transformations is 35 to 55 times faster than the zzso and make the zzso attractive for modern zzso
