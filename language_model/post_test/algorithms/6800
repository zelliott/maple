zzso zzso zzso are emerging as the prevalent zzso to apply intensity modulated zzso zzso Both the principle and the particular design of zzso zzso complex constraints on the practically zzso intensity modulated radiation zzso Most zzso the distribution of exposure times across the maximum field outline is either a zzso constant function in the zzso mode or a zzso linear function in the dynamic mode of driving an zzso In view of clinical utility, the total leaf movement should be zzso which requires that zzso constraints be considered in the dose zzso zzso A method is proposed to achieve this for both zzso zzso fields and dynamic leaf zzso zzso The method is an amendment to a generic zzso zzso dose zzso zzso and zzso zzso problems related to the zzso of the zzso constraints, which can cause erratic zzso of a zzso zzso It employs zzso penalty functions to select zzso leaf zzso from the zzso space of the zzso which is limited by specific design zzso Together with an zzso escape mechanism from local zzso the zzso is capable of finding the optimum of an zzso problem as leaf sequences with minimized leaf zzso In particular, the efficiency of zzso zzso can be raised to the levels of zzso fields with very few field zzso thereby increasing the utility of zzso in clinical zzso
