The objective of our study was to investigate the difference of zzso artifacts between the lungs and the chest wall and zzso in Joint Photographic Experts Group zzso zzso zzso chest CT images and to show that a zzso image quality zzso zzso Range Visual zzso zzso zzso reproduce this regional zzso 

Twenty images were compressed zzso and zzso to zzso To analyze the two regions separately zzso and chest wall and zzso the compressed zzso outside each tested region were replaced with the original zzso By comparing the compressed and original images, three zzso independently rated the zzso artifacts as grade 0, none, zzso 1, barely zzso 2, zzso or 3, zzso At each zzso level, the two regions were compared for the readers' responses, peak zzso ratio zzso and zzso zzso zzso signed rank tests and exact tests for paired proportions were used with a p value threshold of zzso 

zzso were rated as lower grades in the lungs than in the chest wall and zzso showing statistical zzso at zzso for reader 1, zzso for reader 2, and zzso for reader zzso Grade 0 was more frequent in the zzso showing statistical zzso at zzso for reader 1 and at zzso for readers 2 and zzso The results of zzso indicated greater artifacts in the lungs zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso results indicated fewer artifacts in the lungs zzso zzso zzso 

Although zzso artifacts are zzso greater in the lungs than in the chest wall and zzso zzso artifact perceptions are the opposite, which can be successfully reproduced by zzso
