The zzso mobility of zzso is determined by transport and diffusion as well as molecular interactions and is crucial for many processes in living zzso zzso of zzso zzso like zzso laser scanning zzso zzso can be used to characterize the zzso distribution of zzso labeled zzso Fluorescence correlation zzso zzso is used to describe zzso transport and zzso processes zzso As an alternative to zzso zzso resolved zzso of zzso can be implemented using a zzso by utilizing the zzso information inscribed into the image by the scan process, referred to as zzso image correlation zzso zzso Here we present and discuss an extended approach, multiple scan speed image correlation zzso zzso which benefits from the advantages of zzso zzso the use of widely available zzso and the extraction of zzso resolved mobility information, without the need of a zzso knowledge of diffusion zzso In addition, zzso covers a broad dynamic range, generates correlation data comparable to zzso zzso and allows to derive two-dimensional maps of diffusion zzso We show the zzso of zzso to zzso in solution and to free zzso in living zzso
