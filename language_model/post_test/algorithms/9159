DNA zzso experiments are conducted in logical sets, such as time course profiling after a treatment is applied to the samples, or comparisons of the samples under two or more zzso Due to cost and design constraints of spotted zzso zzso experiments, each logical set commonly includes only a small number of replicates per zzso Despite the vast improvement of the zzso technology in recent years, missing values are zzso zzso zzso of missing values is best done using many replicates within the same logical zzso In practice, there are few replicates and thus reliable zzso within logical sets is zzso However, it is in the case of few replicates that the presence of missing values, and how they are zzso can have the most profound impact on the outcome of downstream analyses zzso significance analysis and zzso This study explores the feasibility of zzso across logical sets, using the vast amount of publicly available zzso data to improve zzso reliability in the small sample size zzso 

We download all zzso zzso data of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the Stanford zzso zzso Through zzso and zzso we find that, for all three species, our proposed zzso using data from public databases is far superior to zzso within a logical set, sometimes to an astonishing zzso Furthermore, the zzso root mean square error for significant genes is generally a lot less than that of zzso zzso 

Since downstream analysis of significant zzso such as zzso and network analysis, can be very sensitive to small zzso of estimated gene effects, it is highly recommended that researchers apply reliable data zzso prior to further zzso Our method can also be applied to zzso zzso experiments from other species, provided good reference data are zzso
