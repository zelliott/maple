The purpose of this study was to develop a method to monitor the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso using laser zzso contrast zzso The laser zzso contrast measurement system comprised a semiconductor laser, a zzso zzso and a computer-controlled data acquisition zzso A zzso zzso was condensed into a glass tube and zzso using a curing unit, the light intensity of which was adjusted to either 100 or 600 zzso The zzso patterns obtained from the lateral surface of the zzso were monitored using a zzso camera connected to a zzso The zzso images were analyzed using a zzso correlation algorithm, and movements of the pattern were zzso The zzso pattern revealed rapid movement almost immediately after light exposure was zzso and the orientation of zzso zzso is dependent on light zzso When the specimens were zzso at the lower light intensity, the free shrinkage zzso were oriented towards the light zzso On the other hand, when zzso at the higher light intensity, the zzso zzso of these specimens tended to orient towards the bottom zzso The effectiveness of the employed method to determine zzso zzso is thus proven through the results of this zzso
