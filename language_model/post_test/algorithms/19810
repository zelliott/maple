zzso imaging of moving zzso and zzso at microscopic resolutions represents a major challenge in studying the complex biology of live zzso Here we present a technique based on a novel stabilizer setup combined with a gating acquisition zzso for the imaging of a beating zzso heart at the zzso zzso The method allows serial in zzso zzso imaging of the beating heart in live mice in both zzso and zzso modes over the course of several zzso We demonstrate the utility of this technique for in zzso optical zzso and zzso zzso zzso imaging of cardiac zzso The generic method could be adapted to other moving zzso and thus broadly facilitate in zzso microscopic zzso
