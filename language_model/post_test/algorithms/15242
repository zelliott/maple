zzso measures of zzso typically include zzso and pitch match, minimum masking level zzso and residual zzso zzso We previously developed and documented a zzso zzso evaluation system zzso capable of zzso zzso and pitch zzso The zzso was further developed to conduct zzso zzso testing for zzso matching zzso zzso and zzso 

The purpose of the present study was to document the capability of the upgraded zzso to obtain measures of zzso zzso and zzso and to determine the zzso reliability of the responses zzso 

Three zzso zzso testing protocols were developed to conduct zzso For zzso and zzso testing, a zzso zzso band of noise was zzso All testing was repeated during a second zzso 

zzso meeting study criteria were selected from those who had previously been tested for zzso and pitch matching in our zzso A total of 21 subjects completed testing, including seven females and 14 zzso 

The upgraded zzso was found to be fairly time zzso zzso were generally reliable, both within and between sessions, with respect to the type of stimulus they chose as the best match to their zzso zzso to bandwidth was more variable between zzso with greater consistency seen for subjects reporting tonal zzso or zzso noisy zzso than intermediate zzso zzso repeated zzso were within 10 zzso of each other for all but three of the zzso zzso who experienced zzso during zzso 1 tended to be those who experienced it during zzso zzso 

This study may represent the first time that zzso zzso and zzso zzso testing results have been obtained entirely through a zzso zzso system designed specifically for use in the zzso Future plans include refinements to achieve greater testing zzso
