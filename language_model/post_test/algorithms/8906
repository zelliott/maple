We present a signal processing system with virtual zzso of a zzso sensor to detect magnetic flux density for biomedical zzso This system consists of a magnetic field zzso electronic components implemented on a printed circuit board zzso a data acquisition zzso card, and a virtual zzso It allows the development of a zzso zzso with the capacity to filter small electromagnetic interference signals through digital signal zzso The virtual instrument includes an zzso to implement different zzso of infinite impulse response zzso zzso The zzso contains a precision zzso amplifier, a zzso a zzso filter zzso and a buffer with operational zzso The proposed zzso is used for real-time zzso monitoring of magnetic flux density in the zzso cage of zzso The response of the rat respiratory zzso displays a similar behavior as the rat zzso zzso
