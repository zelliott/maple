Variations in electrical zzso over frequency might be used to distinguish zzso cell zzso zzso from benign skin zzso although the patterns that separate the two are zzso zzso neural networks zzso may be good pattern zzso for this zzso A preliminary study to show the potential of neural networks to distinguish benign from zzso skin zzso using electrical zzso is zzso zzso zzso was measured in zzso from 1 zzso to 1 zzso at five virtual depths on 18 zzso and 16 benign or zzso zzso A zzso neural network was trained using back propagation to zzso these zzso Two methods of zzso were used to account for the zzso of normal skin and the size of the zzso one based on zzso the zzso of the zzso relative to adjacent normal skin and one based on zzso the zzso of the zzso independent of size or surrounding normal zzso zzso networks were able to zzso zzso in a test set with zzso accuracy for the first zzso technique and zzso accuracy for the zzso These results indicate electrical zzso may be a promising clinical diagnostic tool for zzso cell zzso or other forms of skin zzso
