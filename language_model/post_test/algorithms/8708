Fluorescence zzso in zzso zzso is treated by a new approach based on calculation of the probability distribution of zzso and zzso zzso chains around a zzso The effect of zzso lattice site dependence zzso correlations of zzso sister chain occupancy of neighbor zzso was modeled by use of zzso Carlo simulations of zzso chain zzso This explicit accounting of site occupancy correlation was found to fit observed zzso behavior better than did a model wherein zzso zzso are considered to be zzso A key aspect of this approach is to evaluate the rate for zzso in a zzso composed of pure zzso zzso In order to evaluate this zzso rate, and also to provide a strong test of the calculated probability zzso we zzso lipids with both zzso chains labeled with a zzso zzso zzso or zzso as well as the more usual zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso derivatives zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso We obtained consistent results with all the zzso and zzso indicating that up to 18 neighboring zzso sites can contribute to zzso corresponding to two shells of zzso sites on a zzso zzso zzso discrete zzso of zzso zzso were converted into zzso lifetimes and compared with zzso and zzso continuous lifetime zzso The zzso zzso theory presented here may be used to explain zzso the zzso of zzso environments in zzso zzso
