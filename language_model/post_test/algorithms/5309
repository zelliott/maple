Previous works on zzso dynamics on complex networks have mostly focused on continuous phase transition from a zzso state to a locally congested state as a zzso such as the zzso rate, is increased through a critical zzso Above the transition point congestion occurs on a small subset of zzso zzso a conventional zzso model based on the packet zzso process and more importantly, taking into account the fact that in realistic networks zzso have only finite zzso we find an abrupt transition from free flow to complete zzso zzso below the transition point, the network can support the maximum amount of traffic for some optimal value of the zzso zzso We develop a zzso theory to explain the surprising transition phenomenon and provide zzso zzso Furthermore, we propose a control strategy based on the idea of random packet dropping to zzso complete zzso Our finding provides insights into realistic communication networks where complete congestion can occur directly from a zzso state without any apparent zzso and our control strategy can be effective to restore traffic flow once complete congestion has zzso
