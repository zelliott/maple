A zzso alcohol challenge protocol was used to study genetic influences on the acute adaptation of the zzso to alcohol in 53 zzso and 38 same-sex zzso Caucasian twin pairs averaging 30 years of zzso Equal doses of alcohol were administered at 10:00 and zzso zzso yielding mean peak breath alcohol zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso resting zzso was recorded four times: at zzso on the ascending limb of the overall experiment at a breath alcohol concentration zzso near zzso on the descending limb at a zzso near the value when the zzso zzso was obtained on the ascending zzso and, finally, when the zzso fell to zzso zzso analyses of zzso values of total spectral power zzso and spectral band power zzso were performed on zzso zzso averaged across all 17 scalp lead zzso After adjusting for body weight, a significant fraction of population zzso in zzso was attributable to genetic zzso zzso values for zzso were zzso zzso and zzso at the three zzso zzso recordings, zzso Similar findings zzso to each zzso at each zzso recording, except zzso delta zzso The change in zzso zzso power was examined for evidence that genes influence acute adaptations in brain zzso zzso limb zzso was zzso by the zzso ascending limb zzso to minimize zzso effects that can influence both zzso Earlier analyses of the same zzso initial zzso response to alcohol noted a substantial increase in the ascending limb zzso power, compared with zzso Thus, positive values of the zzso change zzso a progression away from baseline attributable to acute zzso to zzso negative values signify a return toward baseline values suggesting acute tolerance to zzso zzso analysis of the zzso difference in zzso had a highly significant zzso value of zzso indicating that both acute tolerance and acute zzso to alcohol may represent adaptations reflecting substantial zzso zzso zzso smaller, but significant values of zzso for the zzso difference in zzso were observed for zzso zzso and zzso frequency zzso In contrast, zzso for the differences between the final and ascending limb zzso power were not zzso except for the zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso may have contributed to detection of genetic influences on acute adaptation, but represent a potential confound only in the zzso zzso
