zzso zzso reduction zzso was developed as a method for detecting statistical patterns of zzso The overall goal of zzso is to change the representation space of the data to make interactions easier to zzso It is well known that machine learning methods may not provide robust models when the class variable zzso zzso zzso is zzso and accuracy is used as the fitness zzso This is because most methods learn patterns that are relevant for the larger of the two zzso The goal of this study was to evaluate three different strategies for improving the power of zzso to detect zzso in zzso zzso The methods evaluated were: zzso zzso that zzso with replacement the smaller class until the data are zzso zzso zzso that randomly removes subjects from the larger class until the data are zzso and zzso balanced accuracy zzso as the fitness function with and without an adjusted zzso These three methods were compared using simulated data with zzso zzso interactions of varying zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and minor zzso frequency zzso zzso that were embedded in 100 replicate zzso of varying sample sizes zzso zzso zzso Each zzso was generated with different ratios of cases to controls (1 : 1, 1 : 2, 1 : zzso We found that the balanced accuracy function with an adjusted threshold significantly outperformed both zzso and zzso and fully recovered the zzso These results suggest that balanced accuracy should be used instead of accuracy for the zzso analysis of zzso in zzso zzso
