The highest level in the hierarchy of protein structure and folding is the formation of protein complexes through zzso zzso We have made modifications to a well established computer lattice model to expand its zzso to zzso zzso and zzso Based on zzso zzso we implement translation and rotation moves of two zzso chains relative to each other, in addition to the zzso motions already present in the zzso We use this zzso model to study the folding dynamics of the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso The calculated heat capacity zzso agree well with experimental zzso Free energy landscapes and median first passage times for the folding process are calculated and zzso zzso measured characteristics such as the multistate nature of the zzso zzso
