This correspondence considers the stability problem for a class of linear switched systems with zzso delay in the sense of zzso convex zzso The bound of zzso of the zzso delay can be an unknown zzso It is concluded that the stability result for linear switched systems still holds for such systems with zzso delay under a certain delay zzso Moreover, the delay bound of guaranteeing system stability can be easily obtained based on linear zzso zzso zzso As a special case, when the zzso delay becomes constant, the criterion obtained in this correspondence is less conservative than existing zzso The reason for less zzso is also explicitly explained in this zzso zzso examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed zzso
