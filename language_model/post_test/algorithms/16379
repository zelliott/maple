In the past decade, significant progress has been made in protein structure zzso However, refining models to a level of resolution that is comparable with experimental results and can be used in studies like zzso activity still remains a major zzso We have previously demonstrated that our modular zzso energy function, uniquely involving a potential of mean force description for zzso zzso works well in protein zzso structure prediction and loop zzso In this work, we couple zzso energy function with our global zzso method zzso zzso with soft constraints and use them to refine a collection of template models from submitted predictions to recent Critical Assessment of zzso for zzso zzso zzso blind prediction zzso A prediction protocol based on a selection of structures with the lowest energy is able to successfully refine all of the test zzso and, more importantly, our energy function does not show degradation in prediction when sampling is zzso
