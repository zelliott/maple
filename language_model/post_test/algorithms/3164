Common structural biology methods zzso zzso and molecular zzso often produce ensembles of molecular zzso zzso averaging of zzso coordinates of molecular structures zzso and zzso is a frequent approach to obtain a consensus structure that is representative of the zzso However, when the structures are zzso artifacts can result in unrealistic local zzso including zzso bond lengths and zzso 

zzso we describe a method to derive representative structures while limiting the number of zzso Our approach is based on a zzso Carlo simulation technique that drives a starting structure (an extended or a zzso zzso towards the zzso zzso using a harmonic zzso energy zzso To assess the performance of the algorithm, we applied our approach to C alpha models of zzso proteins generated by the zzso structure prediction zzso The average zzso of the refined model from the native structure for the set becomes worse by a mere zzso A compared to the average zzso of the averaged structures from the native structure zzso A for refined structures and zzso A for the averaged zzso However, the percentage of atoms involved in clashes is greatly reduced (from zzso to zzso in fact, the majority of the refined proteins had zero zzso Moreover, a small number zzso of refined structures resulted in lower zzso to the native protein versus the averaged zzso Finally, compared to zzso 1, our approach produces representative structure of similar zzso quality, but with much fewer zzso 

The zzso results demonstrate that our approach for removing averaging artifacts can be very beneficial for the structural biology zzso Furthermore, the same approach can be applied to almost any problem where averaging of zzso coordinates is zzso zzso structure averaging is also commonly performed in zzso secondary prediction 2, which could also benefit from our zzso
