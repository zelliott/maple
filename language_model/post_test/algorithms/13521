zzso caused by zzso zzso belongs to the most prevalent food-borne zzso diseases throughout the zzso zzso zzso identification for all zzso cases of zzso infection is important for zzso zzso As a standard, the traditional culture method zzso zzso is used to identify zzso Classical zzso takes 4-5 days to be completed, it is zzso expensive and more than 250 zzso zzso are necessary to characterize more than 2,500 zzso zzso currently zzso These technical difficulties could be overcome with modern molecular zzso We developed a zzso based zzso zzso for the most prevalent zzso zzso in Europe and North zzso The current zzso version could theoretically discriminate 28 zzso and 86 zzso Additionally, we included 77 targets analyzing zzso resistance zzso The zzso zzso was evaluated with a set of zzso reference strains representing 132 zzso previously zzso by conventional zzso through various reference zzso 117 of 132 zzso tested zzso showed an unique zzso zzso 15 of 132 zzso generated a pattern which was shared by multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These shared patterns mainly resulted from the high similarity of the zzso of zzso A and zzso Using patterns of the known reference zzso a database was build which represents the basis of a new zzso software that can zzso unknown zzso zzso zzso After zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso was used to identify a field panel of 105 zzso zzso All were identified as zzso and 93 of 105 zzso zzso were typed in full zzso with conventional zzso This zzso based zzso is a powerful tool for zzso
