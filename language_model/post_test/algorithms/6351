The meanwhile established generation of zzso CT systems enables routine zzso imaging at short zzso zzso Clinical progress in the development of zzso row CT zzso technology beyond 16 slices can more likely be expected from further improvement in spatial and zzso resolution rather than from a mere increase in the speed of volume zzso We present an evaluation of a recently introduced zzso CT system zzso zzso 64, zzso zzso zzso zzso which uses a periodic motion of the focal spot in zzso direction zzso focal zzso to double the number of simultaneously acquired zzso This technique acquires 64 overlapping zzso zzso slices per zzso The sampling scheme zzso to that of a 64 zzso zzso zzso zzso with the goal of improved zzso resolution and reduced spiral zzso After an introduction to the detector design, we discuss the basics of zzso focal spot technology zzso We present phantom and zzso scans for performance zzso The measured full zzso at half maximum zzso of the thinnest spiral slice is zzso zzso All spiral slice zzso are almost independent of the pitch, with zzso of less than zzso zzso from the nominal zzso Using a high-resolution bar pattern phantom zzso Phantom Laboratories, Salem, zzso the zzso resolution can be demonstrated to be up to 15 zzso at the zzso independent of the pitch, corresponding to a bar diameter of zzso zzso zzso resolution is only slightly zzso for off-center zzso At a distance of 100 zzso from the zzso 14 zzso can be resolved in the zzso corresponding to a bar diameter of zzso zzso zzso zzso artifacts presenting as zzso and zzso structures around zzso edges are effectively reduced by the zzso focal spot zzso zzso scanning benefits from the short zzso rotation time of zzso zzso providing up to 83 zzso zzso resolution with zzso zzso zzso
