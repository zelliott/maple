zzso of hospitals by lay media has attracted widespread attention but may not accurately reflect zzso Acute zzso zzso zzso mortality is a straightforward measure of clinical outcome frequently used by ranking zzso 

Our aim was to assess whether ranking among top hospitals correlated with lower zzso zzso mortality following admission for zzso 

Using a zzso zzso model and the comprehensive nationwide database of hospital zzso admissions from 2004 to 2007 in France, we zzso crude and zzso hospital mortality rates in the ranked zzso hospitals versus zzso zzso We subsequently restricted the comparison to zzso hospitals with matching on-site zzso 

We zzso zzso admissions in zzso hospitals, 43 of which were in the ranked zzso Patients admitted to the zzso zzso hospitals tended to be older with more zzso and underwent fewer zzso procedures than patients admitted to ranked zzso Between hospital differences accounted for zzso of differences in zzso Crude mortality was lower in ranked versus zzso hospitals zzso zzso zzso zzso The survival advantage associated with admission to ranked hospitals was reduced after adjustment for age and sex zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Ranked hospitals have similar adjusted zzso mortality rates to those not ranked and patient characteristics rather than hospital differences account for the variation in zzso
