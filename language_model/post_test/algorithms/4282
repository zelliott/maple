Since the publication of zzso zzso and zzso zzso paper on the reaction zzso of the zzso zzso in 1913, molecular biology has evolved zzso New measurement techniques allow in zzso characterization of the whole zzso zzso or zzso of cells, whereas the classical zzso essay only allows determination of the two zzso parameters V and zzso Nevertheless, zzso zzso are still commonly used, not only in the in zzso context of zzso characterization but also as a rate law for zzso reactions in larger zzso reaction zzso In this review, we give an overview of the historical development of kinetic rate laws originating from zzso zzso over the past 100 zzso Furthermore, we briefly zzso the experimental techniques used for the characterization of zzso and discuss web resources that systematically store kinetic parameters and related zzso Finally, describe the novel opportunities that arise from using these data in dynamic mathematical zzso In this zzso traditional in zzso approaches may be combined with modern zzso zzso to foster thorough understanding of the underlying complex zzso
