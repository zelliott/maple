We consider zzso modeled chemical reaction systems with zzso zzso and prove that a zzso stationary distribution exists for each closed, zzso subset of the state space if an analogous zzso modeled system with zzso zzso admits a complex balanced zzso zzso zzso zero zzso then implies that such a distribution exists so long as the corresponding chemical network is zzso zzso and has a zzso of zzso The main zzso of the stationary distribution for the zzso modeled system is a complex balanced equilibrium value for the corresponding zzso modeled zzso We also zzso our main result to some zzso zzso
