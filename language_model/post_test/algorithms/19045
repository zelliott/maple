There are many current applications of the zzso random walk zzso particularly in describing kinetic and transport processes in different chemical and zzso zzso We derive exact solutions for the zzso zzso of the zzso for zzso zzso one-dimensional zzso in an infinite space and in the presence of an absorbing zzso The former is used to produce exact results for the zzso zzso of the first two moments of the displacement of the random zzso the zzso behavior of the moments as zzso and the effective diffusion zzso We show that in the infinite space, the zzso zzso a relation that can be interpreted as a generalized fluctuation zzso since it reduces to the conventional fluctuation zzso at large zzso Based on the zzso transform of the zzso in the presence of an absorbing boundary, we derive the zzso transform of the survival probability of the random zzso which is then used to find the mean lifetime for terminated zzso of the random zzso
