Recent studies have shown that many promising new drug candidates were abandoned due to poor zzso properties zzso zzso it is important to predict the zzso of compounds during the early stages of drug zzso The volume of distribution zzso is one of the most important zzso zzso When considered along with systemic zzso the zzso determines the biological zzso which is used for designing suitable dosage regimens and rational zzso At present, the methods used to predict zzso include zzso the zzso of animal data, zzso zzso based zzso zzso modeling and zzso in zzso approaches that employ quantitative zzso relationships zzso In this article, the latest progress in the field of zzso prediction is summarized in terms of the above three areas, respectively, and these approaches are expected to be valuable for screening new drugs during the early stages of drug discovery and zzso
