The present research was directed towards fabrication of zzso zzso oral zzso A zzso full zzso design was employed for zzso using zzso to zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso and zzso fraction of zzso cellulose zzso as independent zzso The percentage drug released in 1 h zzso and the time required to release zzso of the drug zzso were selected as dependent zzso zzso blend of zzso and zzso was used as a zzso to facilitate the drug distribution in zzso The zzso batch containing 50 zzso zzso 160 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 220 zzso zzso cellulose was formulated by overlapping the zzso plots of zzso and zzso The responses zzso and zzso of zzso batch were zzso and 520 zzso zzso The zzso of drug release was best explained by zzso zzso The results of artificial neural network were superior in prediction power than the zzso design for both the responses zzso and zzso
