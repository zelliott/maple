To develop and evaluate a model for describing the zzso zzso and zzso zzso phase in the presence of zzso frequency zzso and to evaluate the performance of a novel zzso zzso echo zzso 

Using the extended phase graph model, a linear phase term was added to the evolution of zzso zzso An approximation for the total zzso phase was derived with one fit zzso zzso which serves as an effective lifetime of the zzso zzso The model was evaluated using synthetic and in zzso phase evolution zzso In addition, a novel zzso phase correction scheme for the zzso sequence was applied to zzso data, and the number of activated zzso before and after phase correction was zzso 

The zzso of zzso and zzso signals are significantly different from each zzso The proposed zzso phase model provided a good description of the measured phase evolution data, and the approximate model for the zzso phase provided both at good fit to the data, as well as an effective lifetime of the zzso zzso In some subjects the phase contribution from older pathways was zzso In the zzso data, a twofold increase of the number of activated zzso for the zzso signal was observed, compared to no correction and a conventional zzso echo zzso 

The different phase evolution of zzso and zzso signals can be zzso described by the proposed model, and zzso phase history effects are significant at 7 zzso when not appropriately zzso
