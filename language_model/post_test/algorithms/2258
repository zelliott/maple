A simple zzso for the calculation of multiple site zzso zzso is zzso It is based on a zzso of two zzso zzso zzso a modified zzso zzso procedure zzso and zzso zzso zzso 11, zzso and zzso the zzso zzso The sites characterized by strong zzso zzso were selected for statistical mechanical treatment, whereas all other sites were treated by means of the modified zzso zzso The selection of the two sets was made on the basis of a criterion related to the interaction energy between the zzso sites in the protein zzso The zzso was tested for bovine pancreatic zzso inhibitor and the zzso values calculated were discussed in the light of experimental data and theoretical results obtained by other zzso The zzso can easily be coded and incorporated into any program package for the calculation of zzso interactions in zzso
