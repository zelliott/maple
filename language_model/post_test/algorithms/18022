zzso differences exist in zzso zzso beam delivery with a zzso accelerator system when compared to zzso therapy with a conventional linear zzso zzso of zzso with a zzso accelerator is governed by a magnet zzso cycle zzso zzso synchronization of the magnet zzso cycle pattern with the respiratory motion pattern is critical to the efficiency of zzso zzso zzso There has been little systematic analysis to zzso the zzso operational parameters to improve gated treatment zzso The goal of this study was to estimate the overall efficiency of zzso zzso zzso zzso through realistic zzso Using 62 respiratory motion traces from 38 patients, we simulated respiratory gating for duty cycles of zzso zzso and zzso around peak exhalation for various fixed and variable magnet zzso zzso In each case, the time required to deliver 100 monitor units in both zzso and gated zzso scenarios was zzso Based on results from this study, the minimum time required to deliver 100 zzso was zzso zzso for zzso zzso For zzso delivery at a zzso duty cycle around peak zzso corresponding average delivery times were typically three times longer with a fixed magnet zzso cycle zzso However, when a variable zzso cycle was allowed in zzso with the patient's respiratory cycle, the treatment time only zzso Thus, zzso delivery of zzso zzso zzso zzso is feasible and more efficient when a variable magnet zzso cycle pattern is zzso
