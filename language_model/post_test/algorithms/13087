zzso chemists zzso zzso of molecules by attaching functional groups to zzso There is evidence suggesting that some scaffolds yield biologically active molecules more than others, these are termed privileged zzso One role of the scaffold is to present its zzso for molecular recognition, and biologically relevant scaffolds may present zzso in biologically relevant zzso or zzso Since drug discovery is primarily focused on the discovery of compounds that bind to zzso targets, we have been deciphering the scaffold shapes that are used for binding proteins as they reflect biologically relevant zzso To decipher the scaffold architecture that is important for binding protein surfaces, we have analyzed the scaffold architecture of protein zzso which are defined in this context as continuous four zzso segments of a protein chain that are not part of an zzso or zzso secondary zzso zzso are an important molecular recognition motif of zzso We have found that 39 clusters reflect the scaffold architecture of zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso with average zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso These protein loop scaffolds all have distinct zzso We have used these 39 clusters that reflect the scaffold architecture of protein zzso as biological zzso This involved generation of a small zzso of zzso zzso We found that zzso scaffolds with reported biological activities matched loop scaffold zzso and those zzso scaffolds with no reported biologically activities did zzso This preliminary evidence suggests that organic scaffolds with tight matches to the preferred loop scaffolds of zzso implies the likelihood of the scaffold to be biologically zzso
