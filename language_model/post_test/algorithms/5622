Linear zzso zzso relations, also known as linear free energy relations, are widely observed in chemical zzso including protein zzso zzso zzso and channel zzso Despite the widespread occurrence of linear zzso relations, the principles underlying the linear relation between changes in zzso and equilibrium energy in zzso reactions remain zzso When examining zzso regulation of zzso channel gating in zzso zzso we noted that the gating process could be described by a linear zzso relation with a simple geometric zzso This description is possible because the gating process provides a zzso reaction, in which structural changes in a zzso model protein can be studied at the zzso zzso It is thus possible to obtain quantitative information about the zzso of the reaction transition state and its position on a spatial zzso It turns out that the linear zzso relation for the zzso zzso reaction can be zzso and the quantitative relation between changes in zzso energy and equilibrium energy can be zzso by considering the effects of zzso on the changes in zzso elastic energy associated with channel zzso We are not aware that a similar simple zzso explanation of a linear zzso relation has been provided for a chemical reaction in a zzso zzso relations generally should be useful for examining how zzso changes in zzso properties zzso membrane protein folding and function, and for distinguishing between direct zzso due to zzso and indirect zzso zzso
