Random walk computer simulations are an important tool in understanding magnetic resonance zzso in porous zzso In this paper we focus on the description of zzso field zzso spin echo zzso experiments that measure the zzso zzso that a zzso water zzso will travel a distance R in a time zzso Because zzso simulations are often limited by statistical considerations, we will see that valuable insight can be gained by working with simple periodic zzso and comparing simulation data to the results of exact zzso zzso In this connection, our attention will be focused on zzso the zzso zzso and time dependent zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that a zzso particle will return to within delta R of the origin after time zzso
