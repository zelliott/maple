To explore whether the improvement of zzso profile and zzso control observed in zzso control trials with zzso zzso is zzso under conditions of general clinical zzso 

We studied zzso patients with type 2 diabetes zzso not adequately controlled by zzso on either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of a second drug, according to the treating zzso choice, resulted in three groups, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso + zzso followed for twelve months, while efficacy and safety parameters were measured at zzso at six and at twelve zzso 

A total of zzso zzso patients completed the zzso zzso control and zzso profile improved in all three groups, but the improvement was always greater in the two zzso zzso At 12 months zzso zzso and zzso zzso groups compared to zzso + zzso showed greater increase in HDL cholesterol zzso and zzso versus zzso p zzso zzso and greater decrease in zzso zzso and zzso versus zzso p zzso zzso for zzso in zzso zzso and zzso versus zzso p zzso zzso and in LDL cholesterol zzso and zzso versus zzso p zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso All changes were greater in patients already taking zzso zzso As zzso was an zzso study, the major limitation is the introduction of zzso bias which, however, was accounted for in the statistical zzso 

Since improvement of both zzso control and zzso profile are considered main targets in the management of the diabetic patient, the results of the present study, conducted under conditions of everyday clinical practice, show that zzso may be considered a potential choice for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, when lifestyle and zzso zzso
