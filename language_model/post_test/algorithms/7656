zzso extraction and zzso of the spinal zzso intensity varying and elliptical zzso structure under strong neighboring zzso are extremely zzso This study proposes the zzso competition zzso technique to perform spinal zzso zzso extraction and zzso The contribution of the proposed method is zzso The zzso competition zzso compares the image zzso obtained at different detection scales to suppress neighboring zzso It reliably recognizes the zzso and zzso of elliptical zzso zzso 2) The orientation zzso zzso analyzes the detection responses offered by the zzso competition zzso It zzso structure orientation consistency to sustain strong zzso introduced by high contrast neighboring objects to perform zzso zzso 3) The intensity zzso zzso zzso the intensity difference between the zzso and the zzso in the vicinity of the zzso It effectively removes the object intensity variation along the structure to accurately delineate the target zzso They constitute the zzso competition zzso method which can robustly and accurately detect the zzso and boundary of the spinal zzso It is validated and compared using 25 clinical zzso It is demonstrated that the proposed method well suits the applications of spinal zzso zzso extraction and zzso
