Gene expression profiles have great potential for accurate tumor zzso It is expected to enable us to diagnose tumors precisely and zzso and also bring the researchers of machine learning two challenges, the curse of zzso and the small sample size zzso We propose a zzso learning based zzso reduction zzso named zzso local zzso embedding zzso and apply it to tumor zzso Comparing with the classical local zzso embedding zzso zzso aims to obtain an zzso linear projection zzso by solving an zzso zzso After being projected into a zzso zzso by zzso the data points of the same class maintain their intrinsic neighbor relations, whereas the neighboring points of the different classes are far from each zzso Experimental results on a public tumor zzso validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed zzso
