This study introduces an improved hybrid zzso zzso zzso potential for zzso zzso calculations which is very accurate, yet without high zzso zzso The method uses harmonic zzso calculations with the zzso potential to construct an improved zzso potential by coordinate zzso This improved zzso potential is used for the zzso zzso zzso The method was tested zzso for four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Very good agreement with experiment was zzso For most of the systems, the more accurate harmonic treatment considerably improved the zzso zzso zzso
