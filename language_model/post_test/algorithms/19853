zzso facial zzso in zzso Surgery zzso has an approximate zzso of zzso in the trauma patient and in zzso zzso The treatment of acute life-threatening zzso in MFS to prevent zzso shock or airway obstruction forms the basis of emergency care and zzso the need for further analysis given the multitude of options proposed for zzso A systematic review of the literature was undertaken to formulate an evidence-based approach to the treatment of life-threatening zzso in zzso 

A comprehensive search of journal articles was performed using zzso and zzso zzso zzso and phrases used were zzso threatening facial zzso zzso threatening facial zzso zzso carotid artery zzso and zzso carotid artery zzso Our search yielded zzso zzso In an attempt to focus on zzso exclusively from traumatic and operative events, articles that cited zzso disorders as the underlying cause of bleeding were excluded from the zzso There were 40 articles which met the full inclusion criteria and form the basis of this systematic zzso The articles were rated based on the level of zzso There was 1 Level II, 21 Level III, 12 Level IV, and 6 Level V zzso 

Seven Level III evidence-based studies noted a high association between zzso injuries, particularly zzso III fractures and massive zzso zzso One Level II study, 8 Level III studies, and 3 Level IV studies concluded that the internal zzso artery was most frequently associated with intractable zzso zzso One Level II, 16 Level III, 3 Level IV, and 3 Level V articles cited anterior and zzso zzso packing and conservative measures as the first attempt to manage traumatic zzso zzso 8 Level III studies zzso the importance of temporary reduction of facial fractures as an effective means to control massive zzso early in the zzso Seven Level III studies, 4 Level IV, and 2 Level V studies documented the importance of zzso of arteries as one of the absolute measures to manage facial zzso whereas 1 Level II, 14 Level III, 2 Level IV, and 3 Level V studies zzso to zzso as the most reliable technique for control of the zzso In zzso surgery, the internal zzso artery was most frequently the source of massive zzso according to 2 Level III, 4 Level IV, and 1 Level V zzso Two Level III, 5 Level IV, and 1 Level V study proposed packing as the first attempt to zzso the zzso Two Level IV and 1 Level V study cited zzso as a potentially life-threatening vascular complication after zzso zzso 

Management of facial zzso should be performed in a sequential and consistent manner to zzso zzso An evidence-based zzso for zzso and zzso life-threatening zzso in MFS based on this critical review of the literature is presented and zzso
