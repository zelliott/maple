To zzso evaluate the significance of zzso peak in in zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso for the diagnosis of zzso zzso in patients with solid zzso tumors exhibiting totally or partially low signal intensity on zzso zzso 

MR zzso was performed in patients with zzso diagnosed zzso tumors at zzso zzso zzso MR zzso data were collected from a single square volume of interest that zzso the zzso zzso The zzso concentration level was classified into three classes zzso zzso zzso 

A total of 20 zzso tumors in 20 patients were evaluated in this zzso High zzso peak was observed in all seven zzso whereas low zzso peak was observed in only one zzso in 13 zzso tumors (six benign zzso tumors and seven zzso zzso zzso The presence of zzso peak for the diagnosis of zzso had a sensitivity of zzso specificity of zzso positive zzso value of zzso and negative zzso value of zzso 

The high zzso peak reflecting abundant zzso zzso contents is considered a specific zzso concentration for zzso zzso of high zzso peak may contribute to the diagnosis of zzso in distinguishing from other benign zzso zzso tumors or zzso zzso zzso
