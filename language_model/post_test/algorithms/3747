To investigate the fluorescent characteristics of different zzso zzso 

Fresh ex zzso zzso tissue was surfaced scanned with a zzso zzso zzso zzso were evaluated via zzso zzso 

zzso ratios of all zzso were found to be significantly different from each other zzso zzso zzso The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of fluorescent zzso was zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and 59% for zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso for normal zzso zzso 

Fluorescent zzso can been used to identify significant differences in the fluorescent characteristics of various zzso zzso 

This study is the first investigation of the zzso of zzso zzso The diagnostic ability of fluorescent zzso may allow it to be used as a zzso aid for fine needle zzso using optical fiber zzso Further investigations may enhance the sensitivity and specificity of fluorescent zzso allowing it to replace or compliment fine needle zzso
