This paper describes a redundant robot arm that is capable of learning to reach for targets in space in a zzso fashion while avoiding zzso zzso movement commands that activate correlated zzso spatial and motor information are used to learn forward and inverse zzso control models while moving in zzso space using the zzso zzso zzso Unlike prior zzso models, the learning process in this work was realized using an online zzso zzso learning zzso The zzso zzso controller is fault tolerant and can handle a wide range of zzso such as joint zzso and the use of tools despite not having experienced them during zzso The zzso model was extended based on a novel zzso obstacle avoidance direction zzso model to enable redundant robots to avoid obstacles in environments with simple obstacle zzso However, certain zzso of obstacles in the environment prevented the robot from reaching the target with purely zzso obstacle zzso To address this complexity, a zzso process of mental rehearsals of movements was zzso inspired by human and animal experiments on zzso to generate plans for movement execution using zzso in complex zzso These mental rehearsals or plans are zzso by using the zzso zzso zzso to retrieve multiple solutions for reaching each target while accounting for all the obstacles in its zzso The key aspects of the proposed novel controller were illustrated first using simple zzso zzso were then performed on real robot platforms to demonstrate successful obstacle avoidance during reaching tasks in real-world zzso
