This paper introduces an effective technique for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso The technique is based on a new class of zzso discrete zzso transform zzso The performance of zzso zzso zzso is measured by its ability to minimize distortion while retaining all clinically significant features of the zzso The percent zzso square difference zzso is used as an accepted standard for measuring the signal zzso However, there is no standard for measuring the clinically significant features retained after signal zzso The zzso of the zzso are calculated such that the square of the difference between the original signal and the reconstructed one is minimum in least mean square zzso The resulting zzso deal with signals of arbitrary zzso that means the signal length is not restricted to be a multiple of power of zzso zzso results comparing the performance of the constructed zzso transform with that of zzso and zzso zzso zzso transform are zzso These results show that, independent of signal zzso the decomposition of the signal up to the fourth level is sufficient for getting minimum zzso In addition, the proposed technique yields the lowest zzso compared to the other two zzso and for a zzso ratio less than 10 the optimal transform can be obtained for only one zzso zzso However, for a higher zzso ratio the zzso is smaller for long zzso
