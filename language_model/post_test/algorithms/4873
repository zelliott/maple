Our goal was to evaluate whether an zzso pressure is effective in sleep zzso syndrome zzso patients requiring continuous positive airway pressure zzso 

zzso patients with an zzso index zzso were selected for a parallel group zzso study including an zzso laboratory acute phase and a zzso chronic zzso After baseline zzso patients had a second night zzso either with zzso at the zzso pressure, followed by home treatment at this pressure without any correction or adjustment zzso group), or with zzso zzso followed by home treatment at the pressure judged to be optimal from the zzso zzso zzso The primary outcome was the change in zzso zzso scale zzso at 6 zzso 

The calculated pressure zzso zzso was zzso zzso in the calculation group zzso while the optimal pressure was zzso zzso in the zzso group zzso During the zzso treatment at home, the zzso decreased from zzso zzso to zzso zzso in the calculation group zzso and from zzso zzso to zzso zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso difference not zzso 

In these zzso patients with moderate zzso treated with zzso we found no difference in effectiveness between an zzso pressure and an zzso zzso
