Gene zzso plays an important role in the evolution of zzso and zzso zzso how evolution after gene zzso zzso at the sequence and network level is of great zzso In this work, we analyze a data set of gene pairs that arose through zzso zzso zzso in zzso All these pairs have the same zzso time, making them ideal for evolutionary zzso We investigated the interplay between evolution after zzso at the sequence and network levels and correlated these two levels of divergence with gene expression and fitness zzso We find that molecular interactions involving zzso genes evolve at rates that are three orders of magnitude slower than the rates of evolution of the corresponding zzso Furthermore, we find that divergence of zzso pairs zzso strongly with gene expression and fitness zzso Because of the role of gene zzso in determining zzso in biological systems and particularly at the network level, we investigated the role of interaction networks in zzso the evolutionary fate of duplicated zzso We find that gene neighborhoods in interaction networks provide a mechanism for zzso these zzso and we developed an zzso for achieving this zzso Further zzso analysis of zzso pairs zzso by their zzso evolutionary fates demonstrated the utility of these zzso Finally, we find that zzso pairs and other pairs of zzso genes of small-scale zzso origin share similar properties, giving good support for zzso our results from zzso pairs to evolution after gene zzso in zzso
