zzso patient registration may significantly affect the outcome of zzso surgery zzso zzso registration approaches have several advantages over the currently dominant zzso direct contact methods and are used in some industry solutions in zzso radiation therapy with fixed X-ray zzso However, technical challenges including geometric zzso and zzso cost have precluded their use with mobile zzso for zzso We propose a zzso registration framework for zzso patient registration using a conventional mobile X-ray zzso combining zzso zzso tracking and graphics processing unit zzso The zzso framework 1) acquires X-ray images and estimates relative pose between the images using a custom-made zzso zzso and 2) estimates the patient pose using zzso zzso zzso Experimental zzso using a publicly available gold standard zzso a plastic bone phantom and zzso specimens have been zzso The mean target registration error zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rate: zzso registration time: zzso zzso for the phantom with two images zzso apart, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso with images zzso zzso The experimental results showed the feasibility of the proposed registration framework as a practical alternative for zzso zzso
