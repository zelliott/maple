zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exerts important effects on numerous neurological zzso Although zzso is known to respond to zzso zzso zzso and the crystal structures of the zzso zzso zzso of several zzso have been determined, the zzso zzso and structural zzso of zzso signaling in the zzso zzso family remain zzso Here, we identify a novel zzso site in the zzso zzso using a recently developed zzso zzso This predicted site zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso side chain of the zzso zzso zzso is situated in the hinge region in the zzso of zzso adjacent to the reported zzso site, with zzso involved in both zzso and calcium zzso zzso studies indicated that binding of zzso and zzso to their distinct but partially overlapping binding sites zzso modulated zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso site completely abolished zzso signaling while leaving its zzso capability largely zzso zzso the predicted zzso zzso abolished or significantly reduced the sensitivity of zzso not only to zzso and zzso but also, in some cases, to zzso The dual zzso of zzso by zzso and zzso has important implications for the zzso of other zzso zzso and related zzso It also opens up new avenues for developing zzso zzso of zzso function that target specific human zzso
