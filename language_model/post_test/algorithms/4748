zzso elevated zzso activity has been identified as the zzso correlate of working zzso It is generally assumed in the literature and in zzso and theoretical models of working memory that zzso activity is stable and zzso however, this assumption may be an artifact of the averaging of data collected across trials, and needs experimental zzso In this study, we introduce a zzso scheme to characterize the firing frequency trends of cells recorded from the zzso of monkeys during performance of working memory zzso We examine the frequency statistics and zzso of firing during baseline and memory zzso We also study the behavior of cells on individual trials and across trials, and explore the stability of cellular firing during the memory zzso We find that cells from different zzso classes possess markedly different zzso We also find that individual cells show substantial zzso in their firing behavior across trials, and that firing frequency also varies markedly over the course of a single zzso Finally, the average frequency distribution is wider, the magnitude of the frequency increases from baseline to memory smaller, and the magnitude of frequency decreases larger than is generally zzso These results may serve as a guide in the evaluation of current theories of the cortical mechanisms of working zzso
