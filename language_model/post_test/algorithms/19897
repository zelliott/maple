zzso anatomical and functional significant structures renders one of the important tasks for both the theoretical study of the medical image analysis, and the clinical and practical zzso In the past, much work has been dedicated only to the zzso zzso Nevertheless, for clinical end users, a well designed zzso with an interactive software is necessary for an zzso to be zzso in their daily zzso Furthermore, the software would better be open zzso in order to be used and validated by not only the authors but also the entire zzso zzso the contribution of the present work is zzso first, we propose a new robust statistics based zzso metric and the zzso area driven multiple active zzso zzso to simultaneously extract multiple targets from MR and CT medical imagery in zzso Second, an open source zzso interactive zzso zzso tool based on the aforementioned zzso evolution is implemented and is publicly available for end users on multiple zzso In using this software for the zzso task, the process is initiated by the user drawn strokes zzso in the target region in the zzso Then, the local robust statistics are used to describe the object features, and such features are learned zzso from the seeds under a zzso zzso zzso zzso several active contours evolve simultaneously with their interactions being motivated by the principles of action and zzso not only guarantees mutual zzso among the zzso but also no longer relies upon the assumption that the multiple objects fill the entire image domain, which was tacitly or explicitly assumed in many previous zzso In doing so, the contours interact and zzso to equilibrium at the desired positions of the desired multiple zzso Furthermore, with the aim of not only zzso the zzso and the software, but also demonstrating how the tool is to be used, we provide the reader zzso experiments that demonstrate the capability of the proposed zzso tool on several public available data zzso
