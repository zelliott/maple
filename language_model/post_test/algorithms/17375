We have developed a controlled zzso Carlo zzso method to calculate the zzso zzso of light through a thick zzso especially for evaluation of the contribution from early arriving zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso according to a selection zzso so adequate zzso of interest can reach the zzso improving the statistics zzso zzso were conducted for tissue models with a thickness of 3-5 zzso and with optical properties similar to human breast zzso zzso profiles of early zzso were obtained with satisfactory zzso In addition, comparison was made with the conventional zzso Carlo approach to verify our scheme when applied to cases of zzso thin zzso
