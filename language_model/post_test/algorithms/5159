Complete active space zzso field zzso calculations and subsequent zzso zzso treatment zzso have been carried out on a series of metallic complexes based on a zzso zzso These compounds play a zzso role in the zzso of potential zzso zzso such as zzso zzso The zzso energies between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso states are evaluated with respect to the value of the shift zzso zzso affinity zzso zzso recently introduced in the zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 142 zzso Based upon a series of experimental data, it is concluded that the commonly applied zzso shift value zzso zzso is not satisfactory to properly discriminate the zzso HS and zzso zzso zzso We suggest that a zzso zzso value would be preferable for these specific zzso gap zzso
