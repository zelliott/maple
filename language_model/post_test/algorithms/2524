We explore the use of generalized zzso zzso on zzso zzso to help understand the nature of association signal within zzso zzso of zzso association zzso The particular generalized zzso distribution we adopt is a Student distribution on the absolute value of its zzso For low degrees of freedom, we show that the generalized zzso exhibits zzso properties with some attractive features over other common forms of sparse zzso and includes the well known zzso distribution as the degrees of freedom tends to zzso We pay particular attention to zzso representations of zzso statistics obtained from zzso zzso where we sweep over the setting of the scale zzso zzso in the prior to explore the space of zzso models obtained over a range of complexities, from very sparse models with all zzso zzso heavily concentrated around zero, to models with diffuse zzso and zzso distributed around their maximum likelihood zzso The zzso plots are akin to zzso plots of maximum a zzso zzso estimates but they zzso the complete marginal zzso zzso of the zzso plotted as a function of the precision of the zzso zzso zzso zzso over a range of prior zzso is zzso challenging but naturally amenable to sequential zzso Carlo zzso zzso zzso on the scale zzso We show how zzso simulation on zzso zzso provides very efficient zzso for zzso We also present a zzso representation of the generalized zzso prior that leads to an zzso zzso zzso to obtain zzso estimates should only these be zzso
