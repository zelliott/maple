zzso zzso zzso zzso has found zzso use in zzso due to the relatively high accuracy in the staging, differential diagnosis and therapy zzso Most PET studies are performed as a whole body zzso In selected cases a zzso analysis is performed, which is based on the calculation of standardized zzso values zzso The present studies were undertaken in order to evaluate the impact of dynamic PET studies in zzso diseases with respect to tumor diagnosis and therapy zzso Dynamic data acquisition is superior to zzso images because is provides information about the zzso distribution with respect of time and space, in a region of zzso The impact of different zzso and zzso approaches for the zzso and therapy planning was also zzso The zzso used for patient studies were: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A new evaluation strategy of dynamic PET studies based on an integrated evaluation including both compartment and zzso models as well as the use of zzso is zzso Furthermore, the zzso imaging including zzso and zzso analysis was zzso 

zzso with labeled zzso agents provide zzso about the transport and elimination of a zzso agent and help to predict the therapeutic zzso The retention of the zzso zzso agent zzso in liver zzso of zzso cancer was low after systemic zzso zzso with retention values zzso zzso and with zzso zzso correlated with negative and positive growth rates, zzso A high zzso retention zzso zzso was associated with longer survival times zzso zzso In contrast, patients with lower zzso retention values zzso zzso survived no longer than one zzso A higher diagnostic accuracy was obtained by using an integrated evaluation including both compartment and zzso zzso zzso studies for the diagnosis of soft tissue zzso showed a sensitivity and specificity of zzso and zzso for the primary tumors and zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso Using a combination of zzso and transport rates, it was possible to further zzso zzso soft tissue tumors with regard to tumor grading percentages of zzso of the G III, zzso of the G II, zzso of the G I tumors, as well as 50% of the zzso and zzso of zzso tissue were correctly classified using the integrated zzso In patients with bone tumors, integrated evaluation was also superior to zzso or visual evaluation leading to a sensitivity of zzso (for zzso zzso a specificity of zzso (for zzso zzso and an accuracy of zzso (for zzso zzso The diagnostic efficacy of zzso and of the zzso dimension of the time activity data of zzso was evaluated in 159 patients with 200 zzso of different tumors with respect to differential diagnosis and the prognosis of therapeutic zzso zzso analysis revealed a diagnostic accuracy of zzso for all patients, zzso for the zzso group of patients and zzso for the zzso zzso The advantage of zzso imaging is the zzso of one isolated zzso of the zzso s zzso like the zzso in case of zzso Furthermore, the zzso of a tumor is better due to the absence of background zzso The presented data also demonstrate that zzso imaging based on zzso transformation may be useful for the evaluation of the zzso and effectiveness of regional therapeutic zzso In conclusion, a zzso analysis of PET data sets based on zzso is in general helpful and should be performed under standardized conditions, concerning the time after zzso application, the blood zzso level in case of zzso partial volume correction and the choice of reconstruction zzso The combination of two zzso zzso an early and a late one is a simple and zzso approach for the evaluation of a dynamic series in a clinical zzso PET studies with labeled zzso agents provide information about the transport and elimination of a zzso agent and help to predict the therapeutic zzso zzso models require further zzso
