We study 3-D retinal zzso zzso from multiple images that provides the fundamental geometry of the human zzso and could be used for 3-D zzso zzso and disease diagnosis zzso An zzso camera model is used for 3-D reconstruction due to its zzso zzso and zzso A major challenge is that a series of zzso is involved in the retinal imaging process, including an actual zzso camera, a digital camera, and the zzso of the human eye, all of which cause significant zzso zzso in retinal zzso In this paper, we develop a new constrained zzso method that considers both the geometric shape of the human zzso and zzso lens zzso Moreover, we examine a variety of lens distortion models to approximate the zzso of the human eye in order to create a smooth zzso surface for zzso zzso The experimental results on both synthetic data and real retinal images validate the proposed zzso
