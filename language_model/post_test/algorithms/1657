zzso zzso are short sequences that zzso regulate gene zzso The current understanding of zzso and their corresponding zzso targets is primarily based on prediction zzso This study addresses the potential of a coordinated action of zzso to manipulate the human zzso Specifically, we investigate the effectiveness of zzso the zzso of human zzso zzso through a regulation by zzso 

From a set of zzso candidates that is associated with a pathway, an exhaustive search for all possible doubles and triplets zzso zzso zzso is zzso The impact of each zzso on the connectivity of the zzso graph was zzso About 170 human pathways were tested, and the zzso and zzso were scored for their ability to disrupt these zzso zzso We show that zzso of all pathways are effectively disconnected by a small number of zzso zzso Only zzso of the human pathways are resistant to fragmentation by zzso or zzso zzso the combination of the most effective zzso is zzso Thus, a specific regulation of a zzso within the cell is zzso The impact of the selected zzso on various diseases is zzso 

The methodology presented shows that the synthesis of the zzso of a network with a detailed understanding of the zzso regulation is useful in exposing critical zzso of the zzso We propose the zzso approach as a basis for rationally designed zzso zzso
