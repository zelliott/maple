Clock drawing zzso seems to be impaired quite early in the process of cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease zzso 

We assessed performance on the CD test zzso clock setting test zzso and clock reading test zzso in 32 elderly healthy controls, 41 patients with zzso 23 patients with zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso and 40 patients with Alzheimer's zzso zzso Our focus was on comparing the performance of zzso and zzso patients in relation to their global cognitive states zzso by the Mini Mental zzso zzso We also analyzed qualitative differences in errors of drawing, setting and reading zzso 

We found that performance in zzso but not in the zzso or zzso was impaired earlier in zzso than in zzso zzso placement of the minute hand was the most prominent error in both patient zzso We found no specific influence of zzso dysfunction in zzso on clock zzso 

Our findings suggest that executive function related to retrieval of semantic memory about the minute hand is compromised early in zzso
