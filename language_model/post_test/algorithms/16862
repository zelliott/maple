The key zzso that one gene encodes one protein has been overhauled with the discovery that one gene can generate multiple zzso transcripts through alternative zzso zzso In this study, we describe zzso a novel and uniquely motivated zzso designed for experimental biologists that zzso detects widespread changes in zzso zzso from both conventional and zzso sensitive zzso data, zzso automatically zzso zzso changes in zzso processing, and zzso zzso known technological artifacts of zzso zzso detection of alternative zzso resulting from zzso and 3' signal zzso background detection limits, and zzso of probe set signal zzso In this study, we used zzso to compare conventional and zzso zzso zzso data in a model of zzso transformation of primary human B zzso We demonstrated superior detection of zzso changes in zzso processing by the zzso zzso zzso relative to the Human zzso zzso zzso zzso changes in the zzso infection model were confirmed by zzso and revealed a novel set of zzso zzso zzso changes in zzso 6, 7, and zzso Finally, zzso as compared with zzso analysis of publicly available zzso data provided more efficiently zzso zzso zzso changes with a significantly higher proportion of hits supported by previously zzso alternative processing zzso zzso zzso provides an important tool for the biologist interested in studying changes in zzso zzso usage from conventional or zzso zzso platforms, especially considering the expansive amount of archival zzso data generated over the past zzso zzso is freely available upon zzso
