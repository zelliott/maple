To determine the improvement of zzso zzso with density correction and to determine the optimal site to use for air density correction on zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso CT scans of COPD patients zzso zzso smoking history zzso zzso were obtained from several zzso zzso zzso After density measurement of zzso zzso and external air, zzso CT density correction was conducted zzso reference zzso air, zzso zzso zzso zzso Using in-house software, zzso index zzso and mean lung density zzso were zzso zzso in air zzso zzso and zzso prior to and after density correction were evaluated zzso zzso zzso between those parameters and zzso and zzso were compared zzso and sex adjusted partial correlation zzso 

Measured zzso zzso of zzso and external air differed significantly zzso zzso 14, zzso zzso 9, zzso zzso and zzso on original CT data, after density correction using zzso and external air also differed significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, zzso The correlation zzso between CT zzso zzso and zzso and zzso increased after density zzso The zzso air correction showed better results than the external air zzso 

zzso correction of zzso CT data can improve correlations of zzso zzso and zzso
