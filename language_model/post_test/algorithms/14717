This paper presents an original zzso procedure for the diagnosis of electromagnetic devices, as well as zzso electrical rotating machines using two external flux zzso sensors that measure the external magnetic field in the zzso zzso The diagnosis exploits the signal delivered by the two sensors placed in particular zzso zzso to classical methods using only one zzso the presented method does not require any knowledge of a presumed zzso healthy former zzso On the other hand, the loading operating is not a disturbing factor but it is used to the fault zzso In order to present this zzso an internal zzso zzso zzso fault is considered as zzso
