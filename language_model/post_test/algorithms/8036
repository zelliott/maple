We probe the effects of zzso length scale, zzso and zzso pressure on zzso zzso shells using extensive molecular zzso The zzso shell zzso and water fluctuations both display a zzso dependence on zzso size, with a minimum near molecular zzso and enhanced fluctuations for larger zzso These results and calculations on proteins suggest that the zzso shells of unfolded proteins are more zzso than of folded ones contributing to pressure zzso More importantly, the zzso implies a zzso zzso pressure sensitivity for interactions between zzso zzso
