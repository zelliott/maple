Development and evaluation of an zzso protocol for PET examinations of the female breast with zzso zzso 

All PET zzso were performed with a zzso PET system zzso zzso zzso In order to examine the women with the breasts freely zzso a special extension for the patient table made of carbon layer composite was zzso After data acquisition in the zzso zzso zzso data were sorted into zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso and reconstructed by means of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The reconstructed zzso scans were superimposed onto the corresponding transmission zzso The protocol presented was evaluated in examinations on 6 women with breast zzso after the administration of zzso zzso zzso From two adjacent bed positions, zzso and transmission data were acquired over periods of 20 zzso and 10 zzso zzso For comparison, dynamic magnetic resonance zzso image series were acquired with a zzso MR system zzso SP zzso using a zzso zzso 

Using the designed extension of the patient table, it was possible to examine zzso women despite the limited patient port of the PET system in the prone position with the breasts freely zzso zzso a reduction in motion artifacts, this positioning also offers the possibility of making a direct comparison between PET and MR zzso Despite the fact that the amount of zzso applied to the patient was markedly reduced, the combination of zzso data acquisition and zzso image reconstruction resulted in excellent quality of the zzso zzso By zzso of zzso reconstructed zzso and transmission scans, anatomical zzso of breast zzso zzso on the zzso scans could be zzso The zzso of the PET data described was completed in 60 zzso this meaning that the presented concept can readily be employed in clinical zzso
