To describe insulin therapy in patients with diabetes, to determine treatment costs and to compare costs among treatment zzso 

This zzso study was performed by zzso French zzso Adult patients filling an insulin prescription were invited to zzso Participants provided information on their diabetes history and zzso zzso of zzso of insulin therapy were determined by the number of injections in type 1 diabetes zzso zzso patients, and by the different schemes used in type 2 zzso patients, such as zzso insulin only, and regimens using both zzso and zzso zzso zzso were evaluated according to official medication costs, nurse visits and zzso monitoring zzso 

A total of zzso patients with zzso and 1902 with zzso were enrolled in the zzso Patients with zzso more frequently took 1-2 injections per day zzso of zzso and used zzso zzso insulin together with zzso dose of rapid insulin zzso Patients with zzso used multiple treatment regimens, with 58 different combinations zzso Most took zzso insulin only zzso or combinations of zzso and rapid zzso zzso Mean cost of insulin therapy was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso In zzso insulin was the biggest cost component and increased with the number of zzso In zzso nurse visits were the most important cost contributors irrespective of treatment zzso Overall, the cost of insulin therapy increased with the complexity of the insulin zzso 

zzso zzso is found in insulin treatment regimens used in everyday diabetes zzso zzso should consider the full costs associated with the use of insulin rather than the cost of insulin zzso Treatment zzso to harmonize insulin therapy should help to improve care, while encouraging patients to zzso insulin should help to reduce zzso
