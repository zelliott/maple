In most cells, zzso increases in response to external stimulation are organized in the form of zzso and waves that sometimes zzso from one cell to zzso Numerous experimental and theoretical studies reveal that this zzso organization contains a zzso level of zzso In this study, we extend the previous work based on a statistical analysis of experimental zzso traces in isolated, zzso zzso and on zzso simulations of zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of variation in the periods of experimental and simulated zzso spikes provides information about the zzso and the specific zzso of the zzso zzso In zzso coupled by gap zzso the global zzso with a hormone leads to successive zzso responses, giving the appearance of an zzso zzso zzso analysis of experimental zzso zzso in coupled zzso confirms that this coordinated zzso zzso zzso to a phase wave but suggests the existence of an additional zzso zzso
