Compared to traditional strategies, application of zzso experiments combined with zzso methods can potentially speed up downstream process development and increase our understanding of zzso In contrast to the method of Design of zzso in combination with response surface analysis zzso zzso approaches like genetic zzso zzso can be applied to identify optimal zzso settings in zzso zzso zzso In this article the performance of a zzso was investigated applying parameters zzso in zzso downstream process zzso The influence of population size, the design of the initial generation and selection pressure on the zzso results was zzso To mimic typical experimental data, four mathematical functions were used for an in zzso zzso The influence of zzso parameters was minor on landscapes with only one zzso On landscapes with several zzso parameters had a significant impact on zzso performance and success in finding the global zzso zzso convergence increased as the number of parameters and noise zzso zzso was shown to be comparable or superior for simple systems and low to moderate zzso For complex systems or high noise levels, zzso failed, while zzso zzso represented a robust tool for process zzso Finally, the effect of different objective functions is shown zzso for a zzso zzso of zzso
