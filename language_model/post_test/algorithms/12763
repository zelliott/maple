Stroke volume variation zzso during controlled mechanical ventilation is a useful predictor in response to volume expansion, and zzso zzso index zzso a novel zzso allowing for automated and continuous calculation of the respiratory variations in the pulse zzso zzso zzso can also predict fluid responsiveness zzso in mechanically zzso zzso The aim of this study was zzso to determine whether acute fluid infusion affects zzso and zzso and zzso to compare the two values in the case of acute fluid infusion after a zzso fast following general zzso zzso 

After zzso zzso the patients' lungs were mechanically zzso zzso were zzso using zzso and were given a zzso zzso infusion of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso pressure zzso zzso zzso pressure zzso heart rate zzso cardiac output zzso cardiac index zzso zzso and zzso were measured at baseline and after 250 and zzso had been zzso and these values were zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso were unchanged after the zzso zzso and zzso decreased significantly after the zzso zzso increased significantly after the zzso There was a significant difference in zzso only between the post zzso and post zzso zzso 

A rapid infusion of zzso of a zzso in nearly healthy subjects who had zzso overnight returned their zzso to within the normal zzso In such cases, zzso is a more sensitive predictor of fluid responsiveness than is zzso and the infusion gradually increased zzso
