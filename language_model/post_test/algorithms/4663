zzso source zzso flow rates in the workplace are typically unknown in occupational zzso Similarly, a restricted number of concentration zzso can provide only spatial limited information on the zzso distribution in the zzso This paper presents a zzso method to evaluate the zzso of zzso sources and to reconstruct the associated concentration field at every point of a zzso zzso containing one or several zzso sources of unknown zzso zzso This reconstructed concentration field is obtained both from the geometric and ventilation characteristics of the zzso and from a limited number of zzso concentration zzso The method is currently zzso to steady zzso The predictions obtained are then compared with concentration zzso in a laboratory closed cabin under controlled zzso zzso sources generated zzso gas emissions at known flow zzso Comparisons were performed successively for three different physical zzso
