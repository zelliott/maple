The zzso is a secondary protein structure type that plays an important role in protein zzso and zzso Development of accurate prediction methods to identify zzso in protein sequences is zzso Several methods for zzso prediction have been zzso however, the prediction quality is still a challenge and there is substantial room for zzso zzso of the proposed method focus on discovering effective features, and constructing a new architectural zzso 

We zzso predicted secondary structures, predicted shape strings and the zzso scoring zzso zzso as input features, and proposed a novel zzso model to enhance the zzso We achieved the highest values according to four evaluation measures, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso The results show that our proposed zzso model discriminates better between zzso and zzso than the single model due to obtaining higher zzso Moreover, the predicted shape strings based on the structural alignment approach greatly improve the performance, and the same improvements were observed on zzso and zzso zzso as zzso 

In this article, we present a comprehensive method for the prediction of zzso zzso show that the proposed method constitutes a great improvement over the competing prediction zzso
