The identification of zzso zzso (such as induced by zzso is a crucial step for exploring the zzso process of complex zzso Most of the existing methods focus on deregulation of genes rather than the links of the path among zzso In this study, we emphasize on the detection of zzso zzso and develop a novel and effective regulatory zzso approach in finding zzso zzso Observing that a regulatory zzso between two genes might involve in multiple rather than a single path, we identify zzso core regulatory path zzso to detect the significant deregulation of regulatory zzso Using zzso gene zzso we define the regulatory strength within each gene pair based on statistical dependence zzso The zzso in regulatory networks can then be identified using the shortest path zzso Finally, we derive the zzso zzso by zzso the differential edges (as zzso zzso of the zzso between the case and the control zzso To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the method to expression data associated with different states of Human zzso Growth Factor zzso 2 zzso The experimental results show that the genes as well as the links in the zzso zzso are significantly enriched in multiple zzso pathways and GO biological zzso most of which can be validated to suffer from impact of this zzso based on previous zzso Additionally, we find the regulatory mechanism associated with the crucial gene zzso significantly zzso resulting from the zzso of zzso zzso our method provides not only a strategy for detecting the zzso links in regulatory networks, but also a way to identify concerning zzso zzso thus contributing to the target selection of zzso zzso
