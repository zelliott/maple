We have developed a mobile instrument for motion instruction and correction zzso that enables an expert zzso physical zzso to map zzso movements to a zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso comprises an expert module zzso and a zzso module zzso Both the zzso and TM are composed of zzso zzso measurement units, zzso and zzso The TM also has an array of zzso that provide the user with zzso instructional zzso The expert wears the zzso and zzso relevant body position is zzso by an zzso based on an extended Kalman filter that provides zzso state zzso The captured expert body motion information is transmitted zzso to the zzso and based on the zzso difference between the expert and zzso motion, directional instructions are displayed via zzso stimulation to the zzso The zzso is instructed to move in the direction of the zzso sensation until the zzso is zzso Two zzso studies involving young, healthy subjects were conducted using a simplified version of the zzso system zzso target zzso representing ideal expert movements and only two zzso during zzso trunk zzso The first study was designed to investigate the effects of changing the zzso error thresholds zzso zzso and zzso and varying the nature of the control signal zzso zzso plus zzso zzso zzso values were zzso zzso and average position errors zzso and time delays zzso zzso were minimized when the controller used a zzso error threshold and zzso plus zzso feedback control zzso The second study used the best performing zzso threshold and control signal determined from the first study to investigate subject performance when the motion task complexity and speed were zzso zzso performance decreased as motion speed and complexity zzso
