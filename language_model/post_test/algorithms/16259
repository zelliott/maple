zzso zzso zzso and collagen IV have been used extensively for the assessment of liver zzso The aim of this study was to zzso these markers in the peripheral and zzso vein blood of primary zzso zzso zzso patients and to study their ability to discriminate early from advanced zzso 

zzso from 62 zzso patients were compared to 60 controls, 44 chronic zzso C, 38 zzso zzso and 34 viral zzso zzso zzso from the zzso vein of 15 zzso zzso patients and 17 patients with viral zzso was also zzso 

All disease groups had significantly increased levels of zzso and collagen IV, compared to controls, while zzso was significantly increased only in viral zzso zzso levels were statistically different between early zzso zzso zzso zzso and late zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The area under the curve zzso for the identification of late zzso was zzso for zzso zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for collagen zzso zzso had high sensitivity and zzso in identifying late stages of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Short term zzso had no effect on these zzso 

No single measurement can differentiate between advanced and early zzso in zzso However serum zzso is a promising single serum marker for zzso studies in zzso
