zzso zzso in cerebral blood flow can impact the health and function of brain cells and are linked to cognitive decline and zzso To understand zzso in the three-dimensional vascular network of the cerebral cortex, we applied zzso excited zzso zzso to measure the motion of red blood cells zzso in individual zzso throughout the vascular hierarchy in zzso zzso To resolve zzso and zzso flow zzso we simultaneously recorded the zzso and respiratory zzso We found that zzso zzso speed decreased with decreasing vessel diameter in zzso slowed further through the zzso bed, and then increased with increasing vessel diameter in zzso zzso flow was zzso in nearly all cortical vessels, including zzso and zzso zzso speed zzso decreased through the vascular network, while the delay between heartbeat and the time of maximum speed zzso zzso tube zzso was zzso and did not vary with zzso zzso speed or zzso zzso zzso zzso flow profiles in surface vessels were blunted compared with a zzso and could be measured at vascular zzso Finally, we observed a transient decrease in zzso speed in surface vessels before zzso In conclusion, we developed an approach to study detailed characteristics of zzso flow in the three-dimensional cortical zzso including zzso of fluctuations in zzso zzso speed due to cardiac and respiratory rhythms and flow profile zzso These methods and the quantitative data on zzso cerebral zzso open the door to studies of the normal and zzso cerebral zzso
