The identification of zzso factors of easy application in clinical practice can improve the diagnostic and therapeutic decision making process in upper gastrointestinal bleeding zzso The present study estimates the capacity to predict an zzso clinical course zzso unstable zzso and/or zzso zzso on the basis of the zzso and zzso clinical zzso findings in patients with zzso zzso to zzso zzso 

A retrospective cohort study was made of zzso adult patients seen in the Emergency Service of a District Hospital, and diagnosed with zzso secondary to zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to construct different models, with the evaluation of their zzso capacity based on calculation of the area under the receiver operating curve zzso The final model was used to calculate the probabilities of an zzso clinical course for different profiles, with the purpose of constructing an zzso of help in the decision making process applied to patients initially considered to be at low risk zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

The model with the zzso variable showed a high zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to the model of clinical and zzso factors zzso of zzso zzso kidney failure, and liver disease) significantly increased its zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso This model allows the differentiation of different complication risk levels in patients initially at low risk according to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

The zzso zzso is the principal zzso factor for an zzso course in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding zzso to zzso zzso though clinical factors are also important and should complement the decision taking zzso
