zzso testing is very popular for analyzing zzso data to identify zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso false discovery rates zzso is a very popular way to address the inherent multiple testing zzso However, combining these approaches may be problematic when sample sizes are zzso 

With unbalanced data, zzso tests may not be suitable because they do not test the hypothesis of zzso In addition, zzso tests can be zzso Using biased zzso to estimate the zzso can produce unacceptable bias in those zzso zzso also show that the approach of pooling zzso zzso zzso across genes can produce invalid zzso since even zzso genes can have different zzso zzso zzso We encourage researchers to use statistics that have been shown to reliably discriminate DE zzso but caution that associated zzso may be either zzso or a zzso metric for discriminating DE zzso
