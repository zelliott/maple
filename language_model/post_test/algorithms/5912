Inherent difficulties in evaluating clinical competence of physicians has lead to the widespread use of zzso skill assessment zzso Inspired by an zzso between medical procedure and spoken language, proven modeling methods in the field of speech recognition were adapted for use as objective skill assessment zzso A generalized methodology using zzso Models zzso was zzso The database under study was collected with the zzso physical zzso The simulator incorporates an array of five contact force sensors located in key anatomical zzso Two zzso fully connected zzso are used, one for each skill zzso Each state in the model zzso to one of the possible combinations of the 5 active contact force sensors distributed in the zzso zzso distances measured between models representing subjects with different skill levels are sensitive enough to provide an objective measure of medical skill zzso The method was tested with 41 expert subjects and 41 novice subjects in addition to the 30 subjects used for training the zzso Of the 82 subjects, 76 were classified correctly zzso Moreover, unique state transitions as well as force zzso for corresponding states zzso were found to be skill zzso Given the white box nature of the model, analyzing the zzso provides insight into the examination process zzso This methodology is independent of the zzso under zzso It was previously used to assess surgical skill in a minimally invasive surgical setup using the Blue zzso and it is currently applied to data collected using the zzso
