The genetic basis of heart development is remarkably zzso from zzso to zzso and insights from flies have greatly informed our understanding of zzso heart zzso Recent evidence suggests that many aspects of heart function are also zzso and the genes involved in heart development also play roles in adult heart zzso We have developed a zzso heart preparation and movement analysis zzso that allows zzso of functional zzso Our methodology combines high-speed optical recording of beating hearts with a zzso zzso analysis to accurately detect and zzso on a zzso basis, not only heart rate but also zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso percent fractional zzso contraction wave zzso and cardiac zzso Here, we present a detailed analysis of hearts from adult zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mouse zzso indicating that our methodology is potentially zzso to an array of biological zzso We detect progressive age-related changes in fly hearts as well as subtle but distinct cardiac deficits in zzso zzso zzso zzso Our methodology for zzso cardiac function in these genetically zzso model systems should provide valuable insights into the zzso of heart zzso
