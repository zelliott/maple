When both the zzso and the N are unequal in a zzso design, the probability of a Type I error shifts from the nominal zzso error zzso The probability is too liberal when the small cell has the larger zzso and too conservative when the large cell has the larger zzso We present an zzso to circumvent the problem when the smaller group has the larger zzso and show, by zzso that the zzso brings the error rate back to the nominal value without sacrificing the ability to detect true zzso
