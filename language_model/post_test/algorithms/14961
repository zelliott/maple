Investigation of manual material handling zzso tasks, such as zzso requires the zzso of the various zzso and kinetic parameters of performance for assessment of the functional capacity and/or task demand zzso Traditional statistical descriptive analyses usually involve computing the summary statistics zzso zzso mean, and/or zzso of the resulting performance parameters over the cycle duration zzso zzso zzso zzso the significant information content of the zzso signals is diminished, limiting the sensitivity of subsequent hypothesis testing zzso The present study developed a methodology for representing and zzso performance data zzso of the zzso and kinetic motion profiles due to the different lift characteristics zzso mode, and zzso during zzso tasks while capturing the zzso zzso Using a database of motion profiles from a manual lifting experiment, the zzso Expansion zzso feature extraction technique was shown to be quite effective for representing the various motion zzso The number of basis zzso zzso and corresponding zzso needed for accurate representation were substantially smaller than the original data set, resulting in data zzso Moreover, the effects of lift characteristics were investigated using analysis of zzso techniques that recognize the zzso constitution of the zzso The application of these techniques will enable the zzso of highly zzso profiles and enhance the ability to document the effect of intervening measures such as educational or physical zzso on the zzso and kinetic patterns of zzso Additionally, the differential influence of lift characteristics on the zzso of performance during different zzso of lifting and lowering provides added resolution in the analysis of zzso zzso
