zzso are a major tool to evaluate new statistical methods and zzso experimental designs in the zzso zzso However, this can only be achieved when the simulations are close enough to reality, as well as diverse enough to be zzso For mapping studies, it is thus critical to zzso as much as possible the forces generating linkage zzso random zzso changes in population sizes, selection and pedigree zzso and the mechanisms producing trait genetic architecture zzso dominance, zzso We present here a computer program zzso simulating these zzso zzso zzso provide statistics on the linkage zzso zzso structure and the identity by descent between zzso zzso zzso further data zzso Furthermore, zzso enables the simulation of zzso data in known zzso which sticks as precisely as possible to recent population history and structures of the long-range zzso allowing zzso of zzso zzso
