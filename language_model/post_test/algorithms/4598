Cancer is recognized to be a family of zzso diseases whose causes are to be found in disruptions of basic zzso zzso An increasingly deep zzso of zzso networks details the specific molecular interaction of genes and their zzso However, mapping of disease zzso to zzso of these networks of interactions is accomplished indirectly and zzso Here we zzso identify pathways associated with zzso staging, and outcome in cancer through application of an zzso approach that systematically evaluates differences in the activity and consistency of interactions within zzso zzso zzso Using large collections of publicly accessible zzso gene zzso we identify small, common sets of pathways - zzso zzso zzso response to DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso - whose differences robustly distinguish diverse tumor types from corresponding normal samples, predict tumor grade, and distinguish zzso such as zzso zzso status and zzso zzso zzso Pathways identified through this analysis perform as well or better than zzso used in the original studies in predicting cancer zzso This approach provides a means to use zzso zzso to map key biological processes to important clinical features in zzso
