We describe a method, zzso analysis of differential zzso zzso for discovery of differential alternative zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso incorporates a series of low-level analysis zzso motivated by the zzso design of zzso zzso including background zzso zzso probe selection, and removal of zzso zzso to zzso zzso We used zzso to analyze zzso zzso zzso array data on a mouse zzso cell line after zzso zzso of the zzso factor zzso tract binding protein zzso From a list of zzso with predetermined zzso profiles in response to zzso zzso zzso recognized all zzso known to have large changes in transcript inclusion levels and offered improvement over zzso analysis zzso We also identified numerous novel zzso zzso zzso Thirty novel events were tested by zzso and 27 were zzso This work demonstrates that the zzso zzso design is an efficient and powerful approach for zzso unbiased analysis of zzso zzso
