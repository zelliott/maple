zzso integration of fields produced by zzso fluid mechanics simulations is a commonly used tool for the investigation and analysis of fluid flow zzso zzso is often accomplished through the application of ordinary differential equation zzso zzso whose error characteristics are predicated on the zzso of the field through which the streamline is being zzso which is not available at the zzso level of finite volume and finite element zzso zzso error control techniques are often used to zzso the challenge posed by zzso zzso As the root of the difficulties is the zzso nature of the data, we present a complementary approach of applying zzso zzso filters to the data prior to streamline zzso We investigate whether such an approach applied to uniform zzso zzso zzso zzso finite zzso data can be used to augment current zzso error control zzso We discuss and demonstrate through zzso example the zzso zzso exhibited when one applies such a zzso
