zzso pressure zzso and the determination of fractional flow reserve zzso after zzso coronary intervention zzso predict adverse zzso zzso zzso may impair the transmission of pressure waves across a zzso potentially acting as a zzso zzso The pulse transmission zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso the transmission of zzso components of the pressure signal through a zzso It was shown recently that zzso is highly correlated with zzso This study was designed to examine the change of zzso as compared to zzso following zzso zzso signals were obtained by pressure zzso in 27 zzso zzso and zzso and were analyzed with an zzso that identifies the zzso component in the pressure zzso The zzso was calculated at baseline as the ratio between zzso and zzso zzso components of the pressure zzso across the zzso zzso zzso were assessed with zzso zzso There was a significant increase in zzso following zzso zzso zzso zzso at baseline zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso changes were observed for zzso zzso zzso zzso at baseline zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso for zzso assessment of coronary artery zzso Similar to zzso zzso is significantly increased following zzso Thus, it may serve as an adjunct index for the functional assessment of procedural success following zzso
