The growing number of applications of Fluorescence zzso Distribution Analysis zzso demands for new approaches in data processing, aiming at increased speed and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso although proven to be universal and accurate, require some initial guesses zzso of the unknown zzso An essential component of any data processing technology, zzso become especially important in case of zzso since even with apparently reasonable, and physically admissible but randomly chosen zzso the zzso procedure may zzso to situations where the zzso model cannot be evaluated zzso In the present work we introduce an approach for zzso generation in zzso experiments based on the method of zzso zzso are generated for the sample zzso zzso zzso and for the parameters related to experimental zzso background, observation volume zzso A number of zzso zzso were introduced in order to increase the accuracy and zzso of the zzso zzso The performance of the developed method has been tested on number of simulations and experimental zzso zzso fitting with generated zzso proved to be more robust and at least five times faster than with an arbitrarily chosen zzso zzso of the proposed method for quick zzso of brightness and zzso is zzso
