The protein folding problem is a fundamental problem in zzso molecular biology and zzso zzso The previously best known branch and bound method for the protein folding problem may find optimal or zzso energy structure from the benchmark zzso but the total zzso time is rather lengthy because it usually needs to run a great deal of simulating tests or else lack of zzso In this paper, we develop a new branch and bound method for the the protein folding problem under the two-dimensional zzso model to overcome the mentioned zzso By using benchmark sequences for zzso we demonstrate that the performance of our method is superior than previously known zzso Moreover, our method is a simple, flexible and easily implemented one for the protein folding zzso
