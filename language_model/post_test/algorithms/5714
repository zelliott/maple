The aim of this study was to clinically investigate the association between the risk factors of zzso zzso and the two-dimensional zzso movement of the artery zzso To meet this objective, a zzso tracking approach for the zzso of the zzso trajectory of the vessel wall was proposed and applied to zzso ultrasound zzso sequences of the left common carotid artery zzso A zzso skeleton model was also introduced in the block matching zzso Finally, the zzso movements of both zzso and zzso walls were investigated in three different local regions, with zzso zzso zzso zzso kernel zzso A clinical study was conducted in which two different populations zzso young healthy volunteers and 26 older diabetic zzso were zzso The results show that the mean zzso value of the diameter change zzso of the zzso displacement of the zzso wall zzso and of the zzso displacement of the zzso wall zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the young healthy volunteers and the older diabetic patients, zzso The results of the three dynamic parameters zzso zzso and zzso were systematically and significantly lower for the diabetic subjects, respectively zzso zzso and zzso The method introduced in this feasibility study might constitute a pertinent approach to assess the presence of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso of the zzso motion of the zzso complex in the zzso
