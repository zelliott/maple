zzso sequencing technologies provide an zzso opportunity for the characterization and discovery of known and novel zzso Because viruses are known to have the highest zzso rates when compared to zzso and bacterial organisms, we assess the extent to which zzso well-known alignment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso can be used for characterizing zzso and zzso viral zzso those that exhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso To evaluate zzso zzso we developed a realistic zzso simulation and evaluation framework zzso and propose a new combined score to rank zzso for viral characterization in terms of their precision, sensitivity and alignment zzso We used zzso to simulate both human and viral read sequences and suggest the best set of zzso for viral sequence characterization in human zzso zzso Our results show that significant and substantial differences exist between zzso and that a zzso viral identification framework can and should use different zzso for different parts of the zzso We determine the extent to which zzso viral sequences can be effectively characterized and show that more sensitive zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso can accurately characterize substantially divergent viral sequences with up to zzso overall sequence zzso zzso We believe that the results presented here will be useful to researchers choosing zzso for viral sequence characterization using next-generation sequencing zzso
