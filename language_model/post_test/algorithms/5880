We describe a zzso method for recovering zzso human body pose from single images and zzso image zzso Our approach requires neither an explicit body model nor prior labeling of body parts in the zzso Instead, it recovers pose by direct zzso zzso against shape zzso zzso extracted automatically from image zzso For zzso against local silhouette zzso zzso silhouette shape is zzso by zzso zzso We evaluate several different zzso zzso zzso regression, zzso zzso zzso zzso regression, and Support zzso zzso zzso zzso over both linear and kernel zzso The zzso provide much zzso zzso without compromising performance, and kernel bases give a small but worthwhile improvement in zzso The loss of depth and limb labeling information often makes the recovery of zzso pose from single zzso zzso To handle this, the method is embedded in a novel zzso tracking zzso using dynamics from the previous state estimate together with a learned zzso value to zzso the zzso We show that the resulting system tracks long sequences zzso For realism and good zzso over a wide range of zzso we train the zzso on images zzso from real human motion capture zzso The method is demonstrated for several representations of full body pose, both zzso on independent but similar test data and zzso on real image zzso Mean angular errors of 4-6 degrees are obtained for a variety of walking zzso
