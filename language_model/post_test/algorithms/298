The fish zzso of the Southern Ocean is dominated by species of the zzso zzso zzso which constitute zzso of fish species and zzso of zzso zzso have undergone rapid zzso and ecological diversification and developed zzso adaptations to a cold, highly zzso zzso zzso inhabiting animal zzso include those that perform essential nutritional functions, but zzso gut microbial communities have not been investigated using zzso zzso We analyzed bacterial zzso zzso gene sequences obtained from the zzso tract of zzso zzso and zzso zzso which differ in their zzso distribution and feeding zzso Both samples showed dominance of zzso zzso zzso as has been reported for temperate zzso zzso Both samples showed low diversity relative to that reported for other fish zzso studies, with zzso zzso containing fewer zzso than zzso zzso Despite the small sample size of this preliminary study, our findings suggest that Antarctic zzso carry a gut zzso similar in composition to that of temperate fish, but exhibiting lower zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso individual exhibited greater diversity than the exclusively carnivorous zzso zzso individual, which may indicate that increasing zzso in fish leads to gut zzso diversification, as found in zzso Lastly, we detected members of zzso containing known microbial zzso which have not been previously reported in Antarctic zzso zzso
