zzso action recognition applications require the development of systems which are fast, can handle a large variety of actions without a zzso knowledge of the type of actions, need a minimal number of zzso and zzso as short as possible learning zzso In this paper, we suggest such an zzso We regard dynamic activities as long-term zzso objects, which are characterized by zzso features at multiple zzso zzso Based on this, we design a simple statistical distance measure between video sequences which captures the similarities in their behavioral zzso This measure is zzso and can thus handle a wide range of complex dynamic zzso Having a zzso distance measure between zzso we use it for a variety of tasks, zzso video indexing, zzso zzso and zzso video zzso These tasks are performed without prior knowledge of the types of actions, their models, or their zzso zzso
