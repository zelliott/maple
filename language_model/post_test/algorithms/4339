To evaluate the feasibility of procedural planning for zzso zzso valve zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso by comparison with zzso zzso zzso zzso and to investigate zzso of the image quality of zzso 

Patients who underwent zzso of the left zzso and cardiac zzso were zzso zzso acquisition was performed during contrast injection through a zzso zzso zzso positioned in the left zzso On zzso zzso and zzso data sets, diameter zzso were made on zzso images at the level of the zzso zzso zzso zzso ascending zzso zzso junction zzso and the zzso of zzso At the level of the zzso zzso diagnostic image quality was obtained in 49 of 56 zzso In all patients with a body mass index zzso zzso 29 zzso image quality was acceptable whether or not rapid pacing was zzso In patients with zzso zzso 29 zzso the image quality was poor in 1 of 9 zzso who were rapidly paced compared with 6 of 12 zzso who were zzso The correlation between zzso and zzso zzso was high for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and ascending zzso zzso R zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The correlations improved further when the analysis was limited to patients with a zzso zzso 29 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso of the left zzso allows precise measurement of the zzso root and zzso and was feasible for zzso at the time of zzso zzso image quality was obtained without rapid pacing in all patients with a zzso zzso 29 zzso
