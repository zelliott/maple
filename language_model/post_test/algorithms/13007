zzso musculoskeletal disorders zzso of the neck and the shoulders are a growing problem in zzso An interesting pattern of spontaneous muscle activity, the firing of a single motor unit, in the zzso muscle is observed during a laboratory study in a rest state or a state with a mental zzso 

In this study, we report on the finding of the single motor unit firing and we present a detection zzso to zzso these single motor unit zzso 

A spike train detection algorithm, using a zzso energy operator and zzso is presented to detect burst of highly zzso high energetic zzso zzso 

This single motor unit was visible in zzso of the test subjects on one or both zzso muscles although there was no change in posture of the test zzso All the segments in the data that were determined as single motor unit zzso were detected by the zzso 

The zzso meaning of this firing pattern is a very low and subconscious contraction of the zzso A long-term contraction could lead to the exhaustion of the muscle zzso thus resulting in musculoskeletal zzso The detection zzso is able to zzso this phenomenon in a zzso zzso The ability of detecting these zzso is helpful in the research of its zzso 

The detection zzso can be used to gain insight in the zzso origin of this zzso In addition, the zzso can also be used in a zzso system to warn the user for this zzso contraction to prevent zzso
