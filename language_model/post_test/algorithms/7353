The biomedical literature presents a uniquely challenging text mining zzso zzso are long and complex, the subject matter is highly specialized with a distinct zzso and producing zzso training data for this domain is time consuming and zzso In this environment, zzso text mining methods that do not rely on zzso training data are zzso Here we investigate the use of random indexing, an automated method for producing zzso semantic representations of words from large, zzso zzso to address the problem of term zzso in sentences describing drugs and zzso We show that random indexing produces similarity scores that capture some of the structure of zzso a manually curated zzso of zzso zzso We further show that random indexing can be used to identify likely word candidates for inclusion in the zzso and can help zzso these new labels among classes and roles within the zzso
