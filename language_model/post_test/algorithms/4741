zzso zzso use is associated with zzso zzso in psoriasis zzso To monitor this serial liver zzso were zzso The zzso and the zzso are two novel, zzso methods that might be able to assess zzso zzso zzso 

Evaluating the accuracy and feasibility of the zzso and zzso to detect significant zzso liver zzso in psoriasis zzso 

We assessed 24 psoriasis patients who had a recent liver biopsy during zzso zzso The results from the zzso and zzso were compared with liver zzso 

zzso values zzso ranged between zzso and zzso zzso zzso value zzso zzso and correctly identified zzso of the patients without significant liver zzso zzso score zzso zzso zzso The zzso identified zzso of the patients with significant liver zzso zzso score zzso zzso zzso 

In this population, zzso accurately predicted the presence of significant liver zzso while the zzso accurately predicted the absence of significant liver zzso in zzso zzso This suggests that a combination of zzso and zzso should zzso be evaluated in monitoring and detecting significant zzso liver zzso in psoriasis zzso
