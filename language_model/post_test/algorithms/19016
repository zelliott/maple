zzso of zzso zzso syndrome zzso following lung transplantation is based on declines in forced zzso volume in 1 s zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of zzso ventilation zzso in the early detection of zzso following zzso zzso lung transplantation zzso to compare zzso zzso imaging with zzso zzso zzso findings for early detection of zzso following zzso and to evaluate zzso zzso imaging by quantitative zzso 

zzso comprised 30 zzso recipients and 1 zzso recipient, who had undergone zzso at our institution and survived more than 1 zzso zzso diagnosed zzso developed in six zzso zzso in graft function were evaluated using a combination of three methods, zzso dynamic zzso high-resolution CT zzso and zzso ventilation zzso zzso for all transplanted lungs were compared between CT and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging was assessed using mean transit time zzso of zzso unilateral zzso zzso between zzso of bilateral lungs and zzso were zzso zzso in zzso between zzso and zzso zzso and between zzso and donor lungs were also evaluated on unilateral zzso zzso zzso values of zzso of unilateral lungs were set for the diagnosis of zzso 

In all six zzso cases, zzso images of zzso lungs revealed zzso zzso with declines from baseline zzso whereas only one zzso case could be detected using early CT findings of zzso zzso decrease in number and size of pulmonary vessels, zzso of zzso lines, and volume zzso A significant correlation was identified between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso of unilateral lungs was significantly longer in zzso lungs than in zzso lungs zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of unilateral lungs for the diagnosis of zzso was set at zzso zzso 

Our data show that zzso zzso imaging offers excellent potential for early detection of zzso compared with early CT zzso Using zzso zzso imaging and zzso with radioactive zzso offers a zzso indication of selective zzso function in zzso lungs following zzso zzso appears useful for identifying zzso following zzso and allows quantitative evaluation of graft function in unilateral zzso
