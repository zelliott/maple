A computer system zzso for zzso zzso and artificial gene design has been designed for better experimental planning and zzso zzso permits searching for optimal zzso with respect to certain important zzso namely sufficient energy of zzso zzso the secondary structure of zzso and target DNA, the presence of alternate binding sites in the target DNA and terminal zzso zzso It can also be used to plan zzso chain reaction experiments, for optimal primer selection, in sequencing, zzso zzso enables one to search for both existing and potential restriction sites, to perform zzso + target sequence zzso The system consists of a set of original zzso that formalize the empirical knowledge of zzso action as zzso
