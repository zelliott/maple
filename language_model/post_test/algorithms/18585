Although resting frontal zzso zzso alpha asymmetry has been shown to be a stable measure over time in nonclinical zzso its reliability and stability in clinically depressed individuals has not been fully zzso The internal consistency and zzso stability of resting zzso alpha zzso zzso asymmetry were examined in 30 women diagnosed with major depression at zzso intervals for 8 or 16 zzso zzso scores generally displayed good internal consistency and exhibited modest stability over the 8- and zzso assessment zzso Changes in asymmetry scores over this zzso were not significantly related to changes in clinical zzso These findings suggest that resting zzso alpha asymmetry can be reliably assessed in clinically depressed zzso Furthermore, zzso correlation stability estimates suggest that although some zzso aspects of alpha asymmetry exist in depressed individuals, there is also evidence of changes in asymmetry across assessment occasions that are not closely linked to changes in depressive zzso
