The identification of essential genes is important for the understanding of the minimal requirements for cellular life and for practical purposes, such as drug zzso However, the experimental techniques for essential genes discovery are zzso and zzso Considering these experimental constraints, a zzso approach capable of accurately predicting essential genes would be of great zzso We therefore present here a machine zzso zzso approach relying on network zzso features, cellular zzso and biological process information for prediction of essential zzso 

We constructed a decision zzso zzso and trained it on zzso with individual and grouped zzso zzso features, cellular compartments and biological zzso generate various zzso of essential zzso We showed that the zzso with better performances are those generated by zzso with integrated zzso Using the predictor with all zzso zzso network zzso features, cellular compartments and biological zzso we obtained the best predictor of essential genes that was then used to zzso zzso genes with unknown zzso zzso Finally, we generated decision trees by training the zzso zzso on zzso with all network zzso features, cellular zzso and biological process information to discover cellular rules for zzso We found that the number of protein physical zzso the nuclear zzso of proteins and the number of regulating zzso factors are the most important factors determining gene zzso 

We were able to demonstrate that network zzso features, cellular zzso and biological process information are reliable zzso of essential zzso Moreover, by constructing decision trees based on these data, we could discover cellular rules governing zzso
