zzso linear models zzso are a standard approach for analyzing data where individuals are measured repeatedly over zzso However, such models are only zzso to zzso studies of zzso zzso In this paper, we propose a novel zzso zzso model zzso which zzso zzso to the zzso zzso Our proposed model explains the zzso trends in shapes represented as elements of the group of zzso The individual level zzso represent the trajectory of shape changes within zzso The group level zzso represents the average trajectory of shape changes for the zzso We derive the solution of zzso on zzso to estimate individual level zzso the group zzso and the residual zzso We demonstrate the effectiveness of zzso for zzso analysis of zzso generated shapes and zzso zzso brain zzso
