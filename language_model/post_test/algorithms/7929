An image slicing zzso zzso for zzso applications is zzso Its principle is based on the zzso of image zones by specially organized thin mirrors within a custom zzso component termed an image zzso The demonstrated zzso can simultaneously acquire a 140 zzso spectral range within its zzso field of view from a single zzso The spectral resolution of the system is zzso zzso The zzso and spatial resolution of the zzso depend on the selected microscope objective and for the results presented is 45 zzso 45 zzso and zzso zzso zzso This zzso system can be easily improved in the future for higher (both spectral and zzso resolution zzso The system requires no scanning and minimal post data zzso In addition, the reflective nature of the image zzso and use of prisms for spectral zzso make the system light zzso Both of the above features are highly valuable for real time zzso imaging in biological and diagnostic zzso
