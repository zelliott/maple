This paper reports the first known solution to the zzso point location zzso problem when the environment is zzso The zzso problem involves a general learning problem in which the learning mechanism (which could be a robot, a learning zzso or, in general, an zzso attempts to learn a zzso for example, zzso within a closed zzso However, unlike the earlier reported results, we consider the scenario when the learning is to be done in a zzso zzso For each guess, the environment essentially informs the zzso possibly erroneously zzso with probability zzso which way it should move to reach the unknown zzso Unlike the results available in the literature, we consider the fascinating case when the point sought for is itself zzso moving (which is modeled as zzso The environment communicates with an intermediate entity zzso to as the zzso about the point itself, zzso advising where it should zzso The mechanism that searches for the point in turn receives responses from the zzso which directs how it should zzso zzso the point itself, in the overall setting, is moving, zzso delivering possibly incorrect information about its location to the zzso This in turn means that the zzso is itself zzso which implies that the advice of the zzso is both uncertain and changing with zzso the problem extremely zzso The heart of the strategy we propose involves zzso the space and performing a controlled random walk on this zzso Apart from zzso some zzso results about our solution, we also report the simulation results that demonstrate the power of the zzso and state some potential zzso
