In molecular mechanics zzso studies, atom types and/or bond types of molecules are needed to determine prior to energy zzso We present here an automatic zzso of zzso atom types that are defined in a description table, and an automatic zzso of assigning bond types just based on atomic zzso The zzso have been implemented in a new module of the zzso zzso This auxiliary zzso zzso zzso meaning zzso zzso can be applied to generate necessary zzso of zzso zzso program to generate zzso for zzso molecular zzso zzso for most organic zzso The zzso behind the zzso may be useful for other molecular mechanical packages as well as applications that need to designate atom types and bond zzso
