zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso from zzso coli for 53 metals shows that the zzso does not contain any of these metals at significant zzso The zzso analog zzso zzso zzso a structural zzso of zzso with the sugar linked to zzso through the zzso zzso group, is an zzso that zzso reduces zzso to zzso The pH dependence of zzso reveals the essential involvement of an zzso group, zzso measured zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso form and two zzso zzso or basic groups, apparent zzso values of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso as a function of zzso show that it is given by zzso zzso zzso + zzso at a given zzso where K zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso throughout the pH range zzso The zzso first order rate zzso range from zzso to zzso zzso with the maximum value at pH zzso and decreasing at zzso and basic pH zzso zzso of zzso proceeds with kinetic isotope effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at pH values zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso hydride transfer becomes zzso at pH extremes but is not limiting at neutral zzso although zzso transfer is significantly limiting at all pH zzso The isotope effects facilitated correction of the kinetic zzso values to the zzso values zzso on the acid side and zzso on the alkaline zzso We zzso that the group with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso functions as an zzso general base that abstracts the zzso zzso zzso zzso in concert with transfer of the zzso hydrogen and two electrons to zzso The pH dependence on the alkaline side may be related to the zzso zzso zzso transition that is an essential step in the reduction of zzso to zzso by zzso
