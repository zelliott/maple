Cancer diagnosis and clinical outcome prediction are among the most important emerging applications of gene expression zzso technology with several molecular signatures on their way toward clinical zzso Use of the most accurate zzso zzso available for zzso gene expression data is a critical ingredient in order to develop the best possible molecular signatures for patient zzso As suggested by a large body of literature to date, support zzso machines can be considered zzso of zzso zzso for zzso of such zzso Recent work, however, suggests that random forest zzso may outperform support zzso machines in this zzso 

In the present paper we identify zzso biases of prior work comparing random forests and support zzso machines and conduct a new rigorous evaluation of the two zzso that zzso these zzso Our experiments use 22 diagnostic and zzso zzso and show that support zzso machines outperform random forests, often by a large zzso Our data also zzso the importance of sound research design in zzso and comparison of zzso zzso 

We found that both on average and in the majority of zzso zzso random forests are outperformed by support zzso machines both in the settings when no gene selection is performed and when several popular gene selection methods are zzso
