zzso zzso connected by gap junctions can provide a synchronized zzso drive that can zzso zzso zzso This was studied in a zzso zzso model zzso that was zzso by periodic zzso zzso with low jitter in the input spike times zzso high zzso and a variable but large number of zzso spikes on each zzso During zzso the Shannon zzso of the output spike times was reduced sharply compared with its value outside zzso Surprisingly, however, the information transfer as measured by the mutual information between the number of zzso zzso in a cycle and the phase lag of the subsequent output spike was significantly increased during zzso This increase was due to the reduced contribution of the internal correlations to the output zzso These theoretical predictions were supported by experimental recordings from the rat zzso and zzso in zzso
