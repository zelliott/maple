Identification of population structure can help trace population histories and identify disease zzso zzso association zzso is a commonly used approach for population structure identification and association zzso A major issue with zzso is that its performance greatly depends on the zzso and the numbers of ancestral zzso markers zzso Present major zzso selection methods mostly require prior individual ancestry information, which is usually not available or uncertain in zzso To address this potential zzso we zzso develop a novel approach for zzso selection based on principle component analysis zzso which does not require prior ancestry information of study zzso Our simulation and real genetic data analysis results suggest that, with equivalent zzso zzso selected zzso can significantly increase the accuracy of zzso individual zzso compared with traditionally randomly selected zzso Our method can easily be applied to whole zzso data to select a set of highly zzso zzso in population structure, which can then be used to identify potential population structure and correct possible statistical biases caused by population zzso
