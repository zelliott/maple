We introduce a new method for measuring visual population receptive fields zzso with functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso The zzso structure is modeled as a set of weights that can be estimated by solving a linear model that predicts the Blood zzso zzso zzso signal using the stimulus protocol and the zzso zzso response zzso This method does not make a zzso assumptions about the specific zzso shape and is therefore a useful tool for uncovering the underlying zzso structure at different spatial locations in an unbiased zzso We show that our method is more accurate than a previously described method zzso and zzso zzso which directly fits a zzso zzso zzso zzso model to predict the zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso models do not fully capture the actual zzso shape, and can be prone to zzso center zzso when the zzso is located near the border of the stimulus zzso A quantitative comparison demonstrates that our method zzso the zzso methods in the zzso center modeling by achieving higher explained zzso of the zzso zzso This was true for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and difference of zzso zzso zzso zzso our model is also capable of exploring a variety of zzso properties such as surround suppression, receptive field center zzso orientation, location and zzso Additionally, the proposed method is particularly attractive for monitoring zzso properties in the visual areas of subjects with zzso of the visual zzso where it is difficult to anticipate what shape the reorganized zzso might zzso Finally, the method proposed here is more efficient in zzso time than zzso methods, which need to search for a set of parameters in an extremely large searching zzso Instead, this method uses the zzso topography to zzso the space that needs to be searched for the subsequent zzso
