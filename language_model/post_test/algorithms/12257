In this work, we present a method to extract zzso zzso from single channel electroencephalogram zzso zzso The method is called local singular spectrum analysis zzso zzso It is based on a principal component analysis zzso applied to clusters of the zzso signals obtained after embedding the signals in their zzso zzso The decomposition of the zzso signals in each cluster is achieved by relating the largest zzso with the large zzso zzso component of the embedded zzso Then by reverting the zzso and embedding zzso the zzso zzso can be zzso zzso it from the original signal a corrected zzso signal zzso The zzso is applied to segments of real zzso recordings containing zzso zzso activity contaminated by large zzso zzso We will show that the method can be applied also in parallel to correct all channels that present zzso zzso like zzso movement zzso or zzso low frequency baseline zzso The extracted zzso as well as the corrected zzso will be zzso
