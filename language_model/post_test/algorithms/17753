In this paper we propose a robust zzso zzso for zzso zzso The zzso is based on zzso zzso zzso Our basic idea is to decompose the original mesh into a series of details at different scales by using zzso zzso zzso the zzso is then embedded into the different levels of zzso The embedding process includes: global sphere zzso zzso uniform zzso zzso zzso forward zzso embedding zzso zzso zzso inverse zzso and at last zzso the mesh zzso to recover the zzso connectivity of the original zzso zzso showed that our zzso can improve the capacity of the zzso and the zzso of zzso against zzso
