The problem of discovering novel motifs of binding sites is important to the understanding of gene regulatory zzso zzso are generally represented by zzso zzso weight zzso zzso or position specific scoring zzso zzso or zzso However, these representations cannot model biological binding sites well because they fail to capture zzso zzso It has been pointed out by many researchers that the zzso of the DNA binding site cannot be treated zzso zzso the binding sites of zinc finger in zzso In this paper, a new representation called zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a zzso of the zzso and string zzso is introduced which takes into consideration the dependent zzso of neighboring zzso Even though the problem of discovering the optimal motif in zzso representation is proved to be zzso we introduce a zzso zzso called zzso which can effectively find optimal motifs in most simulated cases and some real cases for which existing popular motif finding software, such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso
