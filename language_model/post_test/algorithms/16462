A new method for computing the signal zzso due to restricted diffusion in a linear magnetic field zzso is zzso A fast random walk zzso zzso for simulating random zzso of zzso zzso particles is combined with zzso zzso As random moves of a zzso are continuously adapted to local geometrical length zzso the method is efficient for simulating zzso zzso experiments in zzso or zzso porous media such as concrete, zzso zzso rocks and, zzso brain or zzso
