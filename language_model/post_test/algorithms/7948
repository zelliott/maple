We demonstrate the feasibility of characterizing the zzso and scattering zzso of zzso structures in a zzso medium using a zzso optical zzso zzso zzso system with a bandwidth of zzso zzso zzso zzso are taken from zzso composed of fluorescent zzso The zzso and scattering zzso are recovered with proper selections of spatial window zzso in the post processing zzso Furthermore, we present an analysis using zzso zzso simulation based on zzso solutions of the Maxwell's zzso to zzso the zzso of the multiple zzso in the zzso image for a single zzso Finally, we demonstrate the possibility of identifying contrast agents concentrated in zzso scale in an zzso zzso Two different types of zzso in gel phantom are zzso based on their distinguished zzso zzso
