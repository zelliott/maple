The purpose of this study was to test the functional and data collection capabilities of an online nutrition zzso for patients with chronic kidney disease by comparing zzso nutrition diagnoses, zzso and interventions in zzso zzso patients with and without diabetes zzso zzso 

Data were collected using an online nutrition screening tool and zzso for HD patients based on the American zzso Association's Nutrition Care zzso 

Data were collected by zzso in the United States, New Zealand, Australia, and zzso 

Patients undergoing HD under the care of a participating zzso and who were deemed at nutrition risk at visit 1 were eligible to zzso Other inclusion criteria included age zzso years, able to speak and write English, and not receiving hospice care or the international zzso Data were available on 26 patients zzso zzso zzso with zzso Mean baseline values were as zzso age, zzso years; body mass index, zzso zzso and serum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There were no statistically significant differences between zzso and zzso patients except in mean zzso zzso 

zzso in the frequency of selection of diagnoses, zzso and intervention categories were zzso 

The zzso is under continuous development using input from participating zzso but its use was generally considered zzso The initial data analysis showed that the zzso is an effective method for collecting data on HD zzso In this small zzso patients with and without zzso had similar zzso nutrition diagnoses and zzso but had statistically significant differences in the zzso nutrition interventions that were selected most zzso Health Care Team zzso was selected more often in zzso patients zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso Foods was selected more often in zzso patients zzso zzso zzso 

This preliminary analysis shows that the zzso can be used as both a clinical and a data collection zzso The test analysis, although small in sample size, showed interesting differences in the care of zzso and zzso HD zzso
