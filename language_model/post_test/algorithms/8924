Contemporary genetic studies are revealing the genetic complexity of many traits in humans and model zzso Two hallmarks of this complexity are zzso meaning zzso interaction, and zzso in which one gene affects multiple zzso zzso the genetic architecture of complex traits requires addressing these phenomena, but interpreting the biological significance of zzso and zzso is often zzso While zzso reveals zzso between genetic zzso it is often unclear how the activity of one zzso is specifically zzso the zzso zzso found in one zzso context may disappear in another context, rendering the genetic interaction zzso zzso can suggest either redundant zzso measures or gene zzso that affect multiple biological zzso Here we present an R package, zzso which addresses these interpretation ambiguities by implementing a novel method to generate zzso and zzso genetic networks that influence quantitative zzso zzso zzso information from multiple related zzso to zzso models of zzso thereby enhancing the detection of interactions that simultaneously describe all zzso The networks zzso by zzso are readily zzso in terms of directed influences that indicate zzso and enhancing effects of individual genetic zzso on other zzso which in turn account for the zzso in quantitative zzso We demonstrate the utility of zzso by analyzing a mouse zzso thereby discovering novel zzso interactions influencing zzso related to obesity and zzso zzso is an zzso zzso R package and can be applied to data from both genetic screens and a variety of segregating populations including zzso zzso and natural zzso The package is freely available under the zzso license at zzso
