The zzso zzso does not compromise zzso is minimally zzso and is effective as a treatment for zzso zzso The authors evaluated the effects of zzso on the major zzso responses in zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

Nine volunteers were studied on three randomly assigned days: zzso control zzso zzso zzso at a target plasma concentration of 35 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at a target concentration of 70 zzso zzso dose, approximately 20 zzso zzso Each day, skin and core temperatures were increased to provoke sweating and then reduced to elicit peripheral zzso and zzso The authors determined the thresholds zzso core temperature at a designated skin temperature of 34 degrees zzso by zzso zzso for changes in skin temperature using the established linear zzso contributions to control of each zzso 

zzso did not significantly modify the slopes for sweating zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso significantly reduced the slope of shivering zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso high-dose zzso reduced the shivering threshold by zzso zzso zzso degrees C zzso zzso zzso without any discernible effect on the sweating or zzso zzso 

Most drugs with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso reduce the zzso and shivering zzso However, zzso reduced only the shivering zzso This pattern has not previously been reported for a centrally acting zzso That zzso zzso of zzso and shivering can be separated is of clinical and zzso zzso
