A genetic zzso zzso is used to zzso parameters for zzso regulation of zzso in a model of a zzso futile cycle, in which two zzso are zzso by a pair of irreversible zzso zzso The cycle is regulated by end products of the surrounding zzso The zzso criterion for the zzso is the proper direction of chemical flux in the regulated cycle toward one or the other end product in response to a simple, zzso model of zzso zzso based on zzso imposed variation of the end product zzso An energetic cost, to be held to a zzso is also imposed on the operation of the zzso The best-performing individuals selected by the zzso are found to switch rapidly the direction of net flux according to zzso In different zzso zzso time courses of end product zzso the zzso produces zzso or zzso zzso In some cases zzso and zzso are zzso The present approach provides, purely as a consequence of formally specifying the task of flux direction, the new result of zzso confirmation, in a simple model, of the zzso that negative feedback and zzso regulation are important for good flux direction in arbitrary zzso and gives rise to a diversity of structures, suggestive of the results of biological zzso
