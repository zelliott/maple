This paper is concerned with the state zzso problem for a class of zzso zzso neural networks zzso with random zzso The effect of both variation range and distribution probability of the time delay are taken into account in the proposed zzso The zzso disturbances are described in terms of a zzso motion and the zzso delay is characterized by introducing a zzso zzso zzso By employing a zzso functional, sufficient zzso conditions are established in terms of linear zzso zzso zzso that guarantee the existence of the state zzso which can be checked readily by the zzso zzso The main feature of the results obtained in this paper is that they are dependent on not only the bound but also the distribution probability of the time zzso and we obtain a larger allowance variation range of the zzso hence our results are less conservative than the traditional zzso zzso One example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed zzso
