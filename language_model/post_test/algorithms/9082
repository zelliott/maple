zzso affect climate, health and zzso Currently, their retrieval assumes a zzso atmosphere and solely vertical zzso zzso We propose a principle to estimate the zzso distribution as it really is: a three zzso zzso zzso The principle is a type of zzso The process involves wide angle integral imaging of the sky on a very large zzso The imaging can use an array of cameras in visible zzso We formulate an image formation model based on zzso zzso zzso Model inversion is done using zzso methods, exploiting a zzso zzso which we derive for the zzso cost zzso The zzso model is zzso as the radiation source is zzso and zzso while zzso scattering dominates the zzso
