We propose a technique to obtain accurate and smooth surfaces of patient specific vascular structures, using two steps: zzso and zzso The first step provides accurate and smooth zzso of the vessels, together with cross section zzso and cross section zzso The initial zzso are obtained from a zzso thinning of the vessels segmented using a level set zzso In addition to circle fitting, an zzso scheme fitting zzso to the cross sections and correcting the zzso positions is proposed, leading to a strong improvement of the cross section zzso and of the location of the zzso The second step consists of reconstructing the surface based on this data, by generating a set of zzso preserved zzso patches of branching zzso zzso It improves zzso meshing method zzso et zzso 2004) zzso allowing a vessel to have multiple parents and children, reducing zzso artifacts, and adapting the cross section zzso zzso on phantom and real zzso show that the proposed technique reaches a good balance in terms of zzso number of zzso and distance zzso This technique can be applied in zzso zzso simulations, virtual zzso and in reconstruction of smooth and accurate three-dimensional models for use in zzso
