An automated zzso is presented that zzso protein sequence fragments which display zzso The method incorporates a selection of a number of local zzso sequence alignments with the highest similarity scores and a zzso approach to zzso the consistent start and end points of the fragments zzso one or more ensembles of related zzso The procedure allows the simultaneous identification of different types of repeats within one zzso A multiple alignment of the resulting fragments is performed and a consensus sequence derived from the zzso Finally, a profile is constructed from the multiple alignment to detect possible and more distant members within the zzso The method zzso zzso in the repeats as well as insertions and zzso The sequence spans between the various repeats or repeat clusters may be of different zzso The technique has been applied to a number of proteins where the repeating fragments have been derived from information additional to the protein zzso
