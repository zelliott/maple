Completing everyday tasks often requires the execution of action sequences matched to a particular zzso To study the neural processes underlying these behaviors, we trained monkeys to produce a series of eye movements according to a sequence that changed unpredictably from one block of trials to the zzso We then applied a decoding zzso to estimate which sequence was being represented by the ensemble activity in prefrontal zzso We found that the sequence predicted by this analysis changed gradually from the sequence that had been correct in the previous block to the sequence that was correct in the current block, closely following the fraction of executed movements that were consistent with the corresponding zzso Thus, the neural activity zzso tracked the zzso uncertainty about the correct sequence of zzso These results are consistent with prefrontal involvement in representing zzso knowledge of the correct action zzso
