At clinically relevant zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso enhance zzso action on the zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso do zzso Many zzso also directly activate and/or inhibit zzso zzso actions that may produce important behavioral zzso although, the effects of zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso direct zzso and zzso have not been zzso In this study, we assessed the abilities of two representative zzso zzso zzso and zzso to enhance zzso action, directly zzso and inhibit currents zzso by expressed zzso zzso receptors using zzso zzso Our studies reveal that zzso pane and zzso enhance zzso action on the zzso zzso at zzso that exceed those required to produce zzso Neither zzso zzso directly activated nor inhibited zzso zzso even at zzso that approach their zzso saturated zzso These results strongly suggest that the behavioral actions of zzso zzso zzso do not result from their abilities to enhance zzso actions, directly zzso or inhibit zzso zzso receptors and are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso interactions between zzso and their protein binding sites zzso zzso zzso zzso 

When zzso to either their in zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso are zzso orders of magnitude less potent enhancers of zzso action on zzso zzso receptors than zzso Additionally, zzso and zzso fail to directly activate or inhibit zzso even at near zzso zzso zzso Thus, it is unlikely that either enhancement or zzso of the most common zzso zzso zzso in the brain accounts for the behavioral activities of zzso and zzso
