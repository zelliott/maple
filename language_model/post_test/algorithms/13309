During a recent experiment in zzso Hawaii, zzso transmissions were conducted between two acoustic zzso mounted on the zzso at a depth of 100 zzso The passage of moving surface wave zzso was shown to generate focused and intense coherent acoustic returns, which had increasing or decreasing delay depending on the direction of propagation relative to the direction of surface wave zzso It is shown that a rough surface two-dimensional zzso equation model with an evolving sea surface can produce qualitative agreement with data for the dynamic surface zzso
