A new application of zzso is reported in which the zzso pair zzso serve as objective function in zzso zzso The zzso genetic zzso of zzso is used to search for favorable zzso binding modes guided by zzso zzso as representations of the protein binding zzso The approach is found to be successful in many cases where zzso zzso of already zzso zzso zzso does not yield satisfactory zzso Compared to the zzso scoring function, zzso yields slightly superior results in flexible zzso
