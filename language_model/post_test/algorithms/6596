zzso zzso zzso therapy is increasingly used for primary and zzso solid tumors in the zzso We present an analysis of 4 zzso zzso previously treated with zzso zzso agents zzso or zzso One tumor zzso was analyzed with zzso three-dimensional zzso 

Four patients received zzso artery delivery of zzso zzso for zzso zzso and colon zzso Whole zzso were zzso as part of lifesaving zzso transplant in 2 patients with zzso These patients had received glass zzso as a procedural bridge to zzso zzso was performed on 2 patients with colon cancer who died of progressive zzso disease and who had been treated with zzso zzso Complete zzso review was performed on each whole liver, including zzso of the response of the tumor to therapy, distribution of zzso in the tumor and normal liver zzso and zzso radiation zzso A biopsy taken from the edge of a tumor zzso was zzso serially for three-dimensional radiation zzso zzso zzso zzso coordinates within the biopsy zzso were used to calculate dosage using a three-dimensional dose zzso zzso coverage of tumor and normal liver areas and total dose delivered were zzso 

zzso and zzso deposition of zzso was noted at the edge of tumor zzso compared with the center portion of the tumor or normal liver zzso Both glass and zzso zzso delivered high cumulative doses to the zzso which varied from 100 zzso to more than zzso zzso No zzso disease or widespread radiation zzso was zzso 

zzso zzso therapy delivers high numbers of spheres with resulting high total doses of radiation, zzso in the periphery of zzso zzso liver zzso showed little radiation effect away from the zzso zzso high-dose regions in the tumor were produced by both glass and zzso zzso
