The functional organization of the cerebral zzso is modified dramatically by sensory experience during early zzso zzso The basis for these modifications is a type of synaptic plasticity that may also contribute to some forms of adult zzso The question of how zzso modify according to experience has been approached by determining theoretically what is required of a modification mechanism to account for the available experimental data in the developing visual zzso The resulting theory states precisely how certain variables might influence synaptic zzso This insight has led to the development of a biologically plausible molecular model for zzso modification in the cerebral zzso
