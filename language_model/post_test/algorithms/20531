This paper discusses a computerized zzso to derive the formula for the likelihood ratio for a kinship problem with any arbitrarily defined relationships based on genetic zzso The ordinary zzso case with the familiar likelihood formula zzso is the zzso zzso More generally, any zzso collection of people can be genetically tested to help settle some argument about how they are zzso what one might call a zzso zzso Examples that zzso and DNA identification laboratories run into include zzso incest, zzso zzso zzso and corpse identification zzso The strength of the genetic evidence is always described by a likelihood zzso The general method is described by which the computer program finds the formulas appropriate to these various zzso The benefits and the interest of the program are discussed using many examples, including analyses that have previously been published, some practical problems, and simple and useful rules for dealing with scenarios in which ancestral or fraternal types substitute for those of the alleged zzso
