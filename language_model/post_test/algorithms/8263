zzso management guided by zzso zzso monitor has been reported to improve zzso zzso Stroke volume variation zzso is considered a reliable clinical predictor of fluid zzso zzso the aim of the present trial was to evaluate the accuracy of zzso determined by zzso pulse zzso zzso analysis, using the zzso system, to predict fluid responsiveness as measured by the zzso zzso 

Patients undergoing major abdominal surgery received zzso fluid management guided by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of 250 zzso each were administered in case of a decrease in corrected flow time zzso to zzso zzso Patients were connected to a monitoring device, obtaining zzso by zzso zzso variables were recorded before and after fluid zzso zzso zzso responsiveness was defined as an increase in stroke volume index zzso The ability of zzso to predict fluid responsiveness was assessed by calculation of the area under the receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso 

Twenty patients received 67 fluid zzso zzso of the 67 fluid zzso administered resulted in fluid zzso zzso achieved an area under the zzso curve of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso point for fluid responsiveness was found for zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso positive zzso value: zzso and negative zzso value: zzso 

This zzso zzso zzso study demonstrates that zzso obtained by zzso using the zzso system, is not a reliable predictor of fluid responsiveness in the setting of major abdominal zzso
