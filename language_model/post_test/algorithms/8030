zzso characteristics of zzso zzso waves have been extracted by using a zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso is usually not recorded in clinical practice and zzso zzso are derived from the zzso zzso zzso We evaluated the suitability of the reconstruction of zzso leads from the zzso zzso for zzso waves in zzso 

We used the zzso zzso diagnostic zzso database, which contains 15 simultaneously recorded signals zzso zzso and three Frank zzso zzso of 13 patients during zzso Frank leads were derived from the zzso zzso by using zzso inverse zzso zzso leads were then compared to true Frank leads in terms of the relative error zzso We calculated the orientation of zzso zzso of both recorded zzso leads and derived leads and measured the difference in estimated zzso Also, we investigated the relationship of errors in derivation with zzso wave zzso frequency, wave zzso and fit to a plane of the zzso zzso 

Errors in derivation of zzso zzso were 68 zzso zzso and errors in the zzso of orientation were zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso We did not find any correlation among these errors and zzso frequency, or other zzso 

In conclusion, zzso inverse transform should not be used for the derivation of zzso leads from the zzso zzso for the analysis of zzso wave zzso in zzso zzso parameters obtained after this derivation may differ from those obtained from recorded zzso zzso
