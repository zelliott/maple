zzso copy number changes zzso are common in cell populations that undergo multiple cell divisions including zzso zzso cell lines and tumor zzso Identification of zzso is critical in evolutionary studies, where changes in copy number serve an zzso purpose, as well as in cancer studies, where zzso and deletions of zzso regions have been identified as a major zzso zzso zzso can be studied on zzso level using array zzso (a zzso method that measures the DNA zzso but their presence also affects gene zzso In gene expression zzso analysis, identification of copy number changes is especially important in preventing zzso biological conclusions based on zzso gene expression correlation or masked zzso that arise due to zzso Previously suggested approaches for zzso detection from zzso data mostly focus on array zzso address only zzso or zzso copy number changes, and rely on thresholds or other zzso making them zzso for fully automated general application to gene expression zzso There is a need for a general and robust method for identification of zzso of any size from both array zzso and gene expression zzso zzso 

We present zzso zzso zzso Region zzso a robust and accurate zzso based method for identification of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from gene expression and array zzso zzso zzso zzso evaluation of the zzso on synthetic and biological data shows that the method is robust to noise, zzso segment size and zzso zzso Using our approach, we identify known zzso changes and predict novel potential zzso zzso in commonly used zzso deletion strains and in breast zzso zzso can be routinely used to identify zzso in array zzso zzso and to screen gene expression data for zzso or array zzso Our methodology is sensitive enough to detect statistically significant and biologically relevant zzso even when expression or DNA content changes are subtle as in mixed populations of zzso
