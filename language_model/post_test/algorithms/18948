The present study aims to derive guidelines that identify patients for whom zzso can reliably predict a reduced total lung capacity zzso A total of zzso lung function tests were zzso on Caucasian subjects, aged zzso zzso zzso was defined as a reduced zzso Lower limits of normal zzso for TLC were obtained from the European Respiratory Society recommended reference zzso zzso equations from the National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso III were used for forced vital capacity zzso and forced zzso volume in six seconds zzso The performance of zzso and zzso to predict the presence of restriction was studied as zzso 1) using zzso zzso zzso and 2) by zzso zzso zzso Both analyses were performed in zzso zzso as forced zzso volume in one second zzso or zzso zzso and zzso subgroups, and separately for males and zzso The zzso tables showed generally low positive and high negative zzso values for zzso or zzso below their zzso in predicting a reduced zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that in zzso subjects, restriction can be positively predicted if zzso or zzso is zzso predicted zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso can be ruled out if zzso or zzso in six seconds is zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso In zzso patients, zzso cannot reliably diagnose a zzso restrictive zzso but it can rule out restriction for patients with forced vital capacity or forced zzso volume in six seconds zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso
