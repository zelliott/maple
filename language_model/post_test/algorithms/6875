A particle trap zzso system has been developed and tested for the sampling of ambient zzso zzso Use of a particle trap zzso allows for a reduction of particle bounce and zzso at high particle zzso and operation at high zzso flow rates is achieved without the use of zzso zzso zzso thus zzso the chemical and physical analysis of the organic compounds zzso the collected gas zzso and particle zzso zzso zzso zzso have a greater density of channels for a given zzso zzso area than parallel plate or zzso zzso for a given sampling flow rate, honeycomb zzso can be zzso in more compact shapes and will have a greater amount of surface area for the collection of zzso Field testing of the zzso was conducted primarily at night to minimize the evaporation of organic carbon zzso from collected zzso which can result from the heating of collected particles as ambient temperatures rise during the zzso In side-by-side testing with an zzso filter pack zzso the zzso system was found to minimize positive gas zzso artifacts caused by the zzso of gaseous OC to zzso filter fiber zzso zzso In the zzso zzso negligible amounts of OC were observed on a zzso placed downstream of a zzso zzso suggesting that OC detected on the backup zzso in the filter pack zzso resulted primarily from the zzso of ambient zzso OC rather than OC evaporated from particles collected on the front zzso zzso are presented for the evaluation of the magnitude of positive and negative sampling zzso Analysis of these equations indicates that the mass of OC evaporated from zzso particles present downstream of a zzso depends on zzso the volume of zzso gas passed through the zzso zzso the zzso concentration and the zzso partition zzso zzso of the compounds zzso the zzso zzso zzso the temperature zzso zzso of zzso are zzso zzso to zzso and zzso the mass fraction of carbon in the compounds zzso zzso zzso For these reasons, the magnitude of zzso losses of OC in zzso samplers may vary among different sampling zzso In addition, a method utilizing gas zzso zzso has been developed for determination of zzso zzso collection efficiency and zzso particle transmission zzso Using this method, only a single extraction of the zzso components is necessary, thereby reducing the number of zzso and analyses over conventional approaches by at least a factor of zzso
