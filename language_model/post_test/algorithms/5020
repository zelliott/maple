The aim of this paper is to show some recent developments of zzso zzso theory, as pioneered by zzso zzso and zzso The new results allow to predict much more accurately the detection zzso This step is unavoidable if one wants to analyze visual detection thresholds in the light of zzso zzso zzso The paper first recalls the main elements of zzso zzso zzso It points out a precision issue in this theory, essentially due to the use of discrete probability zzso It then proposes to overcome this issue by using continuous probability zzso and illustrates it on the meaningful alignment detector of zzso et zzso
