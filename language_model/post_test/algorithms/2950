zzso of media components for the growth and biomass production of zzso zzso zzso zzso was carried out using response surface zzso A second order zzso model was estimated and media components were determined based on zzso zzso equation generated by zzso These were zzso g zzso of zzso zzso g zzso of zzso zzso g zzso of gelatin and zzso g zzso of soluble starch in zzso broth supplemented with artificial seawater with zzso zzso of zzso In these optimal conditions, the obtained cell concentration of zzso g zzso dry weight was in agreement with the predicted cell zzso The zzso media significantly shortened the time required for cell culture to reach the stationary phase while providing a nearly zzso increase in biomass zzso Furthermore, in cell cultures of three other zzso zzso the use of zzso media enhanced growth rate and provided zzso zzso
