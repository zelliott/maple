zzso is a designed zzso zzso that, in spite of its size, shares several features with larger zzso zzso the system has been zzso investigated zzso and zzso its folding mechanism is not yet fully zzso Indeed, some experiments suggest a two-state behavior, while others point to the presence of zzso In this work we show that the results of a zzso zzso simulation can be used for constructing a detailed zzso and kinetic model of the zzso The model, although constructed from a biased zzso has a quality similar to those extracted from the analysis of long unbiased molecular dynamics zzso This is demonstrated by a careful benchmark of the approach on a smaller system, the zzso zzso zzso For zzso zzso the model predicts that the relaxation time of zzso zzso observed zzso is due to the presence of a compact molten zzso zzso This state has an occupancy of only zzso at 300 K, but acts as a kinetic zzso zzso structures relax to the folded state on the zzso zzso The model also predicts the presence of a state at zzso of zzso A from the zzso structure in which the zzso strongly interacts with zzso This state can explain the abnormal temperature dependence of the zzso and zzso chemical zzso The structures of the two most stable zzso zzso are in agreement with zzso experiments on the unfolded zzso Our work shows that, using biased molecular dynamics zzso it is possible to construct a model describing in detail the zzso folding zzso and thermodynamics in agreement with experimental zzso
