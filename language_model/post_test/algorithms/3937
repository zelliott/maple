The mechanical properties of bacterial cells are determined by their zzso zzso The size of typical bacterial cells, and the fact that different time and length scales govern their behavior, zzso special experimental techniques in order to probe their mechanical properties under various zzso zzso Here, we present such an experimental technique to study cell mechanics using zzso forces in a zzso zzso We demonstrate the application of this technique by calculating the zzso rigidity of zzso zzso coli zzso In addition, we compare the deformation of zzso cells under growing and zzso conditions during the deformation zzso We show that, at low forces, the force needed to zzso growing cells to the same extent as zzso cells is approximately two times zzso Following previous works, we interpret these results as the outcome of the difference between the elastic response of zzso cells and the zzso response of growing zzso Finally, we observe some zzso in the response of individual cells to the applied zzso We suggest that this results from the individuality of different bacterial zzso
