zzso optical imaging zzso may be a beneficial diagnostic method for women with zzso dense breast zzso In order to evaluate the utility of zzso we are developing broadband diffuse optical zzso zzso to characterize the functional origins of optical signals in breast cancer zzso zzso zzso combines zzso zzso and zzso zzso light to zzso tissue zzso and scattering zzso from 650 to 1000 zzso zzso of intrinsic zzso properties zzso and zzso water, zzso and scatter power) derived from zzso and scattering zzso provide detailed information on breast zzso We present the results of clinical studies of 58 stage zzso zzso breast tumors using a zzso zzso broadband zzso zzso On average, eight positions were scanned over tumor and zzso normal breast for each zzso zzso zzso properties were statistically significantly different for zzso zzso normal zzso for all subjects, without patient age or tumor zzso zzso Breast zzso containing zzso tumors displayed reduced zzso content ( approximately zzso and increased water, zzso and zzso zzso each) compared to normal breast zzso zzso zzso by the tumor were significantly larger than functional variations in normal zzso A tissue optical index zzso derived from intrinsic zzso properties yielded an average zzso contrast difference between zzso tumors and intrinsic tissue zzso Our results demonstrate that intrinsic optical signals can be influenced by functional zzso characteristic of zzso zzso cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our findings further underscore the importance of broadband zzso and patient age zzso in breast cancer zzso
