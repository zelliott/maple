In recent years, many investigators have proposed Gibbs prior models to zzso images reconstructed from zzso zzso zzso zzso Unfortunately, zzso used to specify Gibbs zzso can greatly influence the degree of zzso imposed by such zzso and, as a result, numerous procedures have been proposed to estimate zzso values from observed image zzso Many of these procedures attempt to maximize the joint zzso distribution on the image zzso To implement these methods, approximations to the joint zzso zzso are required, because the dependence of the Gibbs partition function on the zzso values is zzso In this paper, we use recent results in zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso sampling to estimate the relative values of Gibbs partition functions and using these values, sample from joint zzso zzso on image zzso This allows for a fully zzso procedure which does not fix the zzso at some estimated or specified value, but enables uncertainty about these values to be zzso through to the estimated zzso We zzso zzso from the zzso distribution for determining credible regions for the intensity of the zzso zzso We consider two different zzso random field zzso zzso power model and a zzso zzso As applications we estimate the zzso distribution of source zzso from computer simulated data as well as data collected from a physical single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
