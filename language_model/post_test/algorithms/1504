To test a model for the assessment of critical care technology on closed loop infusion control, a technology that is in its early stages of development and testing on human zzso 

A zzso search of the English language literature and reviews of the gathered data by experts in the field of closed loop infusion control zzso 

Studies relating to closed loop infusion control that addressed one or more of the questions contained in our technology assessment template were zzso Study design was not a factor in article zzso However, the lack of zzso clinical outcome studies was an important factor in determining our zzso 

A focus person summarized the data from the selected studies that related to each of the assessment zzso The preliminary data summary developed by the focus person was further analyzed and refined by the task zzso Experts in closed loop systems were then added to the group to review the summary provided by the task zzso These zzso comments were considered by the task force and this final consensus report was zzso 

Closed loop system control is a technological concept that may be zzso to several aspects of critical care zzso This is a technology in the early stages of evolution and much more research and data are needed before its introduction into usual clinical zzso Furthermore, each specific application and each device for each application zzso zzso infusion, zzso zzso although based on the same technological concept, are sufficiently different in terms of hardware and computer zzso to require independent validation zzso 

Closed loop infusion systems may have a role in critical care zzso However, for most applications, further development is required to move this technology from the innovation phase to the point where it can be evaluated so that its role in critical car practice can be zzso Each application of closed loop infusion systems must be independently validated by appropriately designed research zzso Users should be provided with the clinical parameters driving each closed loop system so that they can ensure that it agrees with their opinion of acceptable medical zzso Clinical researchers and leaders in industry should collaborate to perform the zzso zzso zzso research that is necessary to evaluate the effect of this new zzso The original model we developed for technology assessment required the addition of several more questions to produce a complete analysis of an emerging zzso An emerging technology should be systematically assessed zzso a model such as the model developed by the Society of Critical Care zzso before its introduction into clinical practice in order to provide a focus for human outcome validation trials and to minimize the possibility of widespread use of an unproven zzso
