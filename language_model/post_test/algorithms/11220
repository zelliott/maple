zzso correction is essential for reliable interpretation of zzso zzso however, the use of transmission zzso to generate zzso maps is limited by availability of equipment and potential zzso between the transmission and zzso zzso The authors present a first step toward a method of zzso an zzso map from measured scatter data without a transmission zzso 

A scatter model has been developed that accurately predicts the distribution of photons which have been scattered zzso The scatter model has been used as the basis of a maximum likelihood zzso ascent method to estimate an zzso map from measured scatter zzso In order to estimate both the zzso map and activity distribution, zzso of the derived scatter based zzso have been zzso with the maximum likelihood expectation zzso zzso in a joint zzso zzso For each iteration of the zzso map zzso the activity distribution is fixed at the values estimated during the previous activity zzso and in each iteration of the activity distribution zzso the zzso map is fixed at the values estimated during the previous zzso zzso The use of zzso data to enhance the zzso of the zzso map compared to the use of scatter data alone has also been zzso The zzso derived has been used to reconstruct data simulated for an idealized two-dimensional situation and using a physical zzso 

The reconstruction of idealized data demonstrated good reconstruction of both the activity distribution and zzso zzso The inclusion of information recorded in the zzso energy window in the zzso map zzso step demonstrated an improvement in the accuracy of the zzso enabling an accurate zzso map to be zzso zzso of the results with physical phantom data demonstrated that different regions of zzso could be distinguished in a real situation and produces results that represent a promising first step toward the use of scatter data to estimate the activity distribution and zzso map from single zzso zzso zzso zzso data without a transmission zzso 

The technique presented shows promise as a method of zzso correction for zzso data without the need for a separate transmission zzso Further work is required to further improve the method and to compensate for the assumptions used in the scatter zzso
