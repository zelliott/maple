A therapeutic benefit can be achieved by zzso zzso if zzso have small zzso sensitivities characterized by zzso values greater than those for late effects of dose limiting normal zzso It is the purpose of the present paper to estimate zzso values for head and neck zzso from zzso zzso zzso 

zzso likelihood estimates the zzso ratio were obtained from zzso control data from the zzso zzso trials using the zzso model and a zzso or zzso type zzso zzso A joint analysis of five zzso zzso trials for head and neck zzso was performed to estimate overall zzso and zzso values for zzso zzso In addition, zzso ratios for the individual trials were estimated using fixed zzso values zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso between zzso and 5 for zzso 

An overall zzso of zzso zzso was estimated for the zzso control relation from the zzso trials, assuming a zzso or zzso zzso zzso The zzso showed small zzso sensitivities characterized by an overall zzso of zzso zzso zzso One trial allowed quantitative zzso of the zzso values for late normal tissue zzso The zzso estimate for late effects of grade 2 + was zzso zzso zzso assuming a fixed zzso of 5 and was even smaller for smaller zzso zzso 

Head and neck zzso showed small zzso sensitivities with zzso values greater than those typical for bone, soft zzso and skin, as well as steep dose response zzso Thus, important zzso for improving the therapeutic benefit of zzso of head and neck zzso by zzso are fulfilled for patients who met the zzso criteria of the zzso
