The aim of this paper is to report a method of zzso plaque tissue zzso based on pattern recognition and assess its accuracy under conditions of potential clinical zzso 

zzso saline infused human arteries were zzso using zzso with zzso zzso zzso of the vessels were zzso with human blood zzso A database of approximately zzso image zzso zzso of zzso established types was used to design a pattern recognition zzso to predict the tissue type of a given zzso by comparing its zzso against the database, and also to estimate the confidence of zzso zzso zzso validation demonstrated zzso at the highest level of confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions zzso Good agreement with zzso was shown in an in zzso zzso animal zzso 

zzso zzso validation demonstrated the ability to zzso plaque tissue using an zzso system and a method incorporating zzso full spectral information zzso spectral similarity zzso zzso confidence of zzso and, zzso ability to zzso plaque zzso through zzso Promising results were demonstrated in a live animal zzso This approach may have potential for accurate and zzso plaque zzso in zzso
