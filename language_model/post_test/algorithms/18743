Until now, input function is still required in zzso of local cerebral zzso rate of zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Some zzso methods were developed to get input function zzso instead of the zzso blood sampling method, but they needed to make complicated corrections zzso so they cannot always be applied in clinic zzso Here, we propose a simple method based on the zzso approach by using a reference tissue region and without using any information of input zzso This simulation study revealed that the present method was in good agreement with zzso zzso the difference between two methods was less than zzso The statistical errors with two methods were also zzso and the results showed the accuracy of zzso estimated with present method was better than that with zzso method zzso The simulation results indicated that the calculation of zzso with present method was quite stable and independent of the choosing of reference tissue zzso All of these show that the present method is a good approximation to zzso zzso The calculation with this method is very simple and easy to perform zzso by zzso therefore, it can be widely used not only in laboratory studies but also in clinical applications although it only provides the relative zzso
