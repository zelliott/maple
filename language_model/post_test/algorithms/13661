The development of DNA sequencing methods for characterizing microbial communities has evolved rapidly over the past zzso To evaluate more zzso as well as newer zzso for DNA library preparation and sequencing, we compared zzso zzso shotgun and zzso zzso libraries prepared from the same zzso DNA zzso zzso content was elevated in all zzso libraries, compared with shotgun and zzso zzso zzso composition of the different libraries suggested that this was caused by a relative zzso of dominant zzso groups with low zzso content, notably zzso and the zzso zzso in zzso zzso While these abundant zzso had a large impact on library zzso we also observed a positive correlation between zzso zzso content and zzso library representation in other zzso zzso suggesting a general zzso Analysis of gene category representation in different libraries indicated that the functional composition of a library was largely a reflection of its zzso zzso and no additional systematic biases against particular functional categories were detected at the level of sequencing depth in our zzso Another important but less predictable factor influencing the apparent zzso and functional library composition was the read length afforded by the different sequencing zzso Our comparisons and analyses provide a detailed perspective on the influence of library type on the recovery of microbial zzso in zzso libraries and underscore the different uses and utilities of more zzso as well as contemporary zzso DNA library construction and sequencing technologies for exploring the zzso of the natural microbial zzso
