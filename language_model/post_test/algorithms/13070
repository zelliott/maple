zzso is able to discover small peripheral lung zzso The nature of these zzso is uncertain but it is reasonable that some of them, in particular the zzso ones, could represent zzso zzso A previous trial showed a reduction in size of peripheral zzso by zzso zzso in subjects with zzso zzso 

The primary objective of the study was the evaluation of the effect of zzso as a zzso agent for lung zzso The primary zzso was the modification of lung zzso at zzso scan zzso to zzso zzso after one year of treatment in a zzso zzso 

We performed a randomized, zzso zzso controlled trial to evaluate whether zzso zzso was able to reduce size and number of persistent, zzso zzso lung zzso in high-risk zzso subjects currently undergoing a five-year CT scan screening program at the European Institute of zzso 

Trial enrollment started in April 2006 and ended in July 2007 with the zzso of 202 current or former smokers with stable zzso lung zzso set to receive zzso 800 zzso or zzso twice daily for 12 zzso 

Our trial represents the first phase II study of a zzso intervention focusing on the peripheral zzso where the majority of lung zzso zzso The research was zzso into a screening project with clear advantages in participant zzso and reduction of zzso This paper describes the rationale and design of the study, thus focusing on the methodology and operational aspects of the clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso
