This report describes the zzso properties of a poorly soluble zzso complex in a zzso based zzso zzso zzso was used as the model drug and zzso zzso as the zzso The zzso complex was prepared by zzso zzso and DOG in ethanol at 60 degrees C followed by evaporation of zzso The formation of the complex with a zzso zzso zzso ratio was confirmed by zzso zzso and zzso At 25 degrees C, total zzso of zzso decreased with increasing DOG zzso The zzso properties of the zzso complex can be described by two simultaneous zzso a zzso phase equilibrium of the complex and a species equilibrium among the various species in the liquid zzso A model equation was derived accordingly with two zzso the intrinsic zzso of the complex zzso and the solution complex constant zzso The model was in good agreement with experimental zzso The values of zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The equation can successfully predict the zzso of total and free zzso as a function of DOG in the zzso The approach developed provides a useful tool for rationale selection of zzso and their levels to avoid drug zzso in zzso based zzso
