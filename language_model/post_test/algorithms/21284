The zzso zzso acts on a variety of target cells to stimulate the processes of zzso and cell zzso In this study we determined whether zzso receptors interact with known zzso zzso proteins in four different cell zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso pancreatic zzso cells, Swiss zzso zzso and rat brain zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso binding to zzso receptors in zzso from all four zzso In zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso binding with zzso values of about zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso were approximately zzso less zzso In contrast, zzso and the zzso zzso analog zzso had no effect at 100 zzso zzso binding experiments in zzso and zzso cell zzso indicated a single class of binding sites with a zzso constant zzso for zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a binding capacity of 176 zzso 15 zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased the apparent affinity of the receptors without significantly changing zzso zzso zzso with this zzso zzso zzso also increased the rate of zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso cells with either zzso toxin zzso zzso or zzso toxin zzso zzso for 18 h did not affect zzso binding to membrane zzso zzso its regulation by zzso zzso or zzso stimulation of hormone zzso Although zzso toxin zzso has been reported to block zzso stimulation of DNA synthesis in Swiss zzso cells, it did not alter the binding properties of zzso receptors in Swiss zzso zzso or inhibit the rapid increase in zzso zzso produced by zzso in these zzso In zzso our results indicate that the zzso zzso interacts with a zzso zzso protein which exhibits a different toxin sensitivity from those which regulate zzso zzso as well as those which couple some receptors to zzso
