zzso zzso zzso extraction is important for zzso tracking of abdominal vessels and guidance of zzso zzso zzso ultrasound has gained increasing acceptance as a safe and convenient surgical image guidance zzso We aimed to zzso vascular zzso detection and tracking in zzso zzso 

To overcome the intrinsic limitation of low ultrasound image quality, an active zzso method zzso was used to track changes in vessel zzso We tested two zzso of a classic snake using the image zzso and zzso zzso field zzso as external zzso We validated these methods in liver ultrasound images of 10 healthy volunteers, acquired at three zzso instances during the exhalation zzso We calculated the distances between the vessel zzso as detected by zzso and a gold standard consisting of manual zzso performed by an zzso 

Both methods zzso and image zzso can accurately estimate the actual zzso with average zzso distances of zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso Both methods can automatically follow vessel zzso and position zzso 

The proposed approach is feasible for liver vessel zzso extraction from zzso ultrasound zzso The zzso can follow the movement of the vessels during zzso further improvements of hardware components are needed for a real-time zzso
