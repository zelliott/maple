The construction of an artificial biological logic circuit using systematic strategy is zzso as one of the most important topics for the development of synthetic zzso In this study, a zzso genetic zzso zzso which combines general advantages of the traditional real genetic zzso with those of the structured genetic algorithm, is proposed to deal with the biological logic circuit design zzso A general model with the zzso input function and appropriate promoter activity functions is proposed to zzso a wide variety of fundamental logic gates such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The results obtained can be extended to zzso advanced zzso and sequential logic circuits by zzso distinct zzso The resulting optimal design of these logic gates and circuits are established via the zzso The in zzso computer-based zzso technology has been verified showing its great advantages in the zzso
