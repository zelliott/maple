In this report, we describe a direct method for zzso atomic force microscope zzso cantilevers with the zzso aspiration technique zzso A closely fitting polystyrene zzso inside a zzso is driven by precisely controlled zzso pressures to apply known loads on the sharp tip of zzso zzso thus providing a zzso at the most functionally relevant zzso The new method is capable of zzso cantilevers with spring zzso ranging from zzso to hundreds of zzso per zzso Under appropriate loading conditions, this new method yields measurement accuracy and precision both within zzso with higher performance for zzso zzso Furthermore, this method may greatly enhance the accuracy and precision of zzso for zzso zzso
