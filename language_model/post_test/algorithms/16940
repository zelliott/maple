zzso used zzso folding programs zzso the minimum free energy structure of a sequence under the zzso exclusion zzso They are based on zzso zzso which runs in time zzso Recently, it has been claimed that zzso folding can be achieved in average time zzso using a zzso zzso A proof of zzso time complexity was based on the assumption that zzso zzso folding obeys the zzso zzso Several zzso of sparse zzso folding zzso were later zzso Here, we present our own version, which is readily zzso to existing zzso folding programs, as it is extremely simple and does not require any new data zzso We applied it to the widely used Vienna zzso program, to create zzso the first public zzso version of a standard zzso folding zzso To gain a better understanding of the time complexity of zzso zzso folding in general, we carried out a thorough run time analysis with synthetic random zzso both in the context of energy zzso and base pairing zzso zzso to previous claims, the zzso time complexity of a zzso zzso folding zzso using standard energy parameters remains zzso under a wide variety of zzso zzso with our zzso analysis, we found that zzso folding does not obey the zzso zzso as claimed zzso Yet, a basic version of a zzso zzso folding zzso provides zzso to zzso speed zzso Surprisingly, the same zzso technique has a different effect when applied to base pairing zzso There, its zzso running time complexity appears to be either zzso or cubic depending on the base zzso The code used in this work is available at: zzso
