zzso ratios or other effect sizes estimated from zzso scans are zzso zzso because only the zzso associations are reported, and zzso only if they reach a defined level of zzso No unbiased estimate exists based on data selected in this fashion, but replication studies are routinely performed that allow unbiased zzso of the effect zzso zzso based on replication data alone is inefficient in the sense that the initial scan could, in principle, contribute information on the effect zzso We propose an unbiased zzso combining information from both the initial scan and the replication study, which is more efficient than that based just on the zzso Specifically, we adjust the standard combined estimate to allow for selection by rank and significance in the initial zzso Our approach explicitly allows for multiple associations arising from a zzso and is robust to zzso of a significance zzso We require replication data to be available but argue that, in most applications, estimates of effect sizes are only useful when associations have been zzso We illustrate our approach on some recently completed scans and explore its efficiency by zzso
