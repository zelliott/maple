zzso dialysis association study involving individual single zzso zzso zzso in the zzso displacement loop zzso has previously been zzso However, possible zzso interactions for zzso in the zzso which could be associated with a reduced risk for chronic dialysis were not zzso The purpose of this study was to propose an effective zzso to identify protective zzso interactions in the zzso from chronic dialysis zzso We introduce zzso that uses an zzso strategy for genetic zzso zzso to improve the zzso analysis for protective zzso zzso zzso generates zzso patterns with combined zzso zzso zzso for chronic zzso Using our previously reported 77 zzso in the zzso the zzso protective zzso zzso for chronic dialysis were zzso zzso provides the zzso zzso with the maximum frequency differences of occurrence between the cases and zzso The identified zzso zzso with the lowest odds ratio zzso values were regarded as the best preventive zzso zzso against chronic zzso The best zzso zzso zzso zzso to nine zzso are more closely associated with the prevention of chronic dialysis when more zzso are chosen zzso to zzso zzso confidence zzso to zzso The cumulative effects of zzso interactions were more dominant in zzso rather than in zzso without the zzso zzso We provide a fast identification of chronic zzso protective zzso zzso and demonstrate that the zzso interactions may have a cumulative effect on prediction for chronic zzso
