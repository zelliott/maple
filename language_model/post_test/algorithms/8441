We undertook an analysis of zzso survival using the zzso zzso Time Without zzso or zzso methodology and developed a new graphic representation called a zzso zzso plot, which presents a complete and concise zzso analysis on a single zzso 

The zzso plot incorporates the time without symptoms or toxicity and several combinations of utility zzso for toxicity and zzso days into the same zzso In addition, the plot includes threshold lines, to judge whether a particular combination of utility zzso reaches a significance zzso 

The differential in toxicity zzso and severity between the two zzso radiation treatment arms was zzso zzso analyses were run using zzso zzso For all combinations of the various toxicity definitions and utility zzso the median zzso was greater for the zzso zzso radiation treatment arm than for the zzso treatment arm, without achieved zzso 

This work zzso the results previously reported for this Phase III clinical trial in patients with zzso zzso cancer, and there was no significant difference in survival after adjusting for toxicity and zzso Furthermore, the new methods developed for this trial allow for a more detailed and zzso presentation of survival and toxicity data for all zzso clinical zzso
