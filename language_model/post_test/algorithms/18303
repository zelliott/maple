The zzso that simple feedback neural circuits representing a brain area can rapidly carry out are often adequate to solve easy problems but for more difficult problems can return incorrect zzso A new zzso circuit model of zzso memory displays the common human problem of failing to rapidly find a memory when only a small clue is zzso The memory model and a related zzso network for solving Sudoku puzzles produce answers that contain implicit check bits in the representation of information across zzso allowing a rapid evaluation of whether the putative answer is correct or incorrect through a zzso related to visual zzso This fact may account for our strong psychological feeling of right or wrong when we retrieve a nominal memory from a minimal zzso This information allows more difficult zzso or memory zzso to be done in a serial fashion by using the fast but limited capabilities of a zzso module multiple zzso The mathematics of the zzso circuits for zzso memory and for zzso both of which are understood in terms of energy or zzso functions, is described in zzso
