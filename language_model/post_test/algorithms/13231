This paper describes an zzso three-dimensional zzso real-time shape measurement technique using our newly developed high-speed 3-D vision zzso It employs only four projection fringes to realize zzso phase zzso in the presence of zzso or isolated zzso With our zzso pattern generation hardware and a modified low-cost zzso zzso the four designed patterns can be generated and projected at a switching speed of 360 zzso Using a properly synchronized high-speed camera, the high-speed fringe patterns distorted by measured objects can be acquired and processed in zzso The resulting system can capture and display high-quality zzso 3-D data at a speed of 120 frames per second, with the resolution of 640 zzso zzso zzso The speed can be zzso if a camera with a higher frame rate is zzso We detail our shape measurement technique, including the zzso decoding zzso as well as the hardware zzso Some evaluation experiments have been carried out to demonstrate the zzso and zzso of the proposed zzso
