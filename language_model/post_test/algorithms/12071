We describe a method of performing salvage prostate zzso on patients whose initial implant was zzso This technique uses an image correlation zzso only previously used to fuse zzso magnetic resonance and zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, the initial zzso CT and the second zzso volume study are zzso to plan delivery of the salvage zzso 

Two zzso patients had salvage implants performed with this technique, in which only a limited number of sources were visible on the ultrasound zzso The zzso results of the first implant were displayed on the zzso generated for the second zzso The planned total dose then was zzso prior to salvage zzso 

The implants were performed without zzso zzso and zzso doses remained zzso In each case, the improvement in coverage of the zzso was dramatic zzso coverage improved from zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso respectively), zzso the need for further zzso 

zzso of the zzso CT scan to an ultrasound volume study can be zzso and reliably zzso The resulting image set can be used to guide needle placement during a second salvage implant to achieve much improved zzso coverage of the zzso
