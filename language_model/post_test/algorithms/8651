The zzso surface of the heart was modeled as zzso zzso element, network of cells connected logically to each zzso An zzso area was represented by a central core of prolonged zzso distributed into zzso elliptical contours such that zzso declined along varying zzso to the surrounding normal zzso zzso of cardiac action zzso was zzso by five sequential states ranging from zzso to zzso zzso zzso was induced by premature stimulation of the network and resembled a zzso zzso type zzso seen zzso zzso patterns of zzso appeared as two propagation zzso which traveled around the ends of a continuous line of functional zzso block, merged into a single zzso then conducted slowly along a retrograde path to reactivate a region zzso to the zzso zzso could be prevented by zzso the distribution of recovery of zzso through stimulation at two zzso located sites during basic zzso Prevention occurred when the second site was situated in an area of prolonged zzso just zzso to the line of zzso These simulations indicate that zzso zzso is characterized by the formation of long lines of zzso block which occur along a border of steeply graded zzso and retrograde slow zzso which occurs along a more shallow zzso zzso The occurrence of zzso is dependent on: 1) the zzso zzso of the premature zzso 2) the location of the stimulus relative to the maximum zzso zzso and 3) the zzso sequence of the basic paced zzso Thus, this paper presents an efficient logical state model of cardiac zzso which simulates zzso observed zzso patterns of zzso and its zzso
