In diagnostic studies without a gold standard, the assumption on the dependence structure of the multiple tests or zzso plays an important role in model zzso In case of zzso disease status, both conditional independence and crossed random effects structure have been proposed and their performance zzso Less attention has been paid to the situation where the true disease status is zzso In this paper, we propose crossed zzso and zzso random effects to account for the dependence structure and assess the zzso of the proposed model to zzso in the random effects zzso We applied the models to data from the zzso zzso zzso which focuses on assessing the diagnostic accuracy in a population of zzso for the staging of zzso a zzso disorder in zzso Using this new methodology, we estimate the probability of a correct zzso and show that regional experts can more easily zzso the intermediate stage than resident zzso
