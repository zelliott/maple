zzso molecules into their respective zzso zzso targets is a widely used method for lead zzso However, the best known zzso zzso often fail to position the zzso in an orientation close to the experimental binding zzso It was reported recently that consensus scoring enhances the hit rates in a virtual screening zzso This methodology focused on the top-ranked pose, with the underlying assumption that the zzso of the zzso compound is the most zzso In an effort to eliminate the scoring function bias, and assess the ability of the zzso zzso to provide solutions similar to the zzso zzso we investigated the most known zzso programs and evaluated all of the zzso zzso We present the results of an extensive zzso study in which five zzso programs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were investigated against 14 protein families zzso zzso Our findings show that some zzso perform consistently better than others, and a correspondence between the nature of the active site and the best zzso zzso can be zzso
