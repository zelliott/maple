We study the zzso dominance of three species in two-dimensional constrained zzso networks with a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso By limiting the zzso connection distance zzso in zzso networks with the long-range connection probability p , we depict more realistically the zzso interactions among species within zzso When we fix mobility and vary the value of p or zzso the zzso Carlo simulations show that the spiral waves grow in size, and the system becomes unstable and zzso is lost with increasing p or zzso These results are similar to recent results of zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in which they increase the mobility only without including long-range zzso We compared zzso with or without long-range connections and zzso spatial correlation functions and correlation zzso We conclude that long-range connections could improve the mobility of species, drastically changing their crossover to extinction and making the system more zzso
