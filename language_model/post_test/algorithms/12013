A new zzso zzso technique for imaging the cortical distribution of zzso activity is zzso An zzso zzso is zzso which successively alters an initial estimate of cortical source structure until it zzso to the measured magnetic field zzso In this new technique, the zzso of electrical activity across the cortical surface is modeled as a dense grid of thousands of single equivalent current zzso zzso imaging of both compact and extended sources is facilitated by a zzso transformation of the source space into a sequence of successively smaller composite source zzso Two of these composite source structures are combined during each zzso step to generate an improved estimate of the cortical source zzso Thus, inversion of the complete gain zzso corresponding to thousands of cortical sources is not zzso The technique requires only moderate PC based resources even for very large source zzso In contrast to minimum norm zzso imaging methods, this new zzso is insensitive to random noise in the zzso If available, prior knowledge of source structure from other imaging techniques, such as zzso zzso and zzso is easily incorporated as additional constraints on the source structure zzso zzso images solutions corresponding to simulated data are zzso In addition, the technique is applied to source imaging of real zzso data incorporating cortical structure from zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate the capability of our new technique for imaging combinations of compact and extended source zzso
