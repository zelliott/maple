Application of mechanical stimuli has been shown to alter gene expression in zzso smooth muscle cells zzso To date, only a limited number of zzso genes in this cell type have been zzso We employed zzso zzso to identify zzso genes in primary culture human zzso zzso subjected to repetitive mechanical stimulation for 4 zzso zzso gene expression between stretched and zzso cells was assessed using zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso of 20 out of zzso expressed genes ( approximately zzso was altered zzso following stretch, with 19 genes induced and one gene zzso zzso Using real-time zzso we tested independently the responsiveness of 15 genes to stretch and to zzso growth zzso zzso another zzso stimulus for zzso zzso In response to both zzso expression of 13 genes increased, 1 gene zzso zzso and 1 gene was zzso Six transcripts zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated using an ex zzso rat model of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased with zzso stretch ex zzso whereas zzso zzso consistent with expression changes observed in zzso In zzso analysis of zzso data using the zzso zzso identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as potential zzso zzso of stretch zzso Furthermore, the promoters of 9 of 13 zzso genes contained zzso binding zzso These observations identify stretch as a highly selective regulator of gene expression in zzso zzso Moreover, they suggest that mechanical and growth factor signals zzso on common zzso regulators that include members of the zzso zzso
