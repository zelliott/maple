The effects of zzso zzso dependent zzso on the stationary gating zzso of single zzso zzso zzso channels was zzso The single-channel activity from canine cardiac zzso was zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso applied zzso increased the single-channel open probability ( zzso of both native and zzso cardiac zzso channels, after zzso with zzso and zzso The action of zzso on the zzso channel occurred only in the presence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but not in the presence of zzso zzso Thus, the action of zzso requires the presence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso channel zzso was blocked by specific zzso zzso All these results confirmed that the zzso channel can be zzso by zzso protein zzso The gating zzso of single zzso channels before zzso treatment were significantly altered by zzso and zzso as zzso zzso In contrast, after zzso treatment, neither zzso nor zzso significantly alters the gating zzso of these zzso zzso zzso thus decreases the zzso and zzso apparent sensitivity in most of the gating parameters of single zzso zzso The zzso zzso channels open and close more zzso stay open for longer, and stay closed for shorter zzso The zzso zzso obtained demonstrate that the zzso and the zzso channels have zzso different open and closed zzso at zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso
