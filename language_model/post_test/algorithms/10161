The rolling six design zzso is currently being used by the Children's Oncology Group zzso as their standard design for Phase I zzso Because the zzso has large zzso trials with fast zzso the motivation for adopting the zzso is to zzso zzso and shorten the duration of their zzso However, trial suspension due to completion of follow-up still cannot be entirely avoided by the zzso zzso a design that allows continuous enrollment of patients throughout the entire trial is zzso 

To demonstrate the superior performance of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with continuous patient recruitment relative to the zzso in terms of identifying the maximum tolerated dose zzso and reducing exposure of patients to toxic zzso 

Using scenarios that were based on an actual pediatric Phase I trial at the University of Michigan, zzso Carlo simulations were used to investigate the operational characteristics of zzso and zzso 

The zzso treated all available patients, identified the zzso more accurately than the zzso and did not increase the probability of exposing patients to toxic zzso 

Both the zzso and zzso assume that the probability of dose limiting toxicity increases with higher dose zzso 

The zzso which allows for continual enrollment of patients, provides a safe design for pediatric zzso Phase I trials with better accuracy than the zzso
