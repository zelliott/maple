The purpose of this paper is to describe automated techniques for the zzso and mapping of zzso cartilage in magnetic resonance zzso images of the zzso zzso The MR sequences and analysis software which will be described allow the assessment of cartilage damage using a range of standard zzso With high field strength systems it would be possible, using these techniques, to assess zzso The specific aim of the paper is to develop and validate software for automated zzso and thickness mapping of zzso cartilage from three-dimensional zzso zzso MR images of the zzso The method can also be used for zzso assessment of tissue engineered zzso Typical values of cartilage thickness over seven defined regions can be obtained in patients with zzso zzso and control subjects without zzso Three groups of patients were zzso The first group comprised patients with moderate zzso in the age range zzso zzso The second group comprised zzso volunteers of zzso years; the third group, younger volunteers selected by clinical interview, history and zzso In this paper, zzso 3-D zzso zzso acquisition images were obtained using a zzso GE zzso scanner with a specialist knee zzso For validation bovine and zzso zzso knees were given artificial cartilage zzso and then zzso The animal zzso showed close agreement between direct zzso zzso and those obtained from the MR zzso The feasibility of zzso zzso is zzso Regional cartilage thickness values are seen as having practical application for fully automated detection of zzso zzso even down to the zzso zzso
