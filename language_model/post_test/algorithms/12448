The traditional zzso risk assessment technique has been applied in many industries due to the capability of combining different parameters to obtain an overall zzso However, a drawback occurs as the technique is applied in circumstances where there are multiple parameters to be evaluated that are described by multiple linguistic zzso 

In this study, a risk prediction model incorporating fuzzy set theory and zzso zzso Network zzso capable of resolving the problem encountered is zzso An zzso capable of converting the zzso parameters and the overall risk level from the fuzzy property to the zzso attribute is also zzso Its application is demonstrated by a test case evaluating the navigational safety within port zzso 

It is concluded that a risk predicting ANN model is capable of generating reliable results as long as the training data takes into account any potential circumstance that may be zzso 

This paper provides safety assessment practitioners with a novel and flexible framework of zzso risks using a zzso zzso It is especially zzso in circumstances where there are multiple parameters to be zzso The proposed framework also enables the port industry to manage navigational safety in a rational zzso
