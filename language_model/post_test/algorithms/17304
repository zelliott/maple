The purpose of this work is to study the dose enhancement by a thin foil zzso of zzso zzso of zzso material in a water zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Carlo technique was zzso zzso on the beam zzso due to the presence of the zzso and dose enhancement dependence of zzso quality, beam incident angle, atomic number zzso the thickness and size of the foil, and the depth of the foil situated in the phantom were zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso zzso indicates that the dose enhancement near an zzso interface is primarily due to secondary zzso A calculation for zzso zzso lead foil in a water phantom shows that the dose enhancements at zzso 1, 2 and 3 zzso away from the foil in the backward region were zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for a 15 zzso zzso zzso for a variety of zzso zzso and zzso beams show that dose zzso zzso increases with zzso zzso decreases with decreasing foil thickness when the zzso are thinner than a certain value (1 zzso for lead foil for 15 zzso zzso decreases with decreasing incident zzso zzso zzso changes slightly for beam incident angles less than 45 degrees and more prominently for larger zzso zzso increases with size of zzso and zzso is almost independent of the depth at which the foil is situated when the foil is placed beyond the range of secondary zzso The dose enhancement calculation is also performed for a zzso shaped lead foil zzso by a zzso The dose enhancement of zzso was obtained at zzso zzso away from the zzso outer interface for a 15 zzso zzso
