A series of zzso materials were zzso using zzso carbon zzso zzso and zzso zzso by varying the concentration of zzso in the zzso host zzso Such an zzso in the zzso particle density actually tunes the degree of isolation among the magnetic zzso zzso investigation by transmission electron zzso shows that particle zzso increases substantially with zzso particle zzso Field dependence of zzso zzso depict a gradual enhancement of zzso with increasing zzso zzso signifying the enhancement of magnetic zzso in this zzso zzso Furthermore, field cooled and zero field cooled memory effect as well as zzso relaxation zzso show that a glassy magnetic state gradually develops when the concentration zzso Analysis based on the result of high resolution transmission electron zzso along with the zzso data reveals that zzso magnetic exchange interaction in the presence of zzso disorders plays the major role in the emergence of the glassy magnetic state in this zzso zzso
