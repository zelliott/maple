Despite its widespread use, the limitations of the zzso zzso zzso are zzso The main zzso is that just a small area of the zzso is interrogated and for some abnormalities information may be transmitted to a region of the body surface where information is not zzso In this study, we attempted to zzso the zzso zzso by using a zzso approach to suggest alternate recording zzso 

A sequential lead selection zzso was applied to a set of zzso body surface potential maps zzso consisting of recordings from subjects with zzso zzso left zzso zzso and no apparent zzso A number of scenarios were investigated in which pairs of zzso leads were zzso these pairs were zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso The zzso was also used to find optimal positions for all 6 zzso zzso 

Through zzso of entire surface potential zzso it was found that each of the scenarios, with 2 leads zzso captured more information than the standard zzso zzso The scenario with zzso and zzso zzso performed best with a root mean square error of zzso zzso and a correlation zzso of zzso This zzso also fared favorably when compared to the scenario where all 6 zzso leads were zzso as zzso all 6 leads offered no significant zzso 

This study demonstrated the use of a lead selection zzso in enhancing the zzso zzso The results also indicated that repositioning just 2 zzso leads can provide the same level of information capture as that observed when all zzso leads are zzso zzso
