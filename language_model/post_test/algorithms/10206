zzso zzso reconstruction zzso zzso have shown potential to substantially improve zzso zzso CT zzso image zzso The penalty term plays an important role in determining the performance of zzso zzso In this work, we zzso evaluate the impact of the penalties on the performance of a zzso penalized weighted zzso zzso zzso reconstruction zzso for improving the image quality of zzso zzso Three different zzso penalty terms, exponential form zzso zzso zzso penalty zzso inverse square form zzso penalty zzso and total variation penalty zzso were compared against the conventional zzso zzso form penalty zzso using both computer simulation and experimental zzso Noise in zzso zzso can be substantially suppressed by the zzso reconstruction zzso and edges are well preserved by both zzso and zzso penalty zzso The zzso zzso measurement shows that the zzso exhibits the best spatial resolution of all the three zzso penalty terms at matched noise level for reconstructing zzso zzso For the reconstruction of zzso objects, the zzso penalty zzso the zzso one with better resolution preservation at matched noise zzso Different penalty terms may be used for better edge preservation at different targeted contrast zzso
