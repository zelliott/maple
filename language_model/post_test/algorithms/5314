We show that the transition from zzso to the zzso zzso occurring in atomic transport in zzso optical zzso can be interpreted as zzso by recourse to a modified version of zzso zzso As a result, we find that zzso is possible in the transition regime, only where the second moment zzso is zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso is confined within the range zzso although the whole spectrum of zzso values, zzso zzso is considered theoretically zzso The range of zzso values obtained from the modified zzso is also confirmed by the experiments carried out by Douglas et zzso zzso zzso zzso 96, zzso zzso
