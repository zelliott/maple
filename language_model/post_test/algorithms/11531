The process of freezing in healthy lung tissue and in tumors in the lung during zzso was modeled using one-dimensional close form techniques and finite difference techniques to determine the temperature profiles and the propagation of the freezing interface in the zzso A zzso phenomenon was observed during freezing of lung tumors embedded in healthy zzso zzso the freezing interface suddenly zzso at the transition between the tumor and the healthy zzso zzso the frozen tumor temperature drops to low values once the freezing interface moves into the healthy zzso and zzso the outer boundary temperature has a point of sharp inflection corresponding to the time at which the tumor is completely zzso
