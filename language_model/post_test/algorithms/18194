In real-time zzso it is necessary to consider the efficiency of amplification zzso of zzso in order to determine initial target levels zzso zzso can be deduced from standard curves, but these involve extra effort and cost and may yield invalid zzso zzso zzso can be extracted from individual zzso zzso Unfortunately, this is not reliable zzso 

Here we introduce simultaneous zzso fitting to determine - without standard zzso - an optimal common zzso for all samples of a zzso In order to adjust zzso as a function of target fluorescence, and still to describe zzso as a function of cycle number, we use an zzso zzso that increases zzso cycle by cycle and thus simulates the zzso zzso A zzso peak function is used to model the decrease of zzso with increasing zzso zzso Our approach was validated zzso with zzso probe or zzso green detection with dilution series of 5 different zzso It performed distinctly better in terms of accuracy than standard curve, zzso and zzso zzso Based on reliable zzso it was possible to detect that for some zzso extraordinary zzso zzso zzso zzso was generated with locked zzso acid zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso 

In comparison to previously reported approaches that are based on the separate analysis of each curve and on zzso zzso as a function of cycle number, our approach yields more accurate and precise estimates of relative initial target zzso
