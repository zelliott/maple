This paper presents an automatic and robust approach to zzso zzso videos from ordinary zzso videos acquired by commodity video zzso Instead of recovering the depth map, the proposed method zzso the zzso zzso in zzso video directly from the motion zzso in zzso zzso The synthesis is formulated as an zzso problem via introducing a cost function of the zzso effects, the zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso selects the most suitable frames in the input video for generating the zzso video zzso With the zzso selection, convincing and smooth zzso video can be zzso even by simple zzso zzso No user interaction is zzso We demonstrate the visually plausible results obtained given the input clips acquired by ordinary handheld video zzso
