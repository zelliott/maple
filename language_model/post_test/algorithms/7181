zzso calcium zzso signaling in cardiac zzso is vital for proper functioning of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso dynamics would give an insight into the functions of normal and diseased zzso In the current study, zzso zzso dynamics is investigated in zzso zzso by considering zzso release and zzso via zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso diffusion and zzso in the zzso and the blockade of zzso activities associated with the zzso zzso This study is carried out using a three zzso zzso geometric model of a branch of zzso extracted from the electron zzso zzso images of a partial zzso zzso zzso modeling is done by using a system of partial differential equations involving zzso zzso and membrane zzso zzso simulation results suggest that a lack of zzso structure at the vicinity of the cell surface could increase the peak time of zzso concentration in zzso The results also show that zzso and mobile buffers play an important role in the regulation of zzso transient in zzso zzso
