This paper concerns the zzso of an zzso used in industrial elastic web processing plant to allow changing material roll while the rest of the line remains at a constant web zzso A zzso model of a motor zzso zzso is first zzso This model is derived from the physical relationships describing web tension and zzso dynamics in each web span of this zzso A linear model is deduced from the zzso one around a working point for frequency domain zzso Thus the effect of some mechanical zzso zzso variations are zzso In a second part, zzso industrial zzso zzso adjusted with evolutionary zzso on our realistic zzso model are compared with zzso zzso zzso Both controllers allow good zzso against mechanical zzso zzso
