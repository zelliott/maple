The objective of the present work was to detect and analyze zzso by means of a highly sensitive zzso zzso Automatic zzso were compared with clinical zzso for forced exhalation segments from zzso to 0 zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso as a function of flow level related to zzso segments zzso were zzso zzso zzso parameters were measured for the flow range from zzso to zzso zzso zzso were detected in both analyzed zzso zzso (N zzso zzso and control subjects (N zzso zzso zzso differences between groups were found for the mean number of zzso detected at zzso condition zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differences were also significant zzso zzso p zzso zzso All these parameters were also studied after applying a zzso drug zzso zzso differences between patient groups were found when studying the changes in the number of zzso for each patient zzso zzso zzso Finally, limited bandwidth zzso which measure the zzso response, were also zzso
