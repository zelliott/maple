Selective rotation zzso cause zzso within a given frequency range (or zzso to undergo a specified zzso about a specified zzso zzso outside this slice remains unaffected if it is initially along the zzso zzso It has previously been shown that the design of such zzso can be reduced to the design of selective zzso zzso which rotate zzso within the slice from the y zzso By zzso the zzso zzso into two zzso it is shown that an inverse scattering zzso for selective pulse design can be used to calculate selective rotation zzso with any desired zzso response, subject to the constraint that the second zzso component have constant phase across the zzso The design of selective zzso zzso can be treated zzso requiring the zzso by the same inverse scattering algorithm, of a single zzso
