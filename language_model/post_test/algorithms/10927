zzso zzso imaging experimental tests have been performed using a compact zzso imaging system based on a conventional zzso tube, a mosaic zzso and a zzso silicon detector equipped with zzso electronics with single zzso counting zzso For simulating zzso zzso a zzso zzso made of zzso zzso and water, has been zzso Images have been collected with three different pairs of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso Carlo simulation of the experiment has also been carried out using the zzso transport zzso The zzso zzso has been applied both to experimental and simulated data to remove the contrast between two of the phantom materials so as to enhance the visibility of the third zzso
