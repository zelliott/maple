The size of the packing material, the total number of columns and the total feed concentration have significant impacts on the economics of a zzso zzso zzso through their effects on column pressure drop, column efficiency and zzso In this work, the role of these parameters on the performances of a simulated moving bed and a zzso process is investigated on a zzso separation system from literature, using an equilibrium stage zzso A multiple objective zzso technique based on a genetic zzso is adopted, which allows to maximize simultaneously the purity of the extract and productivity of the zzso In this way, it is possible to zzso and compare the performances of both processes in a wide range of zzso values, so as to assess their relative potential under equally zzso zzso The zzso results, zzso the so-called zzso sets, have been discussed in the frame of equilibrium theory and the roles of these three parameters have been zzso
