For maximum value, a predicted model of an zzso site should have an accuracy approaching that of an X-ray structure zzso zzso In addition, the method by which the combining site is zzso should make no demands on the user of a sort that require arbitrary or zzso decisions to be made during the zzso We have made substantial progress towards this objective and some recent results are zzso In addition, we describe how the zzso protocols developed can aid in the design of novel features within the zzso zzso The particular design example reported here suggests an approach for the introduction of zzso sites to create zzso This type of modification may be useful in the design of zzso the induction of zzso activity or simply as an alternative to metal zzso in the preparation of zzso for zzso
