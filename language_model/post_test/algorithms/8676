A neural network processing scheme is proposed which zzso a zzso zzso feature map as the front end to a zzso zzso zzso The results of a series of zzso studies based upon artificial statistical pattern recognition tasks indicate that the proposed architecture performs significantly better than conventional zzso zzso networks when the decision regions are zzso This is attributed to the fact that the zzso process allows internal units in the succeeding zzso network to be sensitive to a specific set of features in the input space at the outset of zzso
