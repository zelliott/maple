zzso understanding of zzso zzso requires knowledge of gene expression patterns associated with normal germ cell zzso The mouse is one of the best models of zzso fertility due to its zzso zzso and the existence of many zzso zzso both naturally occurring and zzso zzso We used zzso zzso zzso to investigate normal gene expression in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso to gain a better insight into the effect of the disruption of the zzso gene on zzso We constructed a zzso zzso from a zzso and zzso adult zzso library and focused on six zzso zzso during the initial zzso wave of zzso The results suggest that in the zzso zzso zzso of genes on our chip change expression dramatically during the zzso To identify patterns in the zzso data, a zzso zzso zzso and principal component analysis were zzso In the zzso knockout zzso the majority of genes remain at baseline levels of zzso because absence of zzso has a severe effect on zzso present in the zzso Although in the prepubescent zzso mice the final point reached in germ cell development is the zzso stage, the zzso results suggest that lack of zzso expression has a zzso effect on the zzso complement of germ cells as early as day 5 when only type A zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
