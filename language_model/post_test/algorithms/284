The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of various tube currents on the accuracy of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso using a chest zzso 

A chest phantom containing 13 artificial zzso zzso with known volumes was scanned using a zzso zzso zzso scanner at different tube currents zzso 60, 90, zzso zzso 180, and 210 zzso zzso zzso were performed using zzso The relative percentage error and the absolute percentage error between the volume measures on zzso zzso and the zzso volumes were zzso zzso between the mean absolute percentage error and the mean zzso of zzso and between the ratio of solid component and the mean zzso of zzso were zzso 

The relative percentage errors showed that there was substantial zzso of zzso volumes at 30, 60, and 90 zzso and substantial zzso of volumes at zzso zzso 180, and 210 zzso but there was no statistically significant difference in absolute percentage errors zzso zzso zzso zzso correlation zzso of the mean absolute percentage errors of zzso on zzso measurement versus the mean zzso value of zzso showed a negative zzso and the ratio of solid component to whole zzso versus the mean zzso of zzso showed a positive zzso 

Volume measurement is a promising method for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso It is important to know that different tube currents can affect the accuracy of zzso zzso
