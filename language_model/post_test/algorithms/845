Analysis of gene expression data obtained from zzso presents a new set of challenges to machine learning zzso In this domain, in which the number of variables far exceeds the number of cases, identifying relevant genes or groups of genes that are good markers for a particular zzso is as important as achieving good zzso zzso Although several machine learning zzso have been proposed to address the latter, identification of gene markers has not been systematically zzso In this article, we investigate several zzso for selecting gene markers for zzso We test these zzso using zzso regression, as this is a simple and efficient supervised learning zzso We zzso using 10 different data sets, that a zzso zzso zzso constitutes a viable choice if a researcher is interested in quickly determining a set of gene expression levels that can serve as markers for zzso We show that the zzso performance of zzso zzso is not very different from that of more sophisticated zzso that have been applied in previous studies, and that the gene selection in the zzso zzso zzso is reasonable in both zzso Furthermore, the zzso is simple, its theoretical basis is well established, and our zzso zzso is now freely available on the zzso serving as a zzso tool for the development of new zzso
