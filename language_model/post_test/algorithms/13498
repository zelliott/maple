zzso is central to development, while zzso is central to cancer zzso zzso a quantitative assessment of differentiation would be most zzso We propose an unbiased method to derive zzso differentiation zzso from gene expression data and demonstrate its usefulness in zzso cancer zzso We derived a list of zzso genes by selecting automatically those genes that are expressed at higher level in the zzso than in any other organ in a normal zzso zzso gene expression zzso The zzso index of a tissue was defined as the median expression of these zzso genes in that zzso As expected, the zzso index was zzso correlated with zzso a proliferation zzso across a wide range of zzso zzso By contrast, the two zzso were positively correlated in a time course of zzso hormone zzso zzso of primary zzso Thus, the zzso index captures biological information not integrated by proliferation zzso The differential diagnostic of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a notorious challenge for zzso The zzso index zzso them as accurately as did zzso zzso trained on the zzso cancer zzso zzso although it was established exclusively from normal tissue data, the zzso index zzso the relevant diagnostic information contained in zzso zzso Similar results were obtained for the zzso of the zzso vs classical zzso of zzso zzso zzso that is, tumors zzso along a different zzso The automated procedures demonstrated in the zzso are zzso to other zzso
