An optical zzso frequency division zzso zzso scheme with zzso transform in optical domain using time zzso both at the zzso and at the receiver is zzso The comparison of performance between this scheme with the optical zzso scheme that zzso fast zzso transform zzso and inverse fast zzso transform zzso in electrical domain is zzso The zzso effects induced by zzso zzso zzso as well as by the fiber are investigated for both zzso zzso show that the coherent zzso using time zzso has almost the same performance as that using zzso when the electrical driving message signal zzso are low so that zzso operates in the linear zzso The zzso of zzso zzso the conventional coherent zzso based on zzso when the power of electrical driving signal increases significantly, but only has negligible impairment on the coherent zzso using time zzso Details of the time lens set up are provided and a novel scheme to implement the time lens without requiring the zzso dependence of the driving zzso is zzso
