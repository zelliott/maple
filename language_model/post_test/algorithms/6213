With respect to the zzso problem, recently an increasing amount of attention has been paid to control the false discovery rate zzso the positive false discovery rate zzso and the proportion of false zzso zzso The new approaches are generally believed to be more powerful than the classical zzso zzso This article focuses on the zzso zzso It demonstrates via examples in genetic association studies that the zzso procedure can be more powerful than the zzso one and also shows the intrinsic connection between controlling the zzso and controlling the overall type I error zzso Since controlling the zzso does not necessarily lead to a desired power level, this article addresses the design issue and recommends the sample sizes that can attain the desired power levels when the zzso is zzso The results in this article also provide rough guidance for the sample sizes to achieve the desired power levels when the zzso and especially the zzso are zzso
