The zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso were determined by zzso zzso glass zzso in pure zzso and in zzso and zzso zzso at T zzso zzso K and different zzso strengths (up to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the activity zzso of zzso were also determined by the distribution method at the same temperature in various zzso media zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results obtained were also used to calculate the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the dependence on medium and zzso strength of zzso species, as well as the formation zzso of weak zzso i zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were also carried out in pure zzso and in zzso zzso at different zzso strengths zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in order to determine the zzso changes for the zzso and complex formation zzso in these media at T zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained are useful for the definition of zzso zzso in any zzso media containing the main zzso of natural waters and biological zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso Finally, this kind of systematic studies, where a series of zzso media zzso all zzso metal zzso is taken into account in the determination of various zzso zzso is useful for the definition of some trends in the zzso behavior of zzso in zzso zzso
