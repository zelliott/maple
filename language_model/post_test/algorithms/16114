We have developed an zzso to track a rat swimming in a Morris Water zzso It provides an update on zzso position 15 times per zzso The tracking zzso uses a rotation insensitive tracking template coupled with a limited exhaustive search technique to maintain lock on the moving zzso At the completion of the run, the relative time the rat spent in each zzso is zzso The tracking zzso was successfully used to evaluate the time course of memory loss and correlate that to tissue loss in the rat zzso following blunt trauma to the sensory zzso zzso of that study are reported in another zzso Our project budget did not allow for commercially available software to perform the tracking task which typically provide position updates 10 times per zzso This paper focuses on the tracking zzso and support equipment used to measure the zzso progress in the zzso
