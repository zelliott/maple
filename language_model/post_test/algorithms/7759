Based on results of zzso in the Balkan Region of Serbia from 2005 to 2007, soil gas zzso and zzso zzso as well as gamma dose rates were zzso Campaigns were conducted in two different geological zzso zzso zzso considered a high natural radiation area, and zzso around the zzso zzso Power Plant zzso a low natural radiation zzso zzso and zzso gas zzso were made by using two types of Japanese passive zzso zzso which included zzso data and gamma dose zzso The zzso of soil zzso gas in zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso for soil zzso gas ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso The gamma dose rates varied from 70 to 320 zzso zzso In the zzso area, zzso concentration was found to range from zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso The gamma dose rate ranged from 90 to 130 zzso zzso In addition, the natural zzso of the soil was investigated at the low background zzso The zzso and zzso contents in collected soil samples ranged from 23 to 58 and 33 to 67 zzso zzso zzso As a result of correlation analyses between the measured values, the highest correlation zzso (R zzso zzso was found for zzso in the soil and the zzso gas zzso
