Wireless body sensor networks zzso hold the promise to be a key enabling information and communications technology for next-generation patient-centric zzso or mobile zzso zzso Through enabling continuous remote cardiac monitoring, they have the potential to achieve improved zzso and quality of care, increased ability of prevention and early diagnosis, and enhanced patient zzso mobility, and zzso However, state-of-the-art zzso zzso monitors still fall short of the required zzso zzso and energy zzso Among others, energy efficiency can be improved through embedded zzso zzso in order to reduce zzso over zzso wireless zzso In this paper, we zzso the potential of the emerging compressed sensing zzso signal zzso paradigm for zzso energy-efficient zzso zzso on the state-of-the-art zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, our results show that zzso represents a competitive alternative to state-of-the-art digital zzso transform zzso zzso zzso solutions in the context of zzso zzso monitoring zzso More specifically, while zzso exhibiting inferior zzso performance than its zzso counterpart for a given reconstructed signal quality, its substantially lower complexity and CPU execution time enables it to ultimately outperform zzso zzso zzso in terms of overall energy zzso zzso zzso zzso is accordingly shown to achieve a zzso extension in zzso lifetime relative to its zzso counterpart for zzso reconstruction zzso
