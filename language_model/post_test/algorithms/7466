zzso of the zzso and pelvis is a prerequisite for zzso planning and simulation for hip zzso zzso boundary determination of the zzso head and zzso is the primary challenge in diseased hip zzso because of zzso shapes and extreme narrowness of the joint zzso To overcome this difficulty, we investigated a zzso method in which the zzso hip statistical shape model zzso is initially zzso to complete zzso of the pelvis and zzso zzso and then the conditional zzso head zzso is used under the condition that the regions segmented during the previous stage are zzso CT data from 100 diseased patients zzso on the basis of their disease type and severity, which included 200 zzso were used to validate the method, which delivered significantly increased zzso accuracy for the zzso zzso
