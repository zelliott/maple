A method based on the infrared hollow zzso zzso was developed for sensing zzso in zzso zzso This zzso was constructed by coating a suitable zzso film onto the inner surface of an infrared hollow zzso By passing the zzso solution through the hollow zzso zzso zzso can be absorbed into the zzso zzso The zzso zzso can be sensed later by using zzso transform infrared zzso Six zzso zzso were investigated for their performance in conjunction with the infrared hollow zzso zzso for the detection of zzso zzso indicated that zzso was a most suitable zzso material for zzso of zzso in zzso zzso To further increase the detection sensitivity, factors such as sampling flow rate, sampling time, and thickness of the zzso film were also zzso zzso indicated that the infrared signals were similar in the examined flow rates zzso zzso but that a higher flow rate tended to produce a higher zzso zzso Fast detection speed was an advantage of this method for the detection of zzso and the zzso time can be zzso zzso In addition, zzso signals were nearly zzso to the thickness of the zzso film coating the inside of the hollow zzso With the optimal conditions found in this work, detection limits based on 3 times the zzso noise level were around 300 zzso for the zzso zzso A high degree of zzso in the standard zzso was also observed for this method in the concentration range of zzso zzso The typical zzso zzso were zzso for the zzso zzso
