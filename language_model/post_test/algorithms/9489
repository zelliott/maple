A method for correlated zzso imaging is zzso A zzso Field zzso Spin Echo zzso sequence is used to record zzso resolved zzso on a zzso basis, making it possible to perform single zzso correlated zzso zzso In zzso zzso media the method thus gives access to zzso information about displacement and zzso zzso The sequence is demonstrated using a number of flow conducting model zzso a tube with flowing water of variable intrinsic zzso mixing zzso of different zzso in an zzso zzso and an intact living zzso zzso can be applied to yield information about the relation between flow, pore size and exchange behavior, and can aid volume flow zzso by making it possible to correct for zzso relaxation during the displacement labeling period Delta in zzso displacement imaging zzso zzso zzso imaging can be of special interest for a number of research subjects, such as the flow of liquids and zzso of liquids or liquids and zzso moving through microscopic zzso of different sizes zzso plants, porous media, zzso zzso
