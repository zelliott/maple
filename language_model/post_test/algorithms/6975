Several investigators have fit zzso functions to data from zzso procedures for threshold zzso Although the threshold estimates are in general quite correct, one encounters a slope bias that has not been explained up to zzso The present paper demonstrates slope bias for zzso and zzso zzso fits and for zzso analysis of zzso zzso The examples include staircase and zzso approximation zzso The paper then presents an explanation of slope bias based on serial data dependency in zzso zzso Data dependency is first illustrated with simple zzso examples and then extended to realistic zzso zzso Finally, the paper presents an zzso staircase procedure designed to measure threshold and slope zzso In contrast to classical zzso zzso procedures, this procedure varies both a threshold and a spread zzso in response to double zzso
