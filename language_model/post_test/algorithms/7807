zzso zzso is frequently found in palm trees and bird nests in zzso zzso However, adult specimens infected by zzso zzso have been invading houses in central zzso zzso and predicting the geographical distribution of this species may improve zzso surveillance strategies for zzso zzso zzso niche modeling using the genetic zzso for zzso production zzso was applied to predict the geographical distribution of zzso zzso from occurrence records and a set of 23 predictor variables zzso temperature, zzso zzso and zzso Additionally, the geographical distribution of zzso zzso was compared with the geographical distribution of four species of palm trees and two species of birds from the study zzso The models were able to zzso with high zzso the occurrence of zzso zzso as a regular (although zzso species of the zzso zzso in central zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso appear as areas with lower probabilities of potential occurrence for the zzso A great overlap was observed between the distribution of zzso zzso palm trees zzso zzso and zzso zzso and birds zzso zzso and zzso zzso By including new records for zzso zzso (from both zzso and domestic zzso our study showed a distribution increase toward the west and northeast areas of Brazil in the zzso of zzso zzso of South zzso These results should aid zzso disease zzso surveillance programs, given that household invasion by zzso species maintains the risk of disease transmission and limits control zzso
