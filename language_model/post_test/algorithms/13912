The zzso dose equivalent rate as a function of distance from a zzso source was calculated using a point kernel technique in the energy range zzso zzso zzso factors for a single medium were those given by the geometric progression zzso The buildup factor for the whole geometry was considered as that from a zzso shield represented by the Broder formula with two corrections applied to it: the first for finite shield and the second for the contribution of the last layer as given by zzso The accuracy of this zzso was tested by performing a zzso zzso Purpose zzso Carlo Code for zzso zzso zzso calculation for the same source and comparing the two sets of zzso The conclusion is that the point kernel technique, with the corrections mentioned above included, gives results that agree with those obtained by using zzso in most cases to within zzso zzso the method presented here is adequate for performing a dose equivalent rate zzso as the effort for using it is much smaller than that needed using the zzso zzso
