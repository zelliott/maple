zzso is a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strands conduct zzso zzso of gene expression through a degradation or zzso of the translation of target zzso Since its discovery in 1998, zzso has been identified in many different organisms, including zzso and this mechanism has provided new approaches for studies in cellular and molecular biology, functional zzso and drug zzso zzso can be predicted by sequence and zzso features, and the wide and zzso application of zzso relies on the ability to select the most active zzso from among numerous predicted zzso Recently, the first-generation prediction zzso based on the characteristics of zzso short hairpin zzso and zzso have been improved by the use of zzso models that account for the zzso determined activities of large numbers of zzso and zzso These second-generation zzso differ from the first-generation zzso in the zzso tools that are used for the prediction of zzso zzso although these new zzso improve the design of effective zzso they do not eliminate the requirement for an experimental evaluation of the activities of zzso This review reports on the most significant second-generation zzso of zzso and zzso zzso as well as on recently designed systems for the experimental evaluation of zzso zzso
