In this paper a new general purpose zzso control architecture, based on zzso neural zzso is presented and applied to solve robot navigation zzso zzso show the ability to react to certain stimuli with simple zzso using direct zzso zzso which can be considered as basic behaviors, inherited and zzso zzso brain zzso known as zzso Bodies zzso and Central Complex zzso were recently identified in zzso though their functional details are not yet fully zzso it is known that they provide secondary pathways allowing the emergence of cognitive zzso These are gained through the coordination of the basic abilities to satisfy the zzso zzso Taking inspiration from this evidence, our architecture zzso through a reinforcement learning, a set of competitive and concurrent basic behaviors in order to accomplish the task assigned through a reward zzso The core of the architecture is constituted by the so-called zzso layer, used to create a concise picture of the current environment situation, fusing together different stimuli for the emergence of zzso zzso These zzso states are steady state solutions of zzso of zzso Cellular zzso Networks zzso designed to show Turing zzso The exploitation of the dynamics of the multiple zzso of the network is emphasized through the zzso shaping of the zzso of attraction for each emerged zzso New experimental campaigns on standard robotic platforms are reported to demonstrate the zzso and the effectiveness of the zzso
