To evaluate the imaging quality of head CT at lowered radiation dose by combining filtered back projection zzso and zzso reconstruction zzso zzso 

Experimental group A zzso underwent CT with zzso tube current reduction, and group B zzso received an equivalent reduced dose by lowering the tube zzso An zzso and zzso control group zzso receiving the conventional radiation dose was zzso zzso Imaging for the control group was reconstructed by zzso only, while images for groups A and B were reconstructed by zzso and zzso The zzso ratios zzso zzso ratios zzso zzso number of zzso and severity of zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared to assess imaging quality and diagnostic zzso 

There were no significant differences in zzso and zzso between group A and the control zzso There were significantly decreased zzso and increased zzso in group zzso Image sharpness decreased in both zzso zzso between detected zzso and severity of zzso across zzso and zzso were high zzso Head diameter was the only significant factor zzso correlated with zzso imaging zzso 

Head CT with zzso reduced tube current reconstructed by zzso provides diagnostic imaging quality for zzso zzso 

zzso zzso CT using zzso reconstruction provides diagnostic images with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso images becomes evident using zzso head zzso zzso Head diameter was zzso correlated with imaging quality in the zzso zzso zzso tube zzso requires a higher radiation dose to maintain image zzso
