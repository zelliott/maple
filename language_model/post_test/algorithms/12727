Although zzso zzso for zzso fluid zzso white matter zzso and gray matter zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso images exist, there is no complete research in this zzso To take into account poor image contrast and intensity zzso on CT scans, the aim of this study was to derive and validate a novel, zzso zzso and robust zzso 

zzso CT scans of normal subjects from two different centers were zzso The zzso developed uses zzso zzso zzso and domain knowledge and is based on zzso on the shape of CT zzso The slope of the intensity zzso corresponding to the three-dimensional largest connected region in a variable zzso intensity range is tracked to determine the critical intensity, which serves as an initial zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso are then zzso derived to minimize zzso zzso zzso zzso and erroneous zzso are resolved by applying domain zzso 

The zzso regions with the minimal partial volume effect were used to evaluate zzso results using the statistical zzso Average sensitivity, zzso index, and zzso respectively, for the first center were zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso and zzso for zzso The results were consistent for the second data zzso 

The zzso automatically identifies zzso zzso and zzso on zzso CT images with high zzso is robust to data from different zzso does not require any zzso setting, and takes about 5 minutes in zzso to process a 512 zzso 512 zzso 30 zzso The zzso has potential use in research and clinical zzso
