Various methods have been used for zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso many involving view zzso However, the extent to which the zzso image time series represents the actual dynamic behavior of the contrast zzso is not always zzso Although zzso simulations can be used to estimate performance, an experimental study can allow more realistic zzso The purpose of this work was to use a computer-controlled motion phantom for study of the zzso zzso of three-dimensional zzso zzso sequences in depicting a contrast zzso It is hypothesized that the view order of the acquisition and the selection of views in the reconstruction can affect the zzso accuracy and sharpness of the leading edge of the zzso and zzso signal preceding the zzso Phantom studies were performed using dilute zzso zzso that were moved along zzso tracks by a computer-controlled zzso Several view orders were tested using zzso and Cartesian zzso zzso of measuring the zzso center, consistency of view ordering within each reconstruction frame, and sampling the zzso center near the end of the zzso footprint were shown to be important in accurate portrayal of the leading edge of the zzso A number of findings were confirmed in an in zzso zzso zzso
