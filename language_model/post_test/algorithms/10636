We report the zzso of a method for the calculation of optical zzso This method is based on the zzso zzso theory and zzso zzso zzso basis zzso The calculations are based on a density zzso It is demonstrated that additional terms in the zzso expression appearing from derivatives of the zzso zzso potential are necessary to provide the zzso independence of the results within a given zzso zzso Contributions from these terms also restore the symmetry between the electric and magnetic zzso in the optical rotation zzso
