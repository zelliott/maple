The zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso technique utilizing zzso flow through cell zzso detection has an inherent practical problem: strong zzso bands of the zzso may mask valuable zzso regions of the zzso zzso The zzso answer to this challenge is physical elimination of the zzso zzso before zzso zzso which however results in zzso measurement of zzso In the present work, the capabilities of some zzso zzso using zzso applied zzso methods such as parallel factor analysis zzso and zzso developed with the aim of overcoming the problems of zzso elimination are examined and zzso Test calculations done on simulated liquid zzso infrared zzso data cubes have shown that although zzso performs much better than the simple zzso method, it does not give correct zzso just like zzso curve resolution with alternative least squares zzso and related zzso data based zzso In search for a better solution, a method named objective zzso of zzso spectrum with zzso use of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso has been zzso zzso performed with the corresponding zzso program developed by the authors and run with the appropriate functions in zzso yielded very promising results in evaluations of both simulated and real zzso data sets, after necessary data zzso
