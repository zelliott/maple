A technique for studying the distribution and size of different zzso types in muscles is proposed for automated analysis of individual zzso in optical density images from zzso muscle zzso After zzso zzso may be classified into different zzso types zzso zzso zzso and zzso using the measurement of their mean optical density zzso The zzso zzso were obtained from three serial zzso slides stained under different zzso The zzso procedure is performed on one of the zzso the resulting mask is fitted to the other images using a linear coordinate zzso Along with zzso zzso the lesser diameter of the zzso is zzso Both in processing and in analysis, extensive use was made of mathematical zzso zzso All software was implemented on a zzso digital image processor, extended with a zzso zzso zzso
