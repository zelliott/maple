When a set of zzso genes share a common structural zzso zzso zzso a zzso most motif search approaches fail to locate the zzso but structurally zzso zzso There do exist methods that can locate structural zzso zzso like zzso but the main problem with these methods is that they are zzso zzso In zzso a major contribution to this is the use of a greedy zzso to construct the multiple zzso To ensure good quality many redundant zzso must be zzso However, by applying the greedy zzso on a carefully selected subset of zzso near full greedy quality can be zzso The basic idea is to estimate the order in which the sequences entered a good greedy zzso If such a ranking, found from all zzso zzso is in good agreement with the order of appearance in the multiple zzso the core structural motif can be found by performing the greedy zzso on just the top sequences in the zzso The ranking used in this zzso zzso is found by using two zzso zzso 1) When interpreting the zzso score as an inner product zzso the sequences can be ranked according to their distance to their center of zzso 2) We construct an zzso that attempts to find the K closest sequences in the zzso space associated with the inner product, and the remaining sequences can be ranked by their minimum distance to any of the zzso or to the center of mass in this zzso The two approaches zzso and zzso and the results zzso We also show that structural alignments of near full greedy quality can found in significantly reduced time, using these zzso The zzso is being included in the zzso zzso zzso zzso server available at zzso
