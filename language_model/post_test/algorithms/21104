The ability of zzso zzso to inhibit zzso formation is studied using zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso are used to model the zzso zzso The presence of zzso in the vicinity of the water cavities not only leads to the formation of complexes, with different zzso ratios, but also to the deformation of the cavity and to the zzso of several of the hydrogen bonds responsible for keeping the zzso zzso zzso The complexes are formed through hydrogen bonding between the peptides and the water zzso The zzso are expected to anchor onto the zzso surface, blocking the access of new water molecules and preventing the zzso zzso from zzso They are also expected to weaken the zzso zzso zzso zzso bands are associated with the zzso zzso They are significantly zzso in the zzso systems compared to isolated zzso The zzso A band is the most sensitive to hydrogen zzso In addition a distinctive band around zzso zzso is proposed for the identification of zzso zzso zzso
