We have evaluated eight different similarity measures used for rigid body registration of serial magnetic resonance zzso brain zzso To assess their accuracy we used 33 clinical three-dimensional zzso serial MR images, with zzso zzso tissue excluded by manual zzso and simulated 3-D MR images with added intensity zzso For each measure we determined the consistency of registration transformations for both sets of segmented and zzso zzso We have shown that of the eight measures tested, the ones based on joint zzso produced the best zzso In particular, these measures seemed to be least sensitive to the presence of zzso zzso For these data the difference in accuracy of these joint zzso measures, with or without brain zzso was within the threshold of visually zzso change in the difference zzso
