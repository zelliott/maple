The authors previously introduced a method in which zzso pressure zzso was estimated using parameters zzso zzso derived from cerebral blood flow zzso zzso and zzso blood pressure zzso Some results suggested that this model might be influenced by the patient's state of cerebral zzso and other clinical zzso zzso it was the aim of the present study to improve the method by zzso the previously used global procedure in certain zzso of zzso 

In 103 traumatic brain injured patients zzso years, zzso 31 zzso 16 zzso signal data of zzso zzso and zzso were used to generate samples of zzso characteristics together with time corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to identify cluster zzso zzso of the sample zzso On each class a local zzso of zzso was zzso This approach provides a zzso assessment of zzso zzso as zzso Using zzso and zzso the zzso characteristics were zzso and related to the matching zzso zzso was calculated as a weighted sum of local zzso zzso 

zzso A and B waves and long-term trends could be visibly zzso The median absolute difference between zzso and zzso was zzso zzso 

The class structure of the model zzso zzso assessment in zzso patient groups and supports a zzso extension of the target patient group without affecting the former zzso
