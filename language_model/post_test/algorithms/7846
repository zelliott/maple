To assess the clinical and economic outcomes of zzso testing strategies in the diagnosis of significant liver zzso zzso score zzso 2) compared with liver zzso 

We developed a decision zzso model of zzso testing strategies in a hypothetical patient population with zzso 1 zzso C virus infection, with no zzso to liver zzso The testing strategies included a testing zzso using the zzso test, a zzso measure of fibrosis, followed by liver biopsy for patients with indeterminate results, zzso II, and zzso The primary outcomes were sensitivity, zzso diagnostic accuracy zzso positive + true zzso zzso and costs, evaluated from the health-care payer zzso 

The testing zzso using zzso was the most accurate zzso strategy with a sensitivity, zzso and overall accuracy of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In comparison with liver biopsy alone, there was a cost savings of approximately zzso with the zzso testing algorithm, but a net decrease in accuracy of zzso zzso II and zzso had poorer accuracy zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and lower costs zzso and zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso In uncertainty analyses in which biopsy sampling error was considered, the zzso zzso remained consistently less accurate zzso zzso 

The results of our study suggest that compared with liver zzso zzso testing zzso can result in short-term cost savings, but the consequences of zzso in terms of health outcomes and treatment costs might outweigh the short-term gains in cost and zzso
