The influences of zzso size on zzso distortion correction are investigated both theoretically and zzso A zzso zzso model is assumed to be the zzso zzso zzso zzso simulations were performed using three zzso distortion correction zzso zzso compensation zzso zzso followed by zzso compensation zzso and the previously proposed, zzso zzso compensation zzso zzso The distorted zzso were generated by zzso a zzso zzso through a zzso zzso model constructed with a two-dimensional zzso scanned map of a real abdominal zzso Performances were evaluated by zzso errors between the corrected zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Point spread functions also were calculated to evaluate the relative image zzso zzso analysis shows zzso error will decrease as zzso size grows when exact phase compensation zzso is applied, although finite errors will always exist along the edges of the corrected zzso Three different zzso sizes, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are considered in this zzso zzso results show that the quality of zzso with zzso is essentially limited by the zzso size, and the correction methods considered are relatively robust against the zzso zzso It also shows that, for low zzso results with zzso and zzso are zzso However, for high zzso zzso significantly zzso zzso in suppression of zzso error and zzso This study suggests that, for most medical ultrasound imaging systems, the exact structure of the zzso medium may not be necessary to be known a zzso for optimal distortion correction because of the limitation imposed by finite zzso zzso
