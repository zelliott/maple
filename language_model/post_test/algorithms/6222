It is often useful in zzso time series analysis to determine statistical zzso relations between different time zzso zzso causality is a fundamental measure for this zzso Yet the traditional zzso approach to zzso causality analysis may not clearly distinguish between direct zzso influences from one time series to another and indirect ones acting through a third time zzso In order to differentiate direct from indirect zzso zzso a conditional zzso causality measure in the frequency domain is derived based on a partition zzso zzso zzso and an application to neural field potential time series are demonstrated to validate the zzso
