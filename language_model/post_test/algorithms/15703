A homogeneous zzso for TNT and its zzso is developed using a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso is based on the rapid zzso separation of an zzso mixture of an zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso TNT or its zzso The band zzso of the free zzso TNT and of the zzso complex reveal the relative zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with a zzso TNT zzso yields a binding constant of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso rate constant of the complex is determined by kinetic zzso zzso using a folded channel and a rotary scanner to interrogate the separation at multiple time zzso The zzso rate constant is found to be zzso zzso zzso zzso and the resulting binding rate constant is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of TNT and five of its zzso are determined by competitive zzso TNT zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso TNT and its zzso can be zzso with high sensitivity zzso 1 zzso and with a wide dynamic range zzso zzso using this zzso zzso
