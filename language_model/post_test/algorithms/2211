zzso for computing with DNA currently require the construction of pools of molecules in which each distinct zzso represents a different starting point for the zzso We have begun building such pools using the technique of parallel overlap assembly that is already used for the generation of diversity in biologically useful zzso search techniques such as gene zzso Unlike these applications, a pool in a molecular computer must be complete, containing all possible zzso and ordered, having minimal contamination from incorrectly assembled zzso We present an experiment in which parallel overlap assembly is used to construct a zzso pool and an experiment in which this pool is used to solve the zzso zzso zzso
