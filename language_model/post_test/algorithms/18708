In the context of manned space flight with the European Space Agency, a quantitative ultrasound device for transmission imaging through the zzso bone has been zzso It includes two zzso zzso of zzso elements each in order to zzso perform the scanning and the focusing of the 500 zzso zzso zzso This device called the zzso zzso provides two zzso images of zzso zzso broadband zzso zzso and zzso zzso speed of zzso of the investigated skeletal zzso The cost and complexity of such a device has motivated the study of an alternative solution, less demanding in terms of technology, based on a crossed beam former zzso zzso et zzso A new concept for a real-time ultrasound transmission camera, in: zzso zzso zzso zzso 2000, zzso zzso It consists in forming two perpendicular zzso focused planes, one in zzso one in reception, instead of two zzso focused zzso The crossing line of the two planes replaces the focused zzso The zzso beam forming technological challenge is moved to a zzso simpler and cheaper zzso In this work the two solutions have been compared for in zzso zzso Data sets have been acquired using all spatial combinations of zzso and reception single elements of the zzso Then signals have been processed using either the zzso or the zzso zzso zzso For zzso zzso the increased level of the side zzso caused severe zzso Several zzso techniques have been implemented to reduce these zzso resulting in encouraging zzso After a brief description of this new zzso method for bone quantitative assessment, several reconstructed images using both processing schemes are zzso zzso statistical results obtained in 29 subjects are also zzso
