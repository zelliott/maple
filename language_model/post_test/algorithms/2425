zzso zzso predictions are widely used to build zzso structural models of integral membrane proteins zzso Experimental validation of these models by traditional methods is labor intensive and requires modifications that might alter the zzso native zzso This work employs zzso labeling coupled with mass zzso zzso as a validation tool for computer-generated zzso zzso zzso exposure introduces zzso modifications in zzso regions, whereas buried segments zzso zzso zzso are zzso The zzso coli protein zzso zzso zzso is predicted to have 12 zzso zzso and a large zzso domain zzso et zzso zzso zzso 2008, 70, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used to map the zzso labeling behavior of zzso Met and zzso exhibit high intrinsic zzso with zzso making them sensitive zzso for zzso accessibility zzso Overall, the zzso pattern of these zzso is consistent with the originally proposed zzso zzso One zzso zzso however, zzso partial zzso despite being predicted to reside within a zzso zzso Using an improved computer algorithm, a slightly modified zzso model was generated that places zzso closer to the membrane zzso On the basis of the labeling data, it is concluded that the refined model more accurately reflects the actual zzso of zzso We propose that the combination of zzso labeling and zzso represents a useful strategy for assessing the accuracy of zzso zzso predictions, supplementing data obtained in traditional zzso zzso In the future, it might be possible to incorporate zzso labeling data directly as constraints in zzso prediction zzso
