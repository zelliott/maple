To link data from the US assisted zzso technology zzso registry with the Massachusetts zzso death file to create a comprehensive zzso on the circumstances surrounding conception and maternal and infant outcomes for a population of zzso zzso 

The authors sought to link data for zzso zzso zzso infants from zzso deliveries in zzso involving Massachusetts resident mothers who gave birth in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, or Connecticut to their corresponding Massachusetts birth record using a zzso zzso zzso and infant dates of birth served as the primary linkage zzso zzso names for a subset of the zzso infants were obtained and used in the second stage of the zzso to confirm a sample of records that matched in Stage I, to resolve duplicate matches, and to link zzso zzso 

In Stage I, zzso of ART deliveries matched with only one Massachusetts record, zzso matched with two records, and zzso remained zzso Overall, the complete zzso using maternal name data for a portion of records yielded an zzso linkage zzso Nearly all of the records that matched during Stage I that were evaluated with maternal name data in Stage II were confirmed as correctly zzso 

This project confirms that high-yield data linkage can be achieved in the absence of specific identifiers zzso name and social security zzso Nonetheless, additional matches were achieved when name data were zzso This linkage creates the first zzso file in the US capturing detailed information on ART zzso
