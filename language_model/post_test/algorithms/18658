This review of the original works on computer analysis of the human zzso considers the development of methods to predict the zzso structure of genes and analysis of alternative zzso zzso of the gene structure is based on zzso between the gene product and a known protein or between the zzso sequences of the gene and its zzso from another zzso The methods were tested and proved highly zzso Human gene zzso was analyzed with original methods and zzso zzso Genes with alternative zzso were for the first time shown to account for no less than zzso total zzso Alternative zzso was compared for the human and mouse zzso zzso zzso were demonstrated for 50% alternatively spliced genes zzso total zzso
