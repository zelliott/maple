To zzso local geometrical uncertainties in anatomical zzso during zzso for zzso cancer zzso 

Local setup accuracy was analyzed for 38 patients, who had received zzso zzso and were regularly scanned during treatment with cone beam zzso zzso zzso for zzso patient setup zzso In addition to the clinically used large region of interest zzso we defined eight zzso in the planning CT that contained rigid zzso zzso the zzso zzso jugular zzso zzso bone, zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso By local rigid registration to successive zzso scans, the local setup accuracy of each zzso was determined and compared with the overall setup error assessed with the large zzso zzso were distinguished from rigid body movements by expressing movement relative to a reference zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso patient setup correction protocol using the large zzso resulted in residual systematic errors (1 zzso within zzso zzso and random errors within zzso zzso for each zzso Local setup errors were larger, ranging from zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ranged from zzso zzso near the reference zzso to zzso zzso for the zzso Random zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso 

zzso cancer patients show considerable local setup variations, exceeding residual global patient setup uncertainty in an zzso correction zzso Current planning target volume margins may be inadequate to account for these zzso We propose registration of multiple zzso to drive correction protocols and zzso zzso to reduce the impact of local setup zzso
