To validate clinically in a normal healthy population an zzso to correct the error in the zzso zzso of zzso power based on the use of a variable zzso index of refraction zzso 

zzso International Hospital zzso and University of zzso zzso zzso 

Case zzso 

zzso power was measured with a zzso zzso system zzso software version zzso in healthy eyes with no previous zzso zzso In all cases, zzso zzso power was also estimated using an adjusted value of zzso that is dependent on the anterior zzso radius zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between the zzso zzso and adjusted zzso zzso zzso power values was zzso 

The study evaluated 92 eyes zzso zzso age range 15 to 64 zzso The mean difference between zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A very strong, statistically significant correlation was found between both zzso powers zzso zzso zzso zzso The range of agreement between zzso and zzso was zzso D, with limits of agreement of zzso and zzso zzso In addition, a very strong, statistically significant correlation of the difference between zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso radius was found zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso in the calculation of zzso power using zzso zzso can be minimized in clinical practice by using a variable zzso index that depends on the radius of the anterior zzso zzso
