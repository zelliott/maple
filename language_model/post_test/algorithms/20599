Neonatal zzso zzso was used to zzso selectively the mossy fiber zzso synaptic input to zzso zzso zzso This zzso caused a zzso zzso reduction in the zzso input as determined by quantitative assessment of the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso caused a reduction in the mean number of miniature zzso zzso currents zzso recorded from zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso also caused a reduction in the mean zzso peak zzso from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso SE; peak zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso Similarly, there was a reduction in the mean zzso rise time from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso The effects of the zzso on both zzso zzso and zzso rise time were significant at P zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on the selectively of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso Both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed extensive overlap between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso had a mean peak zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a mean zzso rise time of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had a mean peak zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso rise time of zzso zzso The modes of the zzso zzso were the same at 5 zzso (62 zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were significantly different at P zzso zzso zzso large sample zzso zzso The data demonstrate that the removal of the zzso synaptic input to zzso zzso cells leads to the absence of the large zzso zzso that are present in control zzso
