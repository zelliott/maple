zzso evaluation of zzso zzso images in homogeneous and layered zzso zzso materials is of general importance for understanding the influence of zzso on wave fields during zzso zzso testing and evaluation of these zzso In this contribution, a three zzso ray tracing method is presented for evaluating zzso zzso images zzso in general homogeneous and layered zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso ray source in general homogeneous zzso zzso zzso zzso steel material (including zzso zzso is obtained in three dimensions based on zzso zzso zzso As a prerequisite for ray tracing model, the problem of zzso ray energy reflection and transmission zzso at an interface between zzso zzso base material and zzso zzso zzso material (including zzso zzso zzso two adjacent zzso zzso metals and zzso zzso zzso metal and zzso base material is solved in three zzso The influence of zzso grain orientation and zzso orientation on zzso zzso image is zzso analyzed in the context of zzso testing of homogeneous and layered zzso steel zzso The presented quantitative results provide valuable information during zzso characterization of homogeneous and layered zzso zzso steel zzso
