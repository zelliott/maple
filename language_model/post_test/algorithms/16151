The zzso response at the zzso zzso from zzso zzso stimulation depends on the stimulation zzso 

BC sound transmission in the human skull is complex and differs from zzso zzso BC sound stimulates both zzso with different zzso and time delays influencing hearing perception in a way that is not completely zzso One important zzso is the stimulation position on the human zzso 

By applying BC stimulation at 8 positions on both sides of 7 human zzso zzso the zzso zzso response of the cochlear zzso was investigated in the frequency range of zzso to 10 zzso Using previous data from zzso zzso the zzso transmission zzso and effects of bilateral stimulation to one zzso was zzso 

The zzso transmission from the 8 positions showed small differences, but the zzso showed a generally increased cochlear separation when the stimulation position approached the zzso The effect of simultaneous bilateral stimulation was zzso showing a zzso negative effect for correlated signals, whereas zzso signals gave zzso zzso At higher zzso there was less interaction of the combined stimulation because of the greater zzso zzso Also, the greatest time difference between zzso transmission and zzso transmission was at positions close to the zzso 

The stimulation position only slightly affects the zzso and phase of the zzso cochlear zzso zzso However, because of the great influence from the zzso transmission, a position close to the zzso would be beneficial for patients with bilateral BC hearing zzso
