In this paper, we present the zzso total variation zzso model for face recognition under varying zzso including natural lighting conditions, where we rarely know the strength, direction, or number of light zzso The proposed zzso model has the ability to zzso a single face image and obtain the zzso zzso facial structure, which is then used for face zzso Our model is inspired by the zzso model but has better zzso ability and simpler zzso zzso The merit of this model is that neither does it require any lighting assumption nor does it need any zzso The zzso model reaches very high recognition rates in the tests using both Yale and zzso zzso face databases as well as a face database containing zzso subjects under outdoor lighting zzso
