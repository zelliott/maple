zzso in natural scenes carry rich semantic information, which can be used to assist a wide range of applications, such as object recognition, zzso zzso zzso and human computer zzso However, most existing systems are designed to detect and recognize horizontal (or zzso zzso Due to the increasing popularity of zzso devices and applications, detecting texts of varying zzso from natural images under less controlled conditions has become an important but challenging zzso In this paper, we propose a new zzso to detect texts of varying zzso Our zzso is based on a zzso zzso scheme and two sets of features specially designed for capturing the intrinsic characteristics of zzso To better evaluate the proposed method and compare it with the competing zzso we generate a comprehensive zzso with various types of texts in diverse real-world zzso We also propose a new evaluation zzso which is more suitable for zzso zzso for detecting texts in varying zzso zzso on benchmark zzso demonstrate that our system compares favorably with the state-of-the-art zzso when handling horizontal texts and achieves significantly enhanced performance on zzso texts in complex natural zzso
