zzso in the genes for zzso zzso and the vitamin K zzso zzso complex zzso 1 zzso affect the zzso and zzso of zzso We developed and validated a zzso zzso for a zzso population that predicts the best dose for stable zzso and compared its performance against other zzso zzso 

We determined the zzso and zzso zzso of genes for zzso and zzso on 167 zzso African-American, Asian and Hispanic patients on zzso On a subset where complete data were available zzso we developed a dosing equation that predicts the actual dose needed to maintain target zzso using demographic variables and zzso This zzso was validated against an independent group of zzso We also applied our data to five other published zzso zzso 

The zzso frequency for zzso and zzso and the A zzso for zzso zzso was similar to previously published zzso For Caucasians and zzso zzso zzso were in zzso linkage zzso Some zzso zzso among the African-American population and one zzso among Hispanics were not in zzso The linear zzso of predicted versus actual zzso dose produced zzso of zzso for the training set and zzso for the validation zzso The zzso zzso improved (to zzso and zzso zzso when rare zzso were eliminated or when the zzso zzso zzso was added to the zzso All of the zzso models tested produced a similar degree of zzso The exclusion of rare zzso that are more associated with certain zzso improved the zzso 

Minor improvements in zzso can be observed with the inclusion of ethnicity and more zzso and zzso zzso as zzso Major improvements will likely require the identification of new gene associations with zzso zzso
