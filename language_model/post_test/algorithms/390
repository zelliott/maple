An effective data representation methodology on zzso feature spaces is zzso which allows a better interpretation of zzso zzso phenomena zzso cardiac behavior related to cardiovascular zzso and is based on search criteria over a feature set resulting in an increase in the detection capability of zzso zzso but also connecting these features with the zzso representation of the zzso The proposed dimension reduction scheme consists of three zzso projection, zzso and zzso First, a hybrid zzso is described that projects the zzso data to a lower dimension space, gathering the features that contribute similarly in the meaning of the zzso reconstruction in order to find information of clinical relevance over the initial training zzso Next, an zzso of variable selection is provided that further reduces the dimension, taking into account only the variables that offer greater class zzso and finally, the selected feature set is projected to a zzso space in order to verify the performance of the suggested dimension reduction zzso in terms of the discrimination capability for zzso zzso The zzso recordings used in this study are from the European zzso database and from the zzso Nacional de Colombia zzso In both cases, over zzso feature reduction was zzso and zzso precision was over zzso using a zzso zzso zzso
