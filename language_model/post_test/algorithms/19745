zzso determination of zzso protein zzso remains a challenge for well-established zzso Here, we provide an assessment of an emerging structural technique, zzso zzso zzso zzso and examine the use of collision zzso zzso derived from zzso as restraints for structure characterization of zzso protein zzso Using 15 complexes selected from the zzso Data Bank, we validate the use of zzso models by comparing their zzso with those calculated for zzso zzso We then select six zzso complexes, zzso them in solution to form zzso Experimental and calculated zzso reveal close similarity for 18 of the 21 zzso zzso the use of zzso as a restraint, we incorporate it into a scoring function and show good correlation between the score and similarity to the native structure for zzso especially when an additional symmetry restraint was zzso
