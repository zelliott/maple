A method is described for the rapid comparison of protein binding sites using geometric matching to detect similar three-dimensional zzso The geometric matching detects common atomic features through identification of the maximum common zzso or zzso These features are not necessarily evident from sequence or from global structural similarity giving additional insight into molecular recognition not evident from current sequence or structural zzso zzso Here we use the method to produce an zzso comparison of zzso binding sites in a number of different zzso zzso zzso The similarity search is combined with zzso of similar sites to allow a preliminary structural zzso zzso by site similarity produces a zzso of binding sites for the zzso representative local environments producing ten main clusters representing half of the representative zzso The similarities make sense in terms of both structural and functional zzso zzso The ten main clusters represent a very limited number of unique structural binding motifs for zzso These are the structural zzso zzso binding motif zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso Similar zzso schemes for zzso binding proteins have also been arrived at independently by others using different zzso
