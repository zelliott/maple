Assessment of the risk for the development of age-related zzso zzso requires reliable detection and quantitative mapping of retinal abnormalities that are considered as precursors of the zzso Typical signs for the latter are the so-called zzso that appear as abnormal zzso deposits on the zzso zzso of these features using conventional image analysis methods is quite complicated mainly due to the zzso zzso and the zzso of the pigmentation of the background zzso This paper presents a novel zzso zzso for the automatic detection and mapping of zzso in zzso images acquired with the aid of a digital zzso zzso We employ a modified zzso zzso zzso namely the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for enhancing local intensity zzso For the detection of zzso in zzso images, we develop a novel zzso technique, the zzso zzso local zzso zzso which extracts the useful information from an image without being affected by the presence of other zzso We provide experimental results from the application of our technique to real images, where certain abnormalities zzso have slightly different characteristics from the zzso The performance of the zzso is established through statistical analysis of the zzso This analysis indicates that the proposed zzso detector gives reliable detection accuracy in both position and mass zzso
