The purpose of our study was to evaluate the zzso features of zzso zzso characteristics and the risk of zzso for zzso and clinically zzso zzso detected initially on breast zzso 

We reviewed zzso consecutive breast zzso examinations performed from January 1, 2003, to June 30, 2005, to identify all zzso initially detected on zzso and assessed as zzso 4 or 5 for which the patient underwent subsequent zzso needle or zzso zzso zzso zzso features were recorded for each case, and the risk of zzso was assessed using generalized zzso zzso Separate zzso models were constructed for zzso classified as zzso 

Included in the analysis were 258 suspicious zzso in 196 zzso Among all zzso those of 1 zzso or greater were significantly more often zzso zzso zzso than zzso of less than 1 zzso zzso zzso odds ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso For masses, size, zzso margin, and enhancement pattern predicted zzso In zzso analysis of combinations of features, masses of 1 zzso or greater with zzso enhancement and irregular margins had a zzso probability of zzso zzso of 1 zzso or greater with smooth margins and homogeneous enhancement had the lowest predicted probability of zzso of zzso zzso zzso and size were not significant zzso of zzso for zzso enhancement zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso zzso can predict the probability of zzso for breast zzso masses but not for zzso If our model is zzso masses with a low probability of zzso may be eligible for zzso follow-up rather than zzso Further research focused on zzso features of zzso is zzso
