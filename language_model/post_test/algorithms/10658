The results of zzso global zzso simulations are presented for four small, zzso proteins described by a zzso zzso A zzso scheme that incorporates the local zzso preferences extracted from a large number of high-resolution protein structures is compared with an unbiased zzso In addition, the discrete path sampling method is used to investigate the folding of one of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso times from kinetic zzso Carlo simulations and zzso calculations based on a zzso zzso analysis for the resulting zzso database are in good mutual agreement, but differ significantly from the experimental values, probably because the native state is not the global free energy minimum for the potential zzso
