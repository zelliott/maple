A challenge involved in applying zzso zzso to zzso biomedical data is that the zzso of attribute values has no ordering zzso making the search for dense zzso zzso We propose the zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso of zzso data, and a complementary index for searching for dense zzso zzso The zzso index is updated when new objects are introduced, such that zzso does not need to be repeated on all zzso The updating and cluster retrieval are zzso Comparisons with several other zzso zzso showed that on large zzso zzso achieved better zzso zzso on the number of objects, as well as cluster zzso By fast collapsing the zzso in large networks we achieved an edge reduction of as much as zzso zzso is suitable for large and quickly growing zzso since it is independent of object ordering, does not require zzso when new data zzso and requires no zzso input zzso
