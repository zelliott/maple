The temperature dependence of the interactions that stabilize protein structures is a long-standing issue, the zzso of which would enable the prediction and the rational modification of the zzso of a target zzso It is tackled here by zzso zzso zzso acid pair zzso from four zzso of proteins with increasing melting temperatures zzso The temperature dependence of the interactions is determined from the differences in the shape of the zzso derived from the four zzso Note that, here, we use an unusual zzso definition, which is based on the zzso values, rather than on the living temperature of the host zzso Our results show that the stabilizing weight of zzso interactions (between zzso zzso and zzso remains constant as the temperature increases, compared to the other zzso In contrast, the two zzso of the zzso and zzso salt bridge zzso show a significant zzso zzso These two zzso zzso to two zzso the zzso zzso where the side chains point toward each other, and the zzso zzso which involves the zzso side chain atom of zzso These two types of salt bridges were determined to be significantly more stabilizing at high zzso Moreover, a preference for zzso salt bridges is noticeable in zzso zzso especially for the zzso zzso The zzso zzso that have been defined here should be useful for predicting zzso stability changes upon zzso
