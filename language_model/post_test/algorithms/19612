As a result of the recent developments of zzso screening in drug discovery, the number of available screening compounds has been growing zzso Chemical vendors provide millions of zzso however, these compounds are highly zzso zzso analysis, a technique that groups similar compounds into families, can be used to analyze such zzso Many available zzso methods focus on accurate zzso of zzso they are slow and are not suitable for very large compound zzso Here is described a fast zzso method based on an incremental zzso zzso and the zzso fingerprints of zzso This method can cluster a very large data set with millions of compounds in hours on a single zzso A program implemented with this method, called zzso is available from zzso
