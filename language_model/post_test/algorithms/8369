Previous studies have found that a zzso near the junction of the sixth zzso domain zzso and the third zzso loop of the zzso zzso zzso leads to zzso zzso and enhanced zzso affinity for the zzso zzso These results were consistent with the extended zzso complex model, which predicts a correlation between zzso affinity and zzso zzso We have introduced the zzso zzso into all five zzso of the highly zzso zzso zzso family; zzso was introduced into zzso and zzso and zzso was introduced into zzso zzso and zzso In binding zzso these zzso produced increases in affinities toward zzso and zzso that ranged from zzso at the zzso zzso to zzso to zzso at zzso zzso and zzso to zzso at zzso In functional zzso all five zzso receptors exhibited zzso activity, at levels ranging between 30 and zzso of the zzso response zzso by zzso In every case, the zzso zzso zzso inhibited this zzso activity with high zzso Thus, despite differences in zzso zzso and in zzso sequence at the zzso site, all five zzso were activated by this zzso at the top of zzso Previous studies of the zzso zzso have indicated that zzso is a zzso switch that sets the zzso state of the zzso Based on the results of the present study, it is possible that zzso represents a general switch for the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
