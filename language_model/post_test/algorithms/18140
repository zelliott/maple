This paper proposes a zzso character modeling method based on zzso random fields zzso for handwritten Chinese character recognition zzso The stroke relationships of a Chinese character reflect its structure, which can be statistically represented by the neighborhood system and zzso zzso within the zzso zzso Based on the prior knowledge of character structures, we design the neighborhood system that accounts for the most important stroke zzso We zzso the structurally mismatched stroke relationships with zzso using the prior zzso zzso and derive the likelihood zzso zzso from zzso mixture models, which zzso the large variations of stroke relationships zzso In the proposed zzso system, we use the zzso likelihood zzso zzso to extract many candidate strokes from character images, and use the zzso zzso zzso to determine the best structural match between the input candidate strokes and the zzso character models by relaxation zzso The experiments on the zzso character database demonstrate that zzso can statistically model character structures, and work well in the zzso zzso
