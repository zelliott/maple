We developed a zzso zzso mathematical model that fits zzso zzso data against zzso zzso in zzso and used the model to simulate the expected kill zzso for typical intravenous and oral dosing zzso A series of zzso mathematical models were used to fit zzso data for two zzso each of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso parameters extracted from human data sets were used in the model to simulate kill zzso for each zzso zzso data were best fit by using an adapted zzso zzso model that corrected for delays in zzso growth and the onset of zzso activity, zzso of the number of zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso The rates of zzso killing by zzso zzso were highly correlated with the growth rates zzso of the zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso using zzso parameters derived from the human data sets showed zzso effects against each of the zzso In conclusion, we demonstrated that the activity of zzso against zzso zzso can be accurately described using a mathematical zzso In the future, it might be possible to devise optimal dosing regimens of zzso using the model and zzso data collected in zzso
