zzso dynamics is a crucial problem for zzso neural networks, as it is the zzso zzso mechanism for memory storage and retrieval in neural zzso This brief studies a class of zzso network consisting of zzso threshold zzso and analyzes global zzso based on a zzso zzso zzso On the basis of previous results on zzso and zzso zzso in zzso we further zzso all possible zzso global zzso Our theoretical result provides precise descriptions on how the changes of network parameters affect the zzso distribution and landscape, and it may give a feasible solution towards specifying zzso by specifying zzso zzso are presented to illustrate the theoretical zzso
