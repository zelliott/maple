The speed of sound zzso has become a useful tool in osteoporosis assessment, since it represents a combination of density and zzso of bone tissue and should provide better information on bone quality and an estimate the fracture zzso In general, the speed of sound on zzso material, such as bone zzso depends strongly on zzso zzso a measurement of zzso zzso magnitude zzso might provide more important bone structure information than zzso of bone mineral density zzso zzso or broadband ultrasound zzso zzso To obtain the zzso zzso magnitude requires a sequence of zzso that have a frequency that is different from that used in conventional zzso The measurement is complicated by the fact that pulse zzso will distort as the zzso zzso through the zzso zzso zzso the phase zzso and zzso zzso zzso also can be obtained on zzso zzso However, the accuracy of those techniques is affected by the zzso ambiguity in the phase zzso process in frequency zzso And the spectrum approach is highly dependent on the gating window selection in time domain zzso The zzso split spectrum processing zzso technique is proposed here to measure the phase zzso and the zzso The zzso technique is also used to measure the zzso and zzso of two commercial zzso zzso zzso results are in good agreement with the zzso parameters of a zzso signal obtained using the zzso zzso In addition, in zzso zzso zzso agree with the zzso specifications for two commercial zzso zzso The negative zzso is also found in in zzso zzso on human zzso Finally, an approach based on the time domain zzso technique has potential clinical applications for osteoporosis zzso
