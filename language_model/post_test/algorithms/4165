A zzso X-ray microscope is a powerful imaging apparatus for taking high-resolution and zzso X-ray images of zzso zzso A sufficient number of X-ray projection images from different angles is required for constructing zzso volume images of an zzso Because a zzso light source is zzso a zzso object holder is required for zzso At a resolution of 10 zzso per zzso the zzso of the holder caused by rotating the object cannot be disregarded if zzso images are to be reconstructed zzso This paper presents a computer method to compensate for the zzso of the zzso holder by aligning neighboring X-ray zzso This alignment process involves two zzso The first step is to match the zzso feature zzso in the sequence of zzso The matched projected feature points in the zzso plane should form a set of zzso zzso The second step is to fit the zzso to a set of sine waves to zzso the parameters required for zzso The experimental results show that the proposed method zzso two previously proposed methods, zzso and zzso The developed software system can be downloaded from the zzso zzso or zzso
