We have developed a new face zzso framework termed from local zzso structure to global image zzso zzso Based on the assumption that two similar face images should have similar local zzso structures, the new framework first uses the input zzso zzso face image to search a face database for similar example high-resolution zzso faces in order to learn the local zzso structures for the target zzso zzso It then uses the input zzso face and the learned zzso structures as zzso to estimate the target zzso zzso We present a three-step zzso procedure for the zzso Step 1 searches the database for K example faces that are the most similar to the zzso and then zzso the K example images to the input using optical zzso Step 2 uses the warped zzso version of the K example faces to learn the local zzso structures for the target zzso zzso An effective method for learning local zzso structures from an individual face, and an zzso procedure for fusing the local zzso structures of different example faces to reduce the influence of zzso zzso have been zzso Step 3 estimates the target zzso face by solving a constrained zzso problem by means of an zzso zzso Experimental results show that our new method can provide good performances for face zzso both in terms of reconstruction error and visual zzso and that it is competitive with existing state-of-the-art zzso
