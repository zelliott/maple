We consider splitting and stabilization of zzso zzso zzso zzso in a model based on the zzso zzso zzso which includes a small zzso term, and weak resonant zzso management zzso zzso zzso zzso of the cubic zzso at the frequency close to that of shape zzso of the zzso The model applies to the light propagation in media with zzso optical zzso and periodic zzso of linear loss and gain and to zzso zzso with the zzso zzso term accounting for the weak zzso of the dynamics from one zzso while the zzso can be induced by means of the zzso zzso We propose an explanation to the effect of the resonant splitting of the zzso under the action of the zzso Then, using systematic simulations and an zzso approach, we conclude that the weak zzso zzso with the zzso sign zzso the zzso while the zzso zzso zzso zzso its zzso It is also shown that the zzso term with the zzso sign makes the resonant response of the zzso to the zzso essentially broader in terms of the zzso
