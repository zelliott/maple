The zzso small animal PET camera is a zzso array of zzso avalanche zzso the camera described in this publication consists of 16 zzso We present the system response using point and line sources and a mouse zzso The zzso camera exhibits a count rate stability of better than zzso and zzso of response to zzso up to zzso zzso zzso zzso at 16 zzso zzso zzso for zzso and random zzso the efficiency for the line source is zzso of which zzso zzso yield zzso The scatter fraction originating from the detectors is zzso zzso within the mouse phantom was zzso and the scatter fraction increased to zzso Resolution is uniform within the entire zzso which is 28 zzso zzso and 17 zzso zzso Reconstruction of a point source yields a resolution of zzso zzso zzso for all three zzso The performance of the camera demonstrates its excellent suitability for the functional imaging of small zzso
