Our aim in this study was to evaluate the effect of geometry for measuring section thickness in zzso by using a metal zzso device zzso zzso zzso images were obtained from two types of zzso equipment, zzso zzso zzso zzso Japan) and zzso zzso GE zzso Milwaukee, zzso After zzso zzso with each device, the zzso zzso images were obtained by image zzso The digital profile was obtained from the digital value of the zzso central coordinate in the perpendicular direction, and we acquired the slice sensitivity profile zzso The section thickness was defined with the full zzso at half maximum obtained from the zzso We investigated the change in section thickness under different evaluation conditions: the angular range, the height of the zzso position, the zzso zzso distance zzso and image zzso The section thickness decreased when the angular range and height of the zzso position zzso Also, the section thickness varied with a change in the zzso The section thickness differed according to the geometry for measuring the section zzso Thus, the effect of the geometry used for measurement should be considered when the section thickness in zzso is measured by the zzso zzso
