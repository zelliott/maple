Achieving dry weight during zzso zzso while minimizing symptoms is critical for zzso patient outcome by preventing chronic fluid overload, hypertension, and zzso Dry weight changes frequently in children because of growth and development and zzso and waning of zzso We have previously shown zzso zzso monitoring zzso helps to decrease zzso symptoms, while still achieving target dry weights in children receiving chronic zzso In the current study, we zzso evaluated an zzso zzso zzso management zzso to determine target dry weight in nine pediatric patients zzso age zzso years, mean weight zzso zzso Use of zzso could potentially lead to overly aggressive zzso with increased zzso symptoms, post treatment zzso and zzso weight gain zzso To evaluate the effectiveness of our zzso zzso algorithm, we studied the effect of three different zzso zzso models zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso symptoms, zzso blood pressure zzso and percentage zzso To assess zzso symptoms, patients completed two zzso one for each day between zzso No statistically significant difference was seen between the three zzso models with respect to zzso or zzso symptoms, zzso zzso or percentage zzso Only one of nine patients received zzso chronic zzso medication, yet all patients had zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for age and zzso The current study suggests that routine determination of target dry weight using zzso and aiming for zzso zzso helps to achieve the target dry weight, reduces both the risk of chronic fluid overload and the need for zzso medication, and does not lead to increased zzso or zzso zzso in pediatric patients treated with chronic zzso
