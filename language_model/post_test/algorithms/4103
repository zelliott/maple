zzso diagnostic methods to conventional zzso are currently being investigated for developing rapid and objective zzso understanding of various disorders, especially zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso imaging has been put in the frontline as potentially promising in this regard as it provides a zzso zzso of the zzso composition of cells and zzso In order to ascertain the feasible conditions of zzso zzso methods for zzso analysis, zzso zzso imaging zzso transmission, zzso total reflection, and zzso zzso of the same colon tissue has been zzso The spectral images acquired were subjected to zzso zzso analysis in order to identify on a molecular level the constituent zzso organization of the colon tissue such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso by comparing the cluster images with the zzso reference zzso Based on this study, a comparative analysis of important factors involved in the zzso zzso imaging approaches such as image resolution, time constraints, their advantages and limitations, and their zzso to biological zzso has been carried zzso Out of the three different zzso imaging zzso tested, zzso total reflection mode of imaging appears to provide a good compromise between the tissue zzso and the time constraints in achieving similar image contrast to that of zzso imaging at an approximately zzso faster measurement zzso The present study demonstrates the advantages, the limitations of the important parameters involved in zzso zzso imaging approaches, and their potential application toward imaging of biological zzso
