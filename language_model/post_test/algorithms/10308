Diagnosis zzso in zzso Care Trial zzso was a zzso zzso zzso study in three European countries to identify the optimal subset of simple tests applied in primary care to diagnose benign zzso zzso zzso in men who spontaneously present with lower urinary tract symptoms zzso 

zzso male patients aged zzso 50 years who spontaneously attended their regular general practitioner zzso office with zzso were eligible for inclusion if they had not previously undergone zzso diagnostic tests or received treatment for zzso Patients were assessed on three occasions, twice by their regular zzso zzso 1 and 2) and once by a zzso zzso zzso The diagnostic accuracy of each variable was determined using the zzso final zzso diagnosis (at visit 3) as zzso Independent variables zzso were as zzso zzso zzso diagnosis performed by zzso in visit 1 zzso probability of zzso diagnosis assessed by zzso in visit 1; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso International zzso zzso zzso zzso diagnosis of zzso performed by zzso in visit 2 zzso and probability of zzso diagnosis assessed by zzso in visit zzso zzso significant variables zzso zzso zzso were included in a zzso zzso model to identify the best zzso and describe each test zzso 

The most frequent spontaneously reported zzso were zzso and weak urinary zzso zzso study prevalence was zzso zzso zzso and zzso of patients were at risk of zzso progression zzso zzso zzso zzso and prostate volume zzso 30 zzso Among the independent variables zzso only age, zzso and zzso showed a statistically significant relationship with zzso zzso In a zzso zzso model including age, zzso zzso and probability of zzso (based on physical examination and zzso positive zzso value zzso was zzso zzso of zzso probability resulted in a zzso of zzso 

A diagnostic zzso including only objective variables zzso zzso and zzso easily implemented in any zzso office, allows zzso to accurately diagnose zzso in approximately three-quarters of patients spontaneously reporting zzso
