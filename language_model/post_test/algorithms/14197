The X-ray zzso zzso structures zzso at the F zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso phase are zzso by a combination of zzso zzso calculations with the zzso code and a zzso discussion of local molecular zzso zzso zzso at the absorbing zzso zzso By means of a Walsh correlation zzso it is shown that the two intense zzso bands observed at the F zzso of the zzso zzso can be interpreted as transitions to zzso zzso in zzso that have zzso and zzso zzso point group zzso The energies of both zzso zzso are very insensitive to the angle between the zzso bonds, which explains the close similarity of the zzso signatures from the three zzso The zzso analysis shows that the increased broadening of the zzso structure for zzso and the zzso zzso phase is due to the zzso of the individual zzso zzso from the zzso distinct F zzso The interpretation in terms of local zzso provides for the first time a zzso zzso approach to investigations of solid zzso by zzso zzso and provides a simple conceptual framework for the discussion of the electronic structure in zzso zzso
