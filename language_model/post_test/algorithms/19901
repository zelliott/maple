zzso information about the geometry of the carotid artery zzso is relevant for investigating the onset and progression of zzso zzso This paper proposes an automatic approach for zzso the carotid zzso angle, carotid area ratio, carotid bulb size and the vessel zzso from zzso zzso First, the internal and external carotid zzso are determined by finding a minimum cost path between zzso seed points where the local costs are based on zzso and zzso The minimum cost path zzso is zzso applied after curved zzso zzso to refine the zzso Second, the carotid zzso is segmented using a zzso preserving zzso active zzso which is zzso by the extracted zzso and steered by the MR zzso Third, the zzso angle and vessel zzso are automatically extracted from the segmented zzso The methods for zzso tracking and zzso zzso are evaluated by comparing their accuracy to the zzso and zzso zzso on 48 zzso zzso carotid zzso acquired as part of a zzso population zzso The evaluation reveals that 94 of 96 carotid arteries are segmented zzso The distance between the tracked zzso and the reference standard zzso zzso is similar to the zzso variation zzso zzso The zzso zzso accuracy zzso zzso average mean absolute surface zzso zzso is close to the zzso variation zzso zzso average mean surface zzso zzso The correlation zzso of manually and zzso derived zzso angle, carotid zzso area ratio, carotid zzso bulb size and vessel zzso zzso are close to the correlation of these measures between zzso This demonstrates that the automated method can be used for replacing manual zzso zzso and manual zzso drawing for zzso zzso in zzso data prior to zzso the carotid zzso zzso
