zzso zzso is considered to be without significant zzso consequence in young zzso However, zzso to adults, few studies have investigated cardiac zzso Using zzso zzso monitoring of cardiac zzso we zzso investigated zzso zzso in 48 children zzso age, zzso zzso receiving zzso general zzso combined with zzso or zzso zzso zzso They were randomly assigned to receive zzso zzso of plain local zzso mixture zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso + 1 zzso of zzso or 1 zzso of the same mixture with 5 zzso of zzso No significant zzso zzso was zzso in zzso and zzso groups receiving the plain mixture except a moderate decrease in heart zzso zzso a mixture with adrenaline added provoked a significant decrease in mean zzso blood pressure by zzso and zzso in systemic vascular resistance by zzso and zzso and an increase in cardiac output by zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso groups, zzso The adrenaline effect was greater by the zzso than the zzso zzso In young children, zzso zzso zzso an increase in cardiac output only when adrenaline is added to local zzso probably through its systemic zzso from the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso may induce significant zzso changes, well documented in zzso Using zzso zzso monitoring in children, we reported an increase in cardiac output and a decrease in zzso blood pressure only when zzso was added to zzso local zzso
