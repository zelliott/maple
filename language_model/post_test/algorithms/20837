This article attempts to discern the physical (or zzso features of the zzso degradation of two major and ubiquitous zzso pollutants, zzso zzso and zzso The fundamental physical phenomenon behind zzso degradation of pollutants is zzso motion of zzso zzso This study zzso a dual approach to the problem, zzso results of the experiments under different conditions have been coupled to a mathematical model that addresses physics and chemistry of the zzso zzso Various experimental techniques applied in this study influence important physical parameters related to zzso phenomenon in the liquid medium such as extent of radical production from the bubble, thickness of the liquid shell surrounding the bubble that gets heated up during transient collapse, the concentration of the zzso in the zzso region and extent of radical scavenging in the zzso zzso analysis of the experimental and simulation results reveal that overall degradation of the zzso achieved for a given combination of experimental conditions is a function of competing (and sometimes zzso effect of these zzso A zzso account of the relative influence of these parameters and the zzso between them is zzso
