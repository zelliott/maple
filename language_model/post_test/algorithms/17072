The authors compared oral zzso zzso with ultrasound zzso in the detection of chronic gallbladder disease using clinical outcome, rather than pathology results, as the reference zzso 

The authors interviewed zzso patients who underwent either zzso zzso or both, for evaluation of chronic right upper zzso abdominal zzso The authors considered patients who underwent zzso with improved symptoms 1 to 4 years after surgery to be zzso positive for gallbladder disease, and patients with objective evidence of an alternative diagnosis zzso zzso zzso zzso which improved with therapy as zzso zzso 

The sensitivity and specificity of zzso were zzso and zzso respectively, and for zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso is comparable with US in evaluating of chronic gallbladder zzso In institutions where zzso is used for diagnosing chronic zzso it may be reasonable to continue using zzso
