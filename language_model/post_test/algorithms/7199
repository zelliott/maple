Time zzso zzso and spatial neighborhood zzso are two mainstream structured light techniques widely used for depth zzso The former is well known for its high accuracy and the latter for its low zzso In this paper, we explore a new paradigm of zzso depth sensing to integrate the advantages of both the TM and zzso zzso Our contribution is zzso First, we design a set of hybrid structured light patterns composed of zzso fringe and zzso zzso Under the zzso of the hybrid patterns, depth can be zzso reconstructed either from a few consecutive frames with the TM principle for zzso scenes or from a single frame with the zzso principle for dynamic zzso Second, we propose a zzso depth sensing framework based on which a global or zzso optimal depth map can be generated through motion zzso To validate the proposed zzso zzso we develop a real-time (20 zzso depth sensing zzso Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves an efficient balance between accuracy and speed during depth sensing that has rarely been exploited zzso
