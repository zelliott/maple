The ability to detect social zzso plays an important role in the social and emotional development of zzso zzso this problem from a zzso perspective may provide important clues for understanding social development, as well as for the synthesis of social behavior in zzso In this paper, we show that the zzso behaviors observed in infants during contingency detection situations are tuned to zzso gather information as to whether a person is responsive to zzso We show that simple reinforcement learning mechanisms can explain how infants acquire these efficient contingency detection zzso The key is to use the reduction of uncertainty zzso zzso as a reward zzso The result is an interesting form of learning in which the zzso rewards itself for conducting actions that help reduce its own sense of zzso This paper illustrates the possibilities of an emerging area of computer science and engineering that focuses on the zzso understanding of human behavior and on its synthesis in zzso We believe that the theory of zzso optimal control will play a key role providing a formal mathematical foundation for this newly emerging zzso
