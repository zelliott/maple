For complex robots such as zzso zzso control is highly beneficial for accurate tracking while keeping negative feedback gains low for zzso However, in such zzso zzso lightweight systems, conventional identification of rigid body dynamics models using zzso data and zzso models is inaccurate due to unknown zzso robot dynamic zzso An alternative method is zzso zzso zzso but significant noise in measured and zzso variables affects it zzso Moreover, standard zzso procedures may give physically inconsistent results due to zzso zzso or insufficiently rich zzso This paper addresses these problems, proposing a zzso system identification technique for linear or zzso linear zzso Inspired by Factor Analysis regression, we develop a zzso efficient zzso zzso zzso zzso that is robust to zzso data, automatically detects relevant features, and identifies input and output zzso We evaluate our approach on rigid body zzso zzso for various robotic systems, achieving an error of up to three times lower than other state-of-the-art machine learning zzso
