Patients with an zzso zzso zzso zzso can undergo inappropriate therapies if electrical activity not originating in the zzso is wrongly recognized as zzso by the zzso zzso therapy can be the result of detection of zzso zzso or zzso of other artifacts by the zzso zzso detection criteria in third-generation zzso have been implemented to recognize fast zzso zzso Analysis of the use of these criteria in patients with an zzso has shown that zzso detected in the zzso zzso zone are frequently zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso episodes in 23 of 59 zzso Use of sudden onset was very effective in detecting zzso zzso (65 of 67 zzso and stability was very useful in detecting zzso zzso zzso of 32 zzso However sensitivity in detecting zzso zzso was only zzso zzso of 497 zzso Application of the zzso rate duration criteria allowed appropriate treatment of all zzso zzso episodes, increasing sensitivity to zzso however, specificity in appropriate zzso of zzso episodes decreased from zzso to zzso zzso analysis of different zzso showed that sudden onset zzso zzso and stability zzso 40 zzso was the zzso with the best specificity and zzso zzso sudden onset and stability detection criteria with a zzso rate duration safety net for triggering zzso therapy results in appropriate device management in most patients with zzso and relatively slow zzso zzso
