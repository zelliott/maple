This study aims to develop an automatic detector of the A zzso of the zzso alternating pattern, periodic activity that generally occurs during zzso zzso zzso Eight zzso recordings from healthy subjects were zzso From zzso recordings, five band zzso an activity zzso and a zzso zzso were extracted and used to train different zzso zzso A visual scoring provided by an expert zzso was used as golden zzso Four alternative mathematical zzso techniques were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso support zzso machines, zzso zzso zzso and zzso supervised artificial neural zzso The results of the zzso compared with the visual analysis, showed average zzso equal to zzso and zzso for the linear zzso and the neural network, respectively, while zzso had a slightly lower zzso equal to zzso The zzso leads to accuracy of zzso The performance achieved by the automatic zzso is encouraging, since an efficient automatic zzso would benefit the practice in everyday clinics, preventing the physician from the time-consuming activity of the visually scoring of the sleep zzso over whole zzso sleep zzso Finally, the zzso based on learning zzso would provide an objective zzso overcoming the problems of zzso zzso
