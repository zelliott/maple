Variation in expert opinion and lack of a systematic methodology hinder the development of reliable clinical practice zzso However standardized protocols have been defined to zzso combine, and zzso expert zzso In addition, statistical methods may help to outline guidelines based on simplified models of these zzso 

To test this hypothesis, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso tree pruning zzso were used to predict the results of two expert panels zzso 1992 and Switzerland zzso on zzso in zzso zzso Both panels, using the zzso explicit method, assessed whether the procedure would be inappropriate or of potential use in zzso case scenarios combining 7 relevant zzso 

zzso was rated as inappropriate in zzso and zzso of the scenarios by the US and Swiss panels, zzso Either statistical method, in both panels, based its simplest model on the same 4 factors, as zzso imaging test results; zzso neurological zzso and conservative treatment trials (in decreasing zzso the influence of 2 other factors, duration of pain and nerve root zzso were only zzso The correct zzso rates of the models were zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso and zzso for zzso zzso the zzso US zzso as a zzso would lead to consider performing zzso only in patients with imaging evidence of hernia, relatively severe zzso zzso zzso and previous zzso zzso zzso to the corresponding zzso Swiss zzso would result in less restrictive zzso 

The statistical techniques proved as useful instruments to structure and simplify appropriateness criteria developed by expert panels and to outline zzso decision models for clinical zzso
