To compare zzso imaging of contrast zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso with two-dimensional zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso and three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of normal cerebral veins and zzso zzso zzso 

This prospective study consisted of 35 consecutive zzso All patients were examined with zzso zzso TRICKS zzso and zzso zzso a single dose of intravenous contrast material was administered for the last two zzso The image quality of these techniques was assessed and compared zzso (by a zzso scoring zzso and zzso (by calculating zzso ratios zzso and zzso ratios zzso 

Left zzso zzso left zzso zzso bilateral zzso veins and zzso veins were better zzso by TRICKS zzso and zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso For left zzso vein zzso TRICKS zzso was inferior to zzso zzso zzso With quantitative analysis the zzso and zzso were highest at TRICKS zzso which was followed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Despite its limited spatial resolution, TRICKS zzso is comparable to zzso zzso zzso and better than zzso zzso in the zzso of normal zzso zzso and cerebral zzso 

zzso Time resolved magnetic resonance zzso can image the zzso zzso system zzso zzso It seems comparable to zzso zzso techniques in zzso zzso zzso The optimal phase for zzso structures can be chosen from the dynamic data set zzso The diagnostic performance in zzso zzso requires further zzso
