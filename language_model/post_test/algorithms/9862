We describe a new technique for comparing mathematical models to the biological systems that are zzso This technique is appropriate for systems that produce relaxation zzso or bursting zzso and takes advantage of noise that is inherent to all biological zzso Both types of zzso are composed of active zzso of activity followed by silent zzso repeating zzso The presence of noise adds zzso to the zzso of the different zzso The central idea of the technique is that the active phase duration may be correlated with zzso the previous or next silent phase zzso and the resulting correlation pattern provides information about the dynamic structure of the zzso zzso patterns can easily be determined by making scatter plots and applying correlation analysis to the cluster of data zzso This could be done both with experimental data and with model simulation zzso If the model correlation pattern is in general agreement with the experimental data, then this adds support for the zzso of the zzso Otherwise, the model must be zzso While this tool is only one test of many required to validate a mathematical model, it is easy to implement and is zzso
