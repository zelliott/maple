zzso zzso zzso imaging is a fast developing new zzso not only for medical imaging, but as well for other fields such as material zzso While these many possible applications zzso the knowledge of the noise behavior is zzso 

In this work, the authors used a least squares fitting zzso to calculate the noise behavior of the three quantities zzso differential phase, and zzso zzso Further, the calculated error formula of the differential phase image was verified by zzso zzso a zzso zzso was setup, using a zzso zzso tube as source and a zzso detector for zzso zzso Additionally, simulations regarding this topic were zzso 

It turned out that the zzso of the reconstructed phase is only dependent of the total number of photons used to generate the phase image and the visibility of the experimental zzso These results could be evaluated in zzso as well as in zzso Furthermore, the correlation between zzso and zzso image was zzso 

These results provide the understanding of the noise characteristics of zzso zzso imaging and will help to improve image zzso
