A zzso visual field with two programs of different testing field size was zzso and the visual fields between them were zzso 

zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso glaucoma were tested by zzso field zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Dublin, California, zzso programs zzso full threshold and zzso full zzso Forty reliable results with both programs were zzso 

zzso of the same position within a zzso field was significantly higher with the zzso program than with the zzso zzso Higher sensitivity within a zzso field with the zzso program significantly correlated with that with the zzso zzso 

Visual field determined by automated zzso was influenced by testing field zzso
