We show that networks of relatively realistic mathematical models for biological zzso in principle can simulate arbitrary zzso zzso neural nets in a way that has previously not been zzso This new approach is based on zzso coding by single spikes zzso by the timing of zzso firing in pools of zzso rather than on the traditional interpretation of analog variables in terms of firing zzso The resulting new simulation is substantially faster and hence more consistent with experimental results about the zzso speed of information processing in cortical neural zzso As a consequence we can show that networks of noisy zzso zzso are zzso zzso in the sense that they can approximate with regard to zzso coding any given continuous function of several zzso This result holds for a fairly large class of schemes for coding analog variables by firing times of zzso zzso This new proposal for the possible organization of zzso in networks of zzso zzso systems has some interesting consequences for the type of learning rules that would be needed to explain the zzso of such zzso Finally, the fast and zzso zzso of zzso neural nets by zzso coding points to possible new ways of implementing zzso and zzso zzso neural nets with pulse stream zzso
