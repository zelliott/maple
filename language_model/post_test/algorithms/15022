The use of zzso image sets has become widely used to zzso zzso zzso zzso One application of this method of zzso is to perform zzso zzso following zzso zzso permanent prostate zzso zzso where the target structure and the source locations are displayed on the same zzso The design of an appropriate scanning sequence often results in abutting slices of an intermediate slice zzso zzso 4, or 5 zzso Because a single source may be zzso on more than one zzso the zzso scans always show many more source locations than actual sources zzso The physicist is then faced with the tedious task of determining which sources appear on more than one slice and deciding which source locations to eliminate from the data zzso We have developed an algorithm, similar to one employed by Roy et zzso which zzso this process by relaxing the nearest neighbor criterion until the number of sources is reduced to either the number of sources implanted or the number counted on a projection zzso This paper details this zzso and the results of its application to phantom studies, comparing to known source locations, as well as clinical studies, comparing to zzso film source zzso on a series of ten zzso Phantom studies demonstrate the superiority of the zzso over zzso film zzso locating zzso of the sources within 5 zzso of the actual location as compared to zzso for the paired zzso The clinical study findings are commensurate with these results, with zzso of the sources on average located within 5 zzso of the corresponding source in the other data zzso The positive correlation of the quality of the zzso film reconstruction results with the quality of the zzso results suggests that differences in registration between the two data sets may be due primarily to the uncertainties in the zzso film zzso
