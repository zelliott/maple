In the last years, several motion analysis methods have been developed without considering representative contexts for sports zzso The purpose of this paper was to explain and underscore a straightforward method to measure human behavior in these zzso 

zzso combining manual video tracking (with zzso zzso and zzso reconstruction (through direct linear zzso using a single camera were used in order to capture zzso data required to zzso collective zzso and control zzso These procedures were applied to a zzso association football task as an illustrative zzso of team sports and will be presented in a tutorial zzso 

zzso analysis of distance and zzso data identified a collective variable zzso between the distance of the attacker and the defender to a target defensive zzso and two zzso control parameters zzso distance and relative zzso 

zzso demonstrated that the complementary use of zzso software and direct linear transformation permit to capture and reconstruct complex human actions in their context in a low zzso space zzso zzso
