zzso Hearing Loss zzso is the most common occupational disease in the zzso zzso noise is a typical noise exposure in military and industrial fields, and generates severe hearing loss problem in these zzso This paper presents four key parameters of impulse noise that significantly affect on zzso zzso Unit zzso in the zzso zzso Assessment Algorithm for zzso zzso zzso The results show that zzso increases zzso with the peak pressure (both zzso and zzso zzso While the zzso increase first and then decrease with time zzso rising, and the peak of zzso appears at about zzso zzso zzso zzso (for both zzso and zzso In addition, the auditory hazard of measured impulse noises generated by the lab noise exposure system was evaluated by using zzso zzso zzso from experiments indicate that the zzso model is suitable for impulse noise hazardous zzso
