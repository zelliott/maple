A simple channel zzso for zzso coded zzso frequency division zzso zzso systems in rapid fading channels is zzso The channels at the training zzso are estimated using the zzso zzso algorithm, while the channels at the data zzso are estimated based on the method for zzso the zzso channel as the linear combination of several zzso zzso zzso Computer simulations showed that this zzso zzso the zzso tracking in rapid fading channels and that the performance of this method can be improved by zzso
