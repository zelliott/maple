Perhaps the most common question that a zzso study can ask is, zzso two given biological conditions, which genes exhibit changed expression zzso zzso methods for answering this question either generate a comparative measure based upon a zzso model, or take an indirect approach, first zzso absolute expression levels and then comparing the estimated levels to one zzso We present a method for detecting changes in gene expression between two samples based on data from zzso zzso Using a library of over 200,000 known cases of differential zzso we create a learned comparative expression measure zzso based on zzso of zzso data patterns as changed or zzso zzso uses perfect match probe data only; mismatch probe values did not prove to be useful in this zzso zzso is particularly powerful in the case of small zzso studies, in which a zzso method such as zzso cannot zzso and in detecting small expression zzso At the levels of selectivity that are typical in zzso analysis, the zzso shows a lower false discovery rate than either zzso or zzso trained from a single zzso When many chips are available to zzso zzso performs better on two out of the three data sets, and nearly as well on the zzso Performance of the zzso log ratio statistic was notably bad on all zzso
