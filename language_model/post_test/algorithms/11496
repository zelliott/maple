zzso zzso are very efficient search mechanisms which zzso recombine and select amongst tentative solutions to a problem until a near optimal one is zzso We introduce them as a new tool to study zzso The identification and motivation for different fitness functions is zzso The evolution of the zinc finger sequence motif from a random start is zzso zzso specified changes of the zzso zzso structure were simulated and critical sites and exchanges for zzso zzso zzso zzso spaces are efficiently searched as illustrated by the zzso zzso folding of a model protein of a four beta strand zzso The genetic zzso simulation which zzso important folding constraints as overall zzso packaging and a propensity of the zzso zzso for trans positions achieved a unique zzso zzso in the beta strand regions and a length of 3-5 for the zzso zzso was zzso zzso interaction sites were considerably less effective in driving the zzso
