zzso zzso coli zzso is defined by zzso adherence zzso to zzso cells, where bacteria display adherence to cell surfaces and also to the intervening zzso in a zzso zzso We previously showed that an zzso zzso designated zzso is required for the expression of zzso genes that mediate AA of zzso strain zzso In this study, we hypothesized that zzso also controls the expression of other zzso zzso in zzso zzso Using zzso and zzso analysis, we identified for the first time that zzso activates the expression of zzso zzso including 25 zzso genes zzso which are localized to a 117 zzso zzso island zzso inserted at zzso Many of these genes have zzso in other zzso bacteria and were recently proposed to constitute a type VI zzso system zzso zzso was identified as a zzso protein that has no apparent zzso within zzso zzso strains carrying zzso deletions of zzso zzso zzso or zzso still zzso zzso however, zzso zzso was zzso Cloning of zzso genes into zzso coli zzso suggested that zzso are sufficient for zzso zzso A second zzso was identified within the zzso zzso that zzso a protein unrelated by sequence identity to zzso Distribution studies indicated that zzso and zzso are commonly found in zzso zzso worldwide, particularly in strains defined as typical zzso These data support the hypothesis that zzso is a global regulator of zzso zzso zzso and builds on the hypothesis that zzso is an importance zzso of zzso
