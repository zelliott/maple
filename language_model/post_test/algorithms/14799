To acquire images of dynamic scenes from multiple points of view zzso the acquisition time of vision sensors should be zzso In this paper, an zzso synchronization derived from the zzso loop zzso mechanism based on the signal zzso method is proposed and zzso To eliminate the system dependency due to the zzso fluctuation of the reference zzso which may be caused by the moving objects or relative zzso distance change between the light source and the observed objects, the zzso zzso of the reference signal is zzso zzso by the estimated maximum zzso between the reference signal and its zzso counterpart to generate a stable synchronization in highly dynamic zzso Both simulated results and real world experimental results demonstrated successful synchronization result that zzso frame rate vision sensors can be successfully synchronized to a LED zzso or its reflected light with satisfactory stability and only zzso zzso
