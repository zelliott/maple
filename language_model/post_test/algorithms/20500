Many biomedical experiments require a precisely timed real-time zzso computer zzso Because commonly used zzso operating systems are inherently zzso real-time laboratory computer systems are often based on outdated zzso software or expensive proprietary real-time operating zzso Here we discuss a real-time computing system, based on the free zzso operating system, which we have developed for zzso pacing control in a clinical cardiac zzso zzso This powerful, flexible, and inexpensive system demonstrates that zzso is well suited for real-time biomedical experiment zzso
