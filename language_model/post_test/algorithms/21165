MR zzso zzso allows the zzso assessment of the zzso properties of human zzso based on the organ response to zzso zzso zzso zzso waves of a given frequency are mechanically introduced and the propagation is zzso by applying zzso zzso An experiment was set up that introduces zzso zzso waves combined with broadband motion zzso to extend the dynamic range of zzso from one given frequency to, in this study, four different zzso With this approach, multiple wave images corresponding to the four driving zzso are simultaneously acquired and can be evaluated with regard to the zzso of the complex zzso over the respective zzso A zzso model based on two zzso zzso and one zzso zzso was used to reproduce the experimental wave speed and wave zzso zzso The technique was applied in eight healthy volunteers and eight patients with zzso high-grade liver zzso zzso zzso zzso liver had a significantly higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Pa zzso zzso and elastic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than the zzso zzso zzso zzso Pa zzso zzso and elastic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of normal zzso zzso zzso is well suited for the zzso differentiation of normal and zzso liver as it allows the measurement of zzso material zzso
