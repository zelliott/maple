Internal zzso coils have important applications in diagnostic and zzso zzso Since they can be placed very close to the region of interest in the body, they are favored over external coils in applications where high-resolution images are zzso In this paper it is demonstrated that ultimate intrinsic zzso zzso and the optimum zzso sensitivity solutions can be used to make new zzso designs with higher intrinsic zzso 

In this study, zzso which is the maximum zzso value of the intrinsic zzso is used as a measure of performance and as a design zzso As an example, a novel zzso zzso zzso is zzso The design is tested with phantom and patient zzso 

An zzso zzso is built to demonstrate the effectiveness of the design zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso to zzso 

An internal zzso design method that takes advantage of the zzso and optimum zzso sensitivity calculations was zzso This method can also be used to design better internal zzso coils for different zzso
