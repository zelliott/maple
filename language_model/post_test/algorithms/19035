We have investigated, using both zzso zzso and density functional theory methods, the minimum energy structures and corresponding binding energies of the van der zzso complexes between zzso and zzso or the nitrogen zzso and the corresponding complexes involving the zzso zzso zzso were obtained at the zzso level using a large basis, and the corresponding energies were corrected for basis set zzso error zzso higher order electron correlation effects, and for basis set zzso The structures of the global zzso were further refined for the effects of zzso and the corresponding binding energies were zzso For each neutral species, we find only a single true zzso zzso bonded for zzso and OH bonded for zzso For both zzso species, we find that the zzso complex is preferred over other zzso which we have identified as having zzso or zzso between zzso zzso The zzso zzso calculations are generally in excellent agreement with experimental binding energies and zzso zzso We find that the zzso functional is particularly poor at describing these complexes, while a density functional theory zzso method with an empirical correction for zzso interactions zzso is very successful, as are some of the new zzso proposed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 7, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso Both the zzso zzso and zzso methods accurately predict the zzso zzso zzso
