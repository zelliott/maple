Typically, commercial sensor zzso are equipped with zzso at a zzso zzso within the 4-12 zzso zzso zzso executing zzso zzso in those zzso generally requires a huge amount of zzso In this respect, the required energy consumption can be higher than using a separate accelerator based on a zzso Gate zzso zzso that is switched on when zzso In this zzso we present the design of a zzso accelerator suitable for an zzso sensor zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso All the embedded resources of the target platform zzso zzso have been zzso in order to provide a cost-effective zzso Moreover, we have added key negotiation capabilities to the zzso zzso security suite based on zzso zzso Cryptography zzso Our results suggest that tailored zzso based on zzso can behave better in terms of energy than contemporary software solutions for zzso such as the zzso and zzso zzso In this regard, a point zzso zzso can be performed between zzso and zzso faster, zzso to zzso faster zzso zzso zzso zzso and between zzso and zzso faster zzso zzso Integrated zzso Scheme, zzso Moreover, the energy consumption was also improved with a factor of zzso zzso
