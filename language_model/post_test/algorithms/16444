Although current technique of zzso zzso is a popular zzso method of zzso zzso analysis in assessing zzso zzso data obtained are frequently affected by various environmental and zzso zzso We proposed an easily zzso air pressure sensing system zzso for zzso zzso signal zzso zzso 108 subjects zzso the aged with or without zzso were recruited from July 2009 to May zzso zzso zzso signals from the wrist were obtained and analyzed using zzso transformation zzso Through ensemble empirical mode decomposition zzso the signals were zzso into eight intrinsic mode functions zzso of which zzso was found to be the desired signal with a discernible zzso zzso The results showed significant differences in reflection index zzso and zzso index zzso from the young subjects and those from the aged participants with or without zzso zzso differences in zzso and zzso were also noted between subjects with zzso diabetes and those zzso Good zzso and correlation were zzso In conclusion, the present study proposed the application of zzso zzso signal capturing zzso and zzso in acquiring more reliable data on zzso and zzso compared with the conventional zzso zzso
