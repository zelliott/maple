zzso analysis of zzso sleep zzso frequency is zzso The frequency content of true sleep zzso is not zzso zzso simulated zzso activity was studied in the present zzso Five types of simulated test signals were zzso all containing a dominant zzso represented by a zzso sine wave as such or with a zzso and waning pattern accompanied by a secondary zzso activity in three test zzso zzso zzso was included in four test signals, modeled either as small additional zzso across the zzso frequency range or as filtered zzso noise zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate how accurately the dominant zzso frequency of 13 zzso could be resolved with different methods in the presence of the interfering zzso A matching pursuit zzso based approach, discrete zzso transform zzso with zzso zzso with and without zero zzso zzso total least squares zzso and zzso methods were compared in the zzso zzso method provided best overall performance, followed closely by zzso with zero zzso Comparative studies like this are important to decide the method of choice in clinical sleep zzso zzso
