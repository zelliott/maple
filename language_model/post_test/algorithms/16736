In chemistry and zzso biology, structural graph zzso have been proven essential for characterizing the structure of chemical and biological zzso It has also been demonstrated that they are useful to derive empirical models for zzso drug zzso However, from a more general zzso zzso point of view, investigating mathematical properties of structural zzso such as their uniqueness and structural zzso is also important for an in-depth understanding of the underlying zzso In this paper, we emphasize the evaluation of the uniqueness of distance, degree and zzso zzso Among these are measures that have been recently investigated zzso We report zzso results using chemical and zzso generated zzso and also investigate correlations between the zzso
