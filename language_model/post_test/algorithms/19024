Previous studies have suggested that zzso effects in masking may be consistent with a decrease in cochlear zzso One paradigm used to show this is to measure the level of a zzso zzso required to just mask a zzso tone that occurs near zzso zzso The zzso effect is revealed when the signal is detected at a lower zzso ratio following preceding stimulation zzso an extension of the zzso or a separate zzso The present study examined whether this effect depends on precursor zzso The signal was a zzso zzso zzso The zzso was 200 zzso A zzso precursor had the same frequency characteristics as the zzso and was 205 zzso The zzso and precursor had either no notch or a wide notch about the signal zzso For a given precursor level, the growth of zzso level with signal level was zzso These data were used to estimate zzso zzso The results are consistent with a graded decrease in gain at the signal frequency when there is no notch in the zzso and zzso and a graded decrease in suppression when there is a large zzso These results could be consistent with the action of the zzso zzso zzso
