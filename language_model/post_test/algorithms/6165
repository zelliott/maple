For what we believe to be the first time, digital holographic zzso is applied to perform optical zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso phase images with zzso zzso accuracy are zzso reconstructed from zzso acquired for different zzso of the rotating zzso then the three-dimensional zzso index spatial distribution is zzso by inverse zzso zzso A precision of zzso for the zzso index zzso and a spatial resolution in the zzso range are zzso
