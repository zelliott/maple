A zzso effect of physical doses was studied in scanning zzso with carbon zzso For the target volumes of 60 zzso 60 zzso 80, 40 zzso 40 zzso 80, and 20 zzso 20 zzso 80 zzso the doses along the beam axis within the zzso Bragg zzso reduced to zzso zzso and zzso of the dose for the target of 80 zzso 80 zzso 80 zzso zzso The present study revealed that the observed reductions can be compensated for by adopting the zzso form of lateral dose zzso for the pencil beam model used in the treatment planning zzso The parameters describing the form were determined through the zzso experiments making flat concentric squared frames with a scanned carbon zzso Since utilizing the zzso model in the dose zzso loop is at present time zzso the correction for the zzso effect should be implemented as a zzso zzso zzso The zzso of this correction method was confirmed through the zzso of a target of 20 zzso 20 zzso 80 zzso
