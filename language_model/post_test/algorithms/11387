A novel and simple approach to optical wavelength measurement is presented in this zzso The working principle is demonstrated using a zzso zzso zzso ring zzso and single zzso The initial zzso is done with a set of known zzso and zzso zzso The combined spectral sensitivity function of the zzso and zzso at each tuning zzso was modeled by a neural zzso For determining the unknown zzso the zzso was tuned with a set of heating zzso and the corresponding zzso signals were zzso The unknown wavelength was estimated, based on the collected zzso signals, the zzso neural networks, and an zzso zzso The wavelength estimate method provides a high spectral precision of about 8 pm (5 zzso zzso at zzso zzso in the wavelength range between zzso zzso to zzso zzso A higher precision of 5 pm (3 zzso zzso is achieved in the range between zzso zzso to zzso zzso which is a factor of five improved compared to a simple zzso of zzso The importance of our approach is that it strongly zzso the optical system and enables optical zzso The approach is also of general importance, because it may be zzso to all wavelength monitoring devices which show an adjustable wavelength zzso
