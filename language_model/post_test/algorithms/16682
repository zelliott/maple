Acute zzso zzso shock with early zzso organ failure has a poor outcome without mechanical circulatory zzso We review our experience with emergent peripheral zzso support as a bridge to decision in these zzso 

A retrospective review from January 2009 through December 2010 was conducted of 26 consecutive adult patients at a single institution with acute zzso zzso shock who underwent salvage peripheral zzso zzso 

There were 18 men and 8 women with a mean age of 54 years zzso 18 to zzso zzso for zzso acute zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chronic heart failure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso arrest zzso zzso zzso acute zzso pathology zzso zzso zzso and unknown zzso zzso zzso Patients with primary zzso shock were zzso Median duration of support was 3 days zzso 1 to zzso zzso zzso withdraw of support zzso zzso zzso recovery zzso zzso zzso and bridge to a procedure zzso zzso zzso The procedures were zzso coronary intervention zzso zzso zzso left zzso assist device zzso zzso zzso heart transplantation zzso zzso 1), and zzso cardiac surgery zzso zzso zzso zzso survival to discharge was zzso In the recovery and bridge to a procedure group, zzso were discharged from the hospital and survival at three months was zzso 

zzso peripheral zzso support is a useful tool to rapidly stabilize acute zzso zzso shock permitting an assessment of zzso and zzso zzso
