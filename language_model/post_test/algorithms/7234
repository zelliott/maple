The selection of optimal camera zzso zzso locations, zzso zzso for zzso networks remains an zzso zzso Previous approaches largely focus on proposing various objective functions to achieve different zzso Most of them, however, do not zzso well to large scale zzso To tackle this, we propose a statistical framework of the problem as well as propose a zzso simulated zzso zzso to effectively deal with zzso We compare our approach with a state-of-the-art method based on zzso zzso programming zzso and show that our approach offers similar performance on small scale zzso However, we also demonstrate the capability of our approach in dealing with large scale problems and show that our approach produces better results than two alternative zzso designed to deal with the zzso issue of zzso zzso we show the versatility of our approach using a number of specific zzso
