zzso zzso with zzso surface areas were chemically activated with zzso at zzso degrees C from zzso that had been zzso from cane zzso at 450 degrees zzso The pore properties including the BET surface area, pore volume, pore size distribution, and mean pore diameter of these activated zzso were characterized and derived using the zzso method based on zzso zzso zzso The activated cane zzso zzso with zzso ratios of 2-6, exhibited BET surface areas ranging from zzso to zzso zzso zzso The scanning electron microscopic zzso observations revealed that the surface zzso of zzso holes on all activated cane zzso zzso was significantly influenced by the zzso zzso The zzso zzso and equilibrium zzso of acid blue 74, zzso blue, basic brown 1, zzso zzso zzso and zzso from water at 30 degrees C on the activated zzso were zzso The zzso zzso were suitably described by a simplified kinetic model, the zzso zzso All zzso equilibrium zzso were in agreement with the zzso zzso and were used to compare the covered area zzso of the activated zzso at different zzso zzso The zzso activated zzso were proven to be promising zzso for pollution control and for other zzso
