We investigate the problem of designing efficient multiplex zzso for medical zzso We show that the problem is zzso by transformation to the Multiple Choice zzso problem and give an efficient approximation zzso We developed this zzso in a computer program that predicts which zzso regions may be simultaneously amplified by zzso zzso use of the software shows that the method can treat 250 zzso zzso with less than 5 simultaneous zzso
