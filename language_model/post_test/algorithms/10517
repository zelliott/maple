zzso zzso was identified as an orally available, zzso zzso inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 zzso The objectives of the present study were: 1) to characterize the zzso relationship of the plasma zzso of zzso to the zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso as a zzso and 2) to characterize the relationship of zzso degradation to tumor growth zzso as a pharmacological response zzso zzso zzso mice implanted with zzso human breast cancer cells were treated with zzso once daily at doses selected to zzso zzso zzso Plasma zzso of zzso were adequately described by a zzso zzso zzso A time delay zzso was observed between the plasma zzso of zzso and zzso degradation; therefore, a link model was used to account for the zzso The model reasonably fit the time courses of zzso degradation with the estimated zzso of 18 zzso For tumor growth zzso the signal zzso model reasonably fit the zzso of individual tumor growth zzso with the estimated zzso of zzso zzso Thus, the zzso for zzso degradation approximately corresponded to the zzso to zzso for tumor growth zzso suggesting that 50% zzso degradation was required for significant zzso efficacy zzso The consistent relationship between zzso degradation and zzso efficacy was also demonstrated by applying an integrated signal zzso model for linking zzso degradation to tumor growth zzso The present results will be helpful in determining the appropriate dosing regimen and guiding dose escalation to achieve zzso systemic exposure in the zzso
