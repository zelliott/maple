An investigation of the neural network convergence and prediction based on three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and delta rule, is zzso Several simulated neural networks built using the above three zzso indicated that the zzso zzso implemented as a zzso neural network zzso faster than the other two zzso and provides in most of the cases better zzso These conclusions are based on eight zzso data sets, each with a significant number of compounds comparable to that usually used in the zzso zzso The superiority of the zzso zzso is revealed in terms of functional dependence of the change of the neural network weights with respect to the zzso of the error propagation as well as distribution of the weight zzso The prediction of the models is assessed by the error of the validation sets not used in the training zzso
