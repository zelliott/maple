In this study, zzso with zzso structure zzso and zzso were zzso via a zzso method, and their zzso and zzso characteristics were zzso Both of them exhibited some zzso activity and possessed a high zzso capacity for copper zzso Further, the zzso model was found to be more suitable to fit the experimental zzso Moreover, it suggested that the zzso model was more adequate in simulating the zzso zzso The maximum zzso capacity was zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso The negative apparent free energy confirmed that the zzso zzso onto the zzso was a spontaneous zzso The underlying mechanism of zzso of zzso onto zzso could be due to the zzso exchange and surface zzso From the results, zzso and zzso zzso may be an effective material for zzso removal and, together with its zzso activity, may be suitable for environmental zzso zzso
