A major consideration before analyzing heart period data or zzso intervals is the removal of zzso Automatic artifact rejection becomes critical when analyzing huge data sets where manual inspection is zzso This study developed an efficient, automatic zzso which uses both a zzso criteria and the median of 25 surrounding zzso to set the boundary for a normal zzso zzso The newly developed zzso is compared with 5 previously developed artifact detection zzso Thirty minutes of simultaneous zzso and zzso zzso data from 10 infants of the Collaborative Home zzso Monitoring zzso zzso study group are used to test the zzso Both real artifacts in the infant zzso zzso and fake artifacts are used to assess the performance of the zzso zzso zzso and accuracy are used to zzso the zzso The newly developed zzso performs better than other zzso for detecting real artifacts in infant zzso zzso data, providing the best balance between sensitivity and specificity zzso and zzso respectively), greatly improving specificity with only a slight loss in zzso It works extremely well for detecting missing and extra beats zzso and zzso sensitivity, zzso even on very noisy zzso In terms of detecting fake missing beats and extra beats, high sensitivity is achieved in most situations, and there is not much difference in specificity among the zzso
