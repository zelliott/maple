zzso zzso identification of unknown materials involves often the comparison of the spectrum of the unknown spectrum with previously recorded reference zzso or data from zzso However, when zzso with many zzso bands or zzso of zzso are involved, searching can be quite zzso Different zzso approaches have been proposed, but these have some zzso zzso in this paper a novel approach is proposed, which is based on a zzso comparison of zzso band zzso Different similarity measures can be used and are evaluated with zzso of test samples that were recorded on different zzso using different laser zzso Moreover, this study evaluates the performances of this zzso for identifying different compounds in zzso by using an zzso zzso
