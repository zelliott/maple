This study describes the three-dimensional zzso characteristics of total body zzso by our dedicated zzso unit, which consists of two modified zzso linear zzso mounted opposite each other, providing a field size of 220 zzso zzso 80 zzso at the zzso Our dose calculation zzso considers the three-dimensional zzso of the patient to evaluate the primary and scatter zzso The data base for the calculation includes zzso ratios measured for the large zzso The lung dose correction was calculated using the methods of zzso or ratio of zzso The accuracy of the calculated dose zzso was verified by zzso with zzso chambers in a zzso zzso We also describe and verified a technique to achieve desirable zzso lung doses using lead zzso The flexibility and the accuracy of the planning system offers the potential in zzso the therapeutic ratio for total body zzso
