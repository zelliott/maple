zzso in molecular zzso has direct impact on the evaluation and management of patients and family members with familial zzso zzso 

zzso zzso in contrast to sporadic cases, are commonly zzso zzso and present at an earlier zzso zzso tumors are inherited in an zzso dominant pattern with zzso zzso of the paternal zzso zzso studies have identified regions on zzso zzso as harboring the genetic zzso responsible for zzso zzso 

A zzso family with five affected females with head and neck zzso underwent clinical and genetic zzso zzso mapping was performed with zzso markers zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso individuals were screened for carrying the affected zzso In addition, by using DNA obtained from an zzso fluid zzso in zzso screening of a fetus was zzso 

The most common complaints were hearing loss and neck masses that usually zzso by age zzso zzso mapping identified zzso zzso and zzso as sites likely responsible for zzso Three unaffected family members, including a zzso were identified as carriers of the affected zzso The genetic findings were used to design a screening protocol for family members at risk for developing zzso zzso 

zzso screening of unaffected family members can identify individuals harboring the zzso zzso Identification of family members at risk for developing zzso by molecular genetic techniques may lead to early detection of head and neck zzso and may directly impact morbidity from zzso tumors and their zzso
