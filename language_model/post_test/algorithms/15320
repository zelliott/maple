zzso a software tool for predicting tree stem heating and injury in forest fires, is a zzso two-dimensional model of stem thermodynamics that results from heating at the bark zzso It builds on an earlier one-dimensional model zzso and provides improved capabilities for predicting zzso mortality and injury before a fire occurs by resolving stem moisture loss, temperatures through the zzso degree of bark zzso and zzso depth around the zzso We present the results of zzso zzso and model evaluation experiments for zzso that simulate laboratory zzso experiments of 52 tree sections from 25 zzso We also conducted a set of virtual sensitivity analysis experiments to test the effects of zzso of heating around the stem and with zzso height using data from two zzso a zzso surface fire and a more intense crown zzso The model allows for improved understanding and prediction of the effects of zzso fire on injury and mortality of trees of different species and zzso
