Using a surface zzso we have obtained zzso zzso zzso from zzso in the human zzso zzso was achieved by combining depth zzso with zzso in zzso zzso magnetic field zzso zzso zzso zzso in which total zzso zzso zzso has a zzso ratio of zzso were obtained in 4 zzso from 14 zzso of zzso A resonance at zzso zzso consisting predominantly of zzso was measured relative to the zzso peak in gray and white matter, and the ratio was lower in the white zzso The zzso relaxation times of zzso and zzso were measured in white and gray matter and while zzso relaxation times were the same in both, the zzso relaxation time was longer in white zzso zzso was detected in the zzso brain and the average of three zzso was approximately equal to zzso zzso from comparison with the zzso plus zzso peak, which was assumed to be zzso zzso
