In this paper, we describe using zzso a new method of presenting complex genetic data, to revisit results of a study from the zzso Vanderbilt DNA zzso zzso is a zzso of DNA samples coupled with zzso electronic medical records zzso In the Ritchie et zzso study zzso zzso samples were zzso for 21 zzso that were previously associated with 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso multiple zzso zzso arthritis, and type 2 zzso In the zzso study, the 21 tests of association zzso previous findings where sample size provided adequate zzso The majority of the zzso results were originally presented in tabular zzso zzso we have revisited the results of this study using zzso The zzso software tool visually zzso the results of complex, zzso studies that aim to characterize associations between small numbers of zzso zzso zzso and diseases and/or zzso such as the results of replication and zzso zzso Using zzso with the data of the Ritchie et zzso study and presenting these data in this integrated visual format demonstrates new ways to investigate and interpret these kinds of zzso zzso is freely available for zzso research institutions, for full details see zzso
