zzso zzso is a common problem with type 1 zzso In the home setting, we conducted a pilot study to evaluate the safety of a system consisting of an insulin pump and continuous zzso monitor zzso zzso with a bedside computer running an zzso that temporarily zzso insulin delivery when zzso is zzso 

After the zzso phase, a zzso zzso trial was conducted in which each night was randomly assigned zzso to have either the zzso zzso suspend zzso system active zzso night) or inactive zzso zzso Three zzso zzso versions were studied zzso during the study for a total of 252 intervention and 123 control zzso The trial included 19 participants zzso years old with type 1 diabetes zzso zzso level of zzso who were current users of the zzso zzso zzso zzso System and zzso zzso sensor zzso zzso zzso zzso 

With the final algorithm, pump suspension occurred on zzso of 77 intervention zzso Mean morning zzso level was zzso on the 77 intervention nights versus zzso on the 37 control nights, with morning blood zzso zzso zzso following one intervention zzso Overnight zzso was lower on intervention than control nights, with at least one value zzso occurring on zzso versus zzso of nights, respectively, with the final zzso 

This study demonstrated that the zzso system in the home setting is safe and zzso The preliminary efficacy data appear promising with the final zzso reducing nocturnal zzso by almost zzso
