Local zzso reconstruction of pedal defects can be accomplished with a variety of zzso Multiple geometric zzso have been described for closure of foot zzso Each has its own unique principles which can be adapted to certain locations and zzso zzso Local zzso considered for closure of foot defects should lie within the higher level of any algorithm, due to their versatility, zzso and long term functional zzso In addition, zzso length of zzso and zzso care can be much less with the use of local zzso
