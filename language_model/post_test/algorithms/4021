zzso and zzso zzso measure the weak electromagnetic signals originating from neural currents in the zzso Using these signals to characterize and locate brain activity is a challenging task, as evidenced by several decades of zzso zzso zzso whose name stems from its capability to zzso zzso zzso current estimates from zzso data, is a software package that provides comprehensive analysis tools and zzso including zzso source zzso zzso analysis, statistical analysis, and several methods to estimate functional connectivity between distributed brain zzso The present paper gives detailed information about the zzso package and describes typical use cases while also warning about potential zzso in zzso The zzso package is a collaborative effort of multiple zzso striving to implement and share best methods and to facilitate distribution of analysis pipelines to advance zzso of zzso Full documentation is available at zzso
