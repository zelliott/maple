zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso was used to study the effects of 17 zzso on the content of zzso and on the flux zzso by zzso zzso in immature rat zzso zzso with zzso medium at 36 C maintained the zzso in a viable state for at least 10 h in zzso during zzso zzso zzso In zzso administration of 17 zzso to the zzso zzso induced changes in the concentration of the high energy zzso similar to those found after in zzso zzso a rapid fall in the zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso during the first 2 zzso followed by a slower return to initial zzso by approximately 6 zzso Analysis of the time course of this zzso indicated that after zzso zzso the energy zzso rate was about twice the production zzso The flux through the zzso zzso zzso reaction was measured independently using zzso zzso transfer zzso it was found to increase in zzso 24 h after zzso injection by the same extent zzso as the specific activity of zzso measured by a zzso zzso The zzso between the results of these two techniques (in the absence of increased zzso zzso provides evidence that the early stimulation of zzso zzso synthesis by zzso results in a net increase in the concentration of this zzso
