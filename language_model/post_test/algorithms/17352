In modern zzso zzso zzso one is frequently called upon to evaluate the integral at various points throughout the zzso material of a dose or particle transport quantity multiplied by a weighting zzso For example, for a given zzso point one might be zzso the product of the dose deposited by a zzso beam and the energy distribution of the actual zzso and want to do this throughout the treatment zzso We have developed explicit formulas for replacing such zzso with a weighted sum of two or three functions zzso for example, the point of dose zzso in order to greatly reduce the calculation time for the zzso being zzso We demonstrate the accuracy of this method of representing dose and particle transport zzso through comparisons with zzso Carlo calculations of dose zzso for two typical problems, in dealing with the energy spectrum of the zzso beam and with the energy deposited by all the Compton electrons emerging from a particular interaction point, zzso
