The ability of a zzso network to zzso faces by sex by means of a zzso representation has not been fully zzso zzso with zzso codes have provided zzso results that are less impressive than those reported for zzso zzso In no case, however, have the reported zzso simulations been zzso for the task of zzso faces by zzso A series of simulations is described in which four network models were applied to the same zzso face zzso These simulations involved either a zzso basis function network or a zzso as a zzso preceded or not by a zzso step of zzso It is shown that performance comparable to that of the zzso models can be achieved with zzso input zzso when the data are zzso The effect of the zzso zzso of the faces is then compared with zzso analysis of face images and analyzed in terms of the zzso information it zzso It is shown that such an examination may offer insight into the facial aspects important to the zzso zzso Finally, the contribution of hair information to the performance of the model is zzso It is shown that, although the hair contributes to the zzso process, it is not the only important zzso
