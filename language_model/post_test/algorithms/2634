zzso zzso zzso is now available in modified zzso forms zzso In this paper, the effect of zzso grade and zzso concentration on in zzso release zzso of a zzso applied drug were studied using gel zzso of a zzso zzso drug zzso zzso zzso zzso with different zzso grades of the zzso zzso 60 M, 90 M for zzso zzso and 50 zzso for conventional zzso zzso in different zzso It was found that zzso zzso gels having a higher zzso and lower zzso concentration release a notably higher amount of drug compared with zzso zzso gels containing a higher concentration of zzso but with lower zzso For gels, the suitability of different common empirical zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso models, and some new statistical zzso zzso zzso zzso and generalized extreme value zzso models to describe the drug release profile were tested through zzso zzso curve zzso A general purpose mathematical analysis tool zzso was zzso Further, instead of the widely used transformed linear fit method, direct fitting was used in the paper to avoid any form of zzso and transformation zzso The results revealed that the zzso distribution, amongst all the models investigated, was the best fit for zzso zzso For zzso ones, the zzso models and zzso distribution worked best, although zzso also showed a close zzso The shape zzso for the zzso and zzso distribution conveys vital information about the rate of release and helps improve understanding of drug release zzso
