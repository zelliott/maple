The identification of proteins based on analysis of tandem mass zzso zzso data is a valuable tool that is not fully realized because of the difficulty in carrying out automated analysis of large numbers of zzso zzso zzso consist of zzso that represent each zzso fragment, usually b and y zzso with zzso determined mass to charge zzso Whether the strategy employed is database matching or De zzso sequencing, a major obstacle is distinguishing signal from zzso zzso ability to distinguish signal zzso of low intensity from background noise increases the likelihood of correctly identifying the zzso as valuable information is preserved while extraneous information is not left to zzso 

This paper introduces an automated noise filtering method based on the construction of zzso zzso By zzso the spectrum into a variable number (3 to zzso of zzso zzso that are considered zzso are identified at a local zzso Using a De zzso sequencing zzso that we are developing, this filtering method was applied to a published zzso of more than zzso mass zzso and an original zzso of more than 300 zzso The samples were peptides from zzso known zzso therefore, the solutions could be compared to the correct sequences and the zzso corresponding to zzso y and other fragments of significance could be zzso The same procedure was applied using two other published filtering zzso The ratios of the number of significant zzso that were preserved relative to the total number of zzso in each spectrum were zzso In the event that filtering out too many or too few signal zzso can lead to inaccuracy in sequence determination, the percentage of zzso acid zzso in the correct positions relative to the total number of zzso acid zzso in the correct sequence was also calculated for each sequence zzso 

The results show that an zzso zzso method of distinguishing signal zzso from background in mass zzso preserves a greater portion of signal zzso than compared methods, improving accuracy in sequence zzso
