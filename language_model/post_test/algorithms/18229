The dynamic clamp is a technique which allows the introduction of artificial zzso into living zzso Up to now, this technique has been mainly used to add small numbers of zzso zzso channels to real cells or to construct small hybrid zzso zzso In this paper we describe a zzso computer system, zzso that extends the dynamic clamp technique to include zzso the attachment of artificial zzso structures consisting of multiple compartments and zzso the construction of large hybrid networks zzso several hundred zzso realistic zzso zzso zzso is a fully interactive system that runs on Windows zzso is written in a combination of zzso and zzso and uses the Microsoft zzso application programming interface zzso to achieve zzso zzso By using the sampling zzso representation of membrane potential at all stages of zzso and by employing simple zzso tables, zzso can simulate over 1000 independent zzso and zzso type zzso in real-time on a modern personal computer zzso In addition, whilst not being a hard real-time system, zzso still offers reliable performance and tolerable jitter levels up to an update rate of zzso A key feature of zzso is that rather than being a simple dedicated dynamic zzso it operates as a fast simulation system within which zzso can be specified as either real or zzso We demonstrate the power of zzso with several example experiments and argue that it provides an effective tool for examining various aspects of zzso zzso
