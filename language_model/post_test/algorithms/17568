zzso of zzso may help clinicians predict their patients' therapeutic dose of zzso thereby decreasing the risk of bleeding during zzso zzso Our goal was to use zzso to develop an zzso that uses zzso clinical, and demographic factors to estimate the zzso dose a zzso We collected a blood sample, demographic zzso laboratory values, smoking status, names of medications, and dietary history from zzso patients who were taking a maintenance dose of zzso Using zzso chain reaction, we zzso each participant for the presence of 8 zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Using multiple regression, we zzso the association between zzso dose and all zzso Advanced age, lower body surface area zzso and the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso single zzso zzso were strongly associated zzso zzso zzso with lower zzso zzso the maintenance dose decreased by zzso per decade of age, by zzso per standard zzso decrease in zzso by zzso per zzso zzso and by zzso per zzso zzso zzso doses were zzso lower in patients who took zzso zzso lower in patients who took zzso zzso lower in patients whose target zzso was zzso rather than zzso and zzso lower in white rather than African-American participants zzso zzso zzso for these zzso An zzso that included these factors and one of borderline significance zzso explained zzso of the zzso in the maintenance zzso zzso Use of this zzso model had potential to prevent patients from being zzso when initiating zzso we estimate that only 24 zzso patients would have been zzso zzso by zzso zzso with zzso dosing compared to 59 zzso patients who would have been zzso if they had been prescribed the empirical dose of 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the maintenance zzso dose can be estimated from zzso clinical, and zzso factors that can be obtained at the time of zzso zzso
