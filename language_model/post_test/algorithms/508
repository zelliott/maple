Human genes undergo various patterns of zzso zzso across different zzso Such variation is primarily regulated by zzso factors that bind on zzso and zzso zzso zzso elements zzso Here we report a zzso method to mechanistically identify zzso zzso elements that contribute to the zzso alternative zzso zzso This method is an extension of our previous model, zzso which predicts the significant zzso that contribute to the zzso differences between two zzso In this study, we introduce zzso functional levels zzso step, which allows evaluating regulatory functions of predicted zzso that are involved in more than two zzso 

Using a publicly available zzso zzso Human zzso zzso zzso our method identifies zzso zzso zzso elements zzso across 11 human zzso About one third of predicted zzso can be mapped to the known zzso zzso binding zzso binding sites or match with other predicted zzso zzso regulator zzso Interestingly, the vast majority of predicted zzso are in zzso regulatory zzso A noticeable exception is that many zzso elements are found to regulate the alternative zzso between zzso and zzso Most identified elements are found to contribute to the alternative zzso between two zzso while some are important in multiple zzso This suggests that zzso alternative zzso patterns are regulated by a combination of zzso zzso elements and zzso zzso whose functional activities are important but differ across multiple zzso 

In this study, we present a zzso zzso approach to identify potential zzso zzso elements by considering the zzso zzso variation as the zzso effects of multiple zzso zzso This methodology provides a novel evaluation on the functional levels of zzso zzso elements by zzso their zzso functions on various zzso
