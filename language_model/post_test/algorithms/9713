zzso networks zzso represent one of the most successful tools for medical diagnosis, selection of the optimal treatment, and prediction of the treatment zzso In this paper, we present an zzso for zzso structure learning, which is a variation of the standard zzso zzso The proposed zzso overcomes the creation of redundant network structures that may include zzso connections between zzso In particular, the zzso finds what relationships between the variables must be zzso by exploiting the zzso of a square zzso containing the mutual information zzso among all pairs of zzso Two different zzso methods are zzso The first one is based on the maximum relevance minimum zzso selection zzso The second one uses a zzso The zzso zzso zzso is exploited as a zzso step for the subsequent greedy search procedure that zzso the network score, reducing the number of possible search paths in the greedy zzso Our zzso has been tested on two different medical zzso and compared against the standard zzso zzso as implemented in the zzso zzso
