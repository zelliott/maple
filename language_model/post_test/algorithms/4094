zzso and rapid characterization of influenza A virus zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences with respect to zzso and zzso is at the basis of extended diagnostic services and implicit to molecular zzso zzso zzso is a new tool and web service for the zzso of zzso sequences of the zzso and zzso gene into zzso and zzso zzso using zzso trained profile hidden zzso models zzso one for each zzso or zzso zzso merely requires as input zzso full-length or partial zzso or zzso DNA zzso It enables rapid and highly accurate assignment of zzso sequences to zzso zzso but particularly zzso on the finer zzso assignment of sequences of highly zzso avian influenza viruses of zzso H5N1 according to the zzso proposed by the H5N1 Evolution Working zzso zzso sequences are classified into zzso zzso zzso was compared to semiautomatic zzso approaches using zzso and zzso and additionally for zzso sequences to the new zzso zzso H5N1 zzso zzso zzso zzso proposed by the zzso Research zzso Our results show that both web tools zzso and zzso although based on different methods, are nearly equivalent in performance and both are more accurate and faster than semiautomatic zzso A retraining of zzso to altered zzso as well as an extension of zzso to other zzso zzso segments or fragments zzso is zzso This is exemplified by zzso assignment to a distinct cluster within zzso zzso of sequences of zzso viruses which emerged in China early in 2013 and caused more than 130 human zzso zzso is a free web zzso For local execution, the zzso source code in zzso is freely zzso
