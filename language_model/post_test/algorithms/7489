This paper presents and evaluates a deep learning architecture for automated zzso cell zzso cancer detection that zzso zzso image representation learning, zzso image zzso and zzso result zzso A novel characteristic of this approach is that it extends the deep learning architecture to also include an zzso layer that highlights the visual patterns that contribute to discriminate between zzso and normal zzso patterns, working akin to a digital zzso which spotlights image regions important for diagnostic zzso Experimental evaluation was performed on set of zzso images from 308 regions of interest of skin zzso zzso where the presence of absence of zzso cell zzso needs to be zzso Different image representation strategies, including bag of features zzso zzso zzso zzso transform zzso and zzso zzso transform zzso and proposed zzso zzso were evaluated for zzso Experimental results show that the representation learned from a large zzso image data set has the best overall performance zzso in zzso and zzso in balanced zzso which represents an improvement of around zzso over zzso representations and zzso over the best equivalent zzso zzso
