A fully automatic computerized method for zzso contours of zzso zzso cells is zzso As part of the method, zzso filtering zzso zzso zzso is used to achieve tasks different from noise zzso This type of filtering is applied making use of the zzso property of zzso zzso avoiding the erosion of zzso A zzso of zzso masking is used to considerably increase the visibility of dark areas of zzso It is shown how the overflow that occurs when two images are zzso can be handled to produce better results than normal zzso zzso The method is exemplified with a low quality zzso zzso To test the performance of the method, its output is used to automatically calculate the average cell size of images of different samples of tissue and different visual zzso The obtained results are successfully compared to those obtained with a manual zzso zzso A method for reading the segmented contours is suggested as well as two shape representations to achieve zzso analysis of individual zzso
