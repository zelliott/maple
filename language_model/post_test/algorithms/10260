The purpose of this study was to determine the zzso impact of density variations observed in zzso solid zzso zzso were performed using two 30 zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso one being 4 zzso think and the other 5 zzso zzso The location and extent of density variations were determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso Additional imaging zzso were made with an zzso silicon zzso portal imaging device and an ultrasound zzso zzso zzso were conducted with a zzso zzso chamber zzso and a scanned zzso in zzso Additional zzso and calculations were made of small zzso void zzso formed with zzso zzso using a zzso zzso chamber array and the zzso zzso zzso Two general types of density variation features were observed on CT zzso 1) regions of many zzso across, but typically only a few zzso thick, with electron zzso a few percent lower than the bulk material, and 2) zzso regions roughly zzso zzso in diameter and up to 20 zzso long with electron zzso up to zzso lower than the surrounding zzso The density variations were not visible on zzso zzso or ultrasound zzso The zzso impact of the density variations were not zzso to within zzso using the zzso zzso chamber array or the scanning zzso zzso at distances zzso zzso to 2 zzso beyond the zzso zzso zzso calculations using the zzso zzso with density corrections enabled on zzso zzso showed no zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on simulated voids place the upper limit on possible zzso variations from observed density variations at much less than zzso CT imaging of zzso zzso may reveal density variations which are otherwise zzso with zzso zzso or ultrasound zzso No zzso impact from these features was zzso with an zzso chamber array or scanned zzso zzso zzso they were determined to be acceptable for all clinical zzso
