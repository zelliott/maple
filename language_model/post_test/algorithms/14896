The zzso conditioning paradigm is a well-established model to study learning processes in humans and zzso Especially results from animal studies have supplied new insight into zzso pathways and brain structures involved in zzso motor learning and zzso An important role of the zzso and its zzso fiber systems could be zzso Recent studies in humans have given evidence that results of animal experiments can be applied directly to the human zzso A high variation of baseline zzso activity and/or spontaneous blinks may influence the analysis of classical conditioning of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso To zzso differentiation between real zzso responses and zzso zzso activity, we developed an zzso which is fully automated and independent of a possible bias of an zzso In a first step the zzso decides whether a subject fulfills the criteria of a successful learning process or zzso The second step zzso the learning zzso For zzso of the learning process, the following parameters were zzso number of zzso responses, onset of zzso time and amount of zzso zzso speed of conditioning and speed of zzso According to our criteria, zzso of the healthy volunteers acquired zzso zzso There is an age-related decline in zzso classical zzso Analysis of patient groups with different types of zzso will further improve our knowledge and understanding of pathways involved in learning processes in zzso The proposed new zzso of data analysis takes less than 10 s on a standard computer, is more sensitive and more specific in detecting zzso responses and, therefore, may further improve the value and reliability of the zzso conditioning paradigm in clinical zzso
