We have developed a zzso registration zzso for medical images and zzso The transformation between images is modeled as locally zzso but globally smooth, and explicitly accounts for local and global variations in image zzso An explicit model of missing data is also zzso allowing us to simultaneously segment and register images with partial or missing zzso The zzso is built upon a differential zzso framework and incorporates the expectation zzso zzso We show that this approach is highly effective in registering a range of synthetic and clinical medical zzso
