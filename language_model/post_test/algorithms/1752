Human heart rate zzso in the form of time series of intervals between heart beats, shows complex, zzso zzso Recently, it was demonstrated many times that the zzso properties vary from point to point along the series, leading to zzso In this paper, we concentrate not only on the fact that the human heart rate has zzso properties but also that these properties depend on the time scale in which the zzso is zzso This time scale is related to the frequency band of the zzso We find that human heart rate zzso appears to be far more complex than zzso reported in the studies using a fixed time zzso We introduce a method called zzso zzso analysis zzso which allows us to extend the description of heart rate zzso to include the dependence on the magnitude of the zzso and time scale (or frequency zzso zzso is relatively immune to additive noise and zzso including the zzso due to inclusions into the time series of events of a different dynamics zzso zzso events in zzso zzso The zzso method may provide new ways of measuring the zzso of a zzso and it may help to develop new methods of medical zzso
