zzso prediction in biological zzso zzso by an optical source is frequently required in some medical applications, like zzso zzso or tissue zzso In this work we propose a new zzso approach to solve the zzso zzso It is based on the two steps zzso modified zzso zzso algorithm, which allows a better zzso more accuracy and a faster zzso than previous zzso methods developed by other zzso The model also includes zzso spatial mesh and time step zzso These improved results for zzso temperature distribution could be used for choosing appropriate laser treatment parameters in medical zzso
