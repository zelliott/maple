Evidence for the existence of discrete zzso underlying continuous human movement has motivated many attempts to zzso zzso Although they produce visually convincing results, all of the zzso that have been employed are prone to produce zzso zzso In previous work, a zzso zzso for zzso zzso capable of global zzso zzso and zzso capable of avoiding zzso zzso was presented zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we present a zzso global zzso zzso zzso that requires approximately four orders of magnitude less time to zzso A sensitivity analysis reveals that the scattershot zzso can reliably detect changes in zzso parameters over time, zzso over the course of zzso zzso
