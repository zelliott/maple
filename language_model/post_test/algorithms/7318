zzso zzso zzso are usually displayed on electronic zzso However, the resolution of current output devices is not high enough to display zzso so the visual field is very zzso A method using a zzso transform optical system has been proposed, to enlarge the size of reconstructed zzso This paper describes a method of zzso calculations for the zzso transform optical system to enlarge the visual field and reconstruct realistic images by using the ray tracing zzso This method reconstructs images at arbitrary depths and also eliminates unnecessary light including zzso order zzso
