By combining a number of simple zzso zzso an arbitrarily complex sensing system may be produced to accommodate a wide range of zzso This work outlines a novel software architecture and knowledge representation scheme that has been developed to support this type of flexible and zzso modular sensing zzso zzso zzso are used to zzso intelligence within each zzso As zzso are added or removed, the composite sensor is able to automatically determine its overall geometry and assume an appropriate collective zzso A virtual zzso zzso layer runs on top of a real-time operating system with a pre-emptive zzso enabling zzso template zzso to be written once and run on any zzso irrespective of its underlying hardware zzso zzso that may benefit from easily zzso modular sensing systems include flexible inspection, mobile zzso zzso and space zzso
