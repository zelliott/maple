With the evolving technology in zzso integration, new classes of zzso detectors have recently become zzso In particular, single zzso avalanche zzso zzso zzso allow detection of single photons at high acquisition rates zzso 100 zzso which is about two orders of magnitude higher than with currently available zzso Here we demonstrate the use of a zzso array for imaging zzso correlation zzso zzso a tool to create zzso maps of the dynamics of fluorescent molecules inside living zzso zzso zzso zzso due to zzso entering and leaving the observed zzso are evaluated by means of zzso zzso The zzso correlation zzso is an appropriate choice, as it does not rely on the full data set to be held in zzso Thus, this zzso can be efficiently implemented in custom zzso We describe a new zzso for zzso parallel zzso correlation zzso Our current zzso can calculate zzso correlation functions at a resolution of 10 zzso in real-time and therefore correlate real-time image zzso from high speed single zzso cameras with thousands of zzso
