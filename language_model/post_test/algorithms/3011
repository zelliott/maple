Analysis of the immense complexity of the immune system is increasingly hampered by technical limitations of current zzso especially for zzso and functional analysis of samples containing small numbers of zzso We here present a method, which is based on the zzso functional manipulation and analysis of living immune cells that are zzso within zzso chips using automated zzso zzso overcoming current limitations for comprehensive zzso zzso with flow zzso revealed a zzso increased sensitivity and a comparable zzso By using small sample volumes and cell numbers zzso zzso down to 20,000 zzso we were able to analyze a virtually unlimited number of zzso and surface markers even on living immune zzso We exemplify the scientific and diagnostic potential of this method by zzso identification and zzso of rare cells, zzso comprehensive analysis of very limited sample volume, and zzso deep zzso of human zzso after in zzso zzso Finally, we propose an zzso model for zzso and comparison of zzso data by using an zzso zzso The zzso zzso introduced here turned out to be a very useful tool to enable a zzso exploration of zzso small zzso samples with an virtually unlimited number of zzso and zzso zzso
