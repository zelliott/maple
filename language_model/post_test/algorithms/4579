A comparison between two zzso zzso techniques, zzso simulated zzso zzso and the zzso genetic zzso zzso is conducted to investigate which is the more attractive option for tuning a finite element model to match experimental zzso The study zzso the zzso zzso and sensitivity of each zzso While both zzso produced zzso results within one standard zzso of the experimental mean, the zzso approach proved more effective than the zzso The zzso zzso demonstrated better zzso after 1000 trials, with an average zzso value change of zzso The zzso zzso also zzso a wider range of the solution space and produced results with significantly lower zzso error than the zzso zzso one zzso p zzso zzso
