This paper intends to an integrated view of the spectral analysis techniques in the detection of zzso zzso The paper includes illustrative information about feature extraction from signals recorded from zzso zzso zzso transform zzso and zzso transform zzso were used for spectral analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using these spectral analysis methods, the variations in the shape of the zzso zzso as a function of time were presented in the form of zzso in order to obtain medical zzso These zzso were then used to compare the applied methods in terms of their frequency resolution and the effects in determination of zzso zzso The author suggest that the content of the paper will assist to the people in gaining a better understanding of the zzso and zzso in the detection of zzso zzso
