In this paper, we propose a novel image indexing and retrieval zzso using local zzso patterns zzso for zzso image retrieval zzso The standard local zzso pattern zzso and local zzso pattern zzso zzso the relationship between the referenced zzso and its surrounding neighbors by computing zzso zzso The proposed method encodes the relationship between the referenced zzso and its neighbors, based on the directions that are calculated using the zzso derivatives in vertical and horizontal zzso In addition, we propose a generic strategy to zzso zzso zzso using zzso - zzso horizontal and vertical derivatives for efficient zzso and analyze the effectiveness of our proposed zzso by combining it with the zzso zzso The performance of the proposed method is compared with the zzso the local zzso patterns, and the zzso based on the results obtained using benchmark image databases zzso zzso 1000 database zzso zzso texture database zzso and zzso zzso database zzso Performance analysis shows that the proposed method improves the retrieval result from zzso to zzso in terms of average zzso recall on database zzso and from zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso in terms of average retrieval rate on databases zzso and zzso respectively, as compared with the standard zzso
