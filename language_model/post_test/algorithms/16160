We zzso in a prospective study, the efficacy of zzso spiral zzso zzso zzso in the evaluation of zzso zzso zzso shunt zzso zzso in patients treated with the zzso zzso Flagstaff, zzso zzso zzso zzso Eighty patients who underwent zzso procedure using the zzso zzso zzso zzso were evaluated at follow-up of 1, 3, 6, and zzso with clinical and laboratory tests as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso In case of zzso upper gastrointestinal zzso was also zzso In addition, the shunt was evaluated using zzso at 6 and zzso In all cases of abnormal findings and zzso between zzso and zzso invasive control zzso was zzso zzso images were acquired before and after injection of intravenous contrast media on the zzso plane and after three-dimensional reconstruction using different zzso zzso was successfully performed in all zzso No zzso correlated to the zzso zzso were zzso A missing correlation between UCSD and zzso was noticed in 20 of 80 zzso zzso zzso control zzso confirmed shunt zzso in 16 zzso cases and shunt malfunction in 4 zzso zzso According to these data, zzso sensitivity was zzso specificity was zzso and positive zzso and negative zzso values zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso sensitivity was zzso specificity was zzso and zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso A high correlation (K zzso between zzso and invasive control zzso was zzso On the basis of these results, zzso shows superior sensitivity and specificity compared with zzso in those patients in whom zzso was performed with the zzso zzso zzso can be considered a valid tool in the follow-up of these zzso
