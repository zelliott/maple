zzso zzso zzso zzso can provide in zzso quantitative and functional information for zzso however, PET image quality depends highly on a reconstruction zzso zzso zzso such as the maximum likelihood expectation zzso zzso algorithm, are rapidly becoming the standards for image reconstruction in zzso zzso The conventional zzso zzso zzso the zzso model in its system zzso which is no longer valid for zzso of randomly corrected zzso The aim of this study is to overcome this zzso The maximum likelihood zzso using the expectation maximum zzso zzso is adopted and modified to reconstruct zzso images using random correction from joint prompt and delay zzso this reconstruction method is called zzso The proposed joint zzso model preserves zzso properties without increasing the zzso zzso associated with random zzso The work here is an initial zzso without applied zzso zzso zzso and arc zzso The zzso of variation zzso and full zzso at zzso zzso values were zzso to compare the quality of reconstructed zzso images of physical zzso acquired by filtered zzso zzso ordered zzso maximum zzso and zzso zzso Experimental and simulated results demonstrate that the proposed zzso produces better image quality than the zzso and zzso zzso
