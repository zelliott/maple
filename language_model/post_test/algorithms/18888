In order to test the zzso of the cluster zzso approach as well as of the zzso model approach and to learn about the zzso zzso we carried out zzso molecular dynamics simulations of the zzso zzso Our calculations contained one zzso zzso dissolved in 60 water zzso zzso moments of individual molecules were derived by means of zzso localized zzso zzso We observed an average zzso moment of about zzso D for zzso and of about zzso D for zzso In particular, the average water zzso moment in proximity of zzso zzso group decayed zzso with increasing distance, while, surprisingly, close to the zzso and zzso group, the zzso moment first rose before its value zzso In a cluster zzso approach, we considered snapshots of zzso surrounded by different water zzso zzso The zzso moments from the cluster approaches utilizing both zzso localized zzso functions as well as natural population analysis served to approximate the zzso moments of the total zzso zzso convergence of the cluster zzso approach is found for either of the two zzso shells around the polar groups and one zzso shell around the zzso groups or two zzso shells around the polar groups surrounded by a zzso zzso
