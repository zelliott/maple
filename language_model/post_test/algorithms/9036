We present a theoretical and zzso model for collagen turnover in soft biological zzso Driven by zzso in the mechanical environment, collagen fiber zzso may undergo important chronic changes, characterized primarily by zzso in collagen synthesis and degradation zzso In particular, hypertension triggers an increase in zzso synthesis and a decrease in collagen degradation, which lead to the well-documented overall increase in collagen zzso These changes are the result of a cascade of events, initiated mainly by the zzso and smooth muscle zzso Here, we represent these events collectively in terms of two internal zzso the concentration of growth factor zzso and tissue zzso of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso increases the collagen zzso The zzso of zzso also increases the collagen density through decreasing zzso zzso zzso We establish a mathematical theory for zzso collagen turnover and introduce a zzso zzso for its robust and efficient zzso We demonstrate that our model can accurately predict the zzso observed collagen increase in response to hypertension reported in zzso Ultimately, the model can serve as a valuable tool to predict the chronic adaptation of collagen content to restore the zzso equilibrium state in vessels with arbitrary zzso and zzso
