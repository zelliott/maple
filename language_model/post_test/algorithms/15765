This paper presents a new approach to predict response during zzso zzso by using mutual information zzso time series of zzso zzso and their complexity zzso The zzso between four lead zzso was first zzso using the zzso time zzso The zzso complexity measures, zzso were extracted from the zzso time zzso zzso was made by means of artificial neural network zzso From 98 zzso patient experiments, 98 distinct zzso recordings were collected prior to incision during zzso zzso of different zzso During and after skin zzso each patient was observed carefully for 2 zzso to detect subsequent responses zzso movement, changes in zzso parameters and respiratory zzso and then the zzso was zzso as zzso for zzso or as zzso for zzso Training and testing the ANN used the zzso zzso The prediction was tested by monitoring the response to incision and the result given by the zzso The system was able to correctly zzso purposeful response in average accuracy of zzso of the zzso The results showed that the method has a better performance than other methods, such as spectral edge frequency, median frequency, and zzso zzso This method is zzso fast and acceptable real-time clinical performance was zzso
