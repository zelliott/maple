Identification of zzso zzso can provide valuable insights into protein zzso With the increasing number of protein zzso structures having been solved by X-ray zzso and zzso techniques, it is highly desirable to develop an efficient method to identify their zzso zzso In this paper, we present an zzso method for the identification of zzso zzso using sequence and structural zzso The zzso was applied to the zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso Site zzso zzso We obtained overall prediction accuracy of zzso from zzso cross validation and zzso from zzso zzso Testing on the 254 zzso zzso shows our method can correctly predict all 254 zzso This result suggests the usefulness of our approach for zzso the identification of zzso zzso from protein zzso
