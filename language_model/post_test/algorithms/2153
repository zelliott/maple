New methods for zzso template fitting and building zzso are zzso Full zzso searches are carried out for flexible zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso search zzso are derived from the method of zzso Carlo zzso with energy zzso in Cartesian zzso An additional fast search step is introduced between the initial zzso and energy zzso The fast search produces approximate low-energy structures, which are likely to minimize to a low zzso For template fitting, zzso uses a zzso force field which automatically assigns short-range attractive forces to similar atoms in different zzso The zzso zzso were evaluated using X-ray data for 12 zzso zzso The zzso had up to 24 zzso bonds and ranged from highly polar to mostly zzso zzso searches of the randomly zzso zzso gave zzso differences between the lowest energy zzso structure and the zzso X-ray structure, of less than zzso A for 10 of the zzso For all the zzso the zzso difference between the zzso X-ray structure and the closest zzso structure was less than zzso A, when parts of one of the molecules which are in the zzso were excluded from the zzso zzso zzso fitting was tested using four zzso zzso Three zzso templates have been previously zzso A single run using zzso generated a series of templates which contained examples of each of the zzso A zzso complementary to an zzso template, was built out of small zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso When individually energy minimized in the zzso each of the four zzso zzso moved with an zzso of less than zzso zzso After random zzso the zzso were zzso into the zzso Each lowest energy zzso structure matched the zzso geometry with an zzso of less than zzso zzso Thus, the zzso shows zzso and chemical zzso to all four zzso The zzso program is reliable, easy to use and sufficiently rapid for routine application in zzso drug zzso
