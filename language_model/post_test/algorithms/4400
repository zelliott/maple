Land reclamation in coastal areas may have a significant effect on local ground water zzso zzso zzso solutions based on zzso and zzso assumptions are derived to evaluate this zzso Two situations are considered, both with ground water flow resulting from zzso zzso the coastal zzso of an extensive zzso and an zzso The results show that after zzso the water table rises and the salt zzso water interface moves zzso The degree of these changes depends on the extent of reclamation and the zzso zzso of the fill zzso For the island situation, the reclamation zzso the ground water divide and changes the ground water conditions in the entire zzso An unintended advantage of the reclamation is an increase of fresh ground water resource because the reclaimed land can be an additional zzso and rain recharge takes place over a larger zzso
