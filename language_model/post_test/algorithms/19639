Since lead has recently been recognized as a source of environmental pollution, we have investigated new electron shielding materials that do not contain zzso We compared the shielding thicknesses of a hard plate and a sheet composed of the new materials with that of lead for electron zzso The shielding thickness was evaluated as the thickness required for shielding primary zzso The comparison revealed the shielding ability of the hard plate and sheet is approximately equivalent to zzso and zzso times that of lead, zzso The thickness (in zzso required for shielding by the zzso as well as the thickness of lead, is related to approximately half of the zzso energy (in zzso The shielding ability of the sheet is also equivalent to that of zzso zzso zzso these materials are environmentally friendly, and can be easily customized into arbitrary zzso Therefore they can be used as lead zzso for shielding against electron zzso
