zzso of the zzso zzso are difficult management issues because of the wide variation in their biological behavior and the potential for sacrifice of the facial nerve during zzso Because of the significant associated zzso prediction of facial nerve sacrifice is critically important for planning surgical procedures and zzso counseling of zzso We zzso that along with the knowledge of the tumor type we would be able to accurately predict the likelihood of facial nerve sacrifice using zzso zzso 

All patients included in this study were previously zzso patients with zzso zzso operated on between January 1997 and July zzso Only those patients with an available zzso imaging were included and this resulted in 44 patients for zzso Nine patients with zzso deficits in facial nerve function were excluded from this study since these patients would require facial nerve sacrifice regardless of the zzso zzso The prediction of facial nerve sacrifice was determined using a prediction of tumor location and an zzso The predicted results were compared to the operative zzso 

For all zzso zzso imaging predicted the need for sacrifice of the facial nerve with a sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso For zzso zzso only, prediction of sacrifice of the facial nerve had a sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso imaging and application of our zzso is a sensitive method for identifying patients with zzso zzso who require facial nerve zzso CT and zzso have a high negative zzso value for facial nerve zzso
