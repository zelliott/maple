This paper investigates two zzso methods for zzso zzso of zzso indicator concentration zzso The two methods, zzso least squares and discrete zzso zzso zzso are applied to simulated data to verify the reliability of the zzso Both zzso methods provide zzso that results in estimated transport functions that are smooth and reasonable estimates of the actual simulated transport zzso On zzso with the simulated input curve, the estimated transport functions provide good fits to the simulated output zzso In addition, methods for identifying an optimal solution and for zzso the zzso long zzso tails of the estimated transport functions are proposed, which appear to allow for reasonably accurate zzso of the mean transit times and zzso of the transport functions as zzso When either method was applied to indicator dilution data obtained from the pulmonary artery and left atrium, it was zzso stable while producing transport functions that when zzso with the input concentration zzso provided good fits to the output concentration zzso The combined simulation and experimental results suggest that the proposed methods should be useful for zzso circulation transport functions from indicator dilution zzso
