Single zzso carry out important sensory and motor functions related to the larger networks in which they are zzso zzso the relationships between zzso zzso and network activity is therefore of great importance and the latter can be readily estimated from zzso brain signals known as local field zzso zzso In this work we examine a number of issues related to the zzso of spike and zzso zzso We show that spike trains and individual spikes contain power at the zzso that are typically thought to be exclusively related to zzso such that simple zzso filtering cannot be effectively used to separate the two zzso zzso simulations indicate that the commonly used method of zzso the zzso signal by zzso filtering the raw zzso signal leads to zzso correlations between spikes and zzso and that these correlations exert a powerful influence on popular metrics of zzso zzso Similar zzso results were seen in data obtained from zzso recordings in zzso visual cortex, when zzso filtering was used to estimate zzso zzso In contrast zzso tuning zzso in response to sensory stimuli do not appear to be affected by spike contamination, either in simulations or in real zzso To address the issue of spike contamination, we devised a novel zzso spike removal zzso and confirmed its effectiveness in simulations and by applying it to the zzso zzso The algorithm, based on a rigorous mathematical zzso zzso other methods of spike removal on most metrics of zzso zzso Following application of this spike removal algorithm, many of our zzso recordings continued to exhibit zzso zzso confirming previous reports that such relationships are a genuine aspect of zzso zzso Overall, these results show that careful zzso is necessary to remove spikes from zzso signals, but that when effective spike removal is used, zzso correlations can potentially yield novel insights about brain zzso
