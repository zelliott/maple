The purpose of this paper is to present a novel technique for analyzing the behavior of an industrial system zzso by utilizing zzso imprecise, and uncertain zzso In the present study two important tools namely zzso methodology and particle swarm zzso are zzso used to present a novel technique named as particle swarm zzso based zzso zzso for analyzing the behavior of a complex zzso system zzso up to a desired degree of zzso Expressions of reliability zzso like failure rate, repair time, mean time between failures zzso expected number of failures zzso reliability and availability for the system are obtained by using zzso methodology and particle swarm zzso is used to construct their membership zzso The interaction among the working units of the system is modeled with the help of zzso zzso The feeding unit of a paper mill situated in a northern part of India, producing approximately zzso of paper per day, has been considered to demonstrate the proposed zzso zzso analysis of system's behavior has also been zzso The behavior analysis results zzso by zzso technique have a reduced region of prediction in comparison of existing technique region, zzso uncertainties involved in the analysis are zzso Thus, it may be a more useful analysis tool to assess the current system conditions and involved zzso
