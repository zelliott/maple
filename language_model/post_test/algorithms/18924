It is a common task in zzso studies to identify a subset of the genes satisfying certain conditions, such as zzso expressed genes or regulatory target genes of a zzso factor zzso This can be formulated as a statistical hypothesis testing zzso Most existing approaches treat the genes as having an identical and independent distribution a zzso testing each gene independently or testing some zzso of the genes one by zzso On the other hand, it is known that the genes work zzso as dictated by gene zzso Treating genes equally and independently ignores the important information contained in gene networks, leading to inefficient analysis and reduced zzso 

We propose incorporating gene network information into statistical analysis of zzso zzso Specifically, rather than treating the genes equally and independently a zzso in a standard mixture model, we assume that zzso prior probabilities are correlated as induced by a gene zzso while the genes are allowed to have different prior zzso those neighboring ones in the network have similar prior zzso reflecting their shared biological zzso We applied the two approaches to a real zzso zzso (and simulated zzso to identify the zzso target genes of zzso zzso The new method was found to be more powerful in discovering the target zzso
