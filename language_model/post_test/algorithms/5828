Muscle zzso leads to modification in its zzso zzso zzso Since the properties of zzso sodium channels zzso are different between zzso and zzso muscles, we studied the effects of zzso on the zzso properties and the zzso of rat zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was cut and fixed to the adjacent bone at neutral muscle zzso After 4 or 8 zzso of zzso the zzso and the zzso properties were studied and compared with muscles from control animals zzso zzso After 4 zzso of zzso zzso showed a faster zzso with a rightward shift of the zzso curve and a decrease in both the Burke's index of zzso and the zzso zzso These parameters showed opposite changes between 4 and 8 zzso of zzso The zzso sodium current in zzso immobilized fibers was higher compared with that of control fibers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso with partial recovery to the control values in zzso immobilized fibers zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In the presence of zzso the zzso residual sodium current decreased continuously throughout zzso Using the Western zzso analysis, zzso expression showed a transient increase in zzso muscle, whereas zzso expression decreased during zzso Our results indicate that a muscle immobilized at optimal functional length with the preservation of neural zzso exhibits a transient fast zzso zzso zzso expression and current are related to the zzso zzso zzso
