A CW zzso diffuse optical zzso has been developed to characterize the zzso optical properties of prostate zzso during zzso zzso The spatial zzso of light zzso rate can be described by the diffusion zzso zzso properties of the prostate are reconstructed by solving the inverse problem with an zzso zzso The zzso reconstructed zzso optical properties for a human prostate is illustrated and compared with the results generated by a well-established point-by-point zzso Moreover, the calculated zzso rate using the reconstructed optical properties matches the measured zzso
