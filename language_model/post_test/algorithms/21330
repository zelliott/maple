zzso gamma zzso striking zzso zzso in zzso cultures of human vascular zzso cells zzso including cell shape change from zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso from dense peripheral bands to zzso zzso of stress zzso Since many zzso zzso including class I major zzso complex zzso zzso interact with zzso zzso an zzso zzso arrangement of stress fibers might cause zzso lateral diffusion of zzso class I zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, we adapted the zzso zzso recovery technique to allow measurement of zzso diffusion of zzso labeled molecules on two-dimensional zzso A highly eccentric elliptical zzso laser beam was used to zzso the sample and to monitor zzso zzso In this technique, named zzso zzso zzso zzso lateral diffusion is measured along that axis of the sample that is perpendicular to the major axis of the elliptical zzso The lateral diffusion zzso and fractional mobility are obtained by fitting the experimental data to a theoretical recovery curve, the form of which is determined by the solution to a modified version of the diffusion equation in which a zzso is used to describe diffusion in two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to label class I zzso proteins on zzso zzso and human zzso zzso These two cultured human cell types were found to be similar in their zzso shape and zzso stress fiber zzso Class I zzso protein lateral mobility was compared to that of zzso zzso a membrane zzso zzso Class I zzso proteins diffused zzso on human zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso diffused zzso on this cell zzso In contrast, both class I zzso proteins and zzso zzso diffused zzso on zzso zzso These data suggest that neither zzso shape nor zzso stress fiber arrangement is sufficient to induce zzso diffusion of proteins on the zzso plasma zzso
