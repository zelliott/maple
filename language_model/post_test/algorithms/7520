zzso zzso detection in zzso zzso has been widely used because of its zzso to noises and statistical power to deal with zzso of individual zzso However, current zzso zzso zzso detection methods typically rely on the spatial alignment established by zzso of individual zzso zzso images into the same template space, which has difficulty in dealing with the remarkable zzso variation of different zzso As a consequence, the resulted zzso among multiple brains could substantially degrade the accuracy and specificity of zzso zzso zzso zzso To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel methodology to detect zzso zzso zzso based on a publicly released dense map of zzso structural cortical landmarks, which possess intrinsic zzso across individuals and zzso The basic idea here is that a zzso general linear model zzso analysis is performed on zzso signals of each corresponding cortical landmark in each individual zzso own space, and then the zzso effect size of the same landmark from a group of subjects are statistically integrated and assessed at the group level using the zzso zzso As a result, the consistently activated cortical landmarks are determined and declared zzso in response to external zzso zzso Our experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach can map meaningful zzso zzso patterns on the zzso of cortical landmarks without image registration between subjects and spatial zzso
