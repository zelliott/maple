This study aimed to zzso investigate two main zzso transfer effects at low zzso the nuclear zzso enhancement zzso and zzso zzso transfer in the human brain at 7 zzso 

The zzso transfer effects in the human brain were characterized using a zzso zzso model, which consisted of bulk water, zzso an zzso group of mobile proteins and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The pool sizes, exchange rates, and relaxation times of these zzso pools were investigated zzso by fitting, and the net signals of zzso zzso transfer and zzso were simulated based on the fitted zzso 

The results showed that the zzso model fitted the experimental data quite well, and the zzso effects in human brain at 7 T had a broad spectrum zzso The zzso effects peaked at a B1 of zzso zzso zzso and were significantly stronger in the white matter than in the gray matter, corresponding to a zzso ratio zzso zzso As the zzso zzso transfer effect was relatively small compared with the zzso effects, zzso transfer asymmetry analysis yielded an zzso contrast in the healthy human brain in this range of zzso 

These findings are important to identify the source of zzso effects and to zzso zzso zzso transfer effects in human brain at 7 zzso
