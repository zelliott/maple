zzso relationships between function, zzso acid zzso and protein structure represents a major zzso In this study, we propose a zzso approach that identifies functional zzso in the zzso database that correlate with intrinsic zzso A statistical evaluation is employed to rank the significance of these zzso zzso sequence data zzso and the relationship between protein length and protein structure were taken into consideration to ensure the quality of the statistical zzso Over 200,000 proteins from the zzso database were analyzed using this zzso The predictions of intrinsic disorder were carried out using zzso zzso predictor of long zzso regions that achieves an accuracy of above zzso Overall, out of the zzso zzso functional zzso that were each associated with at least 20 zzso zzso were found to be strongly positively correlated with predicted long zzso zzso regions, whereas zzso were strongly zzso correlated with such zzso The remaining 170 zzso were ambiguous without strong positive or negative correlation with the disorder zzso These functions cover a large variety of biological activities and imply that zzso regions are characterized by a wide functional zzso Our results agree well with literature findings, as we were able to find at least one illustrative example of functional disorder or order shown zzso for the vast majority of zzso showing the strongest positive or negative correlation with intrinsic zzso This work opens a series of three papers, which zzso the current view of protein zzso zzso especially with regards to zzso of zzso zzso zzso and provides researchers with a novel tool that could be used to improve the understanding of the relationships between protein structure and zzso The first paper of the series describes our statistical approach, outlines the major findings, and provides illustrative examples of biological processes and functions positively and zzso correlated with intrinsic zzso
