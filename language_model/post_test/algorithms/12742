Whether or not a patient could benefit from a zzso zzso zzso scan and/or the evaluation by a zzso requires judgment by a zzso of the risk of clinical zzso To assess this clinical process we aimed to determine how many of the consultations to the zzso department zzso of UC Davis are appropriately indicated for zzso input or zzso zzso we investigated how CT is used in the University of California Davis Medical Center zzso in zzso consults of head injured patients compared to a validated and highly sensitive decision making zzso the Canadian CT Head Rule zzso 

Patients were enrolled in this prospective study if they presented to a department of zzso other than neurosurgery and when, consequently, the zzso was zzso The emergency consultations were zzso into three groups: head injury, spine injury and zzso zzso the appropriateness of the consultations was evaluated based on the need for evaluation determined by the likelihood of clinically important zzso zzso for head injury and by the likelihood of clinically important spinal zzso injury or spinal zzso instability for spine zzso Of the head injured patients with a CT scan the appropriateness of the scan was determined by way of the zzso 

Between 21 July and 15 August 2008 99 consultations were zzso 32 patients with head injuries, 29 with spine injuries, 34 with other diseases and 4 not sufficiently documented zzso 23 classified inappropriate, 69 appropriate and 7 remained zzso Of the head injured patients, 10 zzso had gotten a CT scan that was classified zzso 

zzso receives zzso requests for consultations per day from the other services of zzso of which one is of questionable zzso and one of the three CT scans for head injury is not zzso These results suggest the use of the zzso in zzso would improve patient care and could result in large health-care savings, while there would also be less radiation zzso
