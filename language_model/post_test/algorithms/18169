zzso kidney failure is frequently seen in middle-aged and elderly zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso clearance and single blood sample zzso method are used in several species to estimate the zzso zzso rate zzso 

The hypothesis of this study was that zzso clearance could be determined using an SBS method in normal and zzso zzso 

zzso cats were included in this study, with an average age of zzso zzso Of these zzso 27 had zzso 19 were zzso 

After IV injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 7 blood samples were obtained between 5 and 240 zzso zzso clearance was calculated in zzso and zzso body weight, using a zzso zzso zzso time for clearance measurement with SBS was then determined by systematically comparing each individual plasma concentration to the reference zzso zzso 

The average reference plasma clearance of zzso for all cats was zzso zzso zzso zzso The clearance in zzso cats averaged zzso zzso zzso zzso and in normal cats averaged zzso zzso zzso zzso The optimal time for the SBS was 48 minutes after injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso giving the following converting zzso clearance zzso zzso zzso zzso minutes) - zzso (in zzso 

In this study, the single sample zzso clearance method was used to estimate the global zzso in zzso The method identified differences in clearance between normal and zzso zzso The optimal time for an SBS was 48 zzso
