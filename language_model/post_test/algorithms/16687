We discuss methods for fast zzso smoothing of calcium signals in zzso trees, given zzso zzso localized imaging data obtained via zzso zzso By analyzing the dynamics of calcium binding to probe molecules and the effects of the imaging zzso we show that calcium concentration can be estimated up to an zzso zzso zzso an additive and zzso zzso To obtain a full zzso estimate, we model calcium dynamics within the cell using a functional zzso The evolution of calcium concentration is represented through a smaller set of hidden variables that incorporate fast zzso due to zzso action zzso zzso or other forms of zzso Because of the resulting state space structure, zzso can be done in linear time using zzso zzso zzso zzso constraints on the calcium concentration can also be incorporated using a zzso method that does not affect the zzso zzso Moreover, by exploiting the zzso tree structure we show that the cost of the zzso is also linear in the size of the zzso tree, making the approach zzso to arbitrarily large zzso We apply this zzso to data obtained from zzso zzso zzso cells with zzso evoked zzso some of which were paired with zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso recovers the timing of the zzso and provides an estimate of the induced calcium transient throughout the zzso The proposed methods could be used to further understand the interplay between zzso and zzso in synaptic strength zzso More generally, this approach allows us to zzso the concentration on zzso calcium across the zzso tree from noisy observations at a discrete set of points in zzso
