zzso blood volume zzso zzso can eliminate the background information in near infrared zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the spectrum obtained by this method is accompanied by serious noises which are to the disadvantage of the zzso zzso zzso mode decomposition zzso was applied to restrict the noises in order to improve the performance of zzso blood volume zzso Certain criteria were used to evaluate the performance of the method, such as the average correlation zzso and the average and standard zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was applied to three zzso zzso with different zzso and the criteria were calculated zzso All of the criteria were zzso Especially for the zzso zzso with zzso the correlation zzso increased from zzso to zzso the average zzso distance decreased from zzso to zzso and the standard zzso of the zzso distance decreased from zzso to zzso after zzso zzso The zzso models of the processed zzso were promoted as zzso These preliminary results suggest that zzso is a promising means of improving the performance of zzso blood volume zzso
