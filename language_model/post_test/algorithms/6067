This study presents a real-time crash prediction model and uses this model to investigate the effect of the local zzso ramp zzso strategy on freeway zzso Safety benefits of ramp zzso are zzso in terms of the reduced crash potential estimated by the real-time crash prediction zzso Driver responses to ramp zzso and the zzso traffic flow changes were observed using a microscopic traffic simulation model and crash potential was estimated for a zzso zzso section of zzso in zzso California and a hypothetical isolated zzso zzso The results showed that ramp zzso reduced crash potential by zzso compared to the zzso zzso It was found that safety benefits of local ramp zzso strategy were only restricted to the freeway sections in the vicinity of the zzso and were highly dependent on the existing traffic conditions and the spatial extent over which the evaluation was zzso The results provide some insight into how a local ramp zzso strategy can be modified to improve safety (by reducing total crash zzso on longer stretch of zzso over a wide range of traffic zzso
