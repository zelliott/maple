A newly established method for zzso zzso models via a zzso procedure is applied to the problem of diagnosing acute coronary syndromes zzso The method provides a zzso approach to the selection of zzso which would otherwise require the use of a zzso method zzso to the size of the zzso zzso A strategy for building models is proposed and two models zzso for performance and for simplicity are derived via zzso zzso These models confirm that a relatively small set of zzso including clinical and zzso features can be used successfully in this zzso The performance of the models is comparable with previously published models using less zzso selection zzso The models prove to be portable when tested on data gathered from three other zzso zzso diagnostic accuracy and zzso diminishes slightly for these new settings, it remains satisfactory zzso The prospect of building zzso models that are as simple as possible for a required level of performance is valuable if zzso decision aids are to gain wide acceptance in the clinical situation zzso to the need to minimize the time taken to gather and enter data at the zzso
