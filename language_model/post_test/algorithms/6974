A zzso zzso discrimination model is developed for material transfer between a single source and two distinct sinks arising from an internal branching of the zzso zzso Previous analyses of zzso discrimination in zzso processes are extended to include the effects of the interacting zzso The theory is first developed as a set of generic expressions allowing for flexibility in the definition of intermediate pools in all parts of the zzso transport zzso and then applied to a case study of nitrate zzso by zzso The zzso composition of assimilated nitrate may be evaluated with the model for either contrasting root versus shoot zzso pools, each with a unique zzso signature, or as a single mean value for zzso nitrate zzso The theory is further developed to indicate how zzso zzso may be used to zzso zzso zzso ratios at the root plasma zzso zzso zzso of zzso capture between root and shoot reduction sites, and zzso mixing of root and shoot zzso pools in sink zzso due to zzso circulation of organic nitrogen in both zzso and zzso
