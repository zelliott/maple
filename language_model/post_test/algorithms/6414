The novel zzso zzso zzso and its zzso complex zzso 1, were zzso with the aim of constructing a model of the active site of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies show that 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso reduction zzso similar to those of zzso but at zzso much higher and lower, respectively, than those found for the zzso At room temperature, zzso zzso show that 1 binds strongly to 1 zzso of zzso In frozen solutions zzso zzso 1 zzso binds both zzso and zzso zzso zzso as assessed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso shifts in the pattern of g values result, from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso to either zzso zzso patterns zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso or a zzso pattern zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso analyses of the parent complex zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso complex zzso zzso show that the zzso and zzso zzso bond to copper at a sixth zzso position left vacant by the zzso zzso coordination mode of zzso and induce zzso of its zzso zzso zzso calculations based on the zzso coordinates combined with zzso theory expressions for the g values of a zzso system correlate the results from zzso zzso to the proportions of zzso and zzso character in the relevant zzso unoccupied molecular zzso The combination of zzso zzso and zzso results for this set of zzso complexes provides a zzso example of the physical phenomena underlying zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso
