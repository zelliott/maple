To demonstrate aggressive management of neck zzso adherent to the internal or common carotid artery using sound zzso principles while minimizing the significant risk of zzso 

Our 13 year experience of treating patients with zzso or residual neck zzso adherent to the internal or common carotid artery was zzso zzso 

zzso was used in patients who demonstrated fixation of the carotid artery on examination or imaging, followed by balloon test zzso and single zzso zzso computer zzso zzso zzso The majority of carotid zzso were reconstructed with a vein zzso especially if there was insufficient collateral cerebral zzso zzso zzso of the soft tissue including the carotid artery was performed followed by 15 to 20 Gray of electron beam delivered directly to the deep zzso More recently, the carotid has been permanently zzso zzso if zzso The assessment of the cerebral circulation and management of the carotid artery were analyzed as was survival, site of zzso and zzso 

zzso charts were zzso The majority of patients zzso had their carotid artery reconstructed at time of zzso and the remaining had either the artery zzso or permanently zzso zzso Strokes occurred in 11 zzso The median zzso survival was 12 months, with zzso of patients dying from distant zzso 

The high risk of zzso loss of life's quality, and mortality must be balanced against the natural history of the disease if left zzso The decision is a heavy burden for the patient, family, and head and neck zzso
