In this paper, we deal with the problem of zzso novel motions of zzso martial arts such as zzso zzso and zzso performed by a pair of zzso characters while reflecting their zzso zzso an zzso zzso we address three zzso issues embedded in this problem: motion zzso interaction zzso and motion zzso For the first issue, we present a zzso motion labeling scheme based on zzso motion zzso and zzso action zzso We also construct a pair of motion transition zzso each of which represents an individual motion zzso For the second issue, we propose a scheme for capturing the interactions between two zzso A dynamic zzso network is adopted to build a motion transition model on top of the coupled motion transition graph that is constructed from an example motion zzso For the last issue, we provide a scheme for zzso a novel sequence of coupled motions, guided by the motion transition zzso Although the focus of the present work is on martial arts, we believe that the framework of the proposed approach can be conveyed to other zzso motions as zzso
