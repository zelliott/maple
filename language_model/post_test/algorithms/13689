zzso 71 zzso infections are a significant cause of neurological disorder and death in children zzso Seasonal variations in zzso infections have been zzso but the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon remain zzso The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between meteorological parameters and zzso zzso 

We analyzed the number of zzso infections and daily climate data collected in Taiwan between 1998 and 2008 and used zzso zzso analysis and zzso methodology to evaluate the association between weather zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso A total of zzso zzso patients were reported between 1998 and zzso The zzso of zzso infections reflected significant summertime zzso (for zzso zzso The zzso of zzso infections began to rise at temperatures above zzso zzso zzso at temperatures higher than approximately zzso zzso zzso the zzso began to decline, producing an zzso zzso zzso The increase in the zzso with increasing relative humidity was positive and linear zzso zzso zzso infection was most highly correlated with temperature and relative humidity in the period that likely preceded the zzso 

Our study provides quantitative evidence that the rate of zzso infection increased significantly with increasing mean temperature and relative humidity in zzso
