zzso of mechanical stresses and strains in the left zzso zzso zzso by the finite element zzso method relies on adequate knowledge of the material properties of zzso zzso In this paper, we present a zzso zzso procedure to characterize the zzso relationship in passive zzso zzso A zzso zzso model of the zzso zzso was used, which included zzso fiber and sheet structure and a zzso zzso zzso law with different zzso in the zzso sheet, and zzso zzso The zzso method was based on measured wall zzso We analyzed the zzso ability to estimate the material parameters by generating a set of synthetic strain data by simulating the zzso inflation phase with known material zzso In this way we were able to verify the correctness of the solution and to analyze the effects of measurement and model error on the solution accuracy and zzso A sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate the zzso of the material parameters and to determine which parameters to zzso The results showed a high degree of zzso between the parameters governing the zzso in each zzso Thus, only one zzso in each of the three directions was zzso For the tested zzso of added noise and introduced model zzso the resulting estimated zzso characteristics in the fiber and sheet directions zzso with good accuracy to the known zzso The zzso zzso relationship had a higher degree of uncertainty as more noise was added and model error was zzso
