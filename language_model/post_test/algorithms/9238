In biomedical research with zzso designs, missing values due to intermittent zzso or premature withdrawal are usually zzso in the sense that zzso values are related to the patterns of zzso By drawing the framework of a zzso zzso the process yielding the repeated count measures and the process yielding missing values can be zzso zzso zzso on a group of shared zzso For chronic diseases, zzso transition models can be used to study the transitional features of the zzso zzso In this paper, zzso zzso zzso Carlo zzso are developed to fit a zzso zzso transition model for incomplete count repeated measures, within which random effects are shared by the counting process and the zzso zzso Assuming a zzso distribution for the count measures, the transition probabilities are estimated using a zzso zzso zzso The zzso mechanism is zzso with a zzso zzso to calculate the transition probabilities of the zzso zzso The method is demonstrated using both simulated data sets and a practical data set from a smoking zzso clinical zzso
