zzso and noise have a significant effect on the zzso of speech in zzso The detection of clear speech in highly zzso and noisy zzso is an extremely difficult zzso Recently, zzso microphone zzso have been studied for processing of sound fields in zzso with applications ranging from acoustic analysis to speech zzso This paper presents the derivation of a model that zzso the prediction of zzso array zzso that guarantee an acceptable level of speech zzso in zzso and noisy zzso A zzso microphone array is employed to generate a spatial filter that zzso speech zzso according to an objective measure that combines the effects of both zzso and zzso The zzso array zzso is designed to enhance the speech signal while minimizing noise power and maintaining zzso over a wide frequency zzso The paper includes simulation and experimental studies with a comparison to speech transmission index based analysis to provide initial validation of the zzso Examples are presented in which the minimum number of microphones in a zzso array can be determined from environment conditions such as zzso time, noise level, and distance of the array to the speech zzso
