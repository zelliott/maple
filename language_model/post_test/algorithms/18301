zzso by the existence of highly selective, sparsely firing cells observed in the human zzso zzso lobe zzso we present an zzso method for learning and recognizing object categories from zzso zzso In our model, a network of zzso zzso learns a sparse representation of its zzso through an zzso zzso zzso We show that the application of this strategy to an zzso zzso description of natural images leads to the development of units displaying zzso zzso selectivity for particular individuals or image categories much like those observed in the zzso zzso
