To zzso possible mechanisms leading to zzso in patients with zzso zzso Parkinson disease zzso using combined zzso zzso and zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso in zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso zzso was performed in 13 patients with zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and 19 zzso and zzso healthy controls to investigate zzso zzso in the zzso target regions of zzso zzso zzso as marker of zzso integrity, zzso and zzso containing compounds as markers of membrane zzso zzso and energy zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

Compared to controls, zzso was significantly reduced in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso concentration obtained from zzso zzso was significantly decreased in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso degradation product zzso was increased in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Changes of energy metabolism were not detected in any region of zzso 

The pattern of zzso in zzso zzso is more pronounced in the zzso than in the zzso Our zzso findings suggest that the neurodegenerative process in zzso is associated with zzso of membrane zzso metabolism which might be also involved in abnormal zzso zzso
