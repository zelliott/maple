Despite the advantages of drug delivery through the skin, such as easy accessibility, zzso prolonged therapy, avoidance of the liver zzso metabolism and a large surface area, zzso drug delivery is only used with a small subset of drugs because most compounds cannot cross the skin at zzso useful zzso Recently, a new concept was introduced known as zzso and these could be pierced to effectively deliver drugs using zzso needles in a minimally invasive and painless zzso In this study, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with various depths zzso and 500 zzso and zzso zzso 99 and 154 zzso were zzso using a zzso zzso The skin zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso was examined according to the delivery systems of zzso drug zzso depth of the PC zzso and density of the PC zzso The skin zzso of zzso was the highest when the zzso gel was applied to the skin with the 500 zzso PC zzso zzso In addition, the skin zzso of zzso was the highest when zzso of zzso gel was coupled to the 500 zzso PC zzso zzso zzso as well as longer zzso and larger density of zzso Taken together, this study suggests that a zzso PC zzso might be a suitable tool for zzso drug delivery system of zzso molecules with the possible applications to zzso such as proteins and zzso
