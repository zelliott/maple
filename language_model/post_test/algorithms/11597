Lung diseases caused by the inhalation of various particulate pollutants have often been reported to occur at specific sites in the lung with some diseases zzso occurring in one of the zzso Models for the zzso of particulate matter in the zzso therefore, need to be developed at a level of resolution that allows for the study of zzso and zzso patterns of zzso Using an approach best described as a combination of zzso and zzso approaches to modeling lung zzso we calculated deposition of particulate matter zzso ranging from zzso to coarse particles in each airway down to the level of the zzso zzso Further down the airway tree, we calculated deposition averaged over an airway generation in each lung zzso We compared our results for regional and zzso deposition with various experimental data as well as with results from other zzso The calculated results compared reasonably well with experimental zzso zzso variations in deposition were observed among the zzso zzso as well as among the five zzso The differences among the zzso were zzso as one examined zzso zzso zzso per unit surface area of each zzso zzso was considerably elevated relative to that calculated for the whole zzso The relative distribution of zzso deposited per unit surface area among the zzso zzso was altered by breathing condition and zzso zzso Our observations suggest that a zzso model that incorporates the zzso structure of airways in the lung is likely to reduce uncertainties in PM health risk zzso
