zzso pacing is associated with lower risk of zzso zzso zzso in sick zzso syndrome compared with zzso zzso zzso the impact of site and rate of zzso pacing on progression of zzso remains zzso We evaluated whether long-term zzso pacing at the right zzso zzso zzso versus the low zzso zzso with zzso or without zzso a continuous zzso overdrive pacing zzso can prevent the development of persistent zzso 

We zzso 385 patients with zzso zzso and sick zzso syndrome in whom a zzso was indicated to pacing at zzso zzso ON zzso zzso zzso OFF zzso zzso zzso ON zzso or zzso zzso OFF zzso The primary outcome was the occurrence of persistent zzso zzso documented at least 7 days apart or need for zzso zzso data were homogeneous across both pacing site zzso zzso zzso and zzso overdrive pacing zzso After a mean follow-up of zzso years, persistent zzso occurred in 99 patients zzso annual rate of persistent zzso zzso Alternative site pacing at the zzso zzso versus conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso or continuous zzso overdrive pacing ON versus OFF zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso did not prevent the development of persistent zzso 

In patients with zzso zzso and sick zzso syndrome requiring zzso zzso an alternative zzso pacing site at the zzso zzso or continuous zzso overdrive pacing did not prevent the development of persistent zzso
