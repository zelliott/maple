zzso the evolutionary relationships between organisms is vital for their in-depth zzso zzso methods are often used to zzso such zzso which are not without zzso One can now attempt to use zzso information, because of the ever increasing number of zzso zzso This opportunity also presents a challenge in terms of zzso zzso Two fundamentally different methods are often employed for sequence zzso namely zzso and zzso zzso zzso methods rely on the zzso signature concept and provide a zzso efficient way that is also zzso to zzso zzso The zzso signature contains evolutionary signal as it is more similar for closely related organisms than for zzso related zzso We used zzso sequence information to zzso zzso distances between organisms without additional information such as gene zzso We propose a method to improve zzso tree zzso by learning specific distance metrics over the zzso signature for groups of organisms with similar zzso zzso or ecological zzso Specifically, our method learns a zzso metric for a set of zzso and a reference zzso to guide the learning zzso By applying this method to more than a thousand zzso zzso we showed that, indeed, better distance metrics could be learned for most of the 18 groups of organisms tested zzso Once a zzso metric is available, it can be used to estimate the zzso distances for other zzso organisms from the zzso This study also presents a large scale comparison between 10 zzso zzso and 1 zzso
