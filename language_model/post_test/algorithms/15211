zzso of zzso nerve head zzso zzso could be useful in the clinical management of zzso Here, we propose a novel three-dimensional zzso zzso designed to be used in zzso We carry out preliminary zzso of the zzso by testing its accuracy and its zzso An zzso based on digital volume correlation was developed to extract zzso tissue zzso from two optical zzso zzso zzso volumes of the zzso zzso and zzso The zzso was tested by applying artificial zzso to a baseline zzso scan while manipulating zzso noise, zzso and contrast zzso zzso zzso determined by our zzso were compared with the known zzso zzso Errors in displacement zzso orientation and strain decreased with signal averaging and were zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively (for zzso zzso zzso Previous zzso work suggests that these errors are acceptable to provide in zzso characterization of zzso zzso Our zzso is robust to zzso zzso noise as well as to changes in zzso conditions, and increasing signal averaging can produce better zzso This zzso has potential be used to zzso zzso three-dimensional strains in zzso of benefit in the diagnosis and identification of risk factors in zzso
