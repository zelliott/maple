Although local zzso during zzso zzso zzso are often zzso analyzed over zzso zzso zzso changes may be common over intervals as short as zzso We sought to determine whether averaged zzso zzso of zzso spectral parameters were similar to zzso zzso and whether the zzso intervals could provide an estimate of the zzso stability of the signal frequency content in zzso versus persistent zzso 

Complex zzso zzso zzso zzso were acquired outside the pulmonary vein zzso and from free wall sites in nine zzso and 10 longstanding persistent zzso zzso Using a zzso sliding calculation window, a frequency spectrum was zzso every 100 zzso over an zzso of zzso seconds (82 zzso in zzso The dominant frequency zzso the dominant zzso zzso and the mean spectral profile zzso were zzso The zzso zzso were compared to single zzso zzso zzso zzso of variation zzso were zzso from the 82 zzso for each zzso recording to determine zzso zzso of zzso 

Over the sliding zzso zzso zzso as for fixed zzso zzso zzso mean zzso and zzso were significantly higher in longstanding persistent zzso while zzso was significantly higher in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was significantly higher for the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and significantly higher for the zzso zzso in persistent zzso zzso zzso zzso 

For both zzso and persistent zzso data, the zzso sliding window averages provide similar results to single zzso zzso and information regarding zzso stability was additionally obtained in the zzso
