The effect of the concentration of metal zzso in minimal media has been shown to be very important for the production and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The best media compositions for biomass and zzso zzso formation were evaluated using a genetic zzso The screening was carried out in 96 zzso deep well plates with 900 zzso zzso zzso In 7 generations, 240 different kinds of media were tested, key elements for production and zzso were detected and a zzso increase in production of zzso zzso compared to the previously used medium could be zzso In addition, media with a higher biomass formation zzso or with both more biomass and a higher production of zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso Interestingly the best media for protein production and zzso were different in their zzso with regards to the metal zzso concentration zzso From data derived zzso and from the zzso zzso was shown to be one of the key components of the metal zzso tested for biomass formation and especially for production and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
