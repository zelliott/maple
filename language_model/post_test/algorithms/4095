Phase information is a fundamental aspect of visual zzso However, the nature of the zzso combination of stimuli defined by zzso in contrast, so-called zzso zzso is presently not zzso To address this issue, we measured zzso combination for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso stimuli using a zzso phase combination paradigm in seven normal zzso We found that the zzso perceived phase of zzso zzso depends on the zzso signal ratio as has been previously shown for their first order zzso the zzso signal ratios when the two eyes were balanced was close to 1 in both zzso and zzso phase zzso However, zzso combination is more linear than previously found for zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso combination of zzso stimuli was similar regardless of whether the carriers in the two eyes were zzso zzso or zzso This suggests that, in normal adults, the zzso phase combination of zzso stimuli occurs after the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The sensory balance associated with this zzso combination can be obtained from zzso phase combination zzso
