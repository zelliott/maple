DNA zzso zzso zzso frequently used in biological and medical studies, measure the expressions of thousands of genes per zzso Using zzso data to build accurate zzso for diseases is an important zzso This paper introduces an algorithm, called Committee of zzso Trees by zzso zzso Diversity zzso to build highly accurate ensembles of decision trees for such zzso Since a committee's accuracy is greatly influenced by the diversity among its member zzso zzso uses two new ideas to zzso that diversity, namely zzso the concept of attribute zzso similarity between zzso and zzso the concept of attribute usage diversity among zzso The ideas are effective for zzso data, since such data have many features and behavior similarity between genes can be zzso zzso on zzso data for six zzso show that zzso zzso previous ensemble methods significantly and zzso zzso and show that the diversified features used by zzso decision tree committee can be used to improve performance of other zzso such as zzso zzso has potential for other zzso data, and its ideas may apply to ensembles of other zzso zzso
