The comparison of zzso sequences from different species is an essential approach to reconstruct the evolutionary history of species and of the genes they zzso in their zzso Several complete zzso and nuclear zzso are now available, increasing the importance of using multiple sequence alignment zzso in comparative zzso zzso has long been used in zzso analysis and errors in the alignments can lead to errors in the interpretation of evolutionary zzso Although a large number of multiple sequence alignment zzso have been proposed to date, they all deal with linear DNA and cannot handle directly circular zzso Researchers interested in aligning circular DNA sequences must first rotate them to the zzso place using an essentially manual process, before they can use multiple sequence alignment zzso 

In this paper we propose an efficient zzso that identifies the most interesting region to cut circular zzso in order to improve zzso analysis when using standard multiple sequence alignment zzso This zzso identifies the largest chain of zzso longest zzso common to a set of circular zzso DNA zzso All the sequences are then rotated and made linear for multiple alignment zzso evaluate the effectiveness of this new zzso three different sets of zzso DNA sequences were zzso Other tests considering randomly rotated sequences were also zzso The software package zzso was used to evaluate the standard genetic measures of the alignments obtained with and without the use of the zzso zzso with two well known multiple alignment zzso the zzso and the zzso tools, and also the zzso tool zzso 

The results show that a zzso and rotation zzso step significantly improves the efficiency of public available multiple sequence alignment zzso when used in the alignment of circular DNA zzso The resulting alignments lead to more realistic zzso comparisons between zzso
