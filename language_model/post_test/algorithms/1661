The massive data produced by next-generation sequencing require advanced statistical zzso We address zzso the total diversity or species richness in a zzso To date, only relatively simple methods have been implemented in available zzso There is a need for software employing modern, zzso intensive statistical analyses including error, zzso and zzso zzso 

We present zzso a fast, zzso zzso program that zzso maximum likelihood estimates for zzso models, weighted linear zzso analyses and zzso zzso methods, along with zzso zzso Given sample zzso zzso data, zzso zzso 12 different diversity estimates and applies a zzso zzso zzso also derives discounted diversity estimates to adjust for possibly uncertain zzso zzso It is accompanied by an zzso graphics zzso
