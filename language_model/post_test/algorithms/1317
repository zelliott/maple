Group contribution methods are frequently used for zzso physical properties of compounds from their molecular zzso An zzso for zzso Gibbs energies of formation through group contribution methods has been automated in an zzso zzso The zzso zzso compound structures according to a basis set of zzso It permits the use of zzso and is able to distinguish between ring groups and chain groups that use similar search zzso Past methods relied on manual decomposition of compounds into constituent zzso 

The software is written in Common zzso and requires zzso 2 zzso to estimate Gibbs energies of formation for a database of zzso species of varying size and zzso The software allows rapid expansion to incorporate different basis sets and to estimate a variety of other physical zzso
