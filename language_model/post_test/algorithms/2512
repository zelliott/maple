In making low-level zzso zzso of zzso it is commonly observed that a substantial portion of net results is zzso Furthermore, the observed zzso of the measurement results arises from a combination of measurement uncertainty and population zzso This paper presents a method for zzso measurement uncertainty from population zzso to produce a probability density function zzso of possibly true zzso To do this, simple, justifiable and reasonable assumptions are made about the relationship of the zzso to the zzso (the zzso zzso The zzso are assumed to be zzso that is, that their average value is the average of the zzso Using traditional estimates of each zzso uncertainty, a likelihood zzso for each zzso zzso is zzso Then using the same assumptions and all the data from the population of individuals, a prior zzso of zzso for the population is zzso The prior zzso is zzso and the average is equal to the average of the measurement results for the zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso of each individual zzso are zzso The uncertainty in these zzso zzso zzso appears to be all zzso with no remaining classical zzso The method is applied to baseline zzso data from the zzso zzso The data include zzso zzso zzso of 128 people, zzso in zzso zzso of zzso people and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The method produces excellent results for the zzso and zzso zzso since there are zzso zzso of these global fallout zzso in people who have not been zzso zzso The method does not work for the zzso zzso in zzso exposed people because the population average is essentially zero relative to the sensitivity of the measurement zzso The method is shown to give results similar to classical statistical zzso when the zzso have relatively small zzso
