We measured zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso apparent diffusion zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in each zzso zzso region of interest zzso Such local zzso zzso can be represented in zzso maps showing the magnitude zzso and direction of zzso zzso providing a qualitative zzso tool and quantitative measurement of airway and air space zzso zzso subjects (15 male, mean zzso zzso with global initiative for chronic zzso lung disease zzso stage II zzso mean age zzso zzso GOLD stage III chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso zzso mean age zzso zzso and zzso healthy volunteers zzso mean age zzso zzso were enrolled based on their age and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed on a whole body zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso zzso and zzso standard zzso were calculated for the center zzso zzso and the mean magnitude and direction of the zzso zzso zzso were calculated for each zzso zzso zzso zzso While the zzso zzso standard zzso was not significantly different, mean zzso was significantly different between subjects with stage II zzso zzso and stage III COPD zzso zzso zzso and between healthy subjects zzso zzso and those with stage II COPD zzso The second order statistic zzso may provide a sensitive measure of zzso zzso for zzso representing zzso zzso or zzso zzso of lung zzso
