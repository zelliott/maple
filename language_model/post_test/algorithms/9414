To describe and evaluate a machine zzso automated system to detect zzso and zzso spots in digital color zzso photographs and differentiate them from zzso for early diagnosis of diabetic zzso 

Three hundred retinal images from one eye of 300 patients with diabetes were selected from a diabetic zzso zzso database zzso camera, zzso zzso 100 with previously diagnosed bright zzso and 200 zzso A machine learning computer program was developed that can identify and differentiate among zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A human expert standard for the 300 images was obtained by consensus zzso by two retinal zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso on the 300 images by the automated system and a third retinal specialist were zzso 

The system achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic zzso curve of zzso and zzso pairs of zzso for the detection of bright zzso of any type, and zzso zzso and zzso for the detection of zzso zzso spots, and zzso zzso The third retinal specialist achieved pairs of zzso for bright zzso and zzso zzso and zzso per zzso zzso 

A machine zzso automated system capable of detecting zzso and zzso spots and zzso them from zzso in color images obtained in community based diabetic patients has been developed and approaches the performance level of retinal zzso If the machine learning can be improved with additional training data sets, it may be useful for detecting clinically important bright zzso enhancing early diagnosis, and reducing visual loss in patients with zzso
