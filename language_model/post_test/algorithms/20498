Three types of zzso organization can be called zzso zzso sets of zzso cells, ordered projections between zzso layers and ordered maps of abstract zzso The latter are most intriguing as they reflect the central properties of an zzso experiences and zzso It is proposed that such feature maps are learned in a process that involves parallel input to zzso in a brain area and adaptation of zzso in the neighborhood of the cells that respond most strongly to this zzso This article presents a new mathematical zzso for such adaptation and relates it to zzso zzso
