The performance of a fingerprint matching system is affected by the zzso deformation introduced in the fingerprint impression during image zzso This zzso deformation causes fingerprint features such as zzso points and zzso zzso to be distorted in a complex zzso A technique is presented to estimate the zzso distortion in fingerprint pairs based on zzso curve zzso The zzso zzso represented using the zzso zzso zzso function, aids in the zzso of an zzso deformation model for a specific finger when several impressions of that finger are zzso The estimated average deformation is then zzso to distort the template fingerprint prior to matching it with an input zzso The proposed deformation model based on zzso zzso leads to a better alignment of two fingerprint images compared to a deformation model based on zzso zzso An index of deformation is proposed for selecting the zzso deformation model arising from multiple impressions associated with a zzso zzso based on experimental data consisting of zzso fingerprints corresponding to 50 different fingers collected over a period of two weeks show that incorporating the proposed deformation model results in an improvement in the matching zzso
