This study combines source analysis imaging data for early zzso processing and the zzso zzso maps zzso Human zzso evoked fields zzso were recorded by stimulating left and right median zzso zzso the recorded responses in different frequency ranges identified the most responsive frequency zzso The zzso averaged zzso were analyzed using a single equivalent current zzso zzso model and magnetic field zzso zzso The identified zzso of activity were superimposed with zzso Two major components of opposite polarity were prominent around 21 and 31 zzso A weak component around 25 zzso was also zzso For the most responsive frequency band zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed one focal source at the zzso zzso area zzso zzso at the peak of zzso The component zzso zzso was zzso in zzso area 1 zzso in zzso zzso By using zzso focal generators around zzso zzso located initially in zzso and 2 zzso later to zzso zzso also revealed two focal sources - one in zzso and one in zzso for these zzso Our results provide direct evidence that the earliest cortical response after median nerve stimulation is generated within the zzso zzso zzso zzso few milliseconds later indicates a serial mode of zzso processing within zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso data and the use of zzso allow zzso and quantitative zzso interpretation of zzso identity of activated areas following median nerve zzso even with the simple zzso model, but only when the model fits the data extremely zzso
