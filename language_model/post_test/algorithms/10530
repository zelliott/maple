High zzso zzso zzso zzso is the major sequencing platform for producing long read high zzso zzso While most other sequencing techniques produce reading errors mainly comparable with zzso zzso produce errors mainly comparable with zzso These errors are less efficiently detected by most conventional alignment programs and may produce inaccurate zzso 

We suggest a novel zzso for calculating the optimal local alignment which zzso zzso information in order to improve alignment zzso zzso information can be retained from a zzso sequencing run through interpretation of the zzso zzso zzso This novel zzso has been implemented in a program named zzso zzso Assisted zzso Search zzso 

We present and discuss the results of simulations that show that zzso through the use of the novel algorithm, can gain several percentage points of accuracy compared to zzso zzso depending on the zzso data zzso Furthermore, through an efficient zzso aware zzso zzso is able to perform these high quality alignments at high zzso The tool is available at zzso
