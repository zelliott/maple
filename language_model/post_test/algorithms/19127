The zzso zzso technique is a zzso method that provides the analysis of blood volume changes in the zzso This is made possible by an interpretation of the zzso signal zzso In this paper, time and spatial variations of such zzso signals are studied on recordings made on limbs of 15 healthy subjects at zzso For that purpose, the zzso of each signal has been zzso and quantitative measures based on energies were zzso The results show that the signals are statistically time zzso on three anatomical segments of the zzso zzso thigh and zzso p Value varies between zzso and zzso for the absolute energies zzso on zzso of signals recorded at 5 zzso zzso Moreover, the analysis made on the two legs of each subject shows that the signals are spatial zzso on the three anatomical zzso p Value varies between zzso and zzso for the absolute energies zzso on the zzso of signals recorded simultaneously on the two zzso These conclusions will therefore help the clinicians in studying the zzso variations of zzso parameters on limbs with the zzso zzso Moreover, the results on the spatial zzso make possible the comparisons of these parameters with those given by other acquisition zzso
