The zzso zzso in zzso delivery of intensity modulated zzso is zzso A zzso index zzso is introduced to zzso the zzso effect in zzso zzso Four different types of leaf sequencing methods are zzso The sliding window method and the reducing level method use the same number of field segments to deliver the same intensity map, but the zzso is much less for the reducing level zzso The leaf synchronization method of Van zzso and zzso fails in zzso delivery, but a new method inspired by the method of Van zzso and zzso is shown to eliminate zzso zzso zzso
