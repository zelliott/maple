zzso cellular level zzso of lung cancer is the prerequisite to extract objective zzso features in digitized pathology zzso It is of great importance for zzso diagnosis and zzso However, it is challenging to correctly and robustly segment cells in lung cancer images due to cell zzso or touching, zzso zzso background zzso zzso In this paper, we present a novel zzso zzso combining a robust zzso sparse shape model zzso and an efficient local repulsive balloon snake zzso model zzso to tackle these zzso The zzso has been extensively tested on 62 cases with over zzso tumor zzso We zzso demonstrate that the proposed zzso can produce better performance than other state-of-the-art zzso
