zzso evergreen species commonly have a higher leaf nitrogen content in winter than in zzso Tested here is a hypothesis that such changes in leaf nitrogen content maximize zzso efficiency, defined as the daily carbon gain per unit zzso under given temperature and zzso zzso 

The evergreen shrub zzso zzso growing naturally at three sites with different zzso regimes in Japan was zzso Leaf zzso zzso zzso and leaf nitrogen with zzso of temperature and zzso monthly at each site were zzso Daily carbon gain was determined as a function of leaf nitrogen content to calculate the optimal leaf nitrogen content that zzso daily zzso zzso 

As is known, the optimal leaf nitrogen content increased with increasing zzso The optimal leaf nitrogen content also increased with decreasing temperature because the zzso capacity per zzso zzso Across sites and months, the optimal leaf nitrogen content was close to the actual leaf nitrogen content and explained the variation in actual leaf nitrogen by 64 zzso zzso analysis showed that the effect of temperature on optimal nitrogen content was similar in magnitude to that of zzso 

zzso evergreen species regulate leaf nitrogen content so as to maximize zzso efficiency in daily carbon gain under changing zzso and temperature zzso
