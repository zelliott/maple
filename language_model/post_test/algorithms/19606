The master zzso zzso of the zzso zzso coordinates behavioral and zzso rhythms via synchronization of subordinate peripheral zzso in the central nervous system and zzso throughout the zzso Among these zzso the adrenal zzso hold a prime position because of their regulatory influence on numerous zzso functions via rhythmic zzso of catecholamines and zzso hormones into the zzso In this report, the authors perform whole zzso zzso zzso to characterize the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso They show that zzso of the mouse zzso is under zzso control in this zzso Using gene zzso analysis, they identify classes of transcripts that may zzso adrenal hormone zzso The zzso expression profiling also revealed that multiple zzso genes implicated in either DNA replication or zzso regulation are clock controlled, suggesting a novel way by which the zzso clock may regulate the zzso zzso
