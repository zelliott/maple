To investigate whether zzso machine learning zzso can help identify zzso studies eligible for zzso screening by systematic zzso zzso zzso performance varies with zzso and zzso the number of citations to screen can be zzso 

We used an zzso zzso suite to process and zzso biomedical citations that point to mostly zzso studies from 2 systematic zzso We built training and test sets for citation portions and compared zzso performance by considering the value of indexing, various feature sets, and zzso We conducted our experiments in 2 zzso The design of phase I with no zzso was: 4 zzso zzso 3 feature sets zzso 3 citation zzso zzso included zzso neighbor, zzso zzso complement zzso zzso and evolutionary support zzso zzso Feature sets included bag of words, and zzso and zzso zzso zzso portions included titles, titles and zzso and full citations with zzso Phase II with zzso involved a subset of the zzso as well as features extracted from full zzso and full citations with zzso zzso We zzso features and zzso parameters by manually setting information gain thresholds outside of a process for zzso grid zzso with zzso zzso We independently tested models on data reserved for that purpose and statistically compared zzso performance on 2 types of feature zzso We estimated the number of citations needed to screen by zzso during a second pass through a reduced set of zzso 

In phase I, the evolutionary support zzso machine returned the best recall for bag of words extracted from full zzso the best zzso with respect to overall performance was zzso zzso No zzso attained good enough recall for this task without zzso In phase II, we zzso performance with zzso for evolutionary support zzso machine and complement zzso zzso zzso zzso performance was better for the latter in the independent zzso For evolutionary support zzso machine and complement zzso zzso zzso the initial retrieval set was reduced by zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso learning zzso can help identify zzso studies eligible for zzso screening by systematic zzso zzso can markedly improve performance of zzso However, zzso varies with the zzso The number of citations to screen during a second independent pass through the citations can be substantially zzso
