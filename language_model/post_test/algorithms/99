Small regulatory zzso zzso in zzso and bacteria play an important role in the regulation of gene expression either by binding to regulatory proteins or directly to target zzso Two of the zzso bacterial zzso zzso and zzso form a complementary pair with the zzso binding region of their target zzso thereby zzso translation or promoting zzso zzso To investigate the zzso and dynamic potential of such zzso we examine the 2 key parameters characterizing zzso zzso the capacity to zzso the zzso relative to its target zzso and the speed at which the target zzso is zzso zzso We demonstrate different methods to determine these 2 key zzso for zzso and zzso which combine zzso and genetic experiments with zzso zzso We have developed a mathematical model that describes the functional properties of zzso with various characteristic zzso We observed that zzso and zzso function in distinctive zzso zzso which result in divergent zzso
