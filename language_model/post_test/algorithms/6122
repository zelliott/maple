Image restoration requires some a zzso knowledge of the zzso Some of the conventional zzso techniques are based on the zzso of the power spectrum zzso zzso statistical models for spectral zzso just take into account zzso relations between the zzso of the zzso However, natural images exhibit additional features, such as particular relationships between local zzso or zzso transform zzso Biological visual systems have evolved to capture these zzso We propose the use of this biological behavior to build zzso operators as an alternative to simple statistical zzso The results suggest that if the penalty operator takes these additional features in natural images into account, it will be more robust and the choice of the zzso zzso is less zzso
