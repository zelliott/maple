zzso zzso zzso zzso are conducted worldwide to decide whether and how exotic plant zzso should be regulated to prevent zzso There is an increasing demand for zzso risk mapping in zzso zzso plays a key role in determining the potential distribution of zzso but there is no suitable spread zzso tool available for zzso risk zzso zzso models are species specific, biologically and technically complex, and data zzso Here we present a set of four simple and generic spread models that can be zzso with limited zzso zzso with these models generate maps of the potential expansion of an invasive species at zzso zzso The models have one to three biological zzso They differ in whether they treat spatial processes implicitly or zzso and in whether they consider zzso density or zzso zzso zzso The four models represent four complementary perspectives on the process of invasion and, because they have different initial conditions, they can be considered as alternative zzso All models take into account habitat distribution and zzso We present an application of each of the four models to the western corn zzso zzso zzso zzso using historic data on its spread in zzso Further tests as proof of concept were conducted with a broad range of zzso zzso zzso plants, and plant zzso zzso risk analysts, the intended model users, found the model zzso to be generally credible and zzso The zzso of parameters from data requires insights into population dynamics theory, and this requires zzso If used appropriately, these generic spread models provide a transparent and objective tool for evaluating the potential spread of zzso in zzso Further work is needed to validate models, build familiarity in the user community and create a database of species parameters to help realize their potential in zzso zzso
