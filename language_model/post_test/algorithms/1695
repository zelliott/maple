This study was designed to test the hypothesis that zzso zzso can be zzso into zzso free zzso zzso zzso for controlled drug zzso To test this hypothesis, zzso zzso were prepared by emulsion zzso diffusion zzso A zzso zzso design was used to zzso the effect of three zzso variables zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso on particle mean diameter zzso zzso index zzso zzso and percent drug zzso efficiency zzso zzso The zzso were characterized for zzso zzso behavior, optical properties, zzso and drug release zzso using electron zzso zzso differential scanning zzso zzso zzso transform infrared zzso zzso powder X-ray zzso zzso and high performance liquid zzso zzso The optimum formula produced with 6 zzso of zzso 7 zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso corresponded to zzso zzso zzso and zzso as zzso zzso and zzso values, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicated that zzso was zzso in its zzso zzso form I within the zzso zzso zzso This was further confirmed by a comparative study between native zzso zzso zzso and zzso loaded zzso using scanning zzso zzso and drug release zzso The release zzso of the zzso formula fit the zzso model indicating that the drug was released by diffusion in zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso could be successfully prepared with high zzso and sustained release profile intended for the inner ear drug zzso
