We propose a novel zzso zzso scheme capable of high zzso zzso and high zzso zzso efficiency based on a slit of zzso greater than the zzso immersed in a uniform zzso The zzso properties of the slit are engineered such that the slit sustains a zzso zzso zzso mode just above zzso which is shown to be amenable to zzso matching to the zzso mode at the slit zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso efficiency are zzso by zzso simulations of visible light propagation through the slit for varying zzso and zzso zzso zzso An optimal zzso zzso zzso satisfying zzso matching is shown to yield an zzso greater zzso zzso than a comparable slit of zzso zzso and a peak zzso zzso efficiency zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of zzso between zzso zzso modes in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
