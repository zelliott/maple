We propose a model of zzso registration that leads to a zzso zzso for preoperatively selecting a set of model registration zzso 

We performed five sets of computer simulations using registration points generated by our zzso and two noise amplification index zzso zzso on the basis of the research of Simon zzso We used several different bone surface models zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from CT images of patient zzso The number of registration points used varied between 6 and zzso 

Our zzso was faster than the zzso zzso by factors of approximately 4 and zzso It had equal or better performance in terms of target registration error zzso when compared with the other zzso Our simulations also showed that point selection can have a large effect on zzso zzso in particular, poor point selection does not necessarily decrease zzso as more registration points are zzso 

Our zzso zzso produces model registration points with similar or better zzso behavior than the zzso zzso we tested, and it does so with significantly less zzso zzso
