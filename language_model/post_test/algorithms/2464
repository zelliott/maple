Sleep zzso are bursts of 11-15 zzso that occur during zzso eye movement zzso zzso are highly zzso across the scalp in the electroencephalogram zzso but have low spatial zzso and exhibit low correlation with the zzso when simultaneously measured in the zzso zzso We developed a zzso model to explore the hypothesis that the spatial zzso zzso in the zzso is a consequence of diffuse zzso projections of the zzso to layer 1 compared with the focal projections of the core zzso to layer 4 recorded in the zzso zzso the zzso of zzso connectivity in the zzso zzso while keeping the core zzso fixed led to increased zzso of the zzso activity in the superficial cortical layers in the zzso In agreement with cortical recordings, the zzso for zzso to spread from the core to the zzso was independent of the zzso zzso but highly dependent on the probability of connections between cortical zzso
