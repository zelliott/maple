A common difficulty for the traditional methods of fluorescent molecular zzso zzso reconstruction is that only a small amount of zzso can be used to recover the image comprised of a large number of zzso This difficulty not only leads to expensive zzso cost but also likely results in an unstable solution prone to be affected by the noise in the measurement zzso In this paper, we propose a zzso method for reducing the zzso where the target areas are determined by searching for the nearest neighbor zzso In this method, the zzso zzso of the zzso derivatives is incorporated to speed up the zzso zzso An iteration strategy of zzso measurement is introduced to further improve the accuracy of inverse zzso zzso results demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly speed up the reconstruction process and improve the image quality of zzso
