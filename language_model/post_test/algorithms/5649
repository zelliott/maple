In this paper, we present a zzso patch alignment framework zzso to unify popular zzso zzso zzso zzso related dimension reduction zzso It offers a new viewpoint to better understand the common property of different zzso zzso Although zzso update rule zzso can solve zzso and is easy to zzso it zzso zzso Thus, we propose a fast zzso descent zzso to overcome the aforementioned zzso zzso uses the Newton method to search the optimal step size, and thus zzso faster than zzso zzso on synthetic and real-world zzso confirm the efficiency of zzso compared with zzso for zzso zzso Based on zzso we develop zzso zzso locality alignment zzso zzso on face image and handwritten zzso suggest the effectiveness of zzso in zzso tasks and its zzso to image zzso compared with representative zzso dimension reduction zzso
