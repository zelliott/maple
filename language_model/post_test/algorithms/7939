Total hip zzso zzso significantly improves the quality of life in majority of patients with severe zzso However, long-term outcomes of zzso are compromised by zzso loosening and zzso zzso which needs revision zzso Both of these are zzso linked to a prosthetic wear zzso from the prosthetic articulating zzso As a result, there is a need to measure the mode and magnitude of zzso The paper evaluates three optical methods proposed for construction of a device for the zzso prosthetic wear zzso Of them, the scanning zzso achieved promising combination of accuracy and zzso zzso it is time efficient to enable the development of a sensor for wear zzso
