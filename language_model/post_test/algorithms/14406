Support zzso machine zzso selectivity searching has recently been introduced to identify compounds in virtual screening libraries that are not only active for a target zzso but also selective for this target over a closely related member of the same protein zzso In simulated virtual screening calculations, zzso strategies termed preference ranking and zzso ranking were successfully applied to rank a database and enrich high-ranking positions with selective compounds while removing zzso molecules from high zzso In contrast to the original zzso approach developed for zzso zzso these strategies enable learning from more than two classes, considering that distinguishing between selective, zzso active, and inactive compounds gives rise to a zzso prediction zzso In this chapter, we describe the extension of the zzso strategy to four training zzso Furthermore, we present an adaptation of the preference ranking strategy that leads to higher recall of selective compounds than previously investigated approaches and is zzso in situations where the removal of zzso compounds from high-ranking positions is not zzso
