To investigate the frequency and characteristics of the zzso accessory zzso zzso zzso with zzso 

A retrospective study was carried out using the CT records of 504 patients referred to the zzso University Medical School zzso zzso between 2007 and zzso zzso location, diameter, area and number of zzso and their continuity with zzso canal and distance to the mental zzso were evaluated using zzso zzso and three-dimensional CT zzso zzso analysis was performed using zzso zzso 15 zzso zzso Chicago, zzso and zzso were used for statistical zzso 

14 zzso were observed in 10 zzso of 504 zzso The frequency of zzso was found to be zzso in males and zzso in zzso The mean distance between the zzso and the mental zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean long axis of the zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the mean area of them was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean area of the mental zzso on the side with the zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This study presents a relatively lower frequency of zzso than that in the zzso These zzso could have more complex zzso structures than was previously zzso Thus, in special cases where a direct surgical exploration during the planned surgery is not zzso CT or cone beam CT examination to determine the possible presence of zzso may be zzso
