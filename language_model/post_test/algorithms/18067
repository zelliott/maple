An important method to zzso the effects of zzso on populations is to estimate the minimum number of zzso events, zzso in the history of a DNA zzso People have focused on zzso the lower bound of zzso because it is also a valid lower bound for the true number of zzso events zzso Current approaches for zzso the lower bound are under the assumption of the infinite site model and do not allow for zzso zzso However, zzso zzso are relatively common in genes with high zzso rates or zzso zzso such as those in the zzso of bacteria or zzso 

In this paper two new zzso were proposed for zzso the lower bound of zzso under the infinite site zzso Their performances were compared to other bounds currently in zzso The new lower bounds were further extended to allow for zzso zzso Application of these methods were demonstrated with two zzso data zzso 

These new zzso would help to obtain a better zzso of the lower bound of zzso under the infinite site zzso After extension to allow for zzso zzso they can produce robust zzso with the existence of high zzso rate or zzso zzso They can also be used to show different combinations of zzso zzso and zzso that can produce the same zzso pattern in the zzso
