Over the past few years, two generations of cochlear implants have been designed and tested by our zzso Since the beginning, our goal was to design a system that is completely transparent to sound processing zzso and stimulation zzso The first generation zzso has eight completely independent channels and the second generation one has zzso Each of them is mounted on a thick film hybrid circuit together with necessary zzso zzso The electronic circuits are housed in a hermetically sealed titanium zzso They are able to deliver zzso zzso simultaneous or zzso stimuli on all of their zzso Their zzso are zzso with all possible zzso The zzso zzso has already been successfully implanted on volunteer profoundly deaf patients, zzso our concepts and our zzso The second one is endowed with more flexibility and transparency to stimulation zzso It offers extended possibilities and more zzso zzso In a second version, this one has also been mounted on a thin film hybrid circuit making its size considerably reduced and allowing zzso it in other sites rather than on the zzso zzso The sound zzso supporting these systems communicates with internal parts through an zzso zzso It is built around a powerful zzso and can be programmed with more than one zzso at a zzso It has been already programmed with all the known strategies and some original ones such as the technique of zzso zzso The latter uses a dictionary of zzso stimulation patterns mapped to sound zzso As for programming the systems, this is accomplished by mean of specific zzso application software using a window driven completely zzso zzso
