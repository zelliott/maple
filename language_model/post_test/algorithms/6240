In the clinical field, zzso data provided by advanced technical devices are still zzso Data analysis usually consists of zzso attributes or computing synthetic values from zzso data and exploiting them by means of a zzso statistical zzso This article proposes a method to support zzso especially those in zzso in the contextual interpretation of zzso zzso We propose to characterize zzso zzso data by means of fuzzy zzso windows and to induce fuzzy decision trees to map the zzso and clinical data related to zzso Then, we present a method for zzso explaining a given clinical characteristic of a particular zzso this method is derived using the fuzzy rule base generated from the trees and a zzso zzso We have applied our method to real data in order to provide an objective explanation of the zzso zzso of the functional status of patients with a shoulder zzso and evaluate it by means of the zzso tenfold cross validation zzso The mean explanation zzso zzso to the mean proportion of the patients belonging to test sets whose functional state is explained by the proposed zzso zzso for more than half of the decision trees, and exceeds zzso for zzso of the zzso By supporting clinicians during the zzso data interpretation process, our method helps them take the objective zzso zzso in the medical practice into account, particularly in zzso It can also make zzso evaluations more objective by mapping zzso and objective zzso
