In survivors of pediatric brain tumors, zzso radiation therapy can cause a debilitating cognitive decline associated with decreased volume in zzso white matter zzso We applied zzso geometry to zzso white matter zzso integrity in the brain of zzso zzso zzso features of zzso were evaluated by zzso of zzso dimensions zzso of zzso intensity and boundary on zzso magnetic resonance zzso The zzso index of zzso intensity was calculated by using a fractional zzso motion model, and the zzso index of zzso boundary was calculated by using a zzso zzso zzso features of zzso on 116 magnetic resonance images of 58 patients with zzso were investigated at the start of therapy zzso zzso and approximately 2 years later zzso zzso Patients were assigned to one of two groups based on change in zzso zzso zzso features in patients with decreased zzso volume were significantly greater After zzso whereas those in patients with increased zzso volumes were zzso Multiple linear zzso analysis showed that zzso features were strongly correlated with zzso volumes After zzso in patients with decreased zzso zzso These results demonstrated significant deficit in zzso integrity and zzso density changes in children treated for zzso Multiple zzso analysis illustrated that deficits in zzso integrity in these children may partly explain the decrease in zzso zzso We conclude that zzso geometry can be used to monitor the zzso effects of zzso in brain tumor zzso
