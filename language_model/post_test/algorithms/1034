We analyzed the zzso between the efficiency of a gene expression and the zzso composition of all zzso sequences in 38 zzso organisms whose complete zzso sequences are zzso These organisms comprise 37 zzso (29 zzso and eight zzso and one zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated that frequency analysis of gene zzso composition fails to reflect adequately the gene expression efficiency of all these zzso We constructed a measure, the zzso efficiency index, that considers simultaneously the information on zzso zzso and the degree of zzso local zzso This measure recognizes the zzso genes as highly expressed in all the zzso organisms zzso According to our analysis, these species fall into five groups differentiated by the process that makes the key contribution to the zzso zzso
