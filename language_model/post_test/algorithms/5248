Part of understanding a zzso zzso dynamics is mapping out the dominant zzso or long lived, states that it zzso Once identified, the rates for transitioning between these states may then be determined in order to create a complete model of the system's zzso zzso Here we describe the use of the zzso package (now available at zzso to build zzso State Models zzso to identify the zzso states from zzso Ensemble zzso simulations, as well as other simulation zzso Besides building zzso the code also includes tools for model evaluation and zzso
