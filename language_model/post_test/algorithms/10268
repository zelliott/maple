The purpose of this study was to investigate the accuracy of motion tracking and radiation delivery control of integrated gating systems on a zzso zzso zzso The study was performed on a zzso zzso system, which is equipped with zzso zzso zzso Management zzso system, and zzso zzso gating zzso In this study, the two systems were assessed on accuracy of both motion tracking and radiation delivery zzso To evaluate motion zzso two artificial motion profiles and five patients' respiratory profiles were zzso The motion zzso acquired by the two gating systems were compared against the zzso To assess radiation delivery control, time delays were measured using a zzso zzso More specifically, radiation is delivered with a 4 zzso diameter cone within the phase range of zzso for the zzso zzso system, and within the phase range of zzso for the zzso zzso system during zzso each for three zzso zzso films were used to record the radiation zzso and to calculate the time zzso In the work, the discrepancies were zzso using the parameters of mean and standard zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to test correlation of the data, which is zzso using a zzso of zzso The trajectory profiles acquired by the gating systems show good agreement with those reference zzso A quantitative analysis shows that the average mean discrepancies between zzso zzso system and known references are zzso zzso and zzso zzso for artificial and patient profiles, with the maximum motion zzso of zzso zzso As for the zzso zzso system, the corresponding average mean discrepancies are zzso zzso and zzso zzso for artificial and patient zzso With the proposed zzso method, the time delays are found to be zzso zzso zzso seconds and zzso zzso zzso seconds for zzso zzso and zzso zzso systems, zzso The results indicate the systems can track motion and control radiation delivery with reasonable zzso The proposed zzso method has been demonstrated to be feasible in measuring time delay zzso
