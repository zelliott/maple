Due to several limitations of zzso a widely used zzso drug, there is large interest to develop zzso The aim of the presented study was to produce fully synthetic highly zzso zzso zzso For this purpose, a new type of zzso zzso zzso based on zzso zzso was zzso An efficient synthetic approach has been chosen to prepare several zzso zzso with different molecular weights as well as a zzso zzso analogue and to evaluate them for their zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso and the zzso zzso the zzso zzso prolong the activated partial zzso time zzso and zzso time zzso and inhibit both the classical zzso and alternative complement zzso zzso Whereas their zzso activity in the zzso and in the zzso amounts to zzso and zzso respectively, of that of zzso zzso zzso their zzso and zzso zzso activity is zzso and zzso times, respectively, zzso In contrast to zzso zzso the activities are not clearly dependent on the molecular weight, which might be due to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Due to the zzso between zzso complement zzso and inflammation in the zzso of numerous diseases, zzso zzso with both zzso and zzso activities represent promising candidates for the development of potential zzso
