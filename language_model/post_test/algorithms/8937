To date, statistical methods that take into account fully the zzso zzso and zzso aspects of clinical data have not been applied to the study of progression in Parkinson's disease zzso In this paper, we demonstrate the usefulness of such methodology for studying the zzso and spatial aspects of the progression of zzso zzso this methodology further, we also explore the zzso course of this zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were collected on 78 zzso patients, from 4 zzso on each side of the brain, using 3 different zzso zzso zzso zzso random effects zzso was applied to analyze and interpret these zzso 

The data showed a zzso decline in PET zzso which we zzso successfully by an exponential function depending on two zzso zzso duration since symptom onset and age at symptom zzso We found that the degree of damage was significantly greater in the zzso zzso than in the anterior zzso throughout the zzso We also found that over the course of the illness, the difference between the less affected and more affected sides of the brain decreased in the anterior zzso Younger patients had significantly poorer zzso than older patients at the time of symptom onset suggesting more effective zzso mechanisms delaying the onset of zzso zzso zzso showed that disease onset had occurred some 8 to 17 years prior to symptom zzso 

Our model provides important biological insights into the zzso of zzso as well as its zzso zzso Our methodology can be applied widely to study many other chronic progressive zzso
