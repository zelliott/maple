Biological zzso naturally exhibit zzso fluctuations in period and zzso due to the random nature of molecular zzso zzso measuring the precision of noisy zzso and the zzso in period and strength of zzso across a population of cells requires zzso recordings of sufficient length to fully represent the zzso of zzso We found persistent, independent zzso zzso of clock gene expression in zzso zzso recordings of 80 primary zzso cells zzso from zzso mice and kept in zzso for 6 zzso Due to the zzso nature of zzso the proportion of cells appearing rhythmic increases with the length of zzso zzso with zzso of cells found to be rhythmic when using zzso zzso Mean period and zzso are remarkably stable throughout the zzso recordings, with precision improving over zzso For individual cells, precision of period and zzso are correlated with cell size and rhythm zzso but not with period, and period exhibits much less zzso zzso zzso zzso than does zzso zzso zzso The time series are long enough to distinguish zzso fluctuations within each cell from differences among cells, and we conclude that the cells do exhibit significant zzso in period and strength of zzso which we measure using a novel statistical zzso Furthermore, zzso modeling suggests that these zzso clocks operate near a zzso zzso such that intrinsic noise enhances the zzso by minimizing period zzso and sustaining zzso
