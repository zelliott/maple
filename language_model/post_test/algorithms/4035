zzso management of zzso hunting requires managers to set quotas restricting zzso This often takes place in the absence of reliable information on the population size, and as a consequence, quotas are set in an arbitrary fashion, leading to population decline and revenue zzso In this investigation, we show how an indirect measure of abundance can be used to set quotas in a sustainable manner, even in the absence of information on population zzso Focusing on zzso hunting in Africa, we developed a simple zzso to convert changes in the number of safari days required to kill a zzso into a quota for the following zzso This was tested against a simulation model of population zzso accounting for uncertainties in zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed it to reliably set sustainable quotas despite these zzso providing a robust foundation for the conservation of zzso zzso
