First, to compare the distribution of complications and zzso associated with 17 common surgical zzso We then describe the effect of zzso an zzso version of the zzso zzso index, given the possible zzso of zzso and zzso for three common zzso surgical zzso coronary artery bypass surgery, zzso surgery, and hip fracture zzso 

zzso having one of the above procedures between April 1, 1990 and March 31, 1994, identified from Manitoba Health hospital discharge data, and their extracted zzso 

Design was zzso and zzso using Manitoba data on hospital zzso and zzso 

Manitoba hospital discharge abstracts permit identifying whether or not the diagnosis represents an zzso complication of zzso Two data sets were created for each zzso one including complication diagnoses and another with complications zzso 

The degree to which complications contaminated zzso of zzso depended both on the procedures studied and on the zzso zzso The unique structure of the zzso for the zzso zzso index led to complication diagnoses having only a minor effect on the zzso score zzso Unless a data set zzso the opportunity to remove complication diagnoses, the improvement in zzso detection afforded by zzso the zzso index, combined with the potential for zzso of zzso seem sufficiently modest to zzso such zzso
