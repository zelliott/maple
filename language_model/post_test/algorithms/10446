The diversity of species is striking, but can be far exceeded by the chemical diversity of compounds collected, produced or used by zzso Here, we relate the specificity of zzso interactions to chemical diversity applying a comparative network analysis to both zzso Chemical diversity was explored for interactions between tropical zzso bees and plant zzso which bees collect for nest construction and to deter predators and zzso zzso also function as an environmental source for zzso that serve as zzso zzso and protection against predators when accumulated on the zzso body zzso To unravel the origin of the zzso complex chemical profiles, we investigated zzso collection and the processing of zzso zzso We therefore analyzed chemical networks of tree zzso zzso networks of zzso collecting zzso and their acquired chemical zzso We revealed that 113 zzso in nests of six bee species and 83 on their body surfaces comprised a subset of the zzso compounds found in zzso from seven tree zzso zzso were the most variable class of zzso zzso widely present in tree zzso they were only found on the body surface of some species, but entirely lacking in zzso Moreover, whereas the nest profile of zzso zzso contained zzso its surface profile did zzso zzso bees showed a generalized collecting behavior among zzso sources, and only a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso can explain the variation in chemical profiles of nests and body surfaces from different zzso The tight relationship between bees and tree zzso of a large variety of species zzso why the zzso surfaces contain a much higher zzso than other zzso
