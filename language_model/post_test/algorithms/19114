zzso exhibit zzso behavior believed to be related to their metal zzso zzso zzso We investigate the zzso mechanism of several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with iron, the most abundant type of metal zzso in the body, through zzso electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory zzso We find that the most likely zzso site for zzso is the zzso group, followed by zzso group and the zzso zzso (if zzso for all of the zzso molecules zzso Three zzso molecules are required to zzso the bonds of a single zzso zzso by forming six zzso zzso bonds, though the binding energy per zzso is highest for complexes consisting of two zzso molecules and one zzso zzso in agreement with zzso zzso zzso zzso calculated with zzso zzso serve as signatures to identify various zzso For the zzso complexes, we find a zzso of the first zzso peak upon zzso in good agreement with zzso this behavior is explained by the narrowing of the optical gap of zzso because of zzso zzso zzso
