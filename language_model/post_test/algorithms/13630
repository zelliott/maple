zzso zzso of zzso zzso is important for many applications in zzso However, zzso zzso made using conventional zzso zzso echo imaging are hampered by zzso field zzso Several methods for compensation of zzso field zzso have been introduced, most of them requiring increased scan zzso In this paper, an zzso zzso process using a modified zzso zzso echo sequence that includes bipolar compensation zzso and does not require additional data acquisition time is zzso A zzso zzso based on an zzso weighted signal model is zzso The optimal amount of compensation zzso and performance was investigated by zzso simulation and phantom zzso zzso zzso maps were obtained from 11 human volunteers at zzso zzso results demonstrated that this method successfully removes the effects of zzso field zzso of up to zzso zzso within an error range of zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (red zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso using the proposed method, with statistically significant differences compared to conventional method in the regions of the zzso zzso red nucleus, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our proposed scheme allows for fast zzso zzso zzso measurement and includes compensation for the effects of zzso field zzso
