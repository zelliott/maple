The slime mold zzso zzso is one of the model systems of biological pattern zzso One of the most successful answers to the challenge of establishing a spiral wave pattern in a colony of zzso distributed zzso zzso cells has been the suggestion of a zzso path the cells follow zzso and zzso This is a zzso change in properties each cell zzso on a longer time scale than the typical dynamics of the zzso Here we show that this concept leads to an zzso and systematic spatial distribution of spiral waves, which can be predicted from the distribution of cells on the zzso zzso We propose specific experiments for checking whether such zzso are also found in data and thus, zzso provide evidence of a zzso zzso
