A new zzso for zzso the missing data between two adjacent medical images is zzso Our method is useful for solving the zzso of any zzso images of an object to be zzso even when the object is stretched zzso zzso or zzso as often occurs in medical images, which cases can not be handled well by existing zzso When this zzso is applied, the zzso regions of the same object in the two base images are first extracted and zzso by zzso distance code on every zzso in these zzso Then, the outer edges of the zzso regions are shrunk inward simultaneously so that the stretched edges reach the edges of the overlapping regions at the same zzso The distance codes in zzso regions are used to limit the shrinking of these edges in the zzso zzso The proposed method also provides object zzso and enlargement operations to obtain stable and reasonable results in complicated zzso The experimental results show that the proposed method is more efficient in resolving general zzso tasks than the existing methods zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 9, zzso zzso zzso zzso Herman et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 12, zzso zzso zzso Guo et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 19, zzso zzso
