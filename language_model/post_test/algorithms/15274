zzso stabilization is required following zzso or after transitioning to zzso The current research evaluated two available zzso that zzso zzso data to zzso standing following zzso zzso zzso participants began each trial by assuming a zzso forward kneeling posture that ended with an auditory signal prompting transition to zzso Data from two force plates was collected at zzso for 20s starting with the zzso With one algorithm, using windows of various zzso stabilization time was defined as when mean center of pressure zzso zzso of the current window was less than that for the mean of all subsequent zzso This zzso produced significantly different stabilization times zzso depending on the window zzso In a second algorithm, a negative exponential mathematical model was fit to data within each trial zzso This approach was easily implemented and produced results zzso with lower zzso zzso Though approaches exist that adequately determine stabilization times in zzso zzso movements, there are limitations to zzso The negative exponential mathematical model evaluated in this study provides a promising method for systematically determining stabilization times for zzso zzso
