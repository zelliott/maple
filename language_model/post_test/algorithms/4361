zzso changes of proteins are zzso contributed equally with all other zzso essential part of many biological processes such zzso protein zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso dynamics zzso simulations can describe the dynamics of molecules at atomic detail, therefore providing a much higher zzso and spatial resolution than most experimental zzso Although MD simulations have been widely applied to study protein zzso the zzso accessible by conventional MD methods are usually limited to zzso that are orders of magnitude shorter than the zzso changes relevant for most biological zzso During the past decades great effort has been devoted to the development of theoretical methods that may enhance the zzso zzso In recent years, it has been shown that the statistical mechanics framework provided by zzso and zzso zzso State Models zzso can predict long zzso dynamics from a pool of short MD zzso In this chapter we provide the readers an account of the basic theory and selected applications of zzso We will first introduce the general concepts behind zzso and then describe the existing procedures for the construction of zzso This will be followed by the discussions of the challenges of constructing and zzso zzso Finally, we will employ two zzso systems, the zzso zzso and the zzso to illustrate the application of zzso State Models to zzso the molecular mechanisms of complex zzso changes at biologically relevant zzso
