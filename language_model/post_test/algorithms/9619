In zzso fast zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso a set of overlapping zzso with an inconsistent zzso weighting is acquired, which results in an averaged image contrast when employing conventional image reconstruction zzso This work demonstrates that the problem may be overcome with the use of a dedicated reconstruction method that further allows for zzso zzso by zzso the embedded relaxation zzso Thus, the proposed reconstruction method directly yields a zzso and zzso map from only a single zzso data zzso The method is based on an inverse zzso of the problem and involves a modeling of the received zzso zzso Because the solution is found by zzso zzso the approach exploits all data zzso Further, it handles zzso data and zzso allows for the incorporation of additional prior zzso zzso and experimental results for a phantom and human brain in zzso demonstrate that the method yields zzso and zzso maps that are neither affected by the typical artifacts from TE zzso nor by zzso artifacts from the incomplete zzso coverage at individual echo zzso
