zzso dye imaging zzso allows population patterns of cortical activity to be recorded with high zzso resolution, and recent findings ascribe potential significance to these spatial propagation zzso for normal cortical processing and in zzso such as zzso However, analysis of these zzso patterns has been mostly qualitative to zzso In this report, we describe an zzso to zzso fast local flow patterns of cortical population zzso as measured with zzso The zzso uses correlation of zzso features across space, and therefore differs from conventional optical flow zzso which use correlation of spatial features over zzso This alternative approach allows us to take advantage of the characteristics of fast optical imaging data, which have very high zzso resolution but less spatial zzso We verify the method both on artificial and biological data, and demonstrate its zzso
