A computerized scheme to detect clustered zzso in digital zzso has been zzso zzso of individual zzso in regions of interest zzso was also zzso The zzso were previously classified into fatty and dense, according to their breast zzso The most appropriate zzso basis and reconstruction levels were zzso To select the zzso basis, 40 profiles of zzso were zzso and reconstructed using different types of zzso functions and different combinations of zzso zzso The zzso with a basis of length 8 were chosen for fatty zzso For dense zzso the zzso zzso with a zzso basis were zzso Two methods to detect individual zzso were zzso zzso two-dimensional zzso zzso and zzso one-dimensional zzso zzso The second technique yielded the best results, and was used to detect clustered zzso in the complete zzso When detecting individual zzso by using two-dimensional zzso transform we have zzso for fatty zzso a sensitivity of zzso at a false positive rate of zzso per zzso For dense zzso the sensitivity was zzso and the false positive rate, zzso The areas zzso under the zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso The one-dimensional zzso transform method yielded zzso of sensitivity and zzso false zzso per image zzso for fatty zzso and zzso and zzso false zzso per image zzso for dense zzso For the detection of clusters of zzso in the entire zzso the sensitivity was zzso with zzso false zzso per image zzso for fatty zzso and zzso of sensitivity at a false positive detection rate of zzso per image zzso for dense zzso Globally, a sensitivity of zzso at a false positive detection rate of zzso per image was zzso
