zzso of zzso relevant parameters from zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance images involves the tedious and time-consuming manual zzso of the zzso in a large number of zzso To reduce the manual interaction and zzso the zzso analysis, we propose an automatic registration and zzso method for the derivation of zzso linked zzso 

A complete automation was accomplished by first registering zzso images using a method based on independent component analysis, and then using the registered data to automatically segment the zzso with active appearance zzso We used 18 zzso studies zzso images per zzso for validation in which the automatically obtained zzso contours were compared with expert drawn contours on the basis of zzso error, zzso index, and relative zzso zzso in the zzso 

Visual inspection revealed successful zzso in 15 out of 18 zzso zzso of the zzso contours with expert drawn contours yielded zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as zzso error and zzso index, zzso The average difference between manually and automatically obtained relative zzso parameters was found to be statistically insignificant zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the analysis time per slice was reduced from 20 minutes zzso to zzso minutes zzso 

We proposed an automatic method that significantly reduced the time required for analysis of zzso cardiac magnetic resonance zzso zzso The zzso and accuracy of the proposed method were demonstrated by the high spatial correspondence and statistically insignificant difference in zzso zzso when zzso contours were compared with expert drawn zzso
