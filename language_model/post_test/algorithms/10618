This study is intended to construct a useful method for fold recognition, regardless of whether the proteins to be compared are zzso zzso We developed several descendants of our zzso comparison method to make use of known structural information for protein structure zzso Our prediction strategy in zzso is zzso For every zzso target, we derived zzso alignments from several different versions of zzso zzso We then constructed and zzso evaluated zzso models based on those zzso zzso we selected proper zzso among zzso We specifically addressed the validation of our simple approach for protein structure prediction through zzso because the fold recognition results of zzso revealed areas of improvement in the selection of good zzso zzso we applied a more stringent method for zzso model evaluation this zzso All generated models were evaluated based on a structural quality score calculated by both zzso and zzso zzso It turns out that the prediction results of our human group were supported by the results of three zzso The pipeline that we constructed for our human group prediction and human intervention were also greatly effective in improving prediction models, but the efficacy of our scheme for zzso model evaluation was zzso
