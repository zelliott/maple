zzso associated with the outcome of patients treated for prosthetic joint infections zzso due to zzso zzso are not well zzso 

The medical records of patients treated surgically for total hip or knee zzso infection due to zzso zzso were zzso zzso was defined by the absence of local or systemic signs of zzso infection assessed during the most recent contact with the zzso 

After a mean zzso follow-up period of zzso zzso zzso months, 77 zzso of 98 patients were in zzso zzso of the infected implants was not associated with a worse outcome than was their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were not associated with worse outcome, compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identified during revision for failure exhibited no acquired resistance to antibiotics used as definitive therapy, in particular zzso In zzso analysis, parameters that differed between patients whose treatment did or did not fail were: American Society of Anesthesiologists zzso score, prescription of adequate empirical zzso zzso therapy, and use of zzso combination therapy upon discharge from zzso In zzso analysis, zzso score zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso combination therapy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso were 2 independent variables associated with zzso 

The results of the present study suggest that the zzso score significantly affects the outcome of patients treated for total hip and knee prosthetic infections due to zzso or zzso and that zzso combination therapy is associated with a better outcome for these patients when compared with other zzso zzso
