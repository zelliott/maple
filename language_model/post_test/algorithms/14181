To evaluate the effectiveness, predicted visual outcome, and limitations of a zzso zzso zzso that uses zzso aberration measurement alone without the need for zzso shape zzso 

zzso Lens and Visual zzso Laboratory, School of zzso zzso University of Technology, Brisbane, zzso 

zzso topography and zzso error data from 22 eyes of 11 potential zzso surgery candidates were zzso A computer simulation of the zzso zzso was performed, and the predicted zzso visual outcome was assessed by calculating the resulting zzso zzso zzso values and visual zzso zzso Additionally, the effect of zzso alignment error was zzso Finally, the visual outcomes of the zzso zzso zzso were compared to those in an zzso group of 20 zzso zzso 

zzso improvement in total and zzso zzso zzso was achieved zzso in both an ideal setting and in the case of zzso alignment zzso The predicted improvement in visual zzso ratio in the potential zzso surgery candidates was significantly better than that in the zzso zzso After additional simulated zzso of the zzso center by 150 zzso the result was slightly worse, but the change was found to not be significant when compared to the retinal image quality of zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso could potentially lead to significantly better visual outcomes than those normally encountered in zzso zzso provided that the alignment error is not zzso The presented methodology may be used as a screening tool to predict patients' visual outcomes before the zzso
