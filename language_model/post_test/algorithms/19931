Although general zzso is widely used in the surgical arena, the mechanisms by which general zzso act remain zzso We previously described zzso in gene expression ratios in zzso tissue taken from rats treated with zzso zzso it is considered that zzso influence liver zzso Thus, the goal of this study was to use pattern recognition analysis of zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso to zzso changes in liver zzso zzso in response to widely used intravenous zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso were zzso into 13 groups zzso in each group), and each group received one of following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or no zzso zzso zzso The liver was directly removed from rats immediately after or 24 h or 48 h after a zzso period of zzso zzso compounds were extracted from the liver and were analyzed with zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso All spectral data were processed and analyzed by principal component analysis for comparison of zzso zzso 

Data were zzso by plotting principal component zzso zzso In the zzso each point represents an individual zzso Each group was clustered separately on the zzso and the PC scores of the zzso group were clearly distinct from those of the control group and other zzso zzso The difference in PC scores was more pronounced immediately after completion of zzso when compared with 24 or 48 h after completion of zzso Although the effect of intravenous zzso on the liver dissipated over time, the effect of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso exert different effects on liver zzso In particular, liver metabolism was markedly altered after exposure to zzso The effect of zzso on the liver under zzso or zzso resolved rapidly when compared with the effect under zzso or zzso
