zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a leaf zzso program released as an optional item of the zzso planning system zzso zzso Oncology Systems, zzso zzso it is based on the principles of direct zzso zzso where the size, shape, and weight of individual segments are zzso to produce an intensity modulated radiation treatment zzso zzso In this study, we compare zzso to the traditional method of zzso planning, in which intensity maps are zzso prior to conversion into deliverable zzso zzso zzso zzso and we determine if there was any zzso improvement, treatment efficiency gain, or planning advantage provided by the use of zzso Eleven zzso patients treated with zzso had treatment plans generated using each zzso zzso For each patient, the same planning parameters were used for each zzso zzso All calculations were performed using zzso version zzso software and treatments were delivered using a zzso zzso method on a zzso zzso linear accelerator equipped with a zzso Millennium zzso zzso Medical Systems, Palo Alto, zzso Each plan was assessed based on the calculation time, a conformity index, the composite objective value used in the zzso the number of zzso monitor units zzso and treatment zzso The results showed zzso to be superior to the traditional zzso method in all zzso zzso advantages were observed in the zzso quality of zzso plans, which also required zzso less time to zzso zzso fewer zzso and zzso fewer segments than the conventional zzso zzso These reductions translated directly into a zzso decrease in treatment zzso While considerable gains were observed in planning and treatment efficiency, they were specific to our institution, and the impact of direct zzso zzso on plan quality and zzso will be dependent on the planning zzso planning system, and linear zzso used by a particular zzso
