We sought to test the utility of weight gain zzso to predict episodes of worsening heart failure zzso using zzso data collected as part of the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso in 1 day and 5 zzso in 3 zzso and a moving average convergence divergence zzso zzso were zzso zzso was defined as hospitalization for zzso or worsening of zzso or leg zzso Of zzso patients, 45 were hospitalized with zzso and 76 were hospitalized for other zzso On average, weight gain occurred in the 14 days prior to zzso zzso but not in the 14 days prior to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The true alerts rate was higher for the zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso had much higher false alert rates (54 and zzso zzso zzso rendering them of little practical use for predicting zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso is more specific but less sensitive than zzso when trying to predict episodes of zzso based on daily weight zzso However, many episodes of zzso do not appear to be associated with weight gain and therefore zzso of weight alone may not have great value for heart failure zzso
