We describe a set of procedures and zzso which have been developed to provide an efficient and reliable method for reconstructing a three-dimensional density map from specimens with zzso zzso These procedures build on the original zzso zzso processing suite, with extensions principally developed using the zzso image processing zzso zzso is used as a model zzso to demonstrate the utility of this repackaged and expanded set of zzso The time required to complete a three-dimensional map has been reduced from several weeks using traditional manual techniques to a few zzso The increased zzso provided has allowed for the extraction of additional layer lines not previously identified by manual zzso
