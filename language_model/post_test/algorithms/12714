In this contribution, the subtle periodic zzso in butterfly wings and zzso feathers are applied as natural zzso zzso to in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the structure surface via a convenient solution zzso The resulting zzso zzso zzso show typical zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso structures at the zzso which is inherited from the corresponding natural periodic zzso Moreover, their reflection properties are investigated and show dependence on zzso type, structure zzso loading amount, as well as collecting zzso This work suggests that natural periodic zzso could be perfect zzso to construct novel zzso zzso whose zzso band structures are zzso and thus achieve zzso optical zzso Related ideas could inspire the design and synthesis of future zzso zzso
