In the presence of zzso interactions and a significant background zzso both zzso zzso zzso and standard addition are required for successful zzso zzso achieving the zzso zzso This report discusses a modified zzso standard addition method, in which the test data zzso is zzso from the standard addition zzso and zzso proceeds via the classical external zzso zzso It is shown that this novel data processing method allows one to apply not only parallel factor analysis zzso and zzso curve zzso zzso zzso but also the recently introduced and more flexible partial zzso zzso models coupled to residual zzso zzso In particular, the zzso zzso zzso is shown to produce the best zzso zzso The comparison is carried out with the aid of a set of simulated data, as well as two experimental data zzso one aimed at the determination of zzso in human serum in the presence of zzso as an additional zzso and the second one devoted to the analysis of zzso in human serum in the presence of zzso
