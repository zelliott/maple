zzso pair linkage studies are now widely used to investigate the genetic factors implicated in complex quantitative zzso To increase the power of these approaches, it has been proposed to select extremely zzso zzso zzso pairs which are expected to contain the highest linkage zzso However, it is known that zzso of larger size contain more linkage information than independent zzso zzso In this paper we compare, in terms of power and cost considerations, the zzso strategy, which uses information on zzso pairs only, to the recently developed zzso zzso zzso zzso method performed on the whole zzso from which the zzso zzso pairs have been zzso We show that the use of these whole zzso is an efficient alternative to approaches focusing on zzso zzso pairs zzso
