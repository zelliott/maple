zzso drug toxicity zzso considered as a toxic zzso event, with an apparent lack of dose response relationship, is usually not predictable from early zzso of clinical trials, representing a particularly zzso complication in drug zzso zzso a rare event (usually zzso zzso is often life threatening and is one of the major reasons new drugs never reach the market or are withdrawn post zzso zzso zzso like the computer-based approach proposed in the present study, can play an important role in addressing zzso in early drug zzso We report for the first time a systematic evaluation of zzso models to predict idiosyncratic zzso based on linear zzso analysis zzso artificial neural networks zzso and machine learning zzso zzso in conjunction with a zzso molecular structure representation and feature selection zzso These modeling techniques zzso feature selection to prevent zzso and zzso ANN to capture zzso relationships in the data, as well as the simple zzso zzso were found to produce zzso models with satisfactory internal zzso statistics and zzso on an external subset of zzso More specifically, the models reached values of zzso over zzso respectively in the training series along with zzso values ranging from zzso 78 to zzso of correctly classified zzso An zzso zzso analysis was carried out in order to select the levels of the predictor variables needed to trigger the more desirable drug, zzso the drug with lower potential for idiosyncratic zzso Finally, two external test sets were used to evaluate the ability of the models in discriminating toxic from nontoxic structurally and zzso related drugs and the ability of the best model zzso in detecting potential idiosyncratic zzso drugs, zzso The zzso approach proposed here can be considered as a useful tool in early zzso zzso
