We introduce a new method for predicting characteristics of the synchronized state achieved by a wide class of zzso zzso zzso Specifically, we derive a transfer function from the zzso model that provides estimates of the correlation between the drive and response zzso and of the time shift zzso lag or zzso of the synchronized zzso To demonstrate the method, we apply it to a simulated system of coupled zzso zzso as well as to an experimental system of coupled chaotic electronic zzso Finally, we show that the transfer function can be exploited to design novel zzso schemes that significantly improve the correlation and increase the maximum achievable time zzso
