zzso zzso zzso composed of zzso and zzso acid or zzso and zzso were investigated using zzso zzso zzso zzso between membrane components causes significant zzso from the zzso zzso Area, zzso and stability constant values for the complexes were calculated based on the model assuming zzso zzso and the model was validated by comparison of these values to experimental zzso We established that zzso and zzso form highly stable zzso zzso In the case of zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes with zzso other than zzso should be taken into zzso
