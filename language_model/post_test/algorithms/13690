Here we report the resting zzso rate in zzso geese zzso zzso and provide evidence for the significant energetic effect of zzso Under laboratory conditions zzso zzso together with zzso recording of zzso enabled a calculation of how zzso rate varies with zzso Our principal finding is that standing zzso zzso a zzso increase in zzso rate compared to birds sitting on the zzso In addition to the expected decrease in energy consumption of zzso zzso muscles when sitting, we zzso that a change in breathing mechanics represents one potential mechanism for at least part of the observed difference in energetic zzso Due to the significant effect of posture, future studies of resting zzso rates need to take into account and/or report differences in zzso
