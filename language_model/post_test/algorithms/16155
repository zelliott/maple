zzso bees zzso are vitally important zzso of wild plants and agricultural crops zzso zzso zzso however, have suggested population declines in several North American zzso Despite rising concern over these observations in the United States, highlighted in a recent National Academy of Sciences report, a national assessment of the geographic scope and possible zzso factors of zzso bee decline is zzso Here, we report results of a zzso interdisciplinary study of changing zzso population genetic structure, and levels of pathogen infection in zzso bee populations across the United zzso We compare current and historical zzso of eight species, compiling a database of zzso museum records for comparison with data from intensive nationwide surveys of zzso zzso We show that the relative zzso of four species have declined by up to zzso and that their surveyed geographic ranges have contracted by zzso some within the last 20 zzso We also show that declining populations have significantly higher infection levels of the zzso pathogen zzso zzso and lower genetic diversity compared with zzso populations of the stable zzso zzso Higher pathogen prevalence and reduced genetic diversity are, thus, realistic zzso of these alarming patterns of decline in North America, although cause and effect remain zzso
