The frequency of automated zzso blood pressure zzso zzso during routine zzso is a balance between potentially deleterious effects of frequent cycling and a delay in detecting changes caused by a long cycle zzso A computer model generated zzso blood pressures that changed to a new, random value after a period of zzso We sampled these data at intervals between 1 and 10 zzso to simulate zzso zzso A separate algorithm, based on zzso Tracking zzso indicated when a change had been zzso For each set of zzso the simulation was repeated 1000 times, and the average time to detect a change was zzso The mean time to detect a change was zzso zzso with a zzso cycle, zzso zzso with a zzso cycle, zzso zzso with a zzso cycle, and zzso zzso with a zzso zzso As the cycle time increased, the delay in detecting changes increased but only by approximately half the increase in the cycle zzso The optimum variables for the trend detection zzso also changed as the zzso zzso zzso zzso that abrupt changes in blood pressure are not anticipated, a zzso or zzso cycle time for zzso offers little advantage over a longer zzso 

We used a computer model to study the effect of increasing zzso blood pressure zzso sampling zzso on the detection of blood pressure zzso The detection time increased only 50% of the increase in the sampling zzso This information may help zzso zzso intervals in different zzso
