The purpose of this study was to perform texture analysis of high-resolution CT images obtained from human zzso specimens and to correlate these parameters with the zzso stability of the zzso In addition, structure data were compared with bone mineral density zzso assessed by quantitative CT zzso 

zzso CT images and standard zzso sections were obtained in 36 zzso motion zzso each consisting of two zzso with intact ligaments and zzso zzso The zzso structure in the CT images was assessed using three texture analysis zzso zzso threshold area ratio zzso zzso dimension without zzso zzso and zzso dimension with zzso zzso Finally, the maximum zzso strength zzso was determined using a zzso testing zzso 

A correlation of r zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was obtained for zzso versus zzso of r zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for ITS versus zzso and of r zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso versus zzso while r zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found for zzso versus zzso Best results were obtained by combining structure measures and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

This in zzso study showed a significant correlation between structure measures and zzso strength, which was comparable to zzso and zzso However, best correlations were obtained by combining both zzso Using both zzso and structure measures therefore may improve the prediction of zzso determined bone zzso
