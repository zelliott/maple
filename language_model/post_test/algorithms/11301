zzso interacting zzso such as synergistic drugs pairs or synthetic lethal gene pairs, are of key interest in both pharmacology and functional zzso However, to find such pairs by traditional screening methods is both time consuming and zzso We present a novel zzso framework for efficient identification of synergistic target pairs, zzso for screening of systems with sizes on the order of current drug, small zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso libraries zzso zzso This framework exploits the fact that the response of a drug pair in a given system, or a pair of zzso propensity to interact zzso can be partly predicted by zzso means from zzso a small set of zzso determined target pairs, and zzso pre-existing data zzso gene zzso zzso on the similarities between zzso zzso are obtained by a novel zzso zzso technique, based on cyclical projections onto convex zzso We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method using zzso interaction data from seven cancer cell lines and zzso interaction data from zzso zzso zzso Our protocol increases the rate of zzso discovery significantly over traditional zzso by up to zzso Our method is easy to implement and could be applied to accelerate pair screening for both animal and microbial zzso
