Large amount of zzso genetic variation data are being collected in zzso One potentially important biological problem is to zzso the population zzso history from these genetic variation zzso Partly due to zzso zzso history of a set of DNA sequences in a population usually cannot be represented by a single zzso Instead, zzso is better represented by a zzso network, which is a compact representation of a set of correlated local zzso trees, each for a short region of zzso and possibly with different zzso zzso of zzso history for a set of DNA sequences under zzso has many potential applications, including association mapping of complex zzso In this paper, we present two new methods for reconstructing local tree zzso with the presence of zzso which extend and improve the previous work zzso We first show that the zzso zzso method can be converted to a zzso zzso method based on a hidden zzso zzso We then focus on developing a novel local tree zzso method called zzso that is both accurate and zzso to larger zzso Through zzso we demonstrate the usefulness of our methods by showing that the zzso method is comparable with the original method in terms of zzso We also show that zzso is competitive with other methods in terms of zzso zzso and its zzso error rate is often lower and can handle large zzso
