We describe an zzso time resolved zzso zzso setup aimed at studying the switching of zzso zzso Both zzso pump and probe zzso can be independently tuned over broad frequency range between zzso and zzso zzso A broad pump scan range allows a large optical penetration depth, while a broad probe scan range is crucial to study strongly zzso zzso A new data acquisition method allows for sensitive zzso zzso and zzso for fluctuations in probe intensity and pump stray zzso We observe a tenfold improvement of the precision of the setup compared to laser zzso allowing a measurement accuracy of better than zzso in a 1 s measurement zzso zzso of the improved technique are presented for a bulk zzso zzso a three-dimensional zzso inverse zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the infrared wavelength zzso
