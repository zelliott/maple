This paper investigates the different approaches that best retrieve band shape parameters and kinetic time zzso from series of protein zzso transform infrared zzso zzso recorded in the course of zzso zzso In this first approach, synthetic zzso were zzso It is shown that zzso exchange kinetic zzso can help resolve spectral features otherwise hidden because of the overlap of various spectral zzso We evaluated the efficiency of zzso zzso zzso zzso difference zzso principal component analysis, inverse zzso zzso and determination of the underlying zzso by global analysis assuming zzso zzso with either known or unknown time zzso It is demonstrated that some strategies allow the extraction of both the time dependence and the spectral shape of the underlying zzso
