zzso sleep zzso syndrome zzso is characterized by repeated breathing pauses caused by upper airway collapse during sleep, leading to intermittent zzso sleep fragmentation and zzso zzso The gold standard for the treatment of zzso is ventilation with continuous positive airway pressure zzso 

To study the effect of zzso on zzso dysfunction in patients zzso by assessing the heart rate zzso zzso parameters before the initiation of zzso and under zzso during the first week and at 3 zzso 

We have assessed zzso zzso by 24 hours zzso zzso monitoring in 42 patients with moderate and severe zzso zzso index zzso zzso or zzso zzso without other causes of zzso zzso The assessment was made at diagnosis, during the first week of zzso use and at 3 months of zzso zzso zzso Both time domain and frequency domain zzso parameters decreased significantly during the first week of zzso use and increased back to normal values at 3 zzso zzso and during the first week of treatment, zzso parameters correlated zzso with the severity of zzso expressed by zzso 

Patients with zzso present an zzso of zzso zzso with disease zzso The decrease in zzso is revealed by the absence of zzso during the initiation of zzso After 3 months of zzso treatment, the zzso zzso are zzso independently of the disease zzso
