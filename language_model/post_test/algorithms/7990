This work presents the design and practical zzso of a control strategy for the operation of a sequencing batch reactor with a submerged zzso The zzso is used for treating wastewater that is zzso for sufficiently high zzso The strategy combines the use of a robust feeding strategy to ensure zzso near an optimal unknown concentration value, using only the dissolved oxygen concentration as feedback zzso and a strategy to minimize membrane zzso based on flux and zzso pressure zzso during zzso The strategy was tested on a 10 L laboratory zzso treating synthetic wastewater containing zzso as zzso model compound and sole source of zzso Experimental results show the zzso of the proposed zzso
