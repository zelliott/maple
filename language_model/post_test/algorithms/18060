zzso comparative analysis has yielded important insights into the molecular details of gene zzso We have developed zzso a zzso zzso tool that provides a single uninterrupted view of zzso sequences as they appear in a species of zzso An zzso reveals with near zzso resolution those sequences that are essential for gene zzso 

We describe here zzso a zzso comparative zzso tool that automatically generates from a single input sequence an enhanced view of sequence conservation between zzso distant zzso Currently available for 5 zzso 3 zzso 12 zzso 20 zzso 17 zzso and 20 enteric bacteria zzso zzso employs a modified zzso zzso zzso zzso which detects up to zzso more zzso bases than identified by the zzso alignments used in the earlier zzso zzso The new program also identifies zzso sequences within rearranged DNA, highlights repetitive DNA, and detects sequencing zzso zzso currently holds over 112 billion zzso of zzso zzso in memory and has the flexibility of selecting a subset of zzso for zzso An zzso profile is also generated to portray zzso sequences that are uniquely lost in any one of the zzso Finally, zzso incorporates options that allow for zzso zzso of the analysis using a different zzso aligning region as the reference DNA to detect zzso changes in zzso regions, zzso rapid extraction and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso for bacteria, identifies unique or uniquely shared sequences present in zzso of zzso 

zzso is a fast, high-resolution comparative zzso tool that automatically generates an uninterrupted zzso view of sequence conservation and enables the discovery of zzso sequences within rearranged zzso When combined with zzso a program that discovers sequence elements shared among tissue specific zzso zzso zzso the analysis of zzso sequences that are essential for coordinate gene zzso
