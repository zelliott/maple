The zzso zzso function is shown to be an accurate representation of the form of the zzso anterior teeth from the zzso zzso contact on one side around the perimeter to the opposite side zzso zzso zzso On the basis of this mathematical function, the changes in canine zzso anterior segment depth, arch zzso and their related zzso angular zzso are zzso This knowledge will allow the zzso to predict the effects on various aspects of the anterior segment arch form as one or more of these variables are altered without resorting to trial and error or performing a zzso For example, the zzso can predict the change in the anterior segment arch depth and zzso zzso that would occur with zzso in canine zzso
