We present an unusual method for zzso zzso force fields of the type used for protein structure zzso Force field parameters were determined by assigning each a fictitious mass and using a zzso dynamics zzso in zzso zzso The zzso term favored folded native structures and specifically penalized folded zzso zzso The force field was generated after zzso less than 70 adjustable zzso but shows a strong ability to discriminate between native structures and compact zzso zzso The functional form of the force field was chosen as in molecular mechanics and is not zzso It is continuous with continuous derivatives and is thus suitable for use with zzso such as energy zzso or zzso zzso
