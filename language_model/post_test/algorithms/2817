Analysis of zzso zzso allows evaluation of the patterns of zzso enhancement before and after zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of zzso zzso in monitoring zzso therapy of focal zzso zzso 

Twenty patients underwent zzso therapy with either zzso zzso zzso or zzso ethanol zzso zzso power zzso ultrasound with analysis of zzso zzso was performed one day before and one day after zzso zzso biopsy was then obtained to confirm the imaging zzso 

Before treatment, all zzso showed zzso zzso zzso by high zzso of signal intensity and zzso Complete zzso zzso confirmed by targeted zzso was observed in patients showing no zzso flow signals and zzso zzso with low peak of signal intensity and absence of plateau after zzso zzso confirmed the presence of residual zzso tissue in one patient exhibiting zzso zzso absence of zzso flow signals, and a zzso curve with high peak of signal intensity and zzso 

According to our findings, zzso zzso zzso by high peak of signal intensity and plateau might reflect the presence of zzso or zzso zzso tissue and provide important information on the effectiveness of the zzso
