In this contribution, a medical software system for zzso analysis of different cerebral zzso in magnetic resonance imaging zzso data is zzso The software system is based on a zzso zzso zzso and helps to overcome the time-consuming process of volume determination during monitoring of a zzso After imaging, the zzso zzso a seed zzso set up in the system and an automatic zzso is performed by a novel zzso zzso zzso reviewing the result leads to zzso adding seed points or an automatic surface mesh zzso The mesh is saved for monitoring the patient and for comparisons with follow-up zzso Based on the mesh, the system performs a zzso and volume zzso which leads to diagnosis and therefore further treatment zzso The overall system has been tested with different cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso and cerebral zzso and evaluated against manual expert zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso have been performed to provide a quality measure for the presented zzso
