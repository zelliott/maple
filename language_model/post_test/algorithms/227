We evaluated an zzso for automatic selection of the cardiac phase with the least motion for image reconstruction at coronary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We analyzed data of 100 patients zzso female, mean age 59 zzso who had undergone zzso zzso zzso Two experienced observers visually identified the most suitable zzso and zzso zzso using a series of image reconstructions in zzso increments across the zzso zzso The same data were then reconstructed using an automatic phase finding zzso based on a zzso weighting function of cardiac zzso On average, the zzso determined the most suitable zzso reconstruction phase at zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso by the human observers zzso zzso zzso The most suitable zzso phase was found at zzso zzso zzso zzso by the automatic algorithm, compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso by the observers zzso zzso zzso No statistically significant difference was found between automatically and visually determined reconstruction zzso regarding motion and zzso artifacts in either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, there appears to be no relevant difference between an automatic phase finding zzso and visual selection by experienced observers for determining the phase with the least cardiac motion for zzso image zzso The use of automatic phase finding may therefore facilitate the performance of cardiac CT and reduce human zzso
