Physical activity zzso and energy expenditure zzso in children are frequently assessed using portable activity zzso zzso used to predict zzso by these monitors are often based on adult populations and may not be accurate for zzso 

To evaluate the accuracy of the zzso Pro zzso zzso for assessing zzso in African American children during treadmill exercise, sedentary activities, rest, sleep, and total zzso zzso using indirect room zzso zzso as a reference zzso 

Participants were healthy African American children (10 boys, 11 zzso age: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured simultaneously using zzso and zzso during a zzso stay in the zzso Recorded activities included sedentary behaviors, treadmill exercise, rest zzso and zzso zzso from both methods were matched zzso and compared by zzso zzso Multiple linear zzso analysis was used to describe the relationship between zzso assessed by both methods and children's descriptive zzso 

zzso overestimated zzso compared with zzso during all activities and time zzso ranging from zzso during sleep to zzso during rest after treadmill zzso The zzso zzso was improved by using linear zzso zzso zzso equations for sedentary activities and treadmill exercise were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso body weight zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso body weight zzso zzso The prediction equation for zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso body weight zzso 

zzso estimated using zzso was significantly higher than zzso measured using zzso in African American children ages 10-14 zzso zzso in individual zzso estimated using zzso could be improved by an adjustment for the body weight of a zzso The zzso manufacturer should work with researchers on improving existing zzso for zzso
