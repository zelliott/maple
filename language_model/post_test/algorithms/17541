In this paper we make a rigorous mathematical analysis of one-dimensional zzso zzso models in a unified zzso We find that, under conditions satisfied in particular by the periodically and zzso driven leaky zzso as well as some of its zzso the spike map is increasing on its range, which leaves no room for chaotic zzso A rigorous expression of the zzso zzso is zzso Finally, we zzso the periodically driven perfect zzso and show that the restriction of the phase map to its range is always zzso to a zzso and we provide an explicit expression of the zzso zzso
