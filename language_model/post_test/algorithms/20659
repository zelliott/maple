zzso zzso is a theory of zzso developed by Gerald Edelman along with George zzso and Olaf zzso at Rockefeller zzso As its name suggests, neural zzso is modeled after biological zzso and its authors assert that the two processes are strongly zzso both operate on variation in a population, amplifying the more zzso zzso However, from a zzso perspective, neural zzso is quite different from other models of natural selection, such as genetic zzso The individuals of neural zzso do not zzso thus robbing the process of the capacity to explore new solutions over time and ultimately reducing it to a random zzso Because neural zzso does not have the zzso power of a truly zzso process, it is misleading to label it as zzso to illustrate this disparity in zzso power, one of zzso early computer experiments, Darwin I, is revisited, and it is shown that adding replication greatly improves the zzso power of the zzso
