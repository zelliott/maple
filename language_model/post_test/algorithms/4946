In this paper, we investigate material zzso from single images obtained under unknown viewpoint and zzso It is demonstrated that materials can be classified using the joint distribution of intensity values over extremely compact neighborhoods zzso from as small as 3 zzso 3 zzso zzso and that this can outperform zzso using filter banks with large zzso It is also shown that the performance of filter banks is inferior to that of image patches with equivalent zzso We develop novel zzso representations which are suited to modeling this joint neighborhood distribution for zzso random zzso The representations are learned from training images and then used to zzso novel images (with unknown viewpoint and zzso into texture zzso Three such representations are proposed and their performance is assessed and compared to that of filter zzso The power of the method is demonstrated by zzso zzso images of all 61 materials present in the zzso zzso The zzso performance zzso that of recent state-of-the-art filter zzso zzso such as zzso and Malik zzso zzso zzso and Dana zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso We also benchmark performance by zzso all of the textures present in the zzso Microsoft Textile, and San Francisco outdoor data zzso We conclude with discussions on why features based on compact neighborhoods can correctly discriminate between textures with large global structure and why the performance of filter banks is not superior to that of the source image patches from which they were zzso
