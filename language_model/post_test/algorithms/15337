The management of zzso zzso after total zzso zzso is a challenge as zzso is zzso into a zzso zzso zzso of zzso hormone zzso level after zzso may allow for prediction of zzso HC and lead to shorter hospital zzso A prospective database was zzso between January 2010 and June 2012 with 95 patients who had undergone zzso zzso Patient zzso zzso zzso laboratory values and zzso zzso intravenous calcium zzso and length of stay zzso were zzso A zzso zzso was zzso applied and theoretical cost savings were analyzed in terms of laboratory cost, zzso and total zzso zzso patients underwent zzso 37 patients zzso had cancer, whereas 27 zzso had zzso disease and the remaining 31 zzso had a benign zzso zzso zzso zzso was recorded in 72 patients zzso 46 zzso had zzso greater than 10 zzso and 26 zzso had zzso less than 10 zzso zzso HC occurred in 10 patients zzso with zzso less than 10 zzso zzso risk, zzso P zzso zzso Patients with zzso less than 10 zzso incurred a zzso per cent higher hospital cost compared with those with zzso greater than 10 zzso With retrospective zzso of the algorithm, there is a potential zzso per cent cost savings for the zzso less than 10 zzso group, zzso per cent savings for the zzso greater than 10 zzso group, and zzso per cent savings when taken zzso zzso risk zzso based on zzso zzso less than 10 zzso serves as both a sensitive zzso and specific zzso predictor of zzso zzso Such risk zzso may allow for zzso discharge in a number of patients, and even in patients requiring an overnight stay, result in cost savings as a result of a reduction in laboratory zzso
