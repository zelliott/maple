zzso treatment of zzso or zzso targets demands accurate positioning of the zzso at the beam and table zzso and zzso of the target during zzso For spinal zzso the standard approach involves matching of zzso CT zzso zzso images with the planning CT zzso to determine translation and zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of these techniques compared to advanced zzso using mutual information zzso with consideration given to volume of interest zzso and zzso translations and zzso in all zzso The zzso consequences of our current standard matching techniques were also zzso Ten consecutive spinal zzso patients treated in the last year were subjected to zzso For purposes of this analysis, the zzso using mutual information and a zzso was considered to create zzso true zzso for positioning the zzso Review of the imaging from this zzso confirmed perfect zzso of the two zzso within the zzso zzso the zzso to the zzso using the zzso allowed assessment of the zzso which had been previously zzso zzso of the dose volume zzso was undertaken for each patient, assuming displacement of the true zzso to the treated zzso Comparisons between the delivered doses and the intended doses were zzso The mean absolute zzso translations and zzso displacement between the manual zzso matching zzso and the true zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso with a minimum and maximum individual zzso zzso shift of zzso and zzso zzso The mean pitch, zzso and roll correction for zzso was zzso zzso and zzso with a maximum of zzso zzso and zzso Four of ten patients had a significant change in the coverage of the tumor due to lack of correction of zzso and zzso zzso The largest errors were observed in patients with small and irregular target zzso Our initial results show that precise positioning for spinal zzso cannot be accomplished with manual zzso matching without a clinical strategy to compensate for zzso In the absence of this, significant zzso of the tumor may zzso
