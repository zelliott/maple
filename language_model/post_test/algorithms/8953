Although the majority of bacteria are harmless or even beneficial to their host, others are highly virulent and can cause serious diseases, and even zzso Due to the constantly decreasing cost of zzso sequencing there are now many completely zzso zzso available from both human zzso and innocuous zzso The data can be used to identify gene families that correlate with zzso and to develop tools to predict the zzso of newly zzso zzso investigations that previously were mainly done by means of more expensive and time consuming experimental zzso We describe zzso zzso a zzso for the prediction of bacterial zzso by zzso the input zzso zzso or raw reads provided by the zzso The method relies on groups of zzso created without regard to their zzso function or known involvement in zzso The method has been built to work with all zzso groups of bacteria and using the entire zzso achieved an accuracy of zzso on an independent zzso by correctly zzso 398 out of 449 completely zzso zzso The approach here proposed is not biased on sets of genes known to be associated with zzso thus the approach could aid the discovery of novel zzso zzso zzso the zzso prediction zzso could be used to isolate the potential zzso features of both known and unknown zzso
