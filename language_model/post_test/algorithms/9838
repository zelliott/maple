zzso zzso wave zzso zzso explores the zzso domain, providing information on functional chemical groups represented in the zzso Our goal is to evaluate whether spectral fingerprints obtained by zzso might zzso clinical zzso zzso samples from normal volunteers and from four groups of patients with zzso abnormalities are analyzed by zzso These groups consist of iron overloaded genetic zzso zzso iron depleted zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A partial least squares zzso zzso method is used in a training group to create a zzso algorithm, thereafter applied to a test zzso Patients with zzso or zzso two groups exhibiting important zzso zzso are clearly zzso from control groups with zzso values of zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso When pooling all groups, the zzso method contributes to discriminate controls, zzso and zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso profiling using infrared zzso is a possible way to investigate zzso zzso in zzso
