Previous time domain zzso methods have been tackled by sequential one point at a time zzso selection strategies running in approximately zzso or all points at a time optimal strategies running in approximately zzso zzso zzso Yet basically, the selected dominant points zzso are locally only significant in these methods, which may lead to inaccurate reconstruction or even loss of clinical zzso zzso the zzso one point at a time selection strategy, through different zzso of the zzso line zzso algorithm, zzso globally significant zzso for an approximately zzso zzso zzso We illustrate that the zzso strategy performs zzso almost two times better than the sequential zzso The zzso linear approximation of the input zzso is formally expressed as a curve zzso problem, through reduction of the zzso error zzso We also illustrate that reduction of two error measures performs better than reduction of one error zzso An additional zzso option is proposed in the case of the zzso strategy through zzso of the sorted distances associated to the selected set of zzso The outcome is a zzso zzso that yields zzso ratios ranging from zzso to zzso for a zzso good reconstruction quality and near linear execution zzso The tests have been conducted on the zzso public zzso zzso zzso show that the proposed zzso zzso is an excellent compromise on zzso ratio - zzso time - reconstruction zzso
