zzso the amount of information stored in diffusion zzso zzso data to a set of meaningful and representative zzso values is a goal of much interest in medical zzso Such features can have far reaching applications in zzso zzso and statistical characterization of regions of interest in the brain, as in comparing features between control and diseased zzso Currently, however, the number of biologically relevant features in zzso is very zzso Moreover, existing features discard much of the information inherent in zzso and embody several theoretical zzso This paper proposes a new family of rotation zzso zzso features for zzso based on the zzso harmonic zzso representation of high angular resolution diffusion images zzso These features describe the shape of the orientation distribution function extracted from zzso data and are zzso to any reconstruction method that represents zzso signals in terms of an zzso zzso We further illustrate their significance in white matter characterization of zzso phantom and real zzso brain zzso
