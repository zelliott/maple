A zzso zzso is proposed for which an array of zzso zzso is pierced into a metallic foil whose one flat surface has been made with periodic rectangle holes of finite zzso Designed surface zzso sustained by the holes are explored when the size and spacing of the holes are much smaller than those of the zzso The transmission property of electromagnetic waves through the zzso is zzso zzso show that the designed surface zzso characterized by the holes could support the transmission zzso of the incident wave passing through the zzso zzso and that the peak transmission zzso could be designed by controlling the geometrical and optical parameters of the zzso zzso is taken at zzso zzso Our work proposes a method to design the peak zzso and may affect further engineering of surface zzso zzso especially in zzso to zzso zzso
