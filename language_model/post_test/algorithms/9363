zzso zzso is a major separating technique for proteins in zzso zzso of gel images is critical for zzso or even more difficult zzso gel zzso In the paper, we propose a novel zzso closest point zzso method for zzso zzso image zzso The paper seeks to introduce an information zzso measure as one part of distance metric to gel image zzso We combine intensity information of spots with geometric information of landmarks by applying information potential zzso The proposed method has been applied to both synthetic and real gel images accessible in public zzso gel protein zzso The high accuracy and zzso of the zzso indicate that it is promising for gel image zzso
