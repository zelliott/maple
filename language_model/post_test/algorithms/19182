The paper presents a zzso efficient zzso image registration zzso for automatic zzso validation in zzso The novel aspects of the zzso include zzso a hybrid cost function based on partial digitally reconstructed zzso zzso generated along projected anatomical contours and a level set term for similarity zzso and zzso a fast search method based on zzso fitting and zzso search zzso Using CT and zzso zzso images from a skull and a pelvis zzso the proposed zzso is compared with the conventional zzso full zzso based registration zzso Not only is the zzso shown to be zzso more efficient with registration time being reduced by a factor of 8, but also the zzso is shown to offer 50% higher capture range allowing the initial patient displacement up to 15 zzso zzso by mean target registration zzso For the simulated data, high registration accuracy with average errors of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for translation and zzso zzso zzso degrees for rotation within the capture range has been zzso For the tested phantom data, the zzso has also shown to be robust without being affected by artificial markers in the zzso
