The retinal image of visual objects can vary drastically with changes of viewing zzso Nevertheless, our visual system is capable of recognizing objects fairly zzso of viewing zzso Under natural viewing conditions, different views of the same object tend to occur in zzso zzso thereby generating zzso correlations in the sequence of retinal zzso Such spatial and zzso stimulus correlations can be exploited for learning zzso zzso We propose a biologically plausible mechanism that zzso this learning strategy using the principle of zzso zzso We developed a network of zzso zzso that uses zzso correlations in the zzso to map different views of objects onto a zzso zzso After learning, different views of the same object are represented in a connected neighborhood of zzso Model zzso of a higher processing area that receive unspecific input from a local neighborhood in the map show zzso zzso for visual zzso The findings suggest a functional relevance of cortical zzso zzso
