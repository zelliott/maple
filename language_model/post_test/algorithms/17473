The assignment of bone tissue material properties is a fundamental step in the generation of zzso finite element models from zzso zzso zzso zzso of the present work is to investigate the influence of the material mapping zzso on the results predicted by the finite element zzso Two models, a coarse and a refined one, of a human zzso zzso and zzso were generated from CT data and used for the zzso In addition a convergence analysis was carried out for the zzso model, using six refinement levels, to verify whether the inclusion of the material properties would significantly alter the convergence zzso of the zzso The results showed that the choice of the mapping zzso influences the material zzso However, this did not always zzso into the finite element zzso The difference between the maximum Von zzso stress remained always lower than zzso apart one case when it reached the zzso However, the global zzso of the zzso showed more marked differences between the two zzso in the finer zzso of the two long bones zzso of the bone volume showed differences in the predicted Von zzso stresses greater than zzso The convergence zzso of the model was not worsened by the introduction of zzso material zzso The software was made available in the public zzso
