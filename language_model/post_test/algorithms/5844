This paper proposes an alternative approach to zzso zzso in zzso In particular, the dynamic model for the tumor or zzso will be subjected to a lower elastic boundary at which the process either will be absorbed or zzso The likelihood of reflection then can be interpreted as the probability of zzso This framework will be exemplified for zzso cancer by extending the recently proposed zzso model of zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso model for zzso zzso levels, zzso zzso 190 zzso zzso that zzso on the dynamics of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results for the conditional density function, given a zzso lower boundary, are obtained for the extreme cases of certain cure and of certain zzso zzso illustrate the relevance of the zzso probability and of the normal value of the zzso for the design of treatment zzso The paper thus points to two additional zzso characteristics that might enter treatment design and monitoring of progress in zzso
