This article addresses the topic of zzso logical rules from data by means of artificial neural zzso The approach based on zzso linear neural networks is revisited, which has already been used for the extraction of zzso rules in the past, and it is shown that this approach can be important also for the extraction of fuzzy zzso Two important theoretical properties of zzso neural networks are proved, allowing an zzso of the basic ideas of the approach into several zzso of an zzso for the extraction of zzso zzso That zzso has already been used in two real-world zzso Finally, a connection to the extraction of rules of the zzso logic is established, relying on recent results about rational zzso zzso Based on one of the constructive zzso of the zzso zzso an zzso is formulated that in principle allows zzso a particular kind of formulas of the zzso zzso logic from zzso neural networks trained with rational zzso
