We propose new models and methods for zzso zzso optimal video delivery over zzso when packets with bit errors are also zzso In particular, we propose zzso optimal methods for slicing and unequal error protection zzso of packets over zzso allowing transmission of packets with bit zzso The proposed framework can be employed in a classical zzso transport model for optimal zzso as well as in a zzso transport model for optimal slicing and zzso where the forward error correction zzso coding is performed at the link layer, but the application controls the zzso code rate with the constraint that a given zzso packet is subject to constant channel zzso The proposed method uses a novel dynamic programming approach to determine the optimal slicing and zzso zzso for each video frame in a practical manner, that is zzso with the zzso zzso We also propose new rate and distortion zzso techniques at the zzso side in order to efficiently evaluate the objective function for a slice zzso The zzso zzso option effectively determines which regions of a frame should be protected better; zzso it can be considered as a spatial zzso zzso We successfully zzso by means of experimental results, that each component of the proposed system provides significant gains, up to zzso zzso compared to competitive zzso
