This paper outlines some of the current uses of three-dimensional techniques in medical imaging applications and their potential for the zzso As an example, three-dimensional imaging is described using a CT zzso as it applies to a case involving zzso zzso This includes defining the relationship between the requirements on the data acquisition system, as well as the zzso of the hardware and software for the zzso A currently used zzso is described for the display of surfaces as a function of local position, orientation of the surface and the position of a virtual light zzso This includes the use of transparency and cut plane zzso techniques, in addition to the display of the zzso A speculation is made regarding the use of a three-dimensional display as the standard viewing mode in CT, with slice and zzso imaging as zzso
