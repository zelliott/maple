The interaction of light with multiple red blood cells was systematically investigated by the zzso zzso method zzso The simulations showed that the lateral multiple scattering between red blood cells is very weak and that the polarization has an almost insignificant influence on the distribution of the scattered zzso The zzso results of the zzso method were compared with the results from the zzso approximation and the discrete zzso approximation zzso The agreement with the zzso was zzso
