To derive and validate a new clinical risk prediction zzso zzso zzso to estimate individual patients' risk of zzso zzso 

Prospective open cohort study using routinely collected data from general zzso Cox zzso hazards models used in derivation cohort to derive risk equations evaluated at 1 and 5 zzso zzso of zzso and discrimination undertaken in validation zzso 

zzso general practices in England and Wales contributing to the zzso zzso 

Patients aged zzso years, with no record of pregnancy in the preceding 12 months or any previous zzso zzso and not prescribed oral zzso at zzso zzso in derivation cohort and zzso in validation zzso Outcomes zzso cases of zzso zzso either deep vein zzso or pulmonary zzso recorded in primary care records or linked cause of death zzso 

The derivation cohort included zzso incident cases of zzso zzso from zzso person years of observation zzso of zzso per 10,000 person zzso The validation cohort included zzso incident cases from zzso person years of observation zzso per 10,000 person zzso Independent zzso included in the final model for men and women were age, body mass index, smoking status, zzso zzso zzso cardiac failure, chronic zzso disease, cancer, chronic zzso pulmonary disease, inflammatory zzso disease, hospital admission in past six months, and current prescriptions for antipsychotic zzso We also included oral zzso zzso and hormone replacement therapy in the final model for zzso The risk prediction equation explained zzso of the variation in women and zzso in men in the validation cohort evaluated at 5 years The D statistic was zzso for women and zzso for zzso The receiver operating curve statistic was zzso for both zzso The model was well zzso 

We have developed and validated a new risk prediction model that zzso absolute risk of zzso at 1 and 5 zzso It can help identify patients at high risk of zzso zzso for zzso The zzso is based on simple clinical variables which the patient is likely to know or which are routinely recorded in general practice zzso The zzso could be integrated into general practice clinical computer systems and used to risk assess patients before hospital admission or starting medication which might increase the risk of zzso zzso
