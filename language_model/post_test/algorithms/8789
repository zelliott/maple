One of the challenging tasks for magnetic resonance zzso image analysis is to remove the intensity zzso artifact present in MR images, which often degrades the performance of an automatic image analysis zzso In this regard, the paper presents a novel approach for bias field correction in MR zzso It judiciously zzso the merits of rough sets and zzso zzso While the zzso mean is used in zzso averaging filter to estimate the bias field in zzso model, the concept of lower approximation and boundary region of rough sets deals with zzso and incompleteness in filter structure zzso A theoretical analysis is presented to justify the use of both rough sets and zzso mean for bias field zzso The integration enables the zzso to estimate optimum or near optimum bias zzso Some new quantitative indexes are introduced to measure intensity zzso artifact present in a MR zzso The performance of the proposed approach, along with a comparison with other approaches, is demonstrated on both simulated and real MR images for different bias fields and noise zzso
