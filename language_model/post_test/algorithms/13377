Large amounts of data are being generated by zzso zzso sequencing zzso But the rate of the experimental functional characterization falls far zzso To fill the gap between the number of sequences and their zzso fast and accurate automated zzso methods are zzso Many methods, such as zzso zzso and zzso are designed based on the zzso zzso Unfortunately, the sequence coverage of these methods is low as they cannot detect the remote zzso Adding to this, the lack of zzso specificity advocates the need to improve automated protein function zzso 

We designed a novel automated protein functional assignment method based on the neural response algorithm, which simulates the zzso behavior of the visual zzso in the human zzso zzso we predict the most similar target protein for a given query protein and thereby assign its GO term to the query zzso When assessed on test set, our method ranked the actual leaf GO term among the top 5 probable GO terms with accuracy of zzso 

The proposed zzso is the first instance of neural response zzso being used in the biological zzso The use of zzso profiles along with the secondary structure information to define the neural response gives our method an edge over other available methods on zzso zzso zzso of the zzso cross validation and the comparison with zzso and zzso servers indicate the prominent performance by our zzso The program, the zzso and help files are available at zzso
