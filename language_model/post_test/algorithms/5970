Our objective was to investigate whether zzso or one of its zzso contributes substantially to central nervous effects independent from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

After oral administration of zzso plasma zzso of zzso and its zzso as well as zzso size as a measure of central nervous effects, were measured in 11 healthy volunteers representing poor, zzso extensive, and zzso zzso for zzso zzso the observed plasma zzso zzso were zzso by use of computerized zzso infusion, and the zzso effects were compared with those observed after zzso zzso The contribution of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso effects was analyzed by means of zzso zzso 

The areas under the curve of the zzso effects after zzso were zzso zzso 2 times greater than after zzso zzso zzso This contrasted to similar or even lower zzso zzso after zzso than after zzso zzso under the curve ratio, zzso zzso zzso P zzso A zzso fit of the zzso effects by use of zzso as the only active zzso was most significantly zzso zzso improved when zzso as a second active zzso was zzso 

zzso formation of zzso does not explain exclusively the central nervous effects of zzso zzso is the most likely additional active zzso
