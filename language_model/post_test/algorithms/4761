The purpose of this work is to create a rigorous method of zzso PET images using an automated zzso zzso To this end a phantom study employing zzso targets was used to determine local zzso zzso threshold levels which produce correct zzso based on the contrast between target and zzso Numerous target to background activity concentration ratios were investigated but found to have minimal effect in comparison to the influence of target zzso zzso were fit to this data and used to construct an zzso threshold zzso zzso In all cases this approach yielded convergence within ten zzso zzso threshold zzso was applied using both an zzso and zzso approach to the zzso targets and also to two zzso shaped zzso Of these two approaches, the zzso method proved less susceptible to image noise and better at dealing with partial volume effects at the interface between target and zzso For comparative purposes, single thresholds of zzso and zzso were also applied to the zzso data zzso The zzso zzso method was found capable of zzso cross sections with areas greater than 250 zzso to within the maximum resolution possible (1 zzso zzso Cross sections of less than 250 zzso in area were resolved by the zzso method to within 2 zzso zzso of their true physical zzso Local contrast based zzso threshold zzso shows promise as a method of rigorously zzso PET target volumes with good accuracy subject to the limitations imposed by the image resolution which currently characterizes this zzso
