The vast majority of microbes are zzso and thus cannot be zzso by means of traditional zzso zzso sequencing techniques like zzso or zzso make it possible to explore those microbes by studying whole natural microbial communities and zzso their biological diversity as well as the underlying zzso zzso Over the past few years, different methods have been developed for the zzso and functional characterization of zzso shotgun zzso However, the zzso zzso of zzso sequences from novel species without close zzso in the biological sequence databases poses a challenge due to the high number of wrong zzso predictions on lower zzso zzso Here we present zzso a new method for the zzso zzso of assembled and zzso zzso sequences that has been adapted to work with both zzso and zzso zzso zzso We show that our method makes fewer wrong zzso predictions (at the same zzso than other zzso zzso zzso is freely accessible via the web application zzso from zzso
