We propose a new type of zzso growing, zzso neural network that expands itself by following the zzso relationships that exist among the sequences being zzso The zzso tree zzso of this neutral network, contrary to other more classical neural network zzso permits an efficient zzso of zzso The growing nature of this procedure allows to stop it at the desired zzso level without the necessity of waiting until a complete zzso tree is zzso This novel approach presents a number of other interesting properties, such as a time for convergence which is, zzso a zzso function of the number of zzso Computer simulation and a real example show that the zzso accurately finds the zzso tree that relates the zzso All this makes the neural network presented here an excellent tool for zzso analysis of a large number of zzso
