The objective of this study was to evaluate the zzso predictability of zzso zzso zzso in Japanese pediatric patients using zzso population zzso zzso zzso which we reported zzso The zzso of the zzso model was evaluated by zzso method and cross validation method, and the zzso zzso performance was zzso The zzso performance of the zzso model for premature patients was also zzso The cross validation method showed the predictability to be acceptable for practical use, especially for predicting trough concentration using other trough zzso However, for the external premature patient data, this zzso model did not seem to be zzso A theoretical approach using a simulation technique was also examined to evaluate the zzso zzso The results suggested that the predictability at the peak was not necessarily good at all sampling times and the predictability at the trough was better when a later time point was zzso The optimal sampling time for prediction of zzso concentration in pediatric patients is zzso
