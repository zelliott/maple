Recent advances in modern zzso have shown the utmost necessity of wireless communication systems that allow real-time zzso monitoring of neural signals meeting several requirements such as source zzso and high zzso of the received zzso zzso recordings require zzso zzso with up to hundreds of zzso and transmission of signals zzso over a limited bandwidth zzso In this paper, a zzso resource management zzso is proposed so that adequate source zzso is applied to each channel in order to fit them into the available zzso Performance of the zzso is analyzed using zzso changing zzso and neural recordings with different neural activity zzso
