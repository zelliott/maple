In addition to zzso zzso zzso mechanisms may introduce zzso and shape fluctuations in the components of a zzso potential zzso zzso fluctuations may be originated mainly by zzso zzso Shape fluctuations may be produced by changes in the background synaptic activity received by the zzso zzso which affect the cell membrane zzso This article aims to develop a unified approach for the analysis of zzso zzso and shape fluctuations in the components of a zzso The analysis is based on: zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso a mathematical model able to predict the average and zzso of a zzso with specified components and fluctuations (the zzso zzso Cable zzso zzso and zzso a procedure to estimate the zzso parameters that best reproduce the average and zzso of a given zzso (the zzso zzso identification zzso zzso The zzso is tested with simulated zzso The results obtained support the feasibility of the zzso
