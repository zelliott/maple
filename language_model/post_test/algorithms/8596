The purpose of this study was to investigate whether repetitive zzso magnetic stimulation zzso can change zzso dynamic properties of the cerebral zzso Two zzso trains (10 zzso 3 seconds, zzso of motor zzso were administered to the left frontal area in healthy zzso zzso signals were collected at 14 zzso sites before and after zzso and were filtered digitally into zzso zzso zzso zzso and gamma zzso Basing on an improved zzso introduced in the zzso recent study, dimension estimates were calculated on these signals as well as on the corresponding surrogate zzso zzso treatment was designed into this zzso The data showed that zzso signals obviously exhibited lower dimension estimates than the surrogate data, whereas the zzso and alpha rhythms presented the lowest values among the frequency zzso zzso increased the dimension estimates of zzso signals during the first 2 zzso Similar findings were also obtained on the delta and beta zzso This study revealed that zzso signals in the normal state can be described by a zzso dynamic zzso This process can be affected temporarily by zzso zzso networks revealed by zzso signals show more complicated properties after zzso
