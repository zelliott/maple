Principal component analysis zzso is often used to reduce the dimension of data before applying more sophisticated data analysis methods such as zzso zzso zzso or independent component zzso This practice is based on selecting components corresponding to the largest zzso If the ultimate goal is separation of data in two groups, then these set of components need not have the most zzso zzso We measured the distance between two such populations using zzso distance and chose the zzso to maximize it, a modified zzso method, which we call the zzso zzso zzso zzso was applied to diffusion zzso fractional zzso images to distinguish zzso schizophrenia subjects from healthy zzso The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by the zzso zzso We show that for this fractional zzso data set, the zzso error with 60 components was close to the minimum error and that the zzso distance was twice as large with zzso than with zzso Finally, by masking the zzso function with the white matter tracts of the Johns Hopkins University atlas, we identified left superior zzso zzso as the tract which gave the least zzso zzso In addition, with six zzso chosen tracts the zzso error was zzso
