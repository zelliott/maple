An zzso for the analysis of zzso zzso is zzso This algorithm, referred to as the zzso zzso zzso zzso estimates the binding of transcripts to complementary zzso using zzso zzso free zzso and the zzso between partially complementary transcripts in solution using zzso free zzso The balance between these two competing reactions allows for the translation of zzso zzso into transcript zzso 

To validate the zzso it is applied to publicly available zzso data from a zzso comparison zzso Here, zzso experiments are performed on samples which zzso only in few zzso The zzso fold change between these two samples, as obtained from zzso experiments, agrees well with the zzso fold change as obtained with the zzso indicating that the zzso determines changes in the expression level zzso We also show that the zzso allows for the identification of outlying zzso as it yields independent concentration estimates per zzso 

The zzso is robust and offers an interesting alternative to purely statistical zzso for zzso data zzso
