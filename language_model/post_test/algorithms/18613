zzso zzso is a sodium copper zzso of zzso that is capable of forming strong zzso complexes with several known zzso zzso and zzso effects, including reduced DNA zzso and tumor formation have been demonstrated for zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso and/or metabolism of zzso molecules with at least partial ring structure have been proposed as mechanisms of action for zzso zzso The zzso cell model of zzso zzso transport was used to evaluate the zzso of 1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso across cell zzso in the presence of 0, 1, 10, and 100 zzso zzso No significant differences were observed in the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso compartments for zzso and zzso however, the zzso of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting an active zzso zzso Transport of zzso from zzso zzso zzso compartments was significantly reduced at all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transport of zzso was significantly reduced by the addition of 100 zzso zzso zzso while 1 zzso or 10 zzso zzso had no zzso zzso studies revealed a higher binding affinity zzso for zzso to zzso compared to zzso to zzso in transport zzso zzso zzso zzso transport of zzso which has a lower binding affinity for zzso than zzso or zzso was not significantly altered by the addition of zzso These data suggest that the transport of zzso and zzso can be inhibited by zzso which supports a model of direct binding in the zzso tract of zzso to these zzso with zzso reduction of zzso as one mechanism of action as a cancer zzso zzso
