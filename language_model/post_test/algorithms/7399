The problem of efficient zzso of zzso expression profiles for identification and prediction of complex disease conditions is both important and zzso zzso zzso such as most types of cancer involve zzso of many interacting genes which has prompted search for suitable statistical models for their zzso By accounting for changes in gene regulations between comparable conditions, zzso statistical models are expected to improve prediction zzso 

In comparison problems with two or more experimental conditions, we represent the classes by zzso zzso networks that share one and the same graph structure but have zzso probability zzso The graph structure is learned by a zzso procedure that zzso the difference between class probabilities using a suitable measure of zzso The proposed framework includes an indirect model selection by adhering to a principle of optimal class separation and identifies interactions presenting significant difference between the compared zzso 

We evaluate the performance of the new model against some benchmark zzso such as support zzso machine, penalized linear zzso and linear zzso zzso The zzso are compared by prediction accuracy across 15 different data sets from breast, zzso gastric and zzso cancer zzso In addition to the demonstrated strong performance against the zzso the proposed method is able to identify disease specific changes in gene regulations which are zzso by other zzso The latter is illustrated by analyzing some gene interactions zzso zzso and zzso cell lung zzso
