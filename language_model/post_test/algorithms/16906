The forces that cause zzso of the zzso joint during the fixation of zzso zzso can be determined by means of zzso zzso at the long process of the zzso As in other zzso 3 ranges of forces can be zzso zzso zzso zzso and short-term zzso 

A crucial step in zzso surgery is the attachment of the zzso zzso to the long process of the zzso It is unknown which forces occur during the zzso process that increase the risk of damage to the zzso joint or zzso zzso The goal of this study was to assess the admissible range of forces at the long process of the zzso that would be tolerable before damaging the structures and to compare them with the forces occurring during zzso 

zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso direction were measured in 9 freshly frozen or fresh zzso zzso The force was measured with a load cell, and displacement was taken from the zzso information of the zzso driven translation stage on which the load cell was zzso The long process of the zzso was coupled to the load cell via a customized zzso We also monitored with video recordings for visual confirmation of zzso 

The zzso force at which the middle ear was found to be severely injured was zzso zzso zzso in the zzso direction and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso occurred at forces around zzso zzso zzso in the zzso direction and in the zzso direction at zzso zzso zzso zzso maximum forces of zzso zzso zzso were measured in the zzso direction and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso 

zzso forces of the zzso joint could be defined with high zzso These results were used to calculate risks of zzso zzso or zzso during zzso zzso Compared with the use of clip and zzso zzso the risk of damage from a zzso procedure is significantly zzso
