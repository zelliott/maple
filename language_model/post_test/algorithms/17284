This paper describes the derivation of a simple zzso model for the prediction of log zzso from a set of 55 diverse organic zzso The model contains two zzso polar surface area zzso and calculated zzso both of which can be rapidly zzso It therefore permits the prediction of log zzso for large compound sets, such as virtual zzso zzso The performance of this zzso on two test sets taken from the literature is illustrated and compared with results from other reported zzso approaches to log zzso zzso
