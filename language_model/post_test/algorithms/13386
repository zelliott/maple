zzso state functional connectivity of zzso data was studied in 29 children zzso years zzso The weighted phase lag index zzso was employed for zzso connectivity and compared to zzso To further evaluate the network structure, a graph analysis based on zzso was used to determine zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as local zzso as well as the characteristic path length zzso as a zzso for global zzso The network's modular structure was also calculated to estimate functional zzso A seed region was identified in the central zzso area based on the power distribution at the sensor level in the alpha zzso zzso reveals a specific connectivity map different from power and zzso BC and zzso show a strong level of connectedness in the zzso area between lateral and central zzso C shows different isolated areas of zzso zzso Globally, a network with the shortest L is detected in the alpha band, consistently with the local zzso Our results are in agreement with findings in adults, indicating a similar functional network in children at this age in the alpha zzso The integrated use of zzso and graph analysis can help to gain a better description of resting state zzso
