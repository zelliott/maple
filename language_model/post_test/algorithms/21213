A new approach, based on zzso zzso zzso System zzso is presented for the zzso of zzso data of zzso knees, considering the zzso of existing zzso An zzso zzso was developed and tested on a total of zzso zzso data points collected from 40 normal and 40 injured zzso The system consisted of 5 layers and 8 rules, based on the results of zzso data zzso and trained using the hybrid zzso zzso The performance of the system was evaluated in four runs, in the framework of a zzso cross validation zzso The results indicated a zzso correct diagnosis for typical injured and normal zzso Except for two, all cases with marginally distinct zzso zzso were also diagnosed zzso The overall sensitivity and specificity of the system in four runs were zzso and zzso zzso The superior performance of the zzso zzso over previously suggested criteria highlights its capability when dealing with marginal zzso data of knees with partially disrupted zzso or zzso zzso
