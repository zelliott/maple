zzso strings and other classic zzso structural formats offer a convenient way to represent molecules as a simplistic connection table, with the inherent advantages of ease of handling and zzso In the context of virtual zzso chemical databases to be screened are often initially represented by zzso zzso strings that can be filtered and zzso in a number of ways, resulting in molecules that occupy similar regions of chemical space to active compounds of a therapeutic zzso A wide variety of software exists to convert molecules into zzso format, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Group) and Babel zzso Scientific zzso Depending on the zzso zzso the atoms of a zzso string defining a zzso can be ordered zzso Upon conversion to zzso coordinates they result in the production of ostensibly the same zzso In this work we show how different permutations of a zzso string can affect zzso generation, affecting reliability and zzso of the zzso Furthermore, we propose a novel procedure for the generation of zzso taking advantage of the zzso of the input zzso zzso and other zzso formats, leading to more effective sampling of zzso space in zzso and also implementing fingerprint and principal component analyses step to post process and zzso the zzso
