To evaluate an automated zzso zzso in zzso zzso of the chest in respect to radiation dose and image quality, compared to a standard 120 zzso zzso 

104 patients were examined using a zzso zzso Fifty examinations zzso zzso 15 years, study zzso were performed using the automated zzso of tube potential zzso zzso based on the zzso profile of the scout zzso 54 examinations (62 zzso 14 years, control zzso with fixed 120 zzso zzso CT dose index zzso of the zzso setting was compared with a 120 zzso zzso After the scan zzso volume zzso and dose length product zzso were zzso Image quality was assessed by region of interest zzso zzso zzso image quality by two observers with a 4-point scale zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso selected 100 zzso in zzso and 120 zzso in zzso zzso zzso reduction was zzso zzso in 100 zzso overall zzso reduction was zzso zzso in 100 zzso (all zzso zzso image quality was excellent in both zzso 

The zzso based zzso zzso enables relevant dose reduction zzso in zzso while keeping image quality parameters at high zzso
