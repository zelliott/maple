The generalized linear mixed model zzso which extends the generalized linear model zzso to incorporate random effects characterizing zzso among subjects, is widely used in analyzing correlated and zzso zzso Although there is often interest in identifying the subset of zzso that have random effects, random effects selection can be challenging, particularly when outcome zzso are zzso This article proposes a fully zzso approach to the problem of simultaneous selection of fixed and random effects in zzso zzso out the random effects zzso a zzso structure on the zzso outcome data, and an important problem that we also consider is that of zzso zzso Our approach relies on variable zzso mixture zzso for the components in a special zzso decomposition of the random effects zzso A zzso search zzso zzso is developed, which relies on Gibbs zzso with Taylor series expansions used to approximate intractable zzso zzso data examples are presented for different exponential family zzso and the approach is applied to discrete survival data from a zzso zzso
