The modern view of protein thermodynamics predicts that proteins undergo zzso zzso Unfortunately, the properties of proteins and water conspire to prevent the detailed observation of this fundamental zzso Here we use protein zzso to allow cold zzso of the protein zzso to be monitored by high-resolution zzso at temperatures approaching zzso degrees zzso The zzso unfolding of zzso is found to be highly zzso in distinct contrast to the zzso melting of this and other zzso These results demonstrate the potential of cold zzso as a means to dissect the cooperative zzso of proteins and to provide a rigorous framework for testing statistical zzso treatments of protein stability, dynamics and zzso
