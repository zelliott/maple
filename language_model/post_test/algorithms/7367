zzso gene trees yield zzso and zzso relationships between zzso This information may however contradict other information on zzso and zzso provided by other zzso of evolution, such as zzso zzso 

We explore a way to include external information on zzso in the process of gene tree zzso Given an initial gene tree and a set of zzso constraints on pairs of genes or on zzso we give zzso zzso for producing a modified gene tree satisfying the set of constraints, that is as close as possible to the original one according to the zzso zzso We assess the zzso of the modifications we propose by computing the likelihood ratio between initial and modified trees according to sequence alignments on zzso trees, showing that often the two trees are statistically zzso
