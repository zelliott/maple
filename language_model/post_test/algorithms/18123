The analysis of zzso indicator dynamics is important for cardiovascular zzso as well as for the assessment of tissue zzso aimed at the detection of zzso regions or cancer zzso To this end, indicator dilution zzso are measured after the intravenous injection of an indicator zzso and fitted by zzso models for the zzso of the zzso parameters of zzso Based on zzso reasoning, the dilution process is often modeled by a gamma zzso In this paper, we provide both a physical and zzso interpretation of the gamma zzso zzso The accuracy of the model is compared with the local density random walk model, a known model based on physics zzso zzso zzso were measured by contrast zzso both in zzso and in zzso (20 zzso Blood volume zzso were used to test the accuracy and clinical relevance of the estimated zzso Both models provided accurate curve fits and volume zzso In conclusion, the proposed interpretations of the gamma zzso model describe physics aspects of the dilution process and lead to a better understanding of the observed zzso increasing the value and credibility of the model, and possibly expanding its diagnostic zzso
