To investigate and compare the biologically effective doses, equivalent doses in zzso zzso log tumor cells killed, and late effects that can be estimated for the large zzso in short overall times that are now being delivered in various clinically used schedules in several countries for the treatment of cancer in human zzso liver, and zzso 

Linear zzso zzso modeling is employed with only the standard assumptions that tumor zzso ratio is 10 zzso zzso and late complication zzso ratios are 3 zzso that intrinsic zzso of tumor cells is zzso zzso that no tumor zzso occurs within 2 weeks, and that zzso modeling is valid up to 23 zzso per zzso As well as the planning target volume zzso we propose a practical term called the prescription zzso volume zzso to be used in this zzso In the ideal case of zzso zzso zzso equals zzso but usually zzso is larger than the zzso zzso effective doses zzso in zzso for tumors or zzso for normal lung are calculated and converted to equivalent doses in 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso total doses zzso and to estimated log cell zzso How such large zzso doses might be delivered to zzso is zzso 

zzso cell kill varies between 16 and 27 logs to base 10 for schedules from zzso zzso 12 zzso to zzso zzso 23 zzso The rationale for the high end of this scale is the possible presence of hypoxic or otherwise extraordinarily resistant cells, but how many tumors and which ones require such doses is not zzso How can such large doses be zzso In zzso type zzso it is shown to be theoretically possible, provided that suitably small volumes are zzso with rapid zzso of dose outside the zzso and a mean dose zzso zzso and allowing for local fraction zzso to both lungs of less than 19 zzso zzso If suitably small zzso were used, local late zzso have been given which were as large as 600 zzso equivalent to 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso 360 zzso in zzso zzso with remarkably few complications reported zzso Questions of concurrent chemotherapy and microscopic extension of lung tumor cells are discussed zzso 

Such large doses can apparently be given, with suitable precautions and zzso zzso clinical trials from an increasing number of centers will be reporting the results of tumor control and complications from this new zzso of biologically higher zzso
