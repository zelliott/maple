In Argentina, zzso diagnosis in adults is made using one or two zzso zzso tests and a zzso zzso These strategies may fail to identify infected individuals during early primary infection, which represents an important public health problem among groups with a high zzso zzso such as men who have sex with men zzso zzso zzso The general objective of this study was to contribute to reducing zzso transmission among zzso through the identification of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A total of zzso zzso were recruited for an zzso zzso zzso A total of 161 zzso zzso were zzso and 14 zzso were zzso Among the zzso negative individuals, 16 zzso exhibited zzso results in the screening zzso zzso Western zzso zzso samples and negative zzso samples (with zzso results in the zzso were zzso to detect zzso zzso acid by viral load zzso Up to zzso of zzso zzso samples and zzso of zzso zzso samples with zzso results in the screening zzso had zzso zzso zzso Overall, zzso of the samples with zzso or indeterminate results were identified as zzso using direct zzso With the identification of four new cases using the zzso acid detection test, the zzso prevalence in zzso increased by zzso (from zzso to zzso 

The results of this study suggest the importance of including zzso acid detection in the zzso zzso for zzso with zzso zzso results and those with zzso zzso results and zzso results in screening zzso in order to decrease zzso transmission among this population with a high zzso prevalence and zzso
