A robust analysis of comparative zzso zzso data is critical for meaningful zzso comparison zzso In this paper, we compare our method zzso in a new software zzso zzso freely available at zzso ) with three commonly used analysis zzso zzso zzso available at zzso ), an empirical zzso value of twofold difference between the zzso zzso after zzso zzso or after zzso zzso in which the zzso intensity is divided by the average zzso intensity of the entire data zzso Each method was tested using data sets from real experiments with prior knowledge of zzso and divergent zzso zzso and zzso were superior when a high proportion of genes were zzso zzso was the most suitable method for the data set in which the relationship between the zzso zzso was not zzso zzso has proved robust in an analysis of all the data sets zzso
