The ultimate intrinsic zzso ratio is the highest possible zzso ratio, and the ultimate intrinsic specific zzso rate provides the lowest limit of the specific zzso rate for a given flip angle zzso Analytic expressions for ultimate intrinsic zzso ratio and ultimate intrinsic specific zzso rate are obtained for arbitrary sample zzso These expressions are valid when the distance between the point of interest and the sample surface is smaller than the zzso and the sample is zzso The dependence on the sample zzso zzso temperature, size, and the zzso magnetic field strength is given in zzso form, which enables the easy evaluation of the change in zzso ratio and specific zzso rate when the sample is scaled in size or when any of its geometrical or electrical parameters is zzso Furthermore, it is shown that zzso ratio and specific zzso rate are independent of the zzso of the zzso As a practical case and a solution example, a uniform, circular zzso shaped sample is zzso
