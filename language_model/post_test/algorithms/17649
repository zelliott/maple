zzso at high field has been increasingly zzso to study brain metabolism in healthy and pathological zzso The aim of this work was to determine the effects of zzso motion on the results of this exam in the presence of the increased zzso differences at high zzso Single zzso zzso of various regions in the human brain were acquired using frame-by-frame PRESS zzso at a zzso zzso sampling zzso The frame-by-frame variations of the zzso phase and the frequency and fractional zzso variations of the residual zzso were zzso In the human brain the standard zzso of these variations were zzso zzso zzso degrees, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the mean zzso zzso In a zzso zzso smaller phase and frequency variations were detected in zzso zzso However, the end effects of zzso motion on PRESS zzso of the brain at 3 T were zzso
