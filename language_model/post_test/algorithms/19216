The zzso and dynamic properties of a zzso zzso designed to inhibit human zzso have been examined by using zzso and molecular zzso From a quantitative analysis of a series of two-dimensional zzso data sets, zzso distances were zzso Several different methods were explored and compared to incorporate these distance constraints as well as those derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso into computer-generated three-dimensional zzso These methods included interactive manual manipulation of the structures to fit the zzso distance constraints, distance zzso constrained energy zzso and constrained molecular zzso The advantages and disadvantages of the methods are zzso In addition, to gain insight into the zzso accessible to the zzso zzso and the relative flexibility of the different parts of the zzso molecular dynamics calculations were performed at three different zzso Average zzso distances and zzso angles were obtained from the structures generated in the dynamics zzso and compared to those obtained from the zzso zzso Despite the four zzso groups and zzso linkage contained in the zzso portion of the zzso our zzso results indicated a preferred zzso for the zzso ring of the zzso and supported the presence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, both the molecular dynamics and zzso data indicated a considerable amount of flexibility for the remaining zzso portion of the zzso These results are used to propose an explanation for the zzso zzso inability to inhibit human zzso
