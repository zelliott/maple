Consensus is a server developed to produce high-quality alignments for comparative zzso and to identify the alignment regions reliable for copying from a given zzso This is accomplished even when zzso sequence identity is as low as zzso Combining the output from five different alignment methods, the server produces a consensus zzso with a reliability measure indicated for each position and a prediction of the regions suitable for zzso Models built using the server predictions are typically within 3 A zzso zzso from the crystal zzso Users can upload a target protein sequence and specify a template zzso zzso if no template is given, the server will search for zzso The method has been validated on a large set of zzso protein structure zzso The Consensus server should prove useful for zzso for whom the structural reliability of the model is critical in their zzso It is currently available at zzso
