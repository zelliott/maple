A new zzso of zzso protein zzso is developed and used to evaluate the performance of the protein secondary structure prediction zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The maximum theoretical zzso accuracy for combination of these methods is shown to be zzso A simple consensus prediction on the zzso zzso with automatically generated multiple sequence alignments gives an average zzso prediction accuracy of zzso This is a zzso improvement over zzso which was the best single method zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso for the consensus method on the zzso zzso The secondary structure definition method zzso defines 8 states, but these are reduced by most authors to 3 for zzso Application of the different published 8- to zzso reduction methods shows variation of over zzso on apparent prediction zzso This suggests that care should be taken to compare methods by the same reduction zzso Two new sequence zzso zzso and zzso are derived which are suitable for zzso of secondary structure prediction methods without artifacts due to internal zzso A fully automatic World Wide Web service that predicts protein secondary structure by a combination of methods is available via zzso
