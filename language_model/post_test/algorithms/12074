To determine the degree of irreversible image zzso zzso in conservative viewing zzso 

An zzso zzso which alternately displayed two registered and magnified versions of an image, was used to study observer detection of image degradation introduced by irreversible zzso Five observers evaluated 20 zzso zzso digital chest zzso compressed with Joint Photographic Experts Group zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso ratios of zzso and zzso zzso by using zzso traditional zzso forced choice; zzso zzso zzso forced choice, in which the zzso image is identified to the zzso and zzso a zzso method of matching test images to zzso reference zzso 

The visually zzso threshold was between zzso and zzso for four zzso zzso zzso resulted in performance as good as that with zzso zzso at these zzso The zzso zzso method was faster and as sensitive as the zzso zzso zzso The zzso results were robust and provided information on performance above visually zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso is a versatile tool for comparative assessment of image zzso At zzso zzso images compressed with either zzso or zzso zzso were indistinguishable from zzso original images for most observers at zzso ratios between zzso and zzso indicating that zzso zzso is acceptable for primary image zzso
