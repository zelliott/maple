zzso of small zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is limited by image resolution and low signal to noise zzso We have previously described a matched zzso detection method that uses the time activity curve to distinguish tumors from background in dynamic zzso zzso zzso this zzso on a zzso by zzso basis throughout the dynamic image produces a test statistic image or zzso which on zzso indicates the potential locations of secondary or zzso zzso In this paper, we describe a zzso method that controls zzso error rate zzso for the matched zzso detection statistical zzso The method involves three zzso First, the PET image is segmented into several homogeneous zzso Then, the statistical map is zzso to a zero mean unit zzso zzso random zzso Finally, the images are zzso at a fixed zzso by zzso their spatial zzso and applying a random field theory maximum statistic zzso We evaluate this zzso method using digital zzso generated from clinical dynamic zzso We also present an application of the proposed approach to clinical PET data from a breast cancer patient with zzso zzso
