zzso meningitis zzso is the most common form of zzso and the fifth most common form of zzso zzso Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are the zzso of effective disease zzso The accurate diagnosis of zzso poses a challenge due to an extensive differential diagnosis, low bacterial load and paucity of zzso fluid zzso especially in zzso 

We describe the utility of zzso and zzso for the detection of zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and DNA for the rapid diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from children were classified as zzso zzso zzso zzso culture positive, zzso zzso 29), zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso including other cases of meningitis or neurological disorders zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated from zzso and zzso data of zzso zzso and zzso infectious meningitis zzso samples and zzso values were derived to provide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed zzso zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity in zzso zzso zzso The application of these zzso to zzso and zzso zzso groups yielded excellent sensitivity zzso zzso and specificity zzso zzso for zzso and for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and specificity zzso A test combination of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso accurately detected all zzso samples at a specificity of zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that these tests significantly added value to the currently used zzso for zzso zzso 

The detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA in zzso is likely to improve the utility of existing zzso for zzso diagnosis and also zzso the speed of zzso
