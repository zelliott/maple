The zzso zzso exterior envelope zzso zzso a series of zzso zzso while zzso interacting with the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso or zzso on the surface of host cells to initiate virus zzso Both the crystal structures of the zzso zzso core bound by zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso core zzso by zzso are zzso Despite the wealth of knowledge on these zzso snapshots of molecular zzso the details of molecular motions crucial to intervention remain zzso We presented a comprehensive comparative analysis of dynamic behavior of zzso in its zzso zzso and zzso states based on the zzso models with modeled zzso and zzso zzso zzso computer simulation was zzso to generate ensembles of feasible protein structures, which were subsequently analyzed by essential dynamics technique to identify preferred concerted zzso The revealed collective fluctuations are dominated by complex zzso modes such as zzso zzso and zzso between or within the zzso zzso and zzso zzso An attempt has been made to relate these modes to zzso association and zzso zzso zzso web analysis revealed four zzso that undergo concerted motion in zzso The structural components in zzso that move in concert with zzso were also identified, which may be the suitable target for inhibitor design to interrupt zzso zzso The differences in zzso between the three zzso states revealed certain structural regions that could be related either to zzso association or to subsequent zzso of zzso from zzso These dynamics data provide new insights into the zzso relationship of zzso and may aid in zzso zzso vaccine zzso
