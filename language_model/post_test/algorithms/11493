A number of methods for recognizing protein coding genes in DNA sequence have been published over the last 13 years, and new, more comprehensive zzso drawing on the repertoire of existing techniques, continue to be zzso To zzso continued development, it is valuable to systematically review and evaluate published zzso At the core of most gene recognition zzso is one or more coding zzso which produce, given any sample window of zzso a number or zzso intended to measure the degree to which a sample sequence resembles a window of zzso zzso zzso In this paper we review and zzso the underlying coding measures from published zzso A standardized benchmark is zzso and each of the measures is evaluated according to this zzso Our main conclusion is that a very simple and obvious zzso zzso more effective than any of the more sophisticated zzso Different measures contain different zzso However there is a great deal of zzso in the current suite of zzso We show that in future development of gene recognition zzso attention can probably be limited to six of the zzso or so measures proposed to zzso
