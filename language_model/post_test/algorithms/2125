A zzso zzso procedure is developed to zzso the images of blood flow through various locations of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso The data are recorded by a video microscopic system and, after zzso and zzso are zzso by an zzso zzso based image processing system to obtain zzso and zzso distribution profiles by zzso zzso and image zzso techniques, zzso The vessel zzso zzso blood flow through main and branch arteries and flow separation zones are determined from the data by various zzso zzso In contrast to the earlier techniques the data are obtained from the same location of the vessel and thus the zzso in flow parameters is zzso
