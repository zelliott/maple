zzso zzso Echo zzso Imaging zzso acquisition using parallel imaging can decrease the acquisition time for diffusion imaging and allow zzso high-resolution functional zzso zzso acquisitions at a reduced repetition time zzso However, the zzso of simultaneously acquired, closely spaced slices can be difficult, leading to a high zzso zzso We introduce a method to create zzso image shifts in the phase zzso direction to increase the distance between zzso zzso The shift between the slices is induced using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso simultaneous with the zzso phase zzso zzso This achieves the desired shifts but avoids an zzso zzso zzso blurring artifact associated with previous zzso We validate the method in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at 3 T and 7 T using zzso radio frequency zzso zzso brain zzso The zzso simulated average zzso penalty of the zzso zzso acquisition with zzso shifts is zzso at 3 T zzso with zzso without slice zzso Combining zzso slice acceleration with zzso zzso zzso the zzso penalty becomes zzso at 3 T and zzso at 7 T zzso with zzso and zzso without slice zzso We demonstrate the potential of the method for accelerating diffusion imaging by comparing the fiber orientation uncertainty, where the zzso faster acquisition showed no noticeable zzso
