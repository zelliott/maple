zzso zzso field zzso zzso of the restrained diffusion of confined zzso constitute an efficient method to probe the local geometry in porous zzso In most practical cases, the diffusion zzso when limited to its principal part, can be considered as zzso leading to an apparent diffusion zzso The evolution of the latter as a function of the diffusion zzso yields average information on the zzso ratio of zzso and on the zzso of the zzso In this paper, we investigate porous model systems of packed spheres zzso and zzso with known mean diameter and zzso and, in addition, a real porous polystyrene zzso zzso an zzso zzso Transformation in the second dimension reveals an evolution of the apparent diffusion zzso as a function of the resonance zzso This evolution is related to a similar evolution of the zzso relaxation time zzso These results clearly show that each resonance frequency in the water zzso spectrum zzso to a particular magnetic environment produced by a given pore geometry in the porous zzso This is due to the presence of local field zzso induced by magnetic zzso differences at the zzso interface and to slow exchange rates between different pores as compared to the frequency differences in the zzso This interpretation is nicely confirmed by a series of two-dimensional exchange zzso
