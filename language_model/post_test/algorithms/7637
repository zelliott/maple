The 3M zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is used with the 3M zzso zzso System for the detection of zzso zzso in food, zzso and environmental samples after zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso amplification to rapidly amplify zzso target DNA with high specificity and sensitivity, combined with zzso to detect the zzso The 3M zzso zzso method was compared using an zzso study design in a zzso collaborative study to the zzso Department of zzso Safety and zzso zzso Laboratory zzso zzso zzso Isolation and Identification of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Products for raw ground beef and the zzso Food and Drug zzso zzso Manual zzso Chapter 5 zzso reference method for wet dog food following the current zzso zzso A total of 20 laboratories zzso For the 3M zzso zzso method, raw ground beef was analyzed using 25 g test portions, and wet dog food was analyzed using 375 g test zzso For the reference methods, 25 g test portions of each zzso were zzso Each zzso was artificially contaminated with zzso at three zzso zzso an zzso control level zzso zzso zzso a low zzso level zzso zzso zzso and a high zzso level zzso zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso replicate samples were zzso zzso analysis was conducted according to the probability of detection zzso For the low-level raw ground beef test portions, the following zzso zzso between the zzso of the reference and candidate zzso values with zzso confidence intervals were zzso zzso zzso zzso For the low-level wet dog food test portions, the following zzso with zzso confidence intervals were zzso zzso zzso zzso No significant differences were observed in the number of positive samples detected by the 3M zzso zzso method versus either the zzso or zzso zzso
