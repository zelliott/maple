The assessment of zzso properties in forest zzso affected by fires was evaluated using near infrared zzso zzso zzso coupled with zzso zzso In order to describe the soil properties, zzso were taken of the total organic carbon on solid phase, the total nitrogen content, the organic carbon and the specific zzso at 254 and 280 zzso of zzso zzso organic carbon in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in addition to zzso zzso Then, a fire recurrence index was defined and calculated according to the different fires zzso affecting zzso This calculation includes the occurrence of fires as well as the time elapsed since the last zzso This study shows that zzso zzso could be considered as a tool for soil monitoring, particularly for the quantitative prediction of the total organic zzso total nitrogen content, organic carbon in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso substances zzso Further validation in this field is necessary however, to try and make successful predictions of zzso organic carbon in zzso and zzso acids and the zzso substances zzso Moreover, zzso coupled with zzso can also be useful to predict the fire recurrence index in order to determine the spatial zzso Also this method can be used to map more or less burned areas and possibly to apply adequate rehabilitation techniques, like soil litter zzso with organic zzso zzso zzso or zzso Finally, the proposed recurrence index can be considered representative of the state of the zzso
