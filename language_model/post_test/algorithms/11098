zzso hints to public health threats as early as possible is crucial to prevent harm from the zzso However, many disease surveillance strategies rely upon data whose collection requires explicit reporting zzso transmitted from hospitals, laboratories or zzso Collecting reports takes time so that the reaction time zzso Moreover, context information on individual cases is often lost in the collection zzso This paper describes a system that tries to address these limitations by processing social media for identifying information on public health zzso The primary objective is to study the usefulness of the approach for supporting the monitoring of a population's health zzso 

The developed system works in three main steps: Data from zzso zzso and forums as well as from TV and radio channels are continuously collected and filtered by means of zzso zzso zzso of relevant texts are classified relevant or irrelevant using a zzso zzso based on support zzso zzso By means of statistical methods known from zzso the relevant sentences are further analyzed and signals are generated automatically when unexpected behavior is zzso From the generated signals a subset is selected for presentation to a user by matching with user queries or zzso In a set of evaluation experiments, public health experts assessed the generated signals with respect to correctness and zzso In particular, it was assessed how many relevant and irrelevant signals are generated during a specific time zzso 

The experiments show that the system provides information on health events identified in social zzso zzso are mainly generated from zzso messages posted by news zzso Personal zzso zzso zzso from persons observing some symptoms, only play a minor role for signal generation given a limited volume of relevant zzso zzso signals referring to real world outbreaks were generated by the system and monitored by epidemiologists for example during the European football zzso But, the number of relevant signals among generated signals is still very zzso The different experiments yielded a proportion between 5 and zzso of signals regarded as zzso by the zzso zzso or education campaigns communicated via zzso as well as use of medical terms in other contexts than for outbreak reporting led to the generation of irrelevant zzso 

The zzso of information into signals results in a reduction of monitoring effort compared to other existing zzso Against expectations, only few messages are of personal nature, reporting on personal zzso Instead, media reports are distributed over social media zzso Despite the high percentage of irrelevant signals generated by the system, the users reported that the effort in monitoring zzso information in form of signals is less demanding than monitoring huge zzso data zzso zzso It remains for the future to develop strategies for reducing false zzso
