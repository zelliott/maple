We present a quantitative overhead analysis for effective task migration in zzso zzso A zzso network is the key technology which can automatically provide accurate and specific parameters of a human in real zzso zzso zzso are typically very small devices, so the use of computing resources is zzso Due to the limitation of zzso the zzso network is vulnerable to an external attack against a system for exhausting system zzso Since zzso zzso generally deal with sensitive and privacy data, their malfunction can bring unexpected damage to zzso zzso we have to use a task migration process to avoid the malfunction of particular zzso zzso Also, it is essential to accurately analyze overhead to apply a proper migration zzso In this paper, we calculated task processing time of zzso to analyze system overhead and compared the task processing time applied to a migration process and a general zzso We focused on a cluster ratio and different processing time between zzso zzso in our simulation zzso The results of performance evaluation show that task execution time is greatly influenced by a cluster ratio and different processing time of zzso zzso In the results, the proposed zzso reduces total task execution time in a migration zzso
