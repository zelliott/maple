zzso of the Human zzso zzso zzso zzso cells by first attaching with their surface spikes to the zzso zzso on target zzso This leads to zzso changes in the viral zzso enabling the virus to engage a zzso commonly zzso or zzso and zzso to insert the fusion zzso into the cellular zzso Finally, the viral and the cellular zzso zzso The zzso spike is a zzso consisting of three identical zzso composed of the zzso and zzso envelope zzso Each of the zzso proteins in the zzso is capable of attaching to the zzso zzso and the zzso and each of the three zzso units harbors a fusion zzso It is still under debate how many of the envelope zzso within a given zzso have to bind to the zzso receptors and to the zzso and how many zzso protein fusion zzso are required for zzso These numbers are referred to as zzso zzso We present a mathematical framework for zzso these parameters individually by analyzing zzso zzso with zzso zzso We find that the number of spikes that are engaged in zzso cell entry and the distribution of the spike number play important roles for the zzso of the zzso zzso Our model framework also shows why it is important to zzso the question of the number of functional zzso within one zzso into the three different zzso zzso In a second step, we extend our models to study whether the zzso within one zzso cooperate during zzso binding and zzso As an example for how our models can be applied, we zzso a data set on zzso zzso We find that two envelope proteins have to engage with zzso and zzso and that two fusion proteins must be revealed within one zzso for viral zzso Our study is motivated by the mechanism of zzso entry but the experimental technique and the model framework can be extended to other viral systems as zzso
