Previously, we zzso high zzso screening of a chemical diversity library to identify potent zzso of human zzso zzso and found that many of these compounds had zzso core zzso We also found individual ring zzso had significant impact on zzso zzso activity and compound zzso In the present study, we zzso zzso zzso relationship zzso analysis of a series of 53 zzso derivatives to further zzso these lead zzso We present an improved approach to zzso methodology based on atom pair zzso in combination with zzso zzso molecular zzso This approach zzso the rich representation of chemical structure and leads to zzso analysis that is both accurate and intuitively easy to zzso A sequence of zzso linear zzso and zzso zzso tree analyses of the molecular zzso led to the derivation of zzso zzso zzso These rules revealed that the main factors influencing zzso zzso activity of zzso molecules were the presence of zzso groups in the zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso Furthermore, our data showed that zzso characteristics zzso of frontier molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso were not necessary for achieving good zzso as comparable quality of zzso zzso was obtained with atom pairs and zzso zzso zzso This simplified zzso approach may be useful to qualitative zzso recognition problems in a variety of data zzso
