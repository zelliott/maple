Under specific zzso pressure conditions during the zzso zzso high-speed digital video pictures of zzso zzso were recorded using an zzso and a Kodak Image zzso 1000 Motion zzso A new type of data interface enabled the complete zzso to be saved and processed zzso and, with special mathematical zzso it is possible to generate three-dimensional computer zzso of zzso movements under zzso zzso The present study describes patterns of zzso movements under zzso pressure changes zzso zzso These patterns were consistent with the results of zzso simulations of highly similar zzso zzso reported by other zzso
