zzso of the defensive zzso zzso in the zzso has been linked to a zzso repeated zzso positive feedback zzso zzso from the zzso enhances zzso zzso zzso impulses cross an electrical zzso into the zzso and the zzso excites the zzso via a zzso zzso The zzso has two unusual zzso First, impulses take longer to zzso from the S zzso to the C zzso than in the reverse zzso Second, impulses recorded from the zzso zzso C zzso vary in zzso when zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso with smaller impulses failing to induce synaptic zzso in the zzso A zzso zzso model was developed to test the zzso of zzso independent spike initiation zones in the zzso to explain these zzso The model displays zzso delays in impulse propagation across the zzso electrical zzso and graded impulse zzso in the zzso in simulated high zzso zzso zzso
