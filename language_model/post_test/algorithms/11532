Several three-dimensional vascular models have been developed to study the effects of adding equations for large blood vessels to the traditional zzso transfer equation of zzso when simulating tissue temperature zzso These vascular models include zzso vessels, zzso zzso and zzso zzso for all of which the mean temperature of the blood in the vessels is calculated along their zzso For the zzso arteries this zzso variable temperature is then used as the zzso temperature in the zzso transfer zzso The different vascular models produce significantly different locations for both the maximum tumor and the maximum normal tissue temperatures for a given power deposition zzso However, all of the vascular models predict essentially the same cold regions in the same locations in zzso one set at the zzso corners and another around the zzso of the large blood vessels to the zzso Several different power deposition patterns have been simulated in an attempt to eliminate these cold zzso uniform power in the zzso zzso power in the zzso zzso of the blood in the vessels while they are zzso the normal zzso and an zzso power pattern which combines the best features of the above zzso Although the calculations indicate that optimal power deposition patterns (which improve the temperature zzso exist for all of the vascular models, none of the heating patterns studied eliminated all of the cold zzso zzso in the normal tissue is also simulated to see its effects on the temperature zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
