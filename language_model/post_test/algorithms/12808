A life cycle assessment was carried out to estimate the environmental impact of municipal solid zzso Four scenarios mostly used in China were compared to assess the influence of various technologies on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso composting plus zzso and zzso composting plus zzso In all scenarios, the technologies significantly contribute to global warming and increase the adverse impact of zzso on the zzso The technologies played only a small role in the impact of zzso respiratory zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Similarly, the influence of the technologies on the way other elements affect the environment was zzso Specifically, the direct emissions from the operation processes involved played an important role in most scenarios except for zzso while potential impact generated from zzso infrastructure and energy consumption were quite zzso In addition, in the global warming category, highest potential impact was observed in landfill because of the direct methane gas zzso zzso recovery from methane gas was the key factor for reducing the potential impact of global zzso zzso increasing the use of methane gas to recover electricity is highly recommended to reduce the adverse impact of landfills on the zzso
