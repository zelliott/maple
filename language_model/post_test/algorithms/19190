The coronary zzso is characterized by highly zzso diameters at zzso which may be an important zzso of flow zzso To facilitate accurate reconstruction of the coronary network for zzso analysis, we introduce a statistical data set of the diameter asymmetry at zzso based on zzso data of the zzso coronary zzso and zzso zzso The zzso asymmetry data were represented by the diameter ratio of the daughters relative to mother vessel and by an area expansion ratio zzso at each zzso A novel asymmetry ratio zzso was introduced to describe the diameter asymmetry of daughters to mother zzso The relations between zzso and flow zzso and asymmetry ratio zzso and flow distribution, were zzso The results indicate that the ratio of large daughter to mother vessel has a minimum value at order 5 zzso diameter of approximately 70 zzso whereas the ratio of small daughter to mother vessel decreases zzso with increase in order zzso The zzso was found to be fairly uniform for larger vessels and to increase from order 5 toward the zzso At order 5, we observe a transition in zzso zzso pattern that may mark a zzso transition from zzso to zzso zzso The functional implications of these structural transitions are zzso
