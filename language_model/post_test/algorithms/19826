For reasons of food safety, packaging and food contact materials must be submitted to migration zzso Testing of silicone zzso is often very laborious, since three replicate tests are required to decide about their zzso This paper presents a general zzso framework to predict the zzso compliance or zzso using results of the first two migration zzso It compares the outcomes of models with multiple continuous zzso with a class of models involving zzso and dummy zzso The zzso prediction ability was tested using cross and external zzso zzso model zzso each time a new measurement set became zzso At the overall migration limit of 10 zzso zzso the relative uncertainty on a prediction was estimated to be zzso Taking the default values for zzso and zzso equal to zzso the maximum value that can be predicted for sample compliance was therefore 7 zzso zzso Beyond this limit the risk for false zzso results increases significantly, and a third migration test should be zzso The result of this latter test defines the zzso compliance or zzso zzso for zzso control inspired by the current zzso control strategy are zzso
