zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other large-scale zzso technologies are now routinely used to generate a vast amount of zzso zzso zzso analysis of this data is crucial in helping to understand the data and to help form biological zzso This step requires zzso of the data in a meaningful way to zzso the results and to perform first level zzso 

We have developed a zzso user interface for zzso and first level analysis of molecular zzso It is currently in use at the Institut zzso for cancer research projects involving zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso loss of zzso results zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The interface offers the possibility of studying these different types of information in a consistent zzso Several views are proposed, such as the classical zzso zzso view or zzso zzso zzso Many zzso for analyzing zzso data are provided by the zzso including looking for zzso regions of zzso confrontation to zzso data or clinical information, and zzso Our tool consists of zzso scripts and of an zzso written in zzso It can be run on public zzso at zzso 

The zzso software zzso and Analysis of zzso and other zzso zzso is available upon zzso It can be tested on public zzso at zzso The documentation is available at zzso
