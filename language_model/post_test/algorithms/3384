zzso have become more and more complex over the years, zzso technological advances were used to create more and new possibilities in existing zzso zzso As a result a demand has grown for more automatic functions to reduce the time to program the zzso and zzso follow-up zzso One of the parameters which can be adjusted automatically is the zzso zzso We measured the pacing threshold as a function of zzso zzso between the stimulus and the previous paced complex and related this to the zzso of the paced evoked zzso When the stimulus falls far away from the zzso the pacing threshold is zzso When it approaches the zzso the threshold reduces slightly zzso and at the peak of the zzso there is a sharp increase of the pacing zzso The zzso period zzso with the period from the stimulus until the top of the zzso zzso zzso This result is used in the zzso zzso where the zzso zzso is used to automatically adjust the pace zzso zzso zzso adjusting the zzso period has the extra advantage of higher allowable pacing rates as the zzso period shortens with increasing heart zzso Future applications will include use zzso pacing where the zzso zzso can be used to prevent pacing in the zzso period or in the vulnerable zzso
