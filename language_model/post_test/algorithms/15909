To determine the effect of long term zzso zzso on lung function, zzso and health status in patients with moderate to severe chronic zzso pulmonary zzso 

Double blind, zzso controlled zzso 

zzso UK zzso 

zzso men and women aged between 40 and 75 years with mean forced zzso volume in one second zzso 50% of predicted zzso 

zzso zzso zzso 500 zzso twice daily from a zzso dose zzso or identical zzso 

zzso zzso rate of decline in zzso after the zzso and in health status, frequency of zzso respiratory zzso Safety zzso morning serum cortisol zzso zzso of adverse zzso 

There was no significant difference in the annual rate of decline in zzso zzso Mean zzso after zzso remained significantly higher throughout the study with zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso Median zzso rate was reduced by zzso from zzso a year on zzso to zzso a year on with zzso zzso zzso Health status deteriorated by zzso units a year on zzso and zzso units a year on zzso zzso zzso zzso because of respiratory disease not related to zzso were higher in the zzso group zzso v zzso zzso 

zzso zzso 500 zzso twice daily did not affect the rate of decline in zzso but did produce a small increase in zzso Patients on zzso zzso had fewer zzso and a slower decline in health zzso These improvements in clinical outcomes support the use of this treatment in patients with moderate to severe chronic zzso pulmonary zzso
