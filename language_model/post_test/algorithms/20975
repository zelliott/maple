Although feasibility of accurate zzso reconstruction of the zzso zzso of the zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso has been zzso in zzso application is limited due to bone zzso The aim of this study was to propose a specific zzso to get accurate and zzso low dose in zzso zzso zzso To achieve this goal, a zzso zzso model was introduced as a zzso zzso This geometric model was based on a database based on zzso zzso of 60 zzso The accuracy was estimated using comparisons to CT scans on 13 zzso zzso then in zzso zzso and zzso observer zzso was assessed using a set of 23 zzso The mean for the relative difference was zzso zzso for the in zzso zzso zzso The mean error was zzso zzso with maximum value of zzso zzso in ideal conditions (in zzso The confidence zzso for the zzso zzso was within zzso zzso This method gave us a zzso tool in order to get in zzso zzso reconstructions of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso
