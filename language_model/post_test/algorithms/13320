The zzso time of zzso from neutral zzso zzso zzso in synthetic diamond is zzso The intrinsic zzso lifetime of zzso zzso is measured as zzso zzso 19 zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso nitrogen atoms zzso are shown to zzso zzso from zzso by zzso resonant energy transfer at a rate such that the transfer time would equal zzso if one zzso atom was zzso zzso from the zzso In zzso diamonds grown with a small nitrogen content, that are brown as a result of zzso zzso the zzso time of zzso equals zzso in the zzso zzso However, after zzso at zzso zzso to remove the brown zzso zzso from the zzso zzso is severely zzso This effect is suggested to be a result of the destruction of zzso zzso and the creation of new zzso zzso localized in zzso regions of the zzso
