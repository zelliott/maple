In this study, the separate and combined effects on speech perception of compensation of the reduced dynamic range by zzso and compensation of the reduced frequency resolution by spectral enhancement is zzso The study has been designed to compare the effects of signal processing on monosyllabic zzso words for zzso listeners in conditions of quiet, fluctuating noise, and continuous zzso Speech perception of zzso enhanced speech was compared with zzso zzso In addition, a comparison was made between combinations of zzso enhanced speech and two types of zzso zzso In the past, the definition zzso zzso is often used to indicate fast zzso However, the time zzso of the fast zzso used in this study are so short that zzso has become an inappropriate zzso Moreover, zzso tests were performed in which scores were acquired of monosyllabic words, and their constituent zzso zzso zzso the definitions zzso and zzso will be used throughout this zzso In one condition, spectral enhancement produced significant improvements for vowel zzso But, this was zzso by deterioration of the consonant scores for all but one zzso In general, the best overall scores for zzso words were obtained in the zzso zzso After the spectral enhancement, a single-channel zzso zzso added no zzso There are indications that a zzso zzso zzso and spectral enhancement have opposite effects, because the scores for this combination are, in general, the zzso
