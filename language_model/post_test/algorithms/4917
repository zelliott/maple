The effect of using robots to improve motor recovery has received increased attention, even though the most effective protocol remains a topic of zzso 

zzso The objective was to compare the training effects of treatments on the wrist joint of subjects with chronic stroke with an interactive rehabilitation robot and a robot with continuous passive zzso 

zzso This study was a zzso zzso controlled trial with a zzso zzso zzso zzso subjects with chronic stroke were randomly assigned to receive zzso wrist training with a continuous zzso zzso robot zzso group, zzso zzso zzso and a passive motion device zzso group, zzso zzso zzso completed within 7 consecutive zzso Training effects were evaluated with clinical scores by zzso and zzso tests zzso Assessment zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and with zzso zzso parameters zzso zzso level and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso improvements in zzso scores zzso and zzso were found in the interactive group zzso zzso zzso zzso decreases in the zzso were observed in the wrist and elbow zzso for the interactive group and in the wrist joint for the passive group zzso zzso zzso These zzso changes were associated with the decrease in zzso zzso level of the zzso zzso zzso and the biceps zzso for the interactive group zzso zzso zzso The muscle coordination on wrist and elbow zzso was improved in the interactive groups in the zzso zzso indexes across the training sessions zzso zzso zzso 

zzso The interactive treatment improved muscle coordination and reduced zzso after the training for both the wrist and elbow zzso which persisted for 3 zzso The passive mode training mainly reduced the zzso in the wrist zzso
