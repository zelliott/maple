Two zzso methods for designing zzso transform zzso zzso and zzso zzso produce zzso reconstructions when combined than those produced by each method zzso In previous studies zzso zzso was defined as the mapping from the desired complex value to the closest value produced by the zzso This method is compared with a new zzso criterion in which the desired complex value is mapped to the closest value that can be realized by zzso zzso zzso and experimental zzso using zzso phase and zzso zzso show that the modified approach to blended zzso produces more faithful reconstructions than those of the previous zzso
