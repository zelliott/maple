zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a tool for prediction of zzso in protein sequences that determine the zzso functional zzso It is designed for analysis of protein families whose members have zzso similar but not identical interaction partners zzso different zzso for a family of zzso zzso predicts zzso that could be responsible for the zzso choice of their correct interaction zzso The input of zzso is a multiple alignment of a protein family divided into a number of specificity groups, within which the interaction partner is believed to be the zzso zzso does not require information about the secondary or three-dimensional structure of zzso It produces a set of the alignment positions zzso determining zzso that determine differences in functional zzso zzso is available at zzso
