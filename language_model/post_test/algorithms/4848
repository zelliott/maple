We present a new version of the zzso zzso zzso pulse zzso referred to as zzso zzso with comparable resolution in the zzso dimension to a zzso zzso zzso zzso In the conventional zzso zzso zzso the constant time period zzso approximately 32 zzso severely limits the maximum resolution in the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso experiment presented here, both constant time periods zzso 32 zzso each) for zzso forward and backward transfer between zzso and zzso are zzso to double the zzso evolution zzso This leads to a dramatic enhancement in peak separation along the zzso dimension, making the zzso zzso an ideal pulse scheme for accurate zzso relaxation enhancement and residual zzso zzso zzso
