Hidden zzso zzso models using finite zzso mixture models as their hidden state zzso have been successfully applied in sequential data modeling and zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso mixture models are well known to be highly intolerant to the presence of zzso data within the fitting data sets used for their zzso zzso zzso zzso models have recently emerged as a zzso robust alternative to zzso mixture models, overcoming these zzso To exploit these merits of zzso zzso models in the context of a sequential data modeling setting, we zzso in this paper, a novel hidden zzso model where the hidden state zzso are considered to be finite zzso of zzso zzso zzso We derive an zzso for the model parameters zzso under a maximum likelihood zzso assuming full, zzso and zzso zzso zzso The advantages of the proposed model over conventional approaches are zzso demonstrated through a series of sequential data modeling zzso
