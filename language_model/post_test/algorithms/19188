The zzso averaging procedure proposed here zzso artifacts in zzso potential data by zzso the zzso zzso This method rank orders single trials according to the impact of each trial on the zzso zzso Then, the minimum residual background noise level in the zzso data is determined at each step in the averaging zzso Trials having a negative impact on the residual background noise are discarded from the averaging zzso zzso showed that zzso estimates obtained by the zzso averaging procedure were either better or comparable to those obtained by single trial artifact detection methods at their most optimum zzso in particular during long duration zzso Experimental data from a working memory task further illustrate the effectiveness of the zzso
