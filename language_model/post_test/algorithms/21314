We have used differential polarization zzso which provides images of linear zzso to measure the percentage of aligned zzso zzso in zzso zzso red blood cells from subjects with zzso cell zzso The percentage was found to be only slightly dependent on the speed of zzso thus showing that the percentage of aligned zzso was zzso controlled (as has been found previously for the percentage of zzso zzso in zzso A slight decrease in the percentage of aligned zzso due to increasing speed of zzso is primarily due to the increase in the number of cells containing no zzso aligned zzso This class of cells was also the most variable between the different subjects zzso We were able to identify two other groups of cells that contain different numbers of zzso of aligned zzso and show that these groups contain statistically different percentages of aligned zzso The differences between these classes of cells was shown to be primarily due to different numbers of initial nucleation sites within each zzso It appears that the presence of zzso nucleation sites within cells at ambient oxygen tensions results in the zzso control of aligned zzso zzso
