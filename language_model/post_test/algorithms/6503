This paper presents the results of zzso zzso of derivatives of zzso obtained using six zzso stationary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and a mixture of zzso zzso zzso as the mobile zzso No significant difference was observed in the separation of the zzso on the zzso and zzso zzso stationary zzso Comparing the separation of zzso on zzso columns the retention factors were increased in the order: native zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The highest values of resolution were obtained on the column containing zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso in the zzso stationary phase plays an important role, together with charge interactions and zzso zzso in the separation of zzso of derivatives of zzso
