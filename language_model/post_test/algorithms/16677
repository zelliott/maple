A variety of zzso techniques are used to assess clinical skills during medical zzso The objective assessment of practical skill proficiency is not currently zzso zzso sum charts have been used in several branches of medicine for the audit of practical procedural zzso In this paper, we describe our use of cumulative sum scoring to present and determine competency in peripheral zzso zzso for medical zzso 

Ten medical students each performed between 50 and 65 intravenous zzso zzso recording their successes and zzso zzso sum plots were created using previously published zzso zzso of the standard plot were also used to give an early warning of poor performance and to give an earlier recognition of good zzso 

The zzso zzso modification demonstrated that all students achieved competence during the study, although many needed to perform more procedures than would usually be possible during their medical school zzso The zzso zzso modification aided the early identification of practice that differed from acceptable zzso 

zzso sum scoring is an objective measure of practical procedural success and failure that can easily be used by medical students and professionals alike, to both determine competency and to facilitate the early warning of substandard practice so that appropriate training may be zzso The principle issue affecting the utility of the technique for medical students is the number of procedures that need to be performed in order to create a meaningful zzso
