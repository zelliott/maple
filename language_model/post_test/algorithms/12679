We introduce and study a da Vinci fluid, a fluid whose dissipation is dominated by solid zzso We zzso the flow zzso of a discrete model and then zzso it to the zzso We find that the model gives rise to zzso that is characteristic of dense zzso zzso In particular, it leads to plug zzso We zzso the nucleation mechanism of plugs and their zzso We find that plug boundaries generically expand and we calculate the growth rate of plug zzso In systems whose internal effective dynamic and zzso friction zzso are relatively uniform we find that the linear size of plug regions grows as zzso zzso The suitability of the model to zzso materials is zzso
