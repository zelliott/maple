This paper proposes a method for three zzso gait analysis using zzso sensors and zzso zzso Seven sensor units consisting of a zzso acceleration and gyro sensors, were fixed to the lower zzso The acceleration and angular zzso data of each sensor unit were measured during level zzso The initial zzso of the sensor units were estimated using acceleration data during upright standing position and the angular zzso were estimated afterwards using angular zzso data during zzso Here, an zzso based on zzso calculation was implemented for orientation zzso of the sensor zzso The zzso of the sensor units were converted to the zzso of the body segments by a rotation zzso obtained from a zzso zzso Body segment zzso were then used for constructing a three zzso wire frame animation of the volunteers during the zzso zzso analysis was conducted on five volunteers, and results were compared with those from a zzso motion analysis zzso Comparisons were made for the joint trajectory in the horizontal and zzso zzso The average zzso and correlation zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the hip, knee and ankle zzso angles, zzso
