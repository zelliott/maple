To define the clinical utility of the color zzso zzso zzso surface area zzso method for zzso zzso stroke volume zzso 160 zzso zzso were evaluated in 104 patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso was calculated as 2 zzso zzso zzso V zzso zzso zzso flow zzso where R is the radius corresponding to the first zzso interface zzso of the zzso zzso during the cardiac zzso The zzso integral and peak flow zzso from the zzso zzso recording of the zzso jet were used to correct zzso for zzso variations in zzso zzso Fifteen zzso were excluded because of difficulty in tracing the zzso zzso zzso zzso Among 145 remaining zzso zzso zzso was measurable in 50 zzso of 64 cases of MR and 24 zzso of 35 cases of zzso but in only 12 zzso of 46 cases of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso correlated modestly well with jet zzso area in all zzso valve zzso zzso r zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso However, the correlation improved if only central jets were considered zzso r zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso These findings are not unexpected because jet zzso area zzso the true severity of zzso in cases of eccentric zzso zzso zzso was detected in all severe cases of zzso but in only zzso of cases of mild zzso zzso of cases of mild zzso and zzso of cases of mild zzso zzso zzso zzso The color zzso zzso method is clinically useful in zzso zzso zzso in MR and zzso including mild cases, but is less useful in zzso
