zzso pattern recognition methodology is described for the detection of signatures of volatile organic compounds from passive zzso infrared imaging data collected from an aircraft zzso Data are acquired in an zzso scanning mode with a zzso line scanner based on 8 to 16 spectral channels in the zzso and 3-5 zzso spectral zzso Two controlled release experiments are performed in which zzso of ethanol are generated and detected from aircraft zzso at zzso of zzso to zzso ft zzso to zzso zzso In addition, a methanol release from a chemical manufacturing facility is zzso zzso zzso are developed by application of zzso linear zzso analysis to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso data acquired by the line zzso zzso steps evaluated include contrast enhancement, zzso zzso feature selection, and feature zzso reduction by the minimum noise fraction zzso zzso zzso zzso are developed for both compounds and are tested with data not used in the zzso zzso zzso of temperature and zzso by use of the alpha residual calculation is found to reduce false positive zzso to a negligible level, and the zzso transform is shown to enhance detection zzso
