Recent studies highlighted the disagreement between the typical number of zzso observed with zzso recordings and the ones to be expected based on anatomical and zzso zzso This disagreement has been mainly attributed to the presence of sparsely firing zzso However, it is also possible that this is due to limitations of the spike sorting zzso used to process the zzso To address this issue, we used realistic simulations of zzso recordings and found a relatively poor spike sorting performance for simulations containing a large number of zzso In fact, the number of correctly identified zzso for single-channel recordings showed an zzso behavior zzso at about 8-10 units, when up to 20 units were present in the zzso This performance was significantly poorer for zzso with low firing rates, as these units were twice more likely to be missed than the ones with high firing rates in simulations containing many zzso These results uncover one of the main reasons for the relatively low number of zzso found in zzso recording and also stress the importance of further developments of spike sorting zzso
