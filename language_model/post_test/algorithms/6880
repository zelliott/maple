The ability of iron zzso sand zzso to zzso zzso from synthetic zzso simulating the tank zzso at the zzso Nuclear zzso was examined in this zzso These zzso have high pH and high zzso strength, containing up to zzso M zzso zzso M zzso and zzso M zzso The use of zzso in such applications may be advantageous because it is zzso is zzso and can be prepared from readily available zzso zzso can selectively remove zzso from solutions, even when they contain overwhelmingly higher zzso of potentially competing zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso do not zzso to zzso However, the interference caused by zzso can be substantially overcome by the addition of excess zzso to the solution since zzso zzso Sr from zzso The zzso Sr can be released, and the zzso can be zzso by exposure to dilute acid zzso approximately 3) for short zzso The physical and zzso properties of the zzso remain essentially zzso over at least several dozens of zzso cycles, corresponding to treatment of at least zzso bed volumes of zzso The only byproduct of the zzso process is a small volume of residual waste containing essentially only zzso and dilute zzso
