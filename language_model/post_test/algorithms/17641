zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments have yielded higher calculated zzso zzso than those obtained by zzso penetration zzso A possible explanation of this result is a variable diffusion or partition zzso across the zzso We therefore developed the diffusion model for zzso penetration and zzso to study the effects of either a variable diffusion zzso or variable partition zzso in the SC over the diffusion path zzso zzso zzso lag time, and mean zzso time were obtained from zzso domain zzso zzso inversion of the zzso domain solutions was used for simulations of zzso zzso and amount penetrated zzso zzso zzso and partition zzso zzso were examined using six different zzso The effect of zzso on predicted flux from zzso studies was compared with that obtained in zzso zzso Partition zzso zzso had a more profound effect on predicted zzso than diffusion zzso zzso zzso profiles show even larger dependence on zzso which is consistent with experimental zzso data reported for zzso zzso and other zzso The zzso zzso zzso data were most consistent with the partition zzso decreasing zzso for half the SC and then becoming a constant for the remaining zzso
