To validate the test duration in frequency doubling zzso as an independent criterion to screen for zzso field zzso 

Prospective zzso study 

Group I included 85 eyes (85 zzso with established field defects on automated zzso Group II comprised 41 normal eyes (41 zzso Both groups underwent Swedish interactive testing zzso standard tests as well as frequency doubling zzso zzso A zzso level of 90 seconds was used to calculate test duration sensitivity and zzso We also zzso patients into those who took zzso seconds or less and those who took zzso seconds to complete the test and compared frequency doubling zzso zzso two abnormal points) with Swedish interactive testing zzso in these zzso 

zzso of the test zzso seconds had zzso specificity with zzso zzso Eleven subjects with glaucoma completed test in zzso zzso 

Test duration alone has a limited value in screening for zzso
