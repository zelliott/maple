zzso zzso is widely used to pool zzso association studies zzso in order to a) increase the power to detect strong or weak zzso effects or b) as a result zzso zzso As a consequence of differing zzso panels among zzso chips, zzso is the method of choice within zzso zzso to avoid losing too many zzso in a zzso zzso zzso Another zzso Analysis zzso however, enables zzso conclusions prior to finished and polished zzso runs, which eventually are zzso 

Here we present a fast method to avoid zzso zzso present in only a subset of studies, without relying on zzso This is accomplished by using reference linkage zzso data from 1,000 zzso projects to find zzso together with zzso zzso for zzso missing in at least one zzso MA is conducted by combining association effect estimates of a zzso and those of its zzso Our zzso is implemented in the MA software zzso Association results from zzso analysis applications can be used as input files for MA, tremendously speeding up MA compared to the conventional zzso zzso We show that our proxy zzso is zzso and yields valuable ad hoc results, possibly providing an incentive for follow-up zzso We propose our method as a quick screening step prior to zzso MA, as well as an additional main approach for studies without available reference data matching the zzso of study zzso As a proof of principle, we analyzed six zzso Type II Diabetes zzso and found that the proxy zzso clearly zzso zzso MA on the zzso zzso for 17 out of 23 we observe an improvement on the zzso level by a factor of more than two, and a maximum improvement by a factor of zzso 

zzso is an efficient and fast zzso program which offers various methods, including conventional MA as well as inserting zzso for missing markers to avoid unnecessary power zzso MA with zzso can be readily conducted as zzso provides a generic zzso for zzso tabulated file formats within the zzso field and avoids cumbersome zzso In this way, it supplements the zzso zzso
