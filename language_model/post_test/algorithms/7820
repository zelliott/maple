Mental and zzso motor performance has been reported to be impaired during zzso Current research has focused on zzso explanations zzso deficient zzso zzso and neglected zzso effects zzso zzso emotion, cognitive zzso This study aims at zzso changes in brain cortical activity by using a distributed source zzso zzso zzso to model the probable neural generators of changes in scalp zzso under zzso zzso Brain cortical activity was measured by zzso before, during and after exposure to three time zzso gravity zzso on ten zzso subjects aged zzso zzso Changes in zzso activity were zzso using zzso low resolution brain electromagnetic zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and gamma zzso zzso zzso Individual zzso of blood cortisol and perceived psychological strain were related to changes in cortical current zzso An increase in zzso activity occurred in the right inferior frontal zzso zzso activity was found to be increased in the zzso lobe during zzso Post acceleration zzso and zzso activities declined in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Changes in blood cortisol zzso and perceived strain showed a clear relationship to changes in right sided frontal zzso zzso We conclude that frontal activity during zzso may serve as a marker of zzso This puts a new light on the debate as to whether cognitive and zzso zzso are attributable to primary zzso effects or secondary psychological effects of a zzso zzso
