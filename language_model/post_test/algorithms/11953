We have constructed a human fetal brain zzso library in an zzso coli expression zzso for zzso screening of zzso human zzso Using robot technology, the library was arrayed in zzso plates and zzso onto zzso filter zzso zzso expression clones were detected on the filters using an zzso against the zzso sequence zzso of fusion zzso Positive clones were zzso into a new zzso and 96 randomly chosen clones were zzso zzso products were analyzed by zzso affinity zzso zzso laser zzso mass zzso and the determined protein masses were compared to masses predicted from DNA sequencing zzso It was found that zzso of these clones contained zzso in a correct reading zzso zzso percent of the correct reading frame clones comprised the complete coding sequence of a human zzso zzso zzso plate methods were developed for protein zzso zzso zzso and mass zzso zzso An zzso zzso for zzso zzso activity in native extracts was adapted to the zzso plate zzso Our data indicate that zzso screening of an arrayed protein expression library is an economical way of generating large numbers of clones producing zzso human proteins for structural and functional zzso
