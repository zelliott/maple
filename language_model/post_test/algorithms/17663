In dogs hip joint zzso that can lead to degenerative joint disease zzso is frequent and zzso providing a genetic model for some aspects of the human zzso We have used Portuguese water dogs zzso to identify zzso trait zzso zzso that regulate zzso in the hip zzso A population of zzso zzso each characterized by zzso 500 molecular genetic zzso was analyzed for zzso of the hip joint as measured by the zzso angle, a quantitative zzso measure of zzso A significant directed asymmetry was observed, such that greater zzso was observed in the left than the right zzso This asymmetry was not zzso However, the average zzso angle was highly zzso as were the zzso angles of either the right or left zzso After correction for pedigree effects, two zzso were identified using the metrics of the left and right hips as separate data zzso Both are on canine zzso 1 zzso separated by about 95 zzso One zzso associated with the zzso marker zzso was significant for the left, but not the right zzso The other, associated with zzso was significant for the right but not the left zzso For both zzso some extreme zzso were best explained by specific interactions between zzso
