zzso models indicate that collective animal behavior may emerge from simple local rules of interaction among the zzso However, very little is known about the nature of such interaction, so that models and theories mostly rely on zzso zzso By reconstructing the three-dimensional positions of individual birds in airborne flocks of a few thousand members, we show that the interaction does not depend on the metric distance, as most current models and theories assume, but rather on the zzso zzso In fact, we discovered that each bird interacts on average with a fixed number of neighbors (six to zzso rather than with all neighbors within a fixed metric zzso We argue that a zzso interaction is indispensable to maintain a zzso cohesion against the large density changes caused by external zzso typically zzso We support this hypothesis by zzso simulations, showing that a zzso interaction grants significantly higher cohesion of the zzso compared with a standard metric zzso
