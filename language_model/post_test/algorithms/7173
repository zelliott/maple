Veterinary ultrasound has been used in a large number of animal zzso circumstances while many corresponding applications also call for the use of ultrasound in human zzso However, veterinary ultrasound images are affected by zzso an interference pattern that can reduce the quality and contrast of ultrasound zzso In this paper, a zzso zzso spatial compounding technique for veterinary ultrasound zzso imaging is used to create a compounded veterinary zzso image based on multiple zzso In particular, filtering in the lateral direction has been proved to be able to preserve the zzso information in the zzso and to create zzso between zzso at the expense of some lateral zzso A new method was proposed to obtain zzso zzso data by special veterinary zzso zzso This approach is tested on 275 zzso zzso The effect is accomplished in real-time veterinary zzso imaging with a measurable improvement of zzso Meanwhile, the zzso and electronic noise in the compounded image have been greatly reduced and smoothed in the visual zzso
