zzso reductions from increases in safety belt use are estimated taking into account that drivers who change from being zzso to being users have lower accident involvement rates than the remaining zzso a process referred to as zzso zzso zzso functions are derived which express expected fatality reductions in terms of changes in safety belt use rates from an initial zzso The function parameters are determined by requiring that zzso average crash rates for zzso be zzso higher than the rates for users, a recently determined empirical zzso These functions show that, depending on the initial use rate and use rate increase, selective recruitment may increase or decrease expected fatality zzso However, effects are relatively small, in no case exceeding zzso zzso
