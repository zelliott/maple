To evaluate the performance of a system for automated detection of diabetic zzso in digital retinal photographs, built from published zzso in a large, zzso screening zzso 

We conducted a retrospective analysis of 10,000 consecutive patient visits, specifically exams (four retinal photographs, two left and two right) from zzso unique patients from the zzso diabetic zzso screening project zzso with three types of cameras at 10 zzso zzso criteria included no previous diagnosis of diabetic zzso no previous visit to ophthalmologist for zzso eye exam, and both eyes zzso One of three retinal specialists evaluated each exam as unacceptable quality, no zzso zzso or zzso zzso We then selected exams with sufficient image quality and determined presence or absence of zzso zzso zzso measures included area under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso needed to miss one case zzso and type of false zzso 

Total area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was zzso and zzso was 80 at a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso At this point, zzso of 10,000 exams had sufficient image quality, zzso of zzso zzso were true zzso 59 of zzso zzso were false zzso 319 of zzso zzso were true zzso and zzso of zzso zzso were false zzso zzso percent of false zzso contained large zzso and/or zzso 

zzso detection of diabetic zzso using published zzso cannot yet be recommended for clinical zzso However, performance is such that evaluation on zzso publicly available zzso should be zzso If zzso can be improved, such a system may in the future lead to improved prevention of zzso and vision loss in patients with zzso
