The ability of zzso guided zzso of the knee to assess joint space loss is an important issue in studies of progression and treatment of knee zzso zzso given the practical limitations of protocols involving zzso guided zzso of the zzso We evaluated the ability of the zzso guided zzso zzso protocol to detect knee joint space loss over 3 zzso 

We assessed the zzso zzso precision for measuring minimum joint space zzso zzso the sensitivity for detection of joint space loss using serial films obtained a median of 37 months zzso zzso zzso apart, and the relationship of joint space loss to zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso measures of knee zzso Participants were men and women zzso zzso zzso with knee pain who were participating in the Health, Aging, and Body zzso zzso We assessed baseline zzso zzso and measured zzso using a computerized zzso zzso knee zzso obtained over the same zzso were evaluated for cartilage zzso 

A total of 153 knees were zzso zzso of which had zzso zzso at zzso The mean zzso zzso joint space loss for all knees over 3 years was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso In knees with zzso at zzso the mean zzso zzso joint space loss over 3 years was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in knees with joint space narrowing at zzso joint space loss was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Joint space loss and its standardized response mean increased with the severity of baseline joint space narrowing and with the presence of cartilage zzso at baseline and worsening during zzso 

zzso of the knee in the zzso view provides a sensitive and valid measure of joint space loss in multiyear zzso studies of knee zzso without the use of zzso to aid knee zzso
