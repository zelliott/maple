The limited spatial resolution of zzso causes a partial volume effect zzso and can lead to the significant zzso of regional zzso concentration in the small structures surrounded by a low zzso zzso such as the cortical gray matter of an zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to zzso using zzso and zzso normal zzso of elderly subjects with and without zzso correction zzso and to determine regional differences in the effect of zzso and their association with the regional tissue fraction of the zzso 

zzso zzso zzso using zzso was performed in 33 healthy elderly subjects (18 zzso 15 zzso zzso years old) using the zzso zzso We corrected zzso for zzso using segmented MR images, and analyzed quantitative zzso and regional differences in the effect of zzso using tissue zzso of gray matter zzso and white matter zzso in regions of interest zzso placed on the cortical and zzso zzso regions and deep zzso zzso 

The mean zzso in zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for males and zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for males and zzso zzso The mean zzso in zzso after zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for males and zzso zzso There were statistically significant differences in the effect of zzso among zzso but not between zzso The effect of zzso was small in the zzso and zzso zzso and it was large in the superior frontal zzso superior zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso in zzso recovered significantly, but did not reach values as high as those obtained by invasive methods or in the zzso PET study that used zzso There were significant regional differences in the effect of zzso which were considered to result from regional differences in zzso tissue zzso which is more reduced in the zzso regions in the zzso brain of the zzso
