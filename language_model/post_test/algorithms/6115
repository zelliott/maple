zzso zzso transform zzso which is the zzso shape zzso of zzso has desirable properties for representing shape information in a small number of features with no zzso However, in order for ART to be useful, especially in limited computing zzso the zzso cost of ART must be greatly zzso In this paper, we derive zzso properties from the basis functions of ART and present a fast and efficient method to zzso the ART zzso using these zzso The proposed method significantly reduces the number of zzso operations and zzso in computing the zzso of zzso Moreover, the memory requirements needed to store the ART basis functions in zzso tables are only zzso of the conventional zzso The experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed zzso
