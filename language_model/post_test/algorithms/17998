zzso zzso zzso de zzso Design of zzso is a zzso tool for automatic zzso design of molecules within a protein binding site of known zzso A genetic zzso and a zzso search act in concert to join zzso fragments with a zzso list of zzso A novel feature of zzso is the simultaneous zzso of force field energy and a term enforcing zzso to known zzso or zzso to known binding zzso zzso hopping can be promoted by tuning the relative weights of these zzso The performance of zzso is tested on zzso zzso 2 zzso using a library of about 14 zzso fragments and the binding mode of a known zzso inhibitor to bias the zzso Top ranking zzso molecules are involved in one to three hydrogen bonds with the backbone polar groups in the hinge region of zzso an interaction pattern observed in potent zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso with very favorable predicted binding affinity shares a zzso zzso with a known zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso molecules with a favorable zzso score are synthetic zzso In fact, eight of the zzso molecules designed by zzso for zzso are found in the zzso database of commercially available compounds which also contains about 600 compounds with identical scaffolds as those in the top ranking zzso zzso
