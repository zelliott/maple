A zzso efficient approach that zzso the optimal zzso zzso for the zzso scheme is developed for zzso zzso This approach is based on the least zzso decomposition which is a well-known zzso reduction technique for a large system of zzso It is shown that the proposed framework is effective in terms of quantitative and qualitative reconstructions of initial pressure distribution enabled via finding an optimal zzso zzso The zzso efficiency and performance of the proposed method are shown using a test case of zzso blood vessel zzso where the initial pressure is exactly known for quantitative zzso
