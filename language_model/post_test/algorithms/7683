zzso matching of cortical surfaces is necessary in many zzso zzso In this context zzso are often zzso because they facilitate further statistical analysis and zzso zzso Present methods for computing zzso are based on zzso flows or on inflating surfaces to a common template, but they are often zzso zzso It typically takes several hours on a conventional zzso computer to match a single pair of cortical surfaces having a few hundred thousand zzso We propose a very fast alternative based on an application of spectral graph theory on a novel association zzso Our zzso approach can generate a zzso correspondence map within a few minutes on high-resolution zzso while avoiding the sign and zzso ambiguities of conventional spectral matching zzso The zzso are shared between surfaces and provide a smooth zzso of zzso These properties are exploited to zzso differentials on highly folded cortical zzso zzso can thus be verified and invalid surface folding zzso Our method is demonstrated to attain a zzso accuracy that is at least as good as that of zzso and zzso Demons but in only a fraction of their processing zzso As a practical experiment, we construct an unbiased zzso of cortical surfaces with a speed several orders of magnitude faster than current zzso
