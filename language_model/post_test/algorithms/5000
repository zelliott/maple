zzso association studies attempting to unravel the genetic zzso of complex traits have recently gained zzso zzso these studies employ a sequential zzso zzso A large panel of markers is examined in a zzso of subjects, and the most promising markers are zzso in the remaining zzso In this article, we introduce a novel method for such designs enabling investigators to, for example, modify marker zzso and sample proportions while strongly controlling the zzso type I error zzso Loss of efficiency is avoided by zzso conditional type I error rates of discarded zzso Our approach can be combined with cost optimal designs and zzso a greater flexibility than all previously suggested zzso Among other features, it allows for marker selections based upon biological criteria instead of statistical criteria alone, or the option to modify the sample size at any time during the course of the zzso For practical zzso we develop a new algorithm, subsequently evaluate it by simulations, and illustrate it using a real data zzso
