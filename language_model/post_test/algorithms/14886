zzso biologists frequently can obtain interesting insight by aligning a set of related DNA, zzso or protein zzso Such alignments can be used to determine either evolutionary or functional zzso Our interest is in identifying functional zzso Unless the sequences are very similar, it is necessary to have a specific strategy for zzso zzso zzso of the aligned zzso If the alignment is not known, one can be determined by finding an alignment that zzso the scoring zzso 

We describe four components to our approach for determining alignments of multiple zzso First, we review a zzso scoring scheme we call information zzso Second, we describe two methods for zzso the P value of an individual information content zzso zzso a method that combines a technique from zzso statistics with zzso calculations; zzso a method that is exclusively zzso Third, we describe how we count the number of possible alignments given the overall amount of sequence zzso This count is multiplied by the P value to determine the expected frequency of an information content score and, thus, the statistical significance of the corresponding zzso zzso significance can be used to compare alignments having differing zzso and containing differing numbers of zzso Fourth, we describe a greedy zzso for determining alignments of functionally related zzso Finally, we test the accuracy of our P value calculations, and give an example of using our zzso to identify binding sites for the zzso coli zzso zzso 

Programs were developed under the zzso operating system and are available by anonymous zzso from zzso
