Studies of the response of the immune system to zzso zzso virus zzso during primary infection have shown that a zzso of zzso zzso with an activated zzso and reduced expression of the zzso chain zzso zzso T zzso expands to reach up to zzso of the total zzso T cell zzso The expansion of this zzso is considered to be a signature of zzso and an indicator of immune system zzso We use a simple mathematical zzso to study the relationships over time between the dose of infection, the size of the zzso population, and the circulating viral load in cats infected with zzso zzso profiles are described using a combination of two exponential laws, whereas the zzso percentage (out of the total zzso zzso is represented by a zzso law including an expansion phase and a zzso zzso Model parameters are estimated with a population approach using data from 102 zzso infected zzso We examine the dose of infection as a potential zzso of zzso We find that the rates of increase of viral load and of zzso percentage are both correlated with the dose of zzso Cats that develop strong acute zzso also show the largest degree of zzso zzso The two simple models are robust tools for zzso the time course of zzso percentage and circulating viral load in zzso cats and may be useful for generating new insights on the disease and on the design of therapeutic strategies, potentially zzso to zzso zzso
