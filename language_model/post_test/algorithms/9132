zzso zzso zzso have been used to find efficient solutions to numerous fundamental and applied zzso While zzso are a robust and flexible approach to solve complex problems, there are some situations under which they perform zzso Here, we introduce a genetic zzso approach that is able to solve complex tasks plagued by so-called zzso fitness zzso Our approach, which we zzso variable environment genetic zzso zzso is able to find highly efficient solutions by inducing environmental changes that require more complex solutions and thus creating an evolutionary zzso Using the density zzso task, a zzso computer science problem, as a case study, we show that more complex rules that preserve information about the solution to simpler tasks can adapt to more challenging zzso Interestingly, we find that conservative strategies, which have a bias toward the current state, evolve naturally as a highly efficient solution to the density zzso task under noisy zzso
