zzso analysis has proven to be a useful tool in analysis of various phenomena in numerous zzso sciences including biology and zzso It has been widely used in quantitative zzso studies mainly in calculating the zzso dimension of zzso The zzso dimension describes an zzso zzso it is higher if the object is more complex, that is, its border more zzso its linear structure more winding, or its space more zzso We use a manual version of Richardson's zzso method and a most popular computer-based zzso method applying to the problem of measuring the zzso dimension of zzso zzso in zzso We also compare how these methods work with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that for zzso zzso the mean box dimension of zzso images is significantly larger than that of zzso zzso We also show that the zzso method is sensitive to an zzso orientation, whereas the zzso dimension is unaffected by zzso and zzso We show that the mean zzso dimension measured using the zzso method is significantly smaller than that measured using the zzso zzso Whereas the zzso method requires defined usage that limits its utility for analyzing zzso zzso the zzso method based on Richardson's model presented here can be used more zzso Although this method is rather tedious to use zzso an accessible computer-based zzso for the zzso has not yet been made zzso
