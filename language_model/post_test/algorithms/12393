zzso spin labeling zzso zzso zzso allow the follow-up of muscle zzso with high zzso resolution during a stress zzso zzso image processing is proposed to estimate zzso maps from zzso zzso It is based on two successive zzso at first, automated rejection of the image pairs between which a large displacement is detected is performed, followed by factor analysis of the dynamic data and cluster analysis to zzso zzso with large signal variation characteristic of zzso Then, after masking these zzso zzso factor analysis and cluster analysis are further applied to separate the different muscles between low or high zzso increase, yielding a functional map of the zzso Data from 10 subjects (five normal volunteers and five elite zzso had been zzso zzso time zzso zzso from a region of interest zzso in active muscles show a good accordance whether extracted with automated processing or with manual zzso This method of functional zzso allows automated suppression of vessels and fast zzso of muscles with high, medium or low zzso without any a zzso zzso
