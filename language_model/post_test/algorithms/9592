Main objectives of the present work were to develop an internationally agreed methodology for zzso zzso zzso strategies in rural areas that are still affected by the zzso accident, and to give an overview of the zzso situation in the three affected countries, Belarus, Russia and zzso Study settlements were defined by having in 2004 less than 10,000 inhabitants and official dose estimates exceeding 1 zzso Data on population, current farming practices, contamination of zzso and zzso and remedial actions previously applied were collected for each of such zzso study zzso zzso of the annual effective dose from internal radiation were validated with extensive data sets on whole body counter zzso According to our calculations for 2004, in 290 of the study settlements the effective dose exceeded 1 zzso and the collective dose in these settlements amounted to about 66 zzso Six remedial actions were zzso radical improvement of zzso application of zzso to cows, feeding pigs with zzso fodder before slaughter, application of mineral zzso for potato fields, information campaign on contaminated forest produce, and replacement of contaminated soil in populated areas by zzso zzso Side effects of the remedial actions were zzso by a zzso of zzso zzso are presented for two zzso strategies, zzso Strategy 1, in which the degree of zzso was given a priority, and zzso Strategy 2, in which remedial actions were chosen according to lowest costs per averted dose zzso zzso are highly zzso varying from preference for soil replacement in populated areas in Belarus to preference for application of zzso to cows in zzso zzso actions in 2010 can avert a large collective dose of about 150 zzso (including averted doses, which would be received in the following zzso Nevertheless, the number of inhabitants in zzso and Russian settlements with annual doses exceeding 1 zzso remains zzso Compared to international values for the zzso of actions to reduce occupational zzso the recommended zzso strategies for rural areas affected by the zzso accident are quite cost-effective (about 20 zzso
