We have previously described the use of zzso zzso as zzso zzso of zzso and advantageous zzso interface zzso The use of zzso to establish stable recording and stimulation of zzso zzso results in a high zzso ratio zzso potentially zzso and low-cost alternative to conventional zzso zzso Here we confirm the consistent achievement of high zzso with zzso and systematically characterize the impact of zzso geometry on the measured signals via zzso simulations and in zzso zzso We demonstrate and zzso how channels with a length of zzso zzso and channel cross section of zzso zzso support spontaneous formation of seals and yield spike sizes in the zzso zzso Despite the low degree of complexity involved in their fabrication and use, zzso devices provide a zzso mean zzso of 101 zzso 76, which compares zzso with the zzso obtained from typical zzso zzso
