From the 1950s computer based renderings of molecules have been produced to aid researchers in their understanding of zzso structure and zzso A major consideration for any molecular graphics software is the ability to zzso the three zzso structure of the zzso Traditionally, this was accomplished via zzso pairs of images and later zzso with three zzso display zzso Using a zzso feedback device in combination with molecular graphics has the potential to enhance three zzso zzso Although zzso feedback devices have been used to feel the interaction forces during molecular zzso they have not been used explicitly as an aid to zzso 

A zzso rendering application for zzso zzso has been developed that allows the user to gain three-dimensional awareness of the shape of a zzso By using a water zzso as the probe, zzso as an oxygen atom having zzso interactions with the zzso the process of exploration has the further benefit of being able to determine regions on the molecular surface that are accessible to the zzso This gives insight into how awkward it is for a water zzso to gain access to or escape from channels and zzso indicating possible zzso zzso In the case of liver alcohol zzso bound to the inhibitor zzso it was found that there is a channel just wide enough for a single water zzso to pass zzso zzso the probe zzso with zzso water molecules suggests that they are sometimes located within small pockets that provide a zzso stable environment irrespective of hydrogen bonding zzso 

By using the software, named zzso zzso (available from zzso one can explore the accessible surface of zzso using a three-dimensional input device to gain insights into the shape and water accessibility of the zzso surface that cannot be so easily attained using conventional molecular graphics zzso
