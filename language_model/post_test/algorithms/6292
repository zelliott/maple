zzso zzso is an emerging method for zzso imaging of human zzso using zzso zzso Generally, the tissue is assumed zzso but this may not always be zzso In this paper, we present a method for the zzso of optical zzso zzso allowing the background to be zzso To solve the forward problem, we model the light propagation in tissue using an zzso diffusion zzso The inverse problem consists of the zzso of the zzso zzso based on boundary zzso Generally, the background zzso cannot be assumed to be zzso We treat the uncertainties in the background zzso zzso values as zzso error, and include this in our model and zzso We present zzso examples based on simulated zzso For reference, examples using an zzso inversion scheme are also zzso The estimates are zzso different for the two zzso
