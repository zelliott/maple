The effects of the muscle zzso on the zzso zzso neural control have not previously been analyzed over the entire operating range of the zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso rabbits zzso zzso zzso we isolated carotid zzso and changed zzso zzso pressure zzso from 40 to 160 zzso in increments of 20 zzso every minute while recording zzso sympathetic nerve activity zzso and zzso pressure zzso Muscle zzso was induced by passive muscle stretch (5 zzso of tension) of the zzso Muscle stretch shifted the zzso relationship zzso zzso to a higher zzso whereas it did not affect the zzso relationship zzso zzso zzso was almost doubled zzso 63 zzso 15 to 118 zzso 14 arbitrary units zzso P zzso zzso at the zzso level of 93 zzso 8 zzso and zzso was increased approximately 50% by muscle zzso When the zzso negative feedback loop was closed, muscle stretch increased zzso from 63 zzso 15 to 81 zzso 21 au zzso zzso zzso and zzso from 93 zzso 8 to 109 zzso 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the muscle zzso zzso the neural arc to a higher zzso which moves the operating point towards a higher zzso and zzso under zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso equilibrium zzso indicated that changes in the neural arc induced by the muscle zzso might compensate for pressure falls resulting from zzso zzso
