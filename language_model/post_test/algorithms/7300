We report the theoretical description and the experimental demonstration of an optical zzso formed by inserting a zzso Bragg zzso zzso in a closed fiber zzso The spectral characteristics of such a zzso strongly depend on the zzso of the zzso In the wavelength region where the zzso zzso R is zzso the system behaves like a conventional ring zzso On the other hand, when R is not zzso a zzso structure can be observed, associated to the zzso removal of two zzso resonant zzso The magnitude of the mode splitting can be used to sense small variations of the zzso physical zzso such as zzso temperature or group zzso An example of strain sensing with this setup is reported, showing that the mode splitting is sensitive to a mechanical strain applied to the zzso while it is almost insensitive to a strain applied to any other point of the zzso This peculiar feature allows to perform zzso local strain zzso with a reduced sensitivity to environmental zzso which represents an important improvement in the framework of the fiber-optic zzso
