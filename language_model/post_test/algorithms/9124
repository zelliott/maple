zzso neural zzso are designed to provide a high spatial and zzso precision control signal implementing high degree of freedom real-time prosthetic zzso The development of a Radio zzso zzso wireless neural interface has the potential to expand the number of applications as well as extend the zzso and longevity compared to wired neural zzso However, it is well known that zzso signal is absorbed by the body and can result in tissue zzso In this work, zzso studies with zzso zzso are performed to provide an assessment of power, heating and specific zzso rate zzso associated with the wireless zzso zzso within the human zzso The receiving antenna on the neural interface is designed with different zzso and modeled at a range of implanted depths within the brain in order to estimate the maximum receiving power without violating zzso and tissue temperature zzso safety zzso Based on the size of the designed zzso sets of zzso between 1 zzso to 4 zzso have been zzso As expected the simulations demonstrate that longer receiving antennas zzso and lower working zzso result in greater power availability prior to violating zzso zzso For a 15 zzso zzso antenna operating at zzso zzso on the surface of the brain, 730 zzso of power could be harvested at the Federal Communications Commission zzso zzso violation zzso At approximately 5 zzso inside the head, this same antenna would receive 190 zzso of power prior to violating zzso zzso Finally, the 3-D zzso simulation results show that for all evaluated antennas and frequency combinations we reach zzso zzso limits well before 1 zzso It is clear that powering neural zzso via zzso is possible, but zzso power circuit designs combined with advanced simulation will be required to develop a functional antenna that meets all system zzso
