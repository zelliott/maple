Analysis of protein zzso is a major challenge in zzso here we present a zzso based methodology, which is suitable to determine zzso zzso zzso A few zzso zzso is sufficient to determine zzso patterns (which opens the way for biomedical zzso and requires at least two separate zzso zzso One is using tandem mass zzso (for structure zzso the other single stage zzso mode (for zzso Analysis relies heavily on data zzso The previously developed zzso zzso and software was used to identify zzso in zzso zzso We have developed a new zzso and software zzso which evaluates single stage mass zzso both in terms of zzso identification (for minor zzso and zzso Identification of zzso structures based on zzso analysis has a false positive rate of zzso Minor zzso (when sensitivity is insufficient to obtain an zzso zzso can be identified in single stage zzso using zzso but in such a case the false positive rate is increased to zzso zzso is studied at the zzso level zzso following zzso zzso This way the sugar chains can be unequivocally assigned to a given zzso site zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis has the further advantage that zzso zzso patterns can be identified in complex zzso and not only in zzso zzso This opens the way for medium high zzso analysis of zzso zzso examples of zzso zzso patterns of zzso zzso zzso and on a therapeutic zzso zzso zzso are also zzso
