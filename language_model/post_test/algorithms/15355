Besides the well-known cardiac risk factors for zzso increasing concerns have been raised regarding the cardiac zzso of antipsychotic zzso A zzso analysis of zzso regulation, based on cardiovascular zzso can provide additional information about heart rate zzso and blood pressure regulatory patterns within the complex interactions of the cardiovascular zzso We introduce a new high-resolution zzso analysis method zzso based on joint symbolic dynamics zzso which is characterized by three zzso a threshold zzso dynamic zzso zzso for time series transformation and eight zzso pattern zzso This is based on a zzso reduction strategy used to zzso and characterize cardiovascular zzso In this study, short-term zzso zzso and zzso blood pressure zzso time series of 42 zzso zzso and 42 zzso patients zzso suffering from acute schizophrenia were zzso to establish the suitability of the new method for zzso the effects of zzso on cardiovascular zzso We were able to demonstrate that zzso applying the threshold based on spontaneous zzso sensitivity zzso zzso revealed eight significant pattern families that were able to zzso the zzso effects of zzso and the related changes of cardiovascular regulation zzso in zzso in comparison to zzso This was in contrast to the simple zzso zzso zzso zzso and only partly to standard linear zzso zzso zzso zzso provides strong evidence that zzso regulation in zzso seems to be, to some extent, predominated by zzso zzso responses in combination with alternating SP values in contrast to zzso indicating an impairment of the zzso control feedback loop in zzso zzso data analysis was applied to test for the significance and zzso of cardiovascular zzso in the original data due to medical treatment with antipsychotic drugs in zzso In conclusion, the application of zzso revealed detailed information about short-term zzso cardiovascular zzso and cardiovascular zzso regulatory mechanisms zzso of zzso function due to the zzso effects of zzso in patients with acute zzso
