A new program zzso zzso zzso was developed to scan the zzso zzso zzso for Class I zzso zzso zzso zzso I, Post I, II, and III were identified and expanded in known zzso by primary sequence and secondary structural analysis through hidden zzso model profiling of both a zzso reference database and a reference database of zzso with solved three-dimensional zzso The roles of the zzso zzso acids in the four motifs of the zzso structure and function were then analyzed to expand the previously defined zzso zzso negative log statistical zzso sets were developed from the prevalence of zzso acids in the zzso Multiple zzso zzso is able to scan the zzso and score different combinations of the top fitting sequences for each zzso In addition, the program takes into account the zzso number of zzso acids between the zzso The output of the program is a ranked list of proteins that can be used to identify new zzso and to zzso the assignment of previously identified putative zzso The Multiple zzso zzso program can be used to develop a putative list of zzso for any type of protein that has one or more motifs zzso at variable zzso and is freely available zzso Finally hidden zzso model profile zzso analysis was used to zzso Class I zzso into groups that reflect their zzso zzso zzso
