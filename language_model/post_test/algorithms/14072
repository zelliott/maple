To evaluate the technical feasibility of two zzso zzso cluster analysis, and scout geometry zzso automatic identification of the left zzso zzso cavity in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The DC zzso uses zzso zzso zzso cluster analysis of zzso images from a zzso zzso recovery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso images from a zzso free zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso employs geometric information from scout views zzso vertical zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso incorporate additional geometric continuity constraints along with zzso region zzso to identify the zzso The performance of both zzso was compared on images of eight healthy volunteers, and the zzso zzso was further evaluated on images of 13 clinical zzso 

The DC zzso identified the zzso in zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso at zzso zzso of the images from healthy volunteers, compared to zzso zzso at zzso and zzso at zzso by the zzso zzso Both methods are robust against zzso signal variations and zzso The DC method suffers from zzso between the dual zzso zzso and zzso images near the zzso at zzso The zzso method identified the zzso in zzso zzso at zzso and zzso at zzso of the images from clinical zzso 

The zzso method requires no additional zzso is robust and accurate, and performs better than the DC method for automatic identification of the zzso
