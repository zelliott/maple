For real-time zzso imaging of the human body, a linear array zzso and reflection mode optical zzso is preferably zzso Experimental outcomes however revealed that such a setup results in significant image background, which prevents imaging structures at the ultimate depth limited only by the optical zzso of the irradiating light and the signal noise zzso Various sources of image background, such as bulk tissue zzso reconstruction artifacts, and zzso zzso could be zzso To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel method that results in significantly reduced background and increased imaging zzso For this purpose, we zzso in zzso a series of zzso and zzso images while the tissue sample is gradually zzso by an zzso applied zzso zzso signals and background signals are differently affected by the deformation and can thus be distinguished by image zzso This method takes advantage of a combined zzso device and has a strong potential for improving real-time zzso imaging of deep tissue zzso
