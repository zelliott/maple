Most proteins have evolved in specific cellular compartments that limit their functions and potential zzso On the other hand, motifs define zzso acid arrangements zzso between protein family members and represent powerful tools for assigning function to protein zzso The ideal motif would identify all members of a protein family but in practice many motifs identify both family members and unrelated zzso referred to as True Positive zzso and False Positive zzso zzso zzso 

To address the relationship between protein zzso protein function and cellular zzso we systematically assigned zzso zzso data to motif sequences from the comprehensive zzso sequence motif zzso Using this data we analyzed relationships between zzso and zzso We find that zzso and zzso have a strong tendency to zzso in different zzso When multiple zzso are considered, zzso are usually distributed between related cellular zzso We also identified cases where zzso are concentrated in particular zzso regions, indicating possible functional or evolutionary relationships with zzso sequences of the same zzso 

Our findings suggest that the systematic examination of zzso zzso has the potential to uncover evolutionary and functional relationships between zzso zzso We believe that this type of analysis zzso existing motif zzso and could aid in their zzso Our results shed light on the evolution of cellular zzso and potentially establish the basis for new zzso zzso and function prediction zzso
