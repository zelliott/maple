The mechanisms of liver injury in chronic zzso C virus zzso infection are poorly zzso Recent evidence suggests that zzso stress and zzso play a major zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the serum level of oxidized zzso zzso zzso and evaluate its association with different clinically valuable parameters of liver disease in patients with chronic zzso zzso 

zzso zzso chronic zzso C patients and 45 healthy adult volunteers, matched for age, sex and zzso were zzso Blood samples were collected after 12 h of zzso and serum zzso zzso liver zzso zzso profile, zzso time and zzso were zzso zzso load of zzso was determined in zzso Liver biopsy was performed in patients and the stage of zzso and grade of zzso activity were zzso Healthy controls did not undergo liver zzso 

zzso was significantly higher in zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso was significantly correlated to viral load zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and grade of inflammation zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher in zzso zzso zzso zzso No significant association was found between zzso and zzso zzso serum zzso liver zzso or zzso zzso 

This study provided new data from an in zzso setting which suggests the contribution of zzso to zzso zzso Our results encourage further clinical studies to evaluate the potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications of zzso in zzso zzso
