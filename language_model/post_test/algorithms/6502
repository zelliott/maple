zzso zzso has the goal of distinguishing different zzso instead of each element in a zzso An zzso array provides an zzso zzso method to identify differences in DNA sequence among individuals, which is fundamental for zzso As the cost and difficulty of designing and zzso the zzso array dramatically increase with the number of zzso used, it is therefore important to have a design with a minimum number of zzso meeting the requirement of zzso zzso The first zzso for designing and selecting zzso for zzso zzso zzso typing is zzso The goal in zzso the zzso was to select a minimum number of zzso from a large probe set on the premise of minimum loss of zzso The algorithm, which was based on zzso conditional zzso and mutual information theory, was used to select the minimum number of zzso from a large probe zzso The zzso was tested on a human zzso zzso zzso sequence data set Thirty zzso were selected from 390 zzso for zzso and 60 zzso were selected from 767 zzso for zzso Although the number of zzso was reduced by almost ten times, the zzso was reduced only a little, by zzso (from zzso to zzso for zzso and zzso (from zzso to zzso for zzso zzso This is a satisfactory and practical zzso
