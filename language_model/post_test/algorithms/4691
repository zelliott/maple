This work is framed in the field of statistical face zzso In particular, the problem of accurate zzso of prominent features of the face in frontal view images is zzso We propose a method that zzso linear Active Shape Models zzso which have already been used for this zzso The technique is built upon the development of a zzso intensity model, incorporating a reduced set of differential zzso features as local image zzso These features are zzso to rigid zzso and a subset of them is chosen by zzso Feature zzso for each landmark and resolution zzso The new approach overcomes the zzso and zzso assumptions of classical zzso regarding the distribution of the intensity values across the training zzso Our methodology has demonstrated a significant improvement in zzso precision as compared to the linear zzso and zzso Features zzso (a zzso extension of the pioneer zzso in the tests performed on zzso zzso and zzso zzso
