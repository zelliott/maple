zzso zzso zzso zzso attempts to reconstruct the internal zzso distribution in a medium from electrical zzso at zzso on the medium zzso One key difficulty with zzso zzso is due to the position uncertainty of the electrodes, especially for medical applications, in which the body surface moves during breathing and posture zzso In this paper, we develop a new approach which directly reconstructs both zzso movements and internal zzso changes for difference zzso The reconstruction problem is formulated in terms of a zzso zzso using an zzso zzso sensitive to zzso change and zzso zzso A reconstruction prior term is zzso to impose a zzso constraint on both the spatial distribution of zzso change and zzso zzso A zzso zzso imaging zzso is then implemented based on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Images were reconstructed using the zzso of this paper with data from simulated zzso and zzso zzso changes and zzso movements, and from saline phantom zzso zzso showed good reconstruction of the actual zzso movements, as well as a dramatic reduction in image zzso compared to images from the standard algorithm, which did not account for zzso zzso
