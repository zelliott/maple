zzso zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso is a powerful and zzso tool for the analysis of molecular structures, zzso and zzso However, the zzso of magnetic fields experienced by samples will destroy spectral information and hinder spectral zzso In this study, a new pulse sequence is proposed based on the zzso of distant zzso field to recover high-resolution zzso zzso correlated zzso zzso from zzso zzso 

By using the new zzso the correlation information between coupled spins and the J coupled information with straightforward zzso patterns can be obtained free from zzso line zzso In addition, the new sequence is also suitable for zzso coupled spin zzso Although three-dimensional acquisition is needed, the evolution of indirect detection dimensions is carefully designed and the zzso acquisition scheme is zzso to improve the acquisition zzso A chemical solution of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso in a zzso magnetic field was tested to demonstrate the zzso details of the new zzso The performance of the new sequence relative to the conventional zzso sequence was shown by using an zzso solution of main brain zzso in a zzso magnetic zzso 

The results reveal that the new sequence provides an attractive way to eliminate the zzso spectral line broadening for the zzso correlated spectrum and is a promising tool for the study of zzso in zzso even for the applications on in zzso and in zzso high-resolution zzso zzso zzso
