We have previously performed quantitative kinetic modeling of zzso zzso a new zzso zzso for the zzso zzso site of the zzso zzso We now report a zzso zzso which eliminates the need for zzso blood zzso Dynamic zzso scanning and zzso blood sampling were performed in 7 healthy zzso Good agreement was obtained between kinetic and equilibrium zzso zzso scanning with a zzso protocol is a valid method to estimate the total volume of distribution for zzso zzso in clinical zzso
