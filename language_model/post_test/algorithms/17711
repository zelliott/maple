This paper presents a new method for creating a single panoramic image of a long bone from several individual zzso X-ray zzso zzso images are useful preoperatively for diagnosis, and zzso for long bone zzso zzso for making anatomical zzso and for documenting surgical zzso Our method composes individual overlapping images into an zzso panoramic view that is the equivalent of a single X-ray image with a wide field of zzso The correlations between the images are established from the zzso of a zzso ruler zzso alongside the long zzso Unlike existing methods, ours uses readily available hardware, requires a simple image acquisition protocol with minimal user zzso and works with existing zzso zzso units without zzso It is robust and accurate, producing panoramas whose quality and spatial resolution is comparable to that of the individual zzso The method has been successfully tested on in zzso and clinical zzso
