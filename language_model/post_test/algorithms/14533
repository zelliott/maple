zzso zzso interruptions are zzso during the resuscitation of cardiac arrest patients, especially immediately prior to shock zzso 

To evaluate the effect of use of a new zzso technology, which filters zzso artifact and provides reliable rhythm analysis with automatic zzso charging during chest zzso on zzso chest zzso zzso 

Thirty subjects (20 basic life support zzso 10 advanced life support zzso worked in pairs to perform two randomly ordered simulated cardiac zzso with the zzso operating in either standard mode zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso automated external zzso zzso or the new Analysis and zzso during zzso zzso zzso During each resuscitation zzso rescuers switched roles as chest zzso and zzso operator every two segments of zzso (one segment zzso 2 minutes of chest zzso rhythm analysis, and shock delivery, if zzso for eight total zzso The participants rested zzso minutes between trials and received brief zzso training zzso zzso 30 zzso ALS zzso 5 zzso Heart rate and perceived exertion were measured with pulse zzso and the zzso scale, zzso 

Mean zzso standard zzso zzso chest zzso pause time was considerably shorter in each zzso segment with zzso versus standard zzso operation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso demonstrating effective use of zzso with minimal zzso Despite reduced chest zzso interruption with zzso zzso fatigue and perceived exertion did not differ in any zzso segment with standard zzso operation versus zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso pause time is reduced by zzso utilizing a novel technology that employs automated analysis and charging during chest zzso Although chest zzso pause time is reduced with the use of the new technology, participants do not excessively zzso
