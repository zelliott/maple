In the zzso determination of bacterial growth rates was an important tool in microbial zzso zzso molecular biology, and microbial zzso The exciting technical developments of the 1990s and the 2000s eclipsed that zzso as a result, many investigators today lack experience with growth rate zzso Recently, investigators in a number of areas have started to use zzso of bacterial growth rates for a variety of zzso Those zzso have been greatly facilitated by the availability of zzso plate readers that permit the simultaneous zzso on up to zzso different zzso Only the exponential zzso portions of the resulting growth zzso are useful for determining growth rates, and manual determination of that portion and calculation of growth rates can be tedious for zzso zzso Here, we introduce the program zzso that uses plate reader output files to automatically determine the exponential portion of the curve and to automatically calculate the growth rate, the maximum culture density, and the duration of the growth lag zzso zzso is freely available for Macintosh, Windows, and zzso We discuss the effects of culture volume, the classical bacterial growth curve, and the differences between zzso in rich media and minimal zzso zzso zzso This protocol covers zzso of the plate reader, growth of culture zzso for both rich and minimal media, and experimental zzso As a guide to zzso we report typical day-to-day variation in growth rates and variation within experiments with respect to position of zzso within the zzso
