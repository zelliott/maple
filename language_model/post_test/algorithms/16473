zzso zzso zzso exhibits distinct zzso features compared to zzso zzso zzso Previous studies have discovered several molecular genetic features in zzso zzso zzso but have limitations as they are confined to a small number of zzso To understand the zzso zzso zzso system, this study was designed to identify genes that are zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments were performed using human zzso zzso chips with 25 zzso and 27 zzso cancer zzso zzso expressed genes zzso were determined by Welch's zzso and more accurate zzso were selected from the zzso using the prediction analysis for zzso zzso software zzso zzso results were validated using quantitative real-time zzso The identified gene set was functionally investigated through in zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified and the 50 highest ranking genes could be used to accurately zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The identified gene set included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso were validated by quantitative real-time zzso The functions of these zzso were related to zzso zzso zzso cell cycle progression (6 zzso invasion (2 zzso zzso (7 zzso cell zzso and proliferation (5 zzso and zzso metabolism (3 zzso We suggest that zzso has distinct molecular characteristics from zzso and therefore, that the expression signatures of zzso may improve the understanding of molecular zzso and clinical behaviors in zzso
