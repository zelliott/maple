The zzso of face space is measured zzso in a zzso zzso Within this zzso we obtain a measurement of the dimension for the human visual zzso Using an zzso basis, evidence is presented that talented human observers are able to identify familiar faces that lie in a space of roughly 100 dimensions and the average observer requires a space of between 100 and 200 zzso This is below most current zzso It is further argued that these estimates give an upper bound for face space dimension and this might be lowered by better constructed zzso and by talented zzso
