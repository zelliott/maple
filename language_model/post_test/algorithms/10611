Here we present a full overview of the Critical Assessment of zzso zzso zzso zzso comparative modeling zzso zzso accuracy for the 43 comparative modeling targets was assessed through detailed zzso comparisons between predicted and experimental zzso zzso using standard measures for model backbone quality and structural alignment accuracy highlighted a small number of groups with stand out predictions and these findings were backed up by statistical zzso We were able to carry out evaluations of zzso contacts predictions and zzso zzso zzso for which one group turned out to have statistically better zzso We also assessed the prediction quality of structurally divergent regions and biologically important zzso Interestingly we were able to show that zzso were not predicting these important functional regions with any greater accuracy than the rest of the zzso In addition we investigated the ability of zzso to build models that improve on the structural template and reached some tentative conclusions from comparisons with the previous zzso zzso
