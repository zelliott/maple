The zzso chemical shift is a sensitive reporter of zzso secondary structure and its zzso environment, and it is potentially rich with information about both backbone zzso angles and hydrogen zzso We report results from zzso and solid-state zzso and zzso zzso studies of four zzso model zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in which we attempt to isolate structural and environmental contributions to the chemical zzso We have mapped zzso patterns in the zzso states of these zzso using the published crystal structures and correlated them with zzso and zzso magic angle spinning chemical shift zzso To aid in the interpretation of the zzso chemical shifts, we performed zzso zzso quantum chemical calculations to determine the low-energy zzso and their chemical zzso Assuming low energy barriers to zzso between zzso accessible zzso we compare the zzso chemical shifts with the zzso determined zzso zzso The results allow us to correlate the observed differences in chemical shifts between the zzso and zzso states to changes in zzso and hydrogen bonding that occur upon zzso
