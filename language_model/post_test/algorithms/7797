To evaluate new bone formation and zzso in implanted human zzso bones and relate that to zzso elements zzso 

Human zzso bone zzso zzso 

zzso bone zzso 

Ten human zzso bones from eight patients with zzso cochlear implants and one zzso implant were examined under light zzso and reconstructed with zzso zzso zzso reconstruction zzso Volumes of new bone formation, fibrosis, and patent area were calculated in each zzso 

The amount of zzso and new bone formation zzso varied among zzso There were no statistically significant relationships between age at zzso or duration of zzso and the overall amount of new tissue in the implanted zzso There was a relationship between total amount of new tissue and preservation of zzso elements only in segment I of the zzso zzso zzso Most of the new tissue was located in segments I and II, segment III had little to no new tissue formation, and segment IV was clear in all of the zzso 

New tissue formation zzso was related to preservation of zzso elements primarily in segment I of the zzso In an era of hearing preservation surgery and hybrid cochlear zzso soft surgical techniques are advocated as a means to decrease surgical zzso
