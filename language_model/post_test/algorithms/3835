In Critical Care medicine the concepts of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have become fundamental in clinical practice but zzso of zzso Content and zzso Transport variables require invasive procedures that could be dangerous for critically ill patients and trigger a septic zzso zzso zzso obtained combining data from a Blood Gas zzso with the data from a zzso zzso and using the Ole zzso zzso Gas zzso zzso might be the zzso zzso On 115 zzso blood samples from critically ill patients, we measured zzso zzso zzso oxygen zzso total zzso concentration and zzso of zzso and zzso The new zzso was used to zzso active zzso zzso total oxygen zzso actual zzso tension, zzso zzso estimated functional zzso zzso mixed zzso zzso zzso an zzso oxygen difference of zzso zzso based on a standard oxygen consumption of zzso zzso and a standard cardiac output of zzso zzso and the cardiac oxygen compensation zzso In zzso Care all the oxygen parameters may be determined with sufficient accuracy and precision provided the oxygen zzso level is less than zzso and provided the definition of oxygen zzso is properly settled and zzso are performed according to the highest state of the zzso However, in critically ill patients in evolution our aim is to maintain an zzso zzso on the plateau of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the use of mechanical zzso high zzso fluid challenges and the rapid improvement of the patient's conditions can cause a value for zzso greater than or less than zzso and an improvement or worsening of the zzso The zzso calculation both in simultaneously drawn zzso and zzso blood permits zzso of derived zzso zzso zzso for zzso greater than zzso The Ole zzso zzso seems to give correct zzso values, at high zzso values, particularly when discarding unrealistic values for calculated zzso The correlation between zzso calculated by the Ole zzso zzso with that derived from classical formula shows the superiority of the findings obtained by means of the new zzso In critically ill patients the zzso is usually shifted to the zzso The new zzso zzso and zzso contain useful zzso for clinical zzso but rapid changes in zzso Index zzso and zzso can be ignored by the new algorithm, if these changes are not associated with a rise in zzso or pH and zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
