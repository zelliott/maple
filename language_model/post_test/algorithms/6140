zzso identification is a crucial first step in comparative zzso Here, we present a rapid method of zzso grouping which is effective enough to allow the comparison of many zzso zzso The method takes as input zzso similarity data and zzso genes based on the traditional zzso zzso zzso zzso In the course of zzso the method detects domain fusion or zzso events, and splits clusters into zzso if zzso The subsequent procedure splits the resulting trees such that zzso zzso genes are divided into different groups so as to create plausible zzso zzso As a result, the procedure can split genes into the zzso minimally required for zzso zzso The zzso named zzso was tested using the zzso database as a zzso When comparing several zzso zzso combined with the conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso we found that our method generally showed better agreement with the zzso zzso By comparing the zzso results generated from zzso of different releases, we also found that our method showed relatively good stability in comparison to the zzso zzso
