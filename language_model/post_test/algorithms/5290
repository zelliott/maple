The zzso crystal zzso zzso has become a popular method to study the formation of zzso films that consist of discrete zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso The quantitative interpretation of QCM zzso and bandwidth (or, zzso zzso zzso with such films is limited by the lack of understanding of the energy dissipation mechanisms that operate in these films as they are sheared at zzso zzso during the QCM zzso Here, we investigate dissipation mechanisms in such films zzso and by zzso method zzso zzso zzso we study the zzso of zzso proteins and virus particles to surfaces with various attachment zzso direct zzso to the surface, attachment via multiple zzso or attachment via a single zzso We find that the extent of dissipation caused by the film and the evolution of dissipation as a function of surface coverage is not dependent on the internal properties of these particles but rather on the geometry of their attachment to the zzso zzso calculations reproduce the zzso observed behavior of the zzso In particular, a transient maximum in dissipation that is observed zzso is reproduced by the zzso calculations, provided that the contact zone between the sphere and the surface is narrow and sufficiently zzso Both a zzso rotation of the sphere in the flow field of the background fluid zzso and a zzso zzso zzso contribute to the zzso At high coverage, lateral zzso interactions between neighboring spheres counteract these modes of zzso which results in a maximum in dissipation at intermediate zzso zzso These results highlight that, in many scenarios of zzso zzso the dissipation is not primarily determined by the zzso itself, but rather by the link by which it is bound to the zzso
