Although real imaging problems involve objects that have variations in three dimensions, a majority of work examining inverse scattering methods for zzso zzso considers zzso imaging zzso zzso the study of 3-D inverse scattering methods is necessary for future applications of zzso zzso In this work, 3-D reconstructions using different zzso of zzso elements focused on zzso were studied when reconstructing zzso imaging targets by producing a series of zzso image slices using the zzso distorted Born zzso method zzso The effects of focal number zzso speed of sound contrast zzso and zzso size were zzso For comparison, the 3-D wave equation was also zzso using zzso zzso to produce fully 3-D zzso image zzso In zzso zzso blurring in the vertical direction was highly correlated with the zzso zzso zzso function of the zzso for low zzso The eventual appearance of zzso artifacts in the vertical direction were observed with increasing zzso These zzso artifacts were less severe for smaller focal number values and larger zzso target zzso When using 3-D zzso the zzso artifacts were not observed and spatial resolution was zzso However, results indicate that array zzso in 3-D reconstructions is important for good image zzso zzso zzso were designed and assessed for image reconstruction using 3-D zzso
