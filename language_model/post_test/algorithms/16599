The increasing number of diabetic zzso zzso cases world wide demands the development of an automated decision support system for quick and cost-effective screening of zzso We present an automatic screening system for detecting the early stage of zzso which is known as zzso diabetic zzso zzso The proposed system involves processing of zzso images for extraction of abnormal signs, such as hard zzso cotton zzso spots, and large plaque of hard zzso A rule based zzso is used for zzso the DR into two classes, zzso normal and zzso The abnormal zzso is further classified into three levels, zzso mild, moderate, and zzso To evaluate the performance of the proposed decision support zzso the zzso have been tested on the images of zzso zzso The results obtained from this study show that the proposed system can detect the bright zzso with an average accuracy of about zzso The study further shows promising results in zzso the bright zzso correctly according to zzso severity zzso
