Radio frequency electromagnetic fields zzso in our daily life are caused by numerous sources such as fixed site zzso zzso mobile phone base zzso or indoor devices zzso zzso zzso The objective of this study was to develop a prediction model which can be used to predict mean zzso exposure from different sources for a large study population in zzso zzso We collected personal zzso exposure zzso of 166 volunteers from zzso Switzerland, by means of portable exposure meters, which were carried during one zzso For a validation study we repeated exposure zzso of 31 study participants 21 weeks after the zzso of the first week on zzso These second zzso were not used for the model zzso We used two data sources as exposure zzso 1) a questionnaire on potentially exposure relevant characteristics and behaviors and 2) modeled zzso from fixed site zzso zzso phone base stations, broadcast zzso at the zzso place of residence using a zzso propagation zzso zzso exposure zzso which were identified by means of multiple zzso analysis, were the modeled zzso at the zzso home from the propagation model, housing zzso ownership of communication devices zzso zzso mobile and zzso zzso and behavioral aspects such as amount of time spent in public zzso The proportion of zzso explained zzso by the final model was zzso The analysis of the agreement between calculated and measured zzso showed a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso zzso 90th zzso In the validation study, the sensitivity and specificity of the model were zzso and zzso zzso We could demonstrate that it is feasible to model personal zzso zzso Most importantly, our validation study suggests that the model can be used to assess average exposure over several zzso
