Identification of a general zzso noisy system viewed as an zzso of a predictor function is studied in this zzso A measurement fusion method for the predictor function estimate is zzso In the proposed zzso observed data are first fused by using an optimal fusion technique, and then the optimal fused data are incorporated in a zzso function zzso based on a robust least squares support zzso machine zzso A cooperative learning zzso is proposed to implement the proposed measurement fusion zzso Compared with related identification methods, the proposed method can minimize both the approximation error and the noise zzso The performance analysis shows that the proposed optimal measurement fusion function estimate has a smaller mean square error than the zzso function zzso Moreover, the proposed cooperative learning zzso can zzso globally to the optimal measurement fusion function zzso Finally, the proposed measurement fusion method is applied to zzso signal and spatial zzso signal zzso Experimental results show that the proposed measurement fusion method can provide a more accurate zzso
