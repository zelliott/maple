To develop a zzso zzso clinically relevant model of severe respiratory failure associated with a zzso total body surface area, zzso zzso zzso flame burn and smoke inhalation injury in adult zzso 

Model zzso 

Research zzso 

Adult female sheep zzso zzso zzso 

Animals were divided into three groups, determined by the number of smoke breaths administered zzso 36, zzso for a graded inhalation zzso The smoke was zzso into a zzso with a modified bee smoker at airway temperatures zzso degrees zzso All animals zzso received a zzso total body surface area zzso zzso flame burn to the body zzso After injury, the animals were placed on zzso ventilation to achieve zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blood gases and zzso settings were monitored every 6 zzso zzso for up to 7 zzso 

All animals survived the induction of zzso In the 24 smoke zzso total body surface area burn zzso group, zzso never decreased below zzso and peak zzso pressure was consistently zzso zzso zzso with normal zzso blood gases throughout the observation zzso With 36 smoke zzso total body surface area burn zzso zzso zzso zzso all animals had zzso of zzso and peak zzso pressure of 26 zzso zzso within zzso zzso as zzso died during the study zzso With 48 smoke zzso total body surface area burn zzso zzso zzso zzso all animals developed respiratory distress syndrome zzso in zzso zzso but none survived the experimental zzso 

Development of zzso by smoke and zzso flame zzso injury depends on smoke inhalation zzso A combination of 36 breaths of smoke and a zzso total body surface area zzso zzso flame burn injury can induce severe zzso zzso zzso within zzso zzso to allow evaluation of various treatment zzso of zzso
