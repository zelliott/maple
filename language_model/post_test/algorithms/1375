We present a zzso practical approach to developing risk prediction systems, suitable for use with large databases of medical zzso An important part of this approach is a novel feature selection zzso which uses the area under the receiver operating characteristic zzso curve to measure the expected zzso power of different sets of predictor zzso We describe this zzso and use it to select variables to predict risk of a specific adverse pregnancy zzso failure to progress in zzso zzso network, zzso zzso and zzso zzso risk prediction models are constructed, all of which achieve close to the limit of performance zzso on this prediction zzso We show that better prediction performance requires more zzso clinical information rather than improved zzso zzso It is also shown that better diagnostic criteria in clinical records would greatly assist the development of systems to predict risk in zzso
