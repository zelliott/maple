The zzso or zzso method is an efficient zzso work method for determining the potential of mean force zzso and also supposedly gives in principle the zzso diffusion zzso zzso zzso from a variation called the zzso zzso zzso method suggest inconsistencies in the zzso values when calculated as prescribed by the zzso zzso A new steering protocol has thus been developed and applied to the zzso method for the accurate determination of zzso and also provides greater convergence for zzso in molecular dynamics zzso The bulk diffusion zzso for water was found to be zzso zzso at 350 K with system size dependence within the statistical error zzso Using this steering zzso zzso and zzso for water zzso a zzso zzso zzso were zzso The potential of mean force is shown to have a barrier of peak zzso zzso with a zzso of about 10 zzso on either side from the membrane zzso The diffusion constant is shown to be highest in the core region of the membrane zzso value zzso zzso lowest in the zzso region zzso value zzso zzso and to tend toward the bulk value as the water zzso leaves the zzso The zzso zzso P for zzso in zzso was determined using the simulated zzso and zzso to give values of zzso zzso at 323 K and zzso zzso at 350 zzso The results show more spatial detail than results presented in previous work while reducing the zzso and user zzso
