This paper describes the methods appropriate for calculating sample sizes for clinical trials assessing quality of life zzso An example from a zzso trial of patients with small cell lung cancer completing the Hospital zzso and Depression zzso zzso is used for zzso Sample size estimates calculated assuming that the data are either of the zzso form or zzso are compared to estimates derived using an ordered zzso zzso In our example, since the data are very zzso the zzso and zzso approaches are shown to be zzso zzso methods may lead to substantial over estimates of sample size and zzso methods take no account of the zzso nature of the zzso When zzso zzso data for zzso scores the frequency zzso should always be given so that one can assess if zzso methods should be used for sample size calculations and zzso Further work is needed to discover what changes in zzso scores represent clinical importance for health technology zzso
