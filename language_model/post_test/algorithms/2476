zzso assignment of sequence reads is a challenging task in zzso data analysis, for which the present methods mainly use either zzso or zzso zzso Though the zzso methods are more sensitive and accurate, they suffer primarily due to the time needed to generate the zzso zzso We developed the zzso program and web server for better zzso zzso assignments using an zzso zzso By implementing zzso as the faster alignment method in place of zzso the analysis time has been reduced by zzso It is zzso using both simulated and real zzso zzso and can be used for both single and zzso sequence reads of varying lengths zzso zzso To our knowledge, zzso is the only available program that can be used for the zzso zzso of short reads zzso zzso with high accuracy and high sensitivity using a zzso zzso The zzso web server can be used to carry out the zzso analysis, by either submitting reads or zzso zzso It provides several options including construction of zzso trees, creation of a composition chart, functional analysis using zzso and comparative analysis of multiple zzso zzso zzso web server and a zzso version for zzso analysis are available freely at zzso
