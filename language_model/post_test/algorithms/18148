This paper describes methods for recovering zzso shape and motion of zzso zzso objects from zzso zzso point zzso For example, given a video recording of a talking person, we would like to estimate the zzso shape of the face at each instant, and learn a model of facial zzso zzso shape is modeled as a rigid transformation combined with a zzso zzso Reconstruction is zzso if arbitrary zzso are allowed, and thus additional assumptions about zzso are zzso We first suggest restricting shapes to lie within a zzso zzso and describe zzso zzso However, this restriction alone is insufficient to zzso zzso To address these problems, we propose a reconstruction method using a zzso Principal zzso Analysis zzso shape model, and an zzso zzso that simultaneously estimates zzso shape and motion for each instant, learns the zzso model zzso and robustly zzso missing data zzso We then extend the model to model zzso dynamics in object shape, allowing the zzso to robustly handle severe cases of missing zzso
