The aim of this study was to compare a simplified zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso adjustments in a subset of 193 patients with type 2 diabetes from the zzso zzso study who were using zzso insulin zzso 

zzso zzso was a zzso randomized, phase 4 study, in which subjects were either instructed to adjust their insulin zzso dose every 3 days by zzso units if mean zzso plasma zzso zzso values were above 110 zzso or below 80 zzso zzso zzso or had physicians adjust the insulin zzso dose according to usual practice zzso 

Patients in both groups achieved similar reductions in zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso Algorithm and zzso care groups, zzso between groups zzso zzso Algorithm group patients achieved a greater reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between groups zzso Both zzso Algorithm and zzso care groups experienced a similar rate of overall zzso and similar weight reduction zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso between groups zzso Over zzso of patients in both groups used insulin zzso once zzso 

zzso of a zzso zzso dose by patients using the zzso Algorithm in a zzso setting is equally effective in improving zzso control in patients with type 2 diabetes compared with zzso zzso dose zzso
