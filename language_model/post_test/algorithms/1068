The purpose of this study was to develop a highly sensitive zzso for zzso Down syndrome zzso 

zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso of human zzso zzso serum zzso human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and ultrasound zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the presence of gross zzso zzso and maternal age were measured at genetic zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to identify the most significant zzso A zzso zzso zzso plus age was used to derive zzso Down syndrome zzso zzso and zzso rates at different risk thresholds and the area under the zzso characteristic curve were zzso A probability value of zzso was zzso 

There were zzso study cases with 17 Down syndrome cases zzso The mean zzso maternal and zzso ages for the study group were zzso zzso years and zzso zzso weeks, zzso The significant markers were zzso thickness zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Neither maternal age nor gross zzso anomaly contributed significantly to Down syndrome zzso The comprehensive zzso test was extremely efficient for Down syndrome detection in advanced maternal age only cases with a sensitivity of zzso at a zzso zzso zzso In women zzso years old, all the Down syndrome cases were detected at zzso false positive zzso For the overall population, the sensitivity was zzso at zzso zzso zzso 

In a preliminary study, the comprehensive zzso test appeared highly sensitive in different age zzso Gross anomaly detection was not required for high performance, which makes the comprehensive zzso test potentially suitable for low-risk screening and as an alternative to zzso in women who wish to avoid the zzso This was a small study; thus, the clinical value of this test can only be established in large zzso
