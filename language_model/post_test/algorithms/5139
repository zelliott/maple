The fluorescent dye zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell populations into groups according to the number of divisions each cell has undergone zzso its division zzso The pulse labeling of cells with radioactive zzso provides a means to determine the distribution of times of entry into the first cell zzso We derive in zzso form the number of cells in each division class as a function of time using the zzso approach that zzso independent zzso zzso for the time to divide and the time to zzso We confirm that our zzso form for the number of cells in each division class is consistent with the zzso solution of a set of delay differential equations representing the generalized zzso model with cell death rates depending on the division zzso Choosing the distribution of time to the first division to fit zzso labeling data for B cells zzso in zzso with zzso zzso and either with or without zzso zzso we fit zzso data to determine the dependence of B cell kinetic parameters on the presence of zzso We find when zzso is present, a greater proportion of cells are recruited into division with a longer average time to first zzso The most profound effect of the presence of zzso was decreased death rates for smaller division classes, which supports a role of zzso in the protection of B cells from zzso
