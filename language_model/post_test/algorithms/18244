Complete nerve zzso zzso of the rat zzso nerve is a well-established animal zzso The most frequently used zzso for evaluation of zzso deficits is the walking track analysis with calculation of the zzso functional index zzso More recently, the zzso zzso index zzso has been developed, which shows a good correlation with the zzso However, despite all advantages zzso accessibility, easy zzso high zzso zzso the zzso is still not widely zzso zzso therefore, developed a novel zzso zzso which will be made freely available for the assessment of the zzso As zzso for the treatment of zzso nerve gaps, zzso nerve transplantation studies in the rat zzso nerve model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were carried out to test the effectiveness and feasibility of the zzso zzso We observed a significant recovery starting from the zzso condition over the 3rd, 6th, 9th weeks until the 12th week after surgery zzso zzso the zzso can be calculated from both rearing and normal standing position of the rats and we investigated whether the zzso is affected zzso by these zzso We observed no significant differences between animals in a rearing and normal standing stance zzso The present method combines efficiency zzso of use, rapid and economical zzso with accurate and precise zzso of the functional zzso in the zzso nerve zzso model of the zzso
