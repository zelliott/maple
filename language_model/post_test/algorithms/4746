Although the relationship between brain activity and motor performance is reasonably well established, the manner in which this relationship changes with motor learning remains incompletely zzso This paper presents a study of cortical zzso of zzso beta activity when participants learned to perform a complex zzso motor zzso 151 channel zzso data were acquired from nine healthy adults whilst learning a zzso zzso zzso Sources of zzso activity were determined by means of synthetic zzso zzso that yielded locations and time courses of beta zzso The relationship between changes in performance and corresponding changes in zzso power were assessed using partial least zzso zzso data revealed that participants successfully learned to perform the zzso zzso and that performance improvement was mainly achieved through the proper timing of the finger producing the slow zzso We found zzso zzso of beta power in the zzso motor zzso that was zzso related to force zzso The degree of beta zzso increased during the experiment - although the force level remained constant - and was positively correlated with motor performance, in particular for the motor zzso zzso to the slow zzso These zzso findings support the view that activity in motor zzso zzso closely with behavioral changes over the course of zzso
