The plasma process is often used in the fabrication of semiconductor zzso However, due to the lack of real-time zzso control, this may result in some unacceptable process performances and thus leads to significant waste and lower zzso zzso In order to maximize the product zzso yield, a timely and accurately process fault or abnormal detection in a plasma reactor is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the most frequently used zzso in zzso process zzso Even though zzso has the advantage of zzso it is required to provide a huge amount of zzso As a result, the data analysis of zzso becomes a big zzso To accomplish real-time zzso this work employed the zzso matching method technique, which is the time series of zzso full spectrum zzso First, the response model of a healthy plasma spectrum was zzso Then, we defined a matching rate as an zzso for comparing the difference between the tested wafers response and the health zzso zzso The experimental results showed that this proposal method can detect process faults in zzso even in plasma zzso zzso
