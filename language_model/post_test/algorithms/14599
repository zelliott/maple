zzso the regulation of zzso entry is one of the most important goals of modern cell biology, and zzso modeling of zzso entry has been a subject of several recent zzso However, there are still many regulation mechanisms that remain poorly zzso Two crucial aspects are how zzso entry is controlled by its upstream regulators zzso and zzso and how zzso entry is coordinated with other biological events, especially zzso zzso In this context, we reconstructed a comprehensive zzso model that zzso the zzso entry network and the zzso checkpoint zzso zzso simulation of this model and subsequent experimental zzso revealed that zzso and zzso are redundant to the zzso of zzso zzso during normal zzso entry, but become especially important for zzso zzso zzso during zzso checkpoint zzso Further analysis indicated that, in response to DNA damage, zzso network zzso makes zzso zzso more sensitive to the zzso of zzso and zzso In addition, we demonstrated that zzso targeting zzso and zzso during zzso checkpoint recovery achieves a synergistic effect, which suggests the zzso use of zzso and zzso zzso after chemotherapy or zzso Thus, the results presented here provide novel insights into the regulation mechanism of zzso entry and have potential value in cancer zzso
