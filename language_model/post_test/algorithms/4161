zzso analysis is useful in investigating disease transmission dynamics and the effect of interventions on them, but estimates of probabilities of linkage between infected people from observed data can be biased downward when zzso is zzso We investigate variation in the rates at which subjects' viral zzso link across groups defined by viral load zzso and zzso treatment zzso status using blood samples from household surveys in the Northeast sector of zzso zzso The probability of obtaining a sequence from a sample varies with viral zzso samples with low viral load are harder to zzso zzso genetic distances were estimated from aligned zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso It is first shown that the probability that randomly selected sequences are linked can be estimated consistently from observed zzso This is then used to develop estimates of the probability that a sequence from one group links to at least one sequence from another group under the assumption of independence across zzso Furthermore, a zzso approach is developed that accounts for the presence of correlation across pairs, with zzso for assessing the reliability of the zzso zzso were obtained for zzso of subjects with high viral load zzso zzso zzso of subjects with low viral load but not on ART zzso zzso and zzso of subjects on ART zzso zzso The probability of linkage between two individuals is highest if both have zzso and lowest if one has zzso and the other has zzso or is on zzso zzso across groups is high for zzso and lower for zzso and zzso Adjustment for missing data increases the zzso linkage rates by zzso and changes the relative rates between zzso zzso in zzso regarding zzso viral linkage that arise from differential ability to zzso samples can be reduced by appropriate methods for accommodating missing zzso
