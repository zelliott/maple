In animal studies, exposure to zzso zzso increases the risk of cardiovascular disease through only partly understood zzso zzso Human long-term follow-up studies on the same topic are zzso 

The aim was to study the risk of overweight and the zzso syndrome in adult offspring of women with zzso zzso diabetes zzso zzso or type 1 diabetes, and additionally to study associations between estimates of maternal zzso and outcome in the zzso 

We conducted a follow-up study of zzso primarily Caucasian women aged zzso zzso in the Center for zzso Women with zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of women with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso reference group zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as offspring of women with type 1 diabetes zzso zzso zzso and offspring from the background population representing an zzso reference group zzso zzso zzso The follow-up rate was zzso zzso of zzso 

Women with body mass index of at least 25 zzso were considered zzso The zzso syndrome was determined by the International Diabetes Federation 2006 zzso 

The risk of overweight was doubled in offspring of women with zzso zzso or type 1 diabetes compared with offspring from the background population, whereas the risk of the zzso syndrome was zzso and zzso increased, zzso zzso risk of the zzso syndrome increased significantly with increasing maternal zzso blood zzso as well as zzso blood zzso (during oral zzso tolerance zzso 

Adult offspring of women with zzso zzso or type 1 diabetes are risk groups for overweight and the zzso zzso zzso zzso may in addition to zzso and other factors contribute to the zzso of overweight and the zzso zzso
