We zzso demonstrate the use of the transmission zzso zzso to zzso control the zzso and phase of the light transmitted through highly scattering zzso This is achieved by measuring the absolute value of the TM zzso We also use the fact that the zzso between the contributions of different input channels at the observation plane is important in describing the transmitted optical zzso In addition, we demonstrate both quantitative control of the intensity at multiple output spatial zzso each with a different intensity, as well as a zzso area of low zzso Our experiments are carried out using a low cost (less than zzso spatial zzso zzso zzso that we modify for zzso operation, as well as a novel optical setup that enables independent control of a reference and control signal while maintaining zzso zzso The optical zzso used in this paper will make such experiments widely accessible to many zzso Furthermore, the results presented could serve as the foundation for many useful potential applications ranging from the biomedical sciences to optical zzso
