zzso analysis is a widespread procedure in zzso to assess the presence of genetic defects by the zzso of the structure of zzso The procedure is lengthy and repetitive and an effective automatic analysis would greatly help the zzso routine zzso Still, automatic zzso and the full zzso of zzso are open zzso The first step in every automatic procedure is the zzso step, which detect zzso that represent either single zzso or clusters of zzso The better the zzso step, the easier is the subsequent zzso of zzso clusters into single zzso We implemented zzso zzso methods, zzso the ones that appear in the literature as the best performers, and compared their performance in zzso zzso and zzso clusters in zzso zzso zzso The images are affected by the presence of zzso or zzso regions and by a contrast zzso between the stained zzso and the zzso A thorough analysis of the results highlights that, although every single zzso shows peculiar zzso points, zzso zzso and Region Based Level Set have the overall best zzso In order to provide the scientific community with a public zzso the data and manual zzso used in this paper are available for public download at zzso
