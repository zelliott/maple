Early surgical intervention in zzso zzso zzso is associated with high zzso zzso recommend fine needle aspiration zzso in patients with zzso and signs of zzso Because infection of necrosis is considered an indication for surgery, operations are often performed zzso We changed treatment toward a conservative approach with zzso in selected cases only, thereby reducing the rate of zzso 

zzso analyzed patients, all operated on for zzso infection of pancreatic necrosis zzso zzso 20, group 1) were compared to patients subjected to conservative treatment zzso zzso 24, group 2) who were followed zzso 

zzso scores did not differ between the two groups, indicating comparable zzso the Acute zzso and zzso Health zzso zzso zzso score was zzso zzso zzso versus 16 zzso zzso the zzso zzso Failure Assessment zzso score was zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso level on day 3 was 243 zzso 21 versus zzso zzso 21, and the zzso zzso severity zzso was zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Ten patients in group 2 underwent operation because of severe zzso zzso zzso differed significantly zzso in group 1 zzso zzso in group 2; p zzso zzso 

A highly conservative approach avoiding open zzso in zzso results in significantly lower mortality than previous serial zzso and consecutive indication for surgery in case of proven zzso Open surgery in zzso should be reserved for zzso zzso zzso
