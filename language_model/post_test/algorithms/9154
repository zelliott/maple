The zzso rate zzso is commonly used to assess the performance of zzso zzso zzso Various studies have shown that the optimal number of mental tasks to be used is fairly low, around 3 or zzso We propose an experimental validation as well as a formal approach to demonstrate and confirm that this optimum is user and zzso design zzso Even if increasing the number of mental tasks to the optimum indeed leads to an increase of the zzso the gain remains zzso This might not justify the added complexity in terms of protocol zzso
