zzso zzso produces highly magnified zzso image volumes useful for investigating the structure and function of cellular zzso Image quality is zzso by multiple scattering events and quantum noise, which depend on the angle at which individual tilt projections are zzso We have adapted a biomedical imaging approach to improve image quality by enhancing individual tilt projections prior to zzso zzso Specifically, we have developed a family of zzso zzso diffusion zzso filters zzso by the tilt zzso We give a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of our zzso approach and the zzso zzso We show an improvement in the reconstructed volumes for zzso generated from both zzso and zzso samples of malaria zzso zzso
