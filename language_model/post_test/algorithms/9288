Here we present a novel method for assessment of packing quality for zzso zzso zzso of zzso membrane proteins zzso based on analysis of available high-resolution experimental structures of zzso The presented concept of zzso environment classes permits quantitative description of packing characteristics in terms of membrane accessibility and polarity of the nearest protein zzso We demonstrate that the method allows identification of zzso zzso among the large set of theoretical zzso zzso The developed zzso scoring zzso will be of use for zzso of TM domain packing in theoretical models of zzso first of all zzso coupled zzso
