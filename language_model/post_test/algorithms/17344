zzso zzso zzso channels can be activated by membrane zzso in the absence of zzso zzso indicating that these channels contain an intrinsic zzso zzso The properties of this zzso sensor and its relationship to channel zzso were examined by studying gating charge movement from zzso zzso zzso channels in the virtual absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso movement was measured in response to zzso steps or zzso zzso zzso The zzso relationship zzso is zzso and shifted to more negative zzso than the zzso open probability zzso Both ON and OFF gating currents evoked by brief zzso zzso zzso appear to zzso rapidly zzso zzso 60 zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso 16 zzso at zzso zzso However, zzso increases slowly with pulse zzso indicating that a large fraction of ON charge develops with a time course comparable to that of zzso zzso The slow onset of this gating charge prevents its detection as a component of zzso although it represents approximately zzso of the total charge moved at zzso zzso The zzso of zzso is slowed after zzso that open zzso zzso Yet, the majority of open channel charge relaxation is too rapid to be limited by channel zzso These results can be understood in terms of the zzso zzso scheme developed in the preceding paper zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The model contains five open zzso and five closed zzso states arranged in zzso and the kinetic and zzso properties of zzso gating currents exhibit multiple components associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso
