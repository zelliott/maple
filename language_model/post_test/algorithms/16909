Conventional gene selection methods based on principal component analysis zzso use only the first principal component zzso of zzso or sparse zzso to select characteristic zzso These methods indeed assume that the first PC plays a dominant role in gene zzso However, in a number of cases this assumption is not satisfied, so the conventional zzso methods usually provide poor selection zzso In order to improve the performance of the zzso gene selection method, we put forward the gene selection method via weighting PCs by singular values zzso Because different PCs have different importance, the singular values are exploited as the weights to represent the influence on gene selection of different zzso The zzso zzso and zzso statistics on artificial data show that our method zzso the state-of-the-art zzso Moreover, experimental results on real gene expression data sets show that our method can extract more characteristic genes in response to zzso stresses than conventional gene selection zzso
