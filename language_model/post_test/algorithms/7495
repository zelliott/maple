Good feature design is important to achieve effective image zzso This paper presents a novel feature design with two main zzso First, prior to computing the feature zzso we propose to transform the images with zzso filters to obtain more representative feature zzso Second, we propose to transform the zzso zzso with another set of zzso filters to further improve the zzso zzso In this way, while generic feature zzso are used, zzso information is integrated into the feature extraction process based on the zzso objective to enhance the zzso power of feature zzso The feature design is zzso to different application zzso and is evaluated on both lung tissue zzso in high-resolution zzso zzso zzso images and zzso detection in zzso phase contrast zzso image zzso Both experiments show promising performance improvements over the zzso
