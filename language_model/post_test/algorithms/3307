For surgical planning in spine surgery, the zzso of anatomical structures is a zzso Past efforts zzso on the zzso of zzso from zzso data, but soft tissue structures have, for the most part, been zzso Only sparse research work has been done for the spinal zzso and the zzso However, as far as the author is aware, there is no work on zzso zzso zzso zzso a totally automatic reconstruction zzso for the most relevant cervical structures is zzso It is implemented as a straightforward process, using anatomical knowledge which is, in concept, zzso to other zzso of the human zzso No seed points are required since the discs, as initial landmarks, are located via an object recognition zzso The spinal zzso is reconstructed by surface analysis on already segmented zzso thus it can be taken into account in a zzso zzso The zzso results of our approach showed zzso accordance with expert zzso and the zzso time is less than 1 zzso on a standard zzso Since the presented system follows some general concepts this approach may also be considered as a step towards full body zzso of the zzso
