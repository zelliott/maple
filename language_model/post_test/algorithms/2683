Phase space zzso estimates correlation functions entirely from snapshots in the evolution of the wave function along a time or space zzso In contrast, traditional zzso methods require measurement of multiple zzso zzso However, as in every zzso zzso zzso poses a severe zzso Here we present the first, to our knowledge, experimental demonstration of zzso reconstruction of the classical optical correlation function, zzso the mutual intensity zzso Our zzso zzso makes explicit use of the physically justifiable assumption of a zzso source (or zzso Since the source was directly accessible in our classical experiment, we were able to compare the zzso estimate of the mutual intensity to an independent zzso estimate from the van zzso zzso and verify substantial quantitative improvements in the zzso
