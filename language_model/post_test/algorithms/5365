zzso zzso quantitative real-time zzso zzso is a sensitive technique for zzso gene zzso but its success depends on the stability of the reference zzso used for data zzso Only a few studies on validation of reference genes have been conducted in fruit trees and none in banana zzso In the present work, 20 candidate reference genes were selected, and their expression stability in 144 banana samples were evaluated and analyzed using two zzso zzso and zzso The samples consisted of eight sample sets collected under different experimental conditions, including various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stresses zzso high temperature, and zzso and hormone zzso Our results showed that different suitable reference zzso or combination of reference genes for zzso should be selected depending on the experimental zzso The zzso and zzso genes were validated as the most suitable reference genes across all tested zzso More importantly, our data further showed that the widely used reference zzso ACT and zzso were not the most suitable reference genes in many banana sample zzso In addition, the expression of zzso a gene of interest that plays an important role in regulating fruit zzso under different experimental conditions was used to further confirm the validated reference zzso Taken together, our results provide guidelines for reference zzso selection under different experimental conditions and a foundation for more accurate and widespread use of zzso in zzso
