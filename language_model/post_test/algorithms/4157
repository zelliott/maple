The role intrinsic statistical fluctuations play in creating zzso of complex bursting activity with zzso zzso examined in leaky zzso zzso Using this broad class of models, we develop a zzso approach that employs a potential energy landscape perspective coupled with a zzso description based on statistical zzso We identify six important zzso quantities essential for characterizing system behavior as a function of network size: the internal potential energy, zzso free potential energy, internal pressure, pressure, and bulk zzso In agreement with classical phase zzso these quantities evolve smoothly as a function of the network size until a critical value is zzso At that value, a zzso in pressure is observed that leads to a spike in the bulk zzso zzso loss of zzso zzso We attribute this novel result to a zzso of the ground states zzso zzso of the system's stationary potential energy landscape caused by a zzso deformation of its zzso zzso Further analysis demonstrates that appreciable levels of intrinsic noise can cause zzso a complex mode of operation that dominates system dynamics at zzso or zzso network zzso zzso examples are provided using an zzso model of bacterial infection, where zzso has not been characterized before, and a previously studied model of zzso zzso where zzso was erroneously attributed to specific neural zzso The general methods developed here can be used to study the emergence of zzso (and other complex zzso in many zzso physical and man-made interaction zzso
