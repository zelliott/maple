zzso of zzso patterns is among the most difficult pattern recognition zzso Human gait recognition is a typical difficulty in the area of zzso pattern zzso It zzso and identifies individuals by their zzso gait signature zzso Recently, a new zzso pattern recognition method based on deterministic learning theory was zzso in which a zzso zzso pattern can be effectively represented in a zzso manner and can be rapidly zzso In this paper, we present a new zzso approach for human gait recognition via the aforementioned method, specifically for recognizing people by zzso The approach consists of two zzso a training zzso phase and a test zzso zzso In the training phase, side silhouette lower limb joint angles and angular zzso are selected as gait zzso A zzso zzso model for human gait locomotion is employed to demonstrate that functions containing joint angle and angular zzso state zzso characterize the gait system zzso Due to the zzso and symmetrical characteristics of human zzso the gait system dynamics can be simplified to be described by functions of joint angles and angular zzso of one side of the human body, thus the feature dimension is effectively zzso zzso identification of the gait system dynamics is achieved by using zzso basis function zzso neural networks zzso through deterministic zzso The obtained knowledge of the zzso gait system dynamics is stored in constant zzso zzso A gait signature is then derived from the extracted gait system dynamics along the phase portrait of joint angles versus angular zzso A bank of zzso is constructed using constant zzso networks to represent the training gait zzso In the test phase, by comparing the set of zzso with the test gait pattern, a set of recognition errors are generated, and the average zzso norms of the errors are taken as the similarity measure between the dynamics of the training gait patterns and the dynamics of the test gait zzso zzso the test gait pattern similar to one of the training gait patterns can be rapidly recognized according to the smallest error zzso Finally, experiments are carried out on the zzso and UCSD gait databases to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed zzso
