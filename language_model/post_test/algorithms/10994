zzso neck fracture is a major public health problem in elderly zzso representing the main source of zzso mortality and zzso In this study, we aimed at comparing zzso texture analysis with three-dimensional zzso zzso in human zzso and at evaluating whether bone texture analysis improved the assessment of the zzso neck fracture risk other than that zzso by bone mineral density zzso 

Thirteen zzso zzso heads from patients who fractured their zzso neck and twelve zzso zzso heads from zzso patients were studied using respectively zzso a new high-resolution digital X-ray device zzso zzso Medical zzso allowing for bone texture analysis with zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso was measured zzso by zzso in all patients in the zzso zzso 

In these zzso heads, we found that zzso zzso zzso was correlated with zzso zzso zzso bone volume fraction zzso zzso number zzso zzso separation zzso and zzso dimension zzso respectively zzso Then, zzso zzso zzso was significantly lower in the zzso heads from the fractured group than from the zzso group zzso Finally, multiple zzso analysis showed that combining bone texture analysis and total hip zzso significantly improved the zzso of the zzso neck fracture risk from adjusted zzso to adjusted zzso zzso 

zzso bone texture analysis was correlated with zzso zzso parameters in the zzso head, provided accurate discrimination between the zzso heads from the fractured and zzso groups, and significantly improved the zzso of the zzso neck fracture risk when combined with zzso
