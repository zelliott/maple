Advances in zzso DNA sequencing technologies have determined an explosion in the number of zzso bacterial zzso Comparative sequence analysis frequently reveals zzso of zzso zzso occurring with different mechanisms and rates in different species, but the large-scale use of zzso methods to identify zzso events is hampered by their high zzso zzso Here, we propose a new method to identify zzso events in large zzso of whole zzso zzso Using a filtering procedure of the gene conservation profiles of a test zzso against a panel of zzso this zzso identifies sets of zzso genes acquired by zzso zzso The locations of the zzso zzso are determined using a statistical test that is able to account for the differences in the natural rate of evolution between different zzso The zzso was tested on a zzso of 75 zzso of zzso zzso and 50 zzso zzso different zzso species, and was able to detect zzso zzso events in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso Furthermore, we found zzso of an zzso exchange of genetic material between zzso zzso and zzso zzso a closely related zzso species that zzso the same ecological zzso The method has been implemented in an R package, zzso which is freely available from supplementary material, and provides a rapid screening tool to investigate zzso on a zzso scale from sequence zzso
