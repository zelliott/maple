In this paper we will present and explain zzso the two main zzso which are currently used in commercial zzso flow imaging systems, namely the frequency domain based zzso zzso and the time domain based cross correlation zzso The zzso zzso is a robust optimum mean frequency zzso zzso for both high and low signal to noise ratio zzso Its main disadvantage is its zzso zzso However the cross correlation zzso does not suffer from this problem, and this has been one of the main reasons for its zzso The mathematics behind these two zzso and the general data processing steps used for their zzso will be also zzso The subject of clutter removal filtering will be discussed and valuable points will be zzso A practical relevant approach on how to discriminate between wanted blood flow related estimates and unwanted false estimates due to noise will be zzso On the zzso problem of the zzso algorithm, a promising solution known as spatial tracking of estimated mean frequency does exist, which will be also introduced in zzso zzso the end of this paper other zzso which are currently the subject of research and have potential for development, will be zzso
