zzso distinction between essential zzso and zzso zzso zzso requires determination of the red cell mass in the presence of adequate iron stores, but this is not always zzso We therefore compared the clinical and laboratory features at the time of presentation of 50 patients with unequivocal essential zzso and 27 patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis failed to identify any single zzso capable of reliably separating the zzso A zzso zzso zzso incorporating zzso white cell count, and zzso size markedly increased the diagnostic accuracy zzso compared with predictions based on the zzso alone zzso The zzso usefulness for patients with intermediate zzso was confirmed by analysis of independent samples of essential zzso and zzso zzso zzso patients, and also by analysis of patients with probable essential zzso in whom the diagnosis could not be confirmed because of inadequate exclusion of zzso zzso Furthermore, comparison of survival data suggests that zzso these disorders is zzso zzso The zzso is recommended as an alternate method for zzso essential zzso from zzso zzso zzso whenever the red cell mass is unavailable or iron zzso cannot be zzso
