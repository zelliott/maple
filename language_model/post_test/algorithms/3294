We show that in zzso systems zzso order can be reached through the flows of matter, energy, and information, which can be non zzso spread over the zzso due to zzso induced by the correlated zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso electromagnetic field is self trapped in these zzso and forms the zzso pathways as zzso along which these flows can occur via zzso zzso zzso in the pathways can be zzso either by intrinsic dynamics or by external stimuli and can be zzso in the infrared range as bright or dark zzso The formation of such pathways is the consequence of zzso zzso transitions occurring in the biological cycle of the zzso A rational therapy appears then to be the induction of conditions for zzso existence necessary for maintaining the zzso of the zzso
