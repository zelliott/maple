A novel real-time zzso imaging approach for zzso investigation of the diffusion and zzso phenomena occurring during zzso release from medium chain zzso zzso solution into two zzso zzso is zzso Two zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were applied as simple models mimicking the subcutaneous zzso The evolution of the zzso maps as a function of time provided detailed information on the zzso release processes upon the exposure of the gel zzso to zzso Using zzso curves, the concentration maps of zzso in the zzso imaging area were zzso zzso of the zzso zzso profiles, which were obtained using expressions derived from zzso second law, provided the zzso and the distribution zzso of zzso penetrated into the zzso The obtained zzso zzso zzso distribution zzso of zzso was identical to the zzso zzso zzso distribution zzso determined by the zzso method whereas that of the zzso zzso system was four times zzso The experimental data show that zzso imaging may have considerable potential for investigating the transport properties of drug zzso intended for the subcutaneous zzso
