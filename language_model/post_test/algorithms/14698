Mobile mapping systems have been widely applied for acquiring spatial information in applications such as spatial information systems and zzso city zzso Nowadays the most common technologies used for positioning and orientation of a mobile mapping system include a Global zzso System zzso as the major positioning sensor and an zzso zzso System zzso as the major orientation zzso In the classical approach, the limitations of the Kalman zzso zzso method and the overall price of zzso systems have limited the zzso of most land-based mobile mapping zzso Although intelligent sensor positioning and orientation schemes consisting of zzso zzso zzso Networks zzso one of the most famous zzso zzso Networks zzso and zzso have been proposed in order to enhance the performance of low cost Micro zzso Mechanical System zzso zzso integrated systems, the automation of the zzso applied has not proven as easy as initially zzso zzso this study not only addresses the problems of insufficient automation in the conventional methodology that has been applied in zzso zzso for zzso integrated systems proposed in previous studies, but also exploits and analyzes the idea of developing alternative intelligent sensor positioning and orientation schemes that integrate various sensors in more automatic zzso The proposed schemes are implemented using one of the most famous constructive neural zzso Cascade zzso zzso Network zzso overcome the limitations of conventional techniques based on zzso zzso as well as previously developed zzso zzso The zzso applied also have the advantage of a more flexible zzso compared to zzso Based on the experimental data zzso the preliminary results presented in this article illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes compared to zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso
