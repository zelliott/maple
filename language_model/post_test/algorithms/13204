We have developed an intelligent single switch scanning interface and wheelchair navigation assistance system, called intelligent single switch wheelchair navigation zzso to improve driving safety, comfort and efficiency for individuals who rely on single switch scanning as a control zzso zzso combines a standard powered wheelchair with a laser zzso a single switch scanning interface and a zzso It provides the user with context sensitive and task specific scanning options that reduce driving effort based on an interpretation of sensor data together with user zzso Trials performed by 9 zzso participants showed that the system significantly improved driving safety and efficiency in a navigation task by significantly reducing the number of switch presses to zzso of traditional single switch wheelchair navigation zzso zzso zzso All participants made a significant improvement zzso p zzso zzso in completion time after only two zzso
