zzso objects such as metal zzso surgical clips, or dental zzso generate zzso artifacts in zzso zzso zzso We present a novel method for metal artifact reduction by zzso missing information into the corrupted zzso The information is provided by a zzso model extracted from the distorted zzso To this end the image is first zzso filtered to reduce the noise content and to smooth out streak zzso zzso the image is segmented into different material classes using a zzso zzso The corrupted and missing information in the original zzso is completed using the forward projected information from the zzso zzso The performance of the correction method is assessed on phantom zzso Clinical images featuring a broad spectrum of metal artifacts are zzso Phantom and clinical studies show that metal artifacts, such as streaks, are significantly reduced and shadows in the image are zzso Furthermore, the novel approach improves zzso of organ zzso This can be of great zzso for instance, in radiation therapy planning, where images affected by metal artifacts may lead to zzso treatment zzso
