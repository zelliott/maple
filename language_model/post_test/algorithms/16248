A quantitative zzso comparison was performed between zzso Carlo zzso simulations and zzso calculations at the zzso cellular level zzso zzso for four zzso zzso zzso and A zzso and two zzso that zzso mainly in the zzso of cells zzso and zzso A microscopic investigation around the zzso site of the three zzso zzso zzso was also carried zzso On the whole, zzso between zzso and zzso calculations for the absorbed dose and dose rate to the cell nucleus were within zzso The dose rate to the nucleus for the zzso that mainly zzso in the zzso was greater than that for the zzso zzso Also evident was that the dose rate to the nucleus was approximately the same for the three zzso zzso In contrast to the small differences found between zzso and zzso calculations for the zzso absorbed dose to the nucleus, the zzso analysis at the microscopic level for the three zzso zzso showed that the two zzso approaches lead to a completely different energy deposition pattern around the zzso zzso
