Each zzso segment in zzso zzso zzso is affected by a different zzso varying phase which is caused by unavoidable motions and amplified by the zzso zzso A proper image reconstruction therefore requires phase maps for each zzso Such maps are commonly derived from two-dimensional zzso at relatively low resolution but do not offer robust zzso For example, phase variations in zzso zzso of the brain are often characterized by high spatial zzso To overcome this problem, an inverse reconstruction method for segmented zzso zzso zzso is described that takes advantage of the full zzso data acquired from multiple receiver zzso First, the individual zzso sensitivities are determined from the zzso acquisitions by zzso zzso zzso These zzso sensitivities are then used to estimate accurate zzso phase maps for each segment by zzso linear zzso Finally, the zzso sensitivities and phase maps serve to reconstruct zzso images of the object by zzso linear zzso taking advantage of the data of all zzso The efficiency of the new method is demonstrated for segmented zzso zzso echo acquisition mode zzso of the human zzso
