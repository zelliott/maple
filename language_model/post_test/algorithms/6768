zzso technology combined with tandem mass zzso zzso is a powerful method that provides a rapid solution to the discovery of zzso interactions and protein zzso We studied the problem of detecting zzso peptides and zzso zzso acids from tandem mass spectral zzso Our method consists of two steps: the first step finds two protein zzso whose mass sum equals a given mass measured from the mass zzso and the second step finds the best zzso zzso acids in these two zzso sequences that are zzso correlated to a given tandem mass zzso We designed fast and zzso zzso for these two steps and implemented and tested them on experimental data of zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso between two beta zzso was found in two tandem mass zzso The length of the zzso zzso zzso is very close to the actual distance zzso zzso obtained from the molecular structure in zzso
