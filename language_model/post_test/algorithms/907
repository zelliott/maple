zzso analysis of heart rates during 24-hr ambulatory zzso monitoring has been carried out to characterize the heart rate spectral components of zzso zzso zzso by using fast zzso transformation zzso Eight patients with zzso heart failure were selected for the zzso zzso analyses have been performed for zzso zzso Out of the power spectrum, five parameters were extracted to characterize the zzso The low peak zzso in eight subjects were between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso used to detect zzso are the zzso zzso if the zzso ratios were above the absolute value of zzso and zzso the zzso ratios were above the absolute values of zzso then the power spectrum is suggestive of zzso We conclude that the automatic detection of zzso by heart rate spectral analysis during ambulatory zzso monitoring may afford a tool for the evaluation of the patients with zzso heart zzso
