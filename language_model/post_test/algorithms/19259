A color analysis method which enables both qualitative and quantitative analyses of an zzso color was zzso The method uses a color zzso and processing system composed of a zzso video camera and a digital image zzso which zzso a color image into values of red, green, and blue zzso then processes these zzso We introduced a zzso principle by the zzso law, and were able to establish a color model to analyze an zzso zzso In the coordinate space based on our color model, the hue of the zzso color is represented by the direction from the origin, and the density by the distance from the zzso This new method was used to analyze the colors of zzso solutions at various oxygen zzso and zzso The results agreed with the known conditions, indicating the zzso of the model and its usefulness for quantitative as well as qualitative analyses of zzso
