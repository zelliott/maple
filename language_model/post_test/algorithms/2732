Earlier diagnosis of zzso tract cancer could help improve survival so better tools are needed to help zzso 

To derive and validate an zzso to estimate the absolute risk of zzso tract cancer in patients with and without symptoms in primary zzso 

zzso study using data from 375 UK zzso general practices for development and 189 for zzso 

Included patients were aged zzso years free at baseline of a diagnosis of zzso tract cancer zzso zzso zzso or zzso and without zzso abdominal pain, appetite loss, or weight loss in previous 12 zzso The primary outcome was incident diagnosis of zzso tract cancer recorded in the next 2 zzso zzso factors examined were age, body mass index, smoking, alcohol, zzso treated hypertension, zzso stones, structural kidney problems, diabetes, previous diagnosis of cancer apart from zzso tract cancer, zzso abdominal pain, appetite loss, weight loss, zzso zzso zzso and zzso Cox zzso hazards models were used to develop separate risk equations in males and zzso zzso of zzso and discrimination assessed performance in the validation zzso 

There were zzso incident cases of zzso tract cancer from zzso million zzso in the derivation zzso Independent zzso in both males and females were age, smoking status, zzso abdominal pain, weight loss, and zzso A history of prior cancer other than zzso tract cancer, and appetite loss were zzso for females zzso On zzso the zzso explained zzso of the variation in females and zzso in zzso The receiver operating curve statistics were zzso zzso and zzso zzso The D statistic was zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of patients with the highest predicted risks contained zzso of all zzso tract zzso diagnosed over the next 2 zzso 

The zzso has good discrimination and zzso and could potentially be used to identify those at highest risk of zzso tract cancer, to facilitate more timely referral and zzso
