zzso or zzso zzso of zzso data can occur either due to the field of view limitation of the scanning apparatus or in zzso zzso In this paper, we suggest two new methods to handle lateral zzso in zzso scan zzso It is seen that reconstruction with zzso truncated projection data, assuming it to be complete, gives severe artifacts which even zzso into the field of zzso A zzso data completion approach using linear prediction is introduced for zzso scan truncated zzso An extension of this technique known as windowed linear prediction approach is zzso zzso of the two techniques are shown using simulation with standard zzso A quantitative image quality measure of the resulting reconstructed images are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods against an extension of a standard existing zzso
