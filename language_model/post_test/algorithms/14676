To evaluate the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gel versus other topical therapies for scalp psoriasis in adults using direct and indirect zzso 

A systematic review identified 10 zzso controlled trials zzso of topical treatments used in clinical practice for moderately severe scalp zzso A zzso was undertaken to obtain estimates of clinical effectiveness using recommended efficacy and safety outcome zzso We determined the proportion of responding patients using two zzso zzso zzso zzso using the zzso Global Assessment zzso rating scale and zzso a score of 0 or 1 on the Total Sign zzso zzso zzso was extracted in terms of percentages of patients experiencing all adverse events zzso skin zzso and withdrawals due to zzso zzso comparisons were performed where head-to-head data were zzso For other zzso where zzso gel was compared zzso zzso of trials were compared on the basis of a common zzso using zzso in order to derive an indirect comparison estimate, while preserving zzso within zzso zzso of zzso were considered regarding study zzso zzso can be pooled in a zzso similarity of trials zzso and zzso and consistency of findings from direct and indirect zzso 

The zzso showed that zzso gel was statistically significantly more effective than other topical treatments in terms of achieving a response defined according to both zzso and zzso zzso zzso gel was generally associated with a statistically significant lower risk of zzso skin zzso or patients withdrawing from zzso due to zzso 

Although direct and indirect evidence in this analysis is zzso this indirect comparison suggests that the zzso gel has significant benefits over other topical therapies considered in the routine management of patients with moderately severe scalp zzso Despite other analysis limitations in terms of study zzso inevitable across an evidence base spanning decades, these results were consistent, using a number of efficacy and zzso outcome zzso
