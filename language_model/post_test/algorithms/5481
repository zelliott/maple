A novel zzso robust control approach is proposed in this study to deal with the learning problems of zzso neural networks zzso The analysis and design of a desired weight update law for the zzso is transformed into a robust controller design problem for a discrete dynamic system in terms of the zzso zzso The drawbacks of some existing learning zzso can therefore be revealed, especially for the case that the output data is fast changing with respect to the input or the output data is corrupted by zzso Based on this approach, the optimal learning parameters can be found by utilizing the linear zzso inequality zzso zzso techniques to achieve a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Several existing zzso zzso are shown to be special cases of the new zzso zzso zzso analysis and several examples are provided to show the advantages of the new zzso
