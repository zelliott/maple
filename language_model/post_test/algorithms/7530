zzso representations provide us with a tool allowing visual inspection of the zzso To zzso and compare different DNA zzso a novel zzso method is proposed in this paper for both zzso representation and similarity analysis of zzso We introduce a transformation to represent each DNA sequence with neighboring zzso zzso Then, based on approximate joint zzso theory, we transform each DNA primary sequence into a corresponding zzso zzso zzso which can be considered as zzso characterization of DNA zzso Meanwhile, we get zzso representation for DNA sequence via the plot of zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, using zzso we cluster these feature zzso of sequences into several reasonable zzso In addition, similarity analyses are performed by computing the distances among the obtained zzso This approach contains more sequence information, and it analyzes all the involved sequence information jointly rather than zzso A typical zzso constructed by this method demonstrates the effectiveness of our zzso
