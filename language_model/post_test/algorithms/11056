Geometric modeling of zzso plays an essential role in the zzso of zzso structure, function, zzso and zzso zzso geometric modeling offers a basis for molecular zzso which is crucial for the understanding of molecular structure and zzso zzso geometric modeling bridges the gap between molecular information, such as that from zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso models, such as molecular zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso In this work, we present a family of zzso zzso geometric models for zzso zzso Our models are able to combine zzso geometric modeling with zzso zzso modeling in a unified zzso zzso We discuss a suite of techniques for molecular surface generation, molecular surface zzso molecular zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso is given to the zzso representations of zzso and the associated zzso zzso analyses as well as zzso zzso zzso The resulting fine resolution representations of a zzso system enable the detailed analysis of zzso interaction, and zzso channel zzso whereas our coarse resolution representations highlight the zzso of zzso zzso and possibility of zzso zzso
