The large, complex networks of interactions between proteins provide a lens through which one can examine the structure and function of biological zzso Previous analyses of these continually growing networks have primarily followed either of two zzso large-scale statistical analysis of holistic network properties, or small-scale analysis of local zzso zzso Meanwhile, investigation of zzso network structure (above that of individual functional zzso while maintaining the significance of individual zzso has been hindered by the zzso complexity of structural search in zzso zzso zzso interaction zzso networks at the zzso may provide insights into the presence and form of relationships between individual protein complexes and functional zzso 

In this article, we present an efficient zzso for performing zzso zzso queries on a network and show its zzso advantage over previous zzso We also present a novel application of this form of zzso search which permits analysis of a network's structure at a scale between that of individual functional zzso and that of zzso zzso This analysis provides support for the presence of zzso zzso in the zzso network of zzso zzso
