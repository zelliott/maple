In this paper, we consider several variations of the following basic zzso problem: given a sequence of real numbers with two zzso zzso we want to find a set of tiles of maximum total weight such that each tiles zzso the size zzso A solution to this problem is important to a number of zzso biology applications such as selecting zzso DNA fragments for zzso zzso zzso and performing zzso searches with long sequence zzso Our goal is to design efficient zzso with linear or zzso time and space in the normal range of zzso values for these zzso For this purpose, we first discuss the solution to a basic online zzso maximum problem via a zzso approach and show how to use this solution in a zzso manner for many of the zzso problems zzso We also discuss zzso results and approximation zzso for zzso our basic zzso problem to higher zzso Finally, zzso results from applying our zzso zzso to zzso sequences of five model zzso are zzso
