zzso zzso relationship zzso models zzso the retention times of fatty acid zzso zzso in high resolution zzso gas zzso and their structures were developed based on zzso and linear modeling zzso zzso zzso zzso was used for the selection of the variables that resulted in the zzso zzso Gravitational index zzso number of zzso double bond zzso and number of trans double bond zzso were selected among a large number of zzso The selected zzso were considered as zzso for artificial neural networks zzso with three different weights update functions including zzso zzso network zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso updates zzso zzso result indicates that the zzso method has better zzso power than the other zzso The model was also tested successfully for external validation zzso Standard error for the training set using zzso was zzso with correlation zzso zzso For the prediction and validation sets, standard error was zzso and zzso and correlation zzso was zzso and zzso zzso The accuracy of zzso zzso model was illustrated using leave multiple zzso zzso zzso and zzso
