Experimental work has demonstrated that the efficient operation of the zzso zzso machinery is sensitive to the presence of zzso crowding zzso Here, I describe zzso detailed computer simulations that provide a microscopic view of how crowding effects are zzso zzso were performed to zzso the free energy required to extract the protein zzso from the central cavity of zzso into solutions containing a range of zzso zzso The zzso zzso allow the total yield of folded protein to be zzso the calculated yields show a zzso dependence on the concentration of crowding agent identical to that observed zzso The close correspondence between simulation and experiment zzso the use of the former in a truly zzso zzso simulations are used to suggest that more effective crowding agents might be designed by exploiting an zzso zzso
