Good zzso control through insulin administration among intensive care unit zzso patients can reduce mortality zzso however, it remains a big challenge because of zzso of individualized models for zzso zzso To deal with this challenge, a new combination of particle swarm zzso zzso and model zzso control zzso has been proposed to identify the model online as well as to zzso design the zzso zzso the insulin delivery rate zzso According to the population distribution, ten typical linear dynamic models were selected such that any patient's model could be zzso by a linear combination of these ten typical zzso zzso was used to update the weight zzso while zzso was used to design the insulin delivery rate based on the combination model identified by using zzso The proposed strategy was compared with the Yale protocol on 30 virtual zzso According to the zzso grid analysis, the percentage values in A + B zone were, respectively, zzso under the proposed strategy and while 51% under the Yale zzso which demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed zzso As a good candidate for the full zzso insulin delivery method, this new combination can control the zzso level by bringing it to a safe range promptly thereby reducing the risk of zzso
