A novel theoretical beam position controlling method for zzso optical system has been proposed in this zzso zzso ring zzso which is a typical zzso optical system, has been chosen as an example to show its zzso To the best of our knowledge, the generalized ray zzso zzso 5 zzso 5 ray zzso for zzso zzso interface transmission and zzso zzso transmission, and their detailed zzso process have been proposed in this paper for the first zzso By utilizing the novel coordinate system for zzso beam reflection and the generalized ray zzso of zzso zzso transmission, the rules and some novel results of the zzso zzso of zzso ring zzso have been zzso zzso zzso zzso errors of zzso ring zzso have been found out and two experimental beam position controlling methods to effectively eliminate the wedge zzso zzso errors have been zzso All those results have been confirmed by related alignment experiments and the experimental results have been described with diagrammatic zzso These findings are important to the beam control, cavity design, and cavity alignment of high precision zzso ring laser zzso Those generalized ray zzso and their zzso methods are valuable for ray analysis of various kinds of zzso zzso and zzso This novel theoretical beam position controlling method for zzso optical system is valuable for the controlling of various kinds of zzso optical zzso
