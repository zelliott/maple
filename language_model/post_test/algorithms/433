Geometric methods are very intuitive and provide a theoretical foundation to many zzso problems in the fields of pattern recognition and machine zzso In this brief, the notion of scaled convex zzso zzso is defined and a set of theoretical results are exploited to support zzso These results allow the existing nearest point zzso to be directly applied to solve both the zzso and zzso zzso problems successfully and zzso Then, the popular zzso zzso has been presented to solve the zzso problems in the context of the zzso zzso The theoretical analysis and some experiments show that the proposed method may achieve better performance than the state-of-the-art methods in terms of the number of kernel evaluations and the execution zzso
