With an increasing need for the rapid and effective safety assessment of compounds in industrial and zzso products, in zzso toxicity exploration techniques provide an economic way for environmental hazard zzso The previous in zzso researches have developed many quantitative zzso relationships models to predict toxicity mechanisms for last zzso Most of these methods benefit from data analysis and machine learning techniques, which rely heavily on the characteristics of data zzso For zzso zzso toxicity data sets, there is a great technical zzso zzso The zzso of data class distribution would greatly deteriorate the prediction performance on rare zzso Most of the previous researches for zzso mechanisms of toxic action prediction did not consider this practical zzso In this work, we dealt with the problem by considering the difference between the two types of zzso Random Forest zzso was employed in zzso learning framework to construct prediction models based on selected molecular zzso In zzso experiments, both the global and local models obtained appreciable overall prediction zzso zzso the performance on rare classes was indeed zzso Moreover, for practical usage of these models, the balance of the two zzso can be adjusted by using different cost zzso according to the application zzso
