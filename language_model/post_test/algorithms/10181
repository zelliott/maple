Deep tissue zzso zzso that may cause unwanted bubble formation or transient bubble growth has been referred to in theoretical models and demonstrated by zzso gas formation in animals, when changing zzso breathing gas from nitrogen to zzso after zzso air zzso We visually followed the in zzso resolution of zzso air bubbles injected at 101 zzso into nitrogen zzso rat zzso zzso spinal white matter, skeletal muscle or tail zzso Bubbles were observed during zzso zzso shifts from air to zzso zzso zzso mixture while at 285 zzso or following immediate zzso to either 285 or 405 zzso breathing zzso and zzso zzso zzso During the zzso shifts, some bubbles in zzso tissue grew marginally for zzso zzso subsequently they shrank and disappeared at a rate similar to or faster than during air zzso No such bubble growth was observed in spinal white matter, skeletal muscle or zzso In spinal white matter, an immediate breathing gas shift after the zzso air exposure from air to both zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso to either 285 or 405 zzso caused consistent shrinkage of all air bubbles, until they disappeared from zzso Deep tissue zzso zzso may cause some air bubbles to grow zzso in zzso zzso The effect is marginal and of no clinical zzso zzso disappearance rate is faster with zzso breathing zzso as compared to zzso We see no reason for reservations in the use of zzso breathing during treatment of zzso zzso zzso
