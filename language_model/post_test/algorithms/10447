Recently, increasing attention has been focused on the investigation of the human brain zzso that describes the patterns of structural and functional connectivity networks of the human zzso Many studies of the human zzso have demonstrated that the brain network follows a zzso zzso with an zzso cohesive modular structure and includes several network hubs in the zzso zzso zzso However, most of these studies have only focused on zzso connections between regions in which the directions of information flow are not taken into zzso How the brain regions zzso influence each other and how the directed network of human brain is zzso organized remain largely zzso Here, we applied linear zzso zzso causality analysis zzso and graph theoretical approaches to a zzso functional zzso zzso with a large cohort of young healthy participants zzso to explore connectivity patterns of the zzso zzso functional directed zzso This directed brain network exhibited prominent zzso properties, which obviously improved previous results of functional zzso studies showing weak zzso properties in the directed brain networks in terms of a zzso zzso and individual zzso This brain network also showed significant modular structures associated with 5 well known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and primary zzso zzso we identified several driving hubs predominantly located in the components of the zzso network zzso the inferior frontal zzso supplementary motor area, zzso and zzso zzso and several driven hubs predominantly located in the components of the default mode network zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prefrontal zzso and inferior zzso zzso Further zzso analyses indicated that our results were highly zzso between two independent zzso The current study demonstrated the directions of spontaneous information flow and zzso influences in the directed brain networks, thus providing new insights into our understanding of human brain functional zzso
