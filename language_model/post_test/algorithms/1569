Studies that have combined zzso and global positioning systems zzso to identify walking have done so in carefully controlled zzso This study tested zzso for identifying walking trips from zzso and zzso data in zzso zzso The study also assessed the accuracy of the locations where walking occurred compared with what participants reported in a zzso 

A convenience sample of high school females was recruited (N zzso zzso in zzso Participants wore a zzso unit and an zzso and recorded their zzso travel for 6 zzso zzso validation was used to examine agreement in the daily and total number of walking trips with Kappa statistics and count zzso models, while agreement in locations visited by walking was examined with geographic information zzso 

zzso varied based on the parameters of the algorithm, with zzso exhibiting moderate to substantial agreement with zzso daily zzso zzso zzso and weekly zzso zzso zzso walking zzso zzso of reported locations reached by walking and zzso data suggest that reported locations are zzso 

The use of zzso and zzso is promising for assessing the number of walking trips and the walking locations of adolescent zzso
