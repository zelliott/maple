In this paper, we present an approach to zzso the brain zzso in phase contrast magnetic resonance zzso zzso According to our prior work, we can describe the overall probability density function of a zzso speed image as either a zzso zzso or zzso zzso mixture zzso An automatic mechanism based on zzso divergence is proposed for selecting between the zzso and zzso models given a speed image zzso A zzso measure, namely local phase zzso zzso which incorporates information about the spatial relationships between neighboring flow zzso is defined and shown to be more robust to noise than previously described zzso zzso A statistical measure from the speed images and the zzso measure from the phase images are combined in a zzso zzso based on the maximum a zzso method and zzso random fields, to estimate the zzso probabilities of vessel and background for zzso It is shown that zzso based on both measures gives a more accurate zzso than using either speed or flow zzso information zzso The proposed method is tested on zzso flow phantom and clinical zzso The results show that the method can segment normal vessels and vascular regions with relatively low flow rate and low zzso ratio, zzso zzso and zzso
