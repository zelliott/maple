A novel real-time zzso framework for range imaging zzso based respiratory motion analysis in image guided interventions such as zzso radiation therapy is zzso We constitute our method based upon real-time constraints in clinical practice and an zzso analysis of zzso based elastic body surface deformation zzso For the latter, we show that the underlying joint rigid and zzso registration problem is zzso and identify insufficient body coverage as an error zzso Facing these issues, we propose a novel zzso ray casting technique enabling the reconstruction of an 180 degrees coverage body surface model composed of - 3 zzso zzso points from zzso fused zzso range data in - 25 zzso zzso the wide field of view surface model enabled by our method, we reduce the error in motion compensated patient alignment by a factor of zzso in the zzso and zzso in the zzso component compared to conventional single sensor surface zzso
