zzso within the zzso lining of the zzso cavity metabolize a variety of zzso volatile zzso In common with zzso developed for other zzso zzso the nose extracts these chemicals from the zzso thereby clearing some portion of the total zzso zzso In this article, a zzso based zzso zzso model of zzso metabolism is used to predict extraction for zzso zzso This model, developed by zzso of existing zzso based zzso zzso zzso models, has three tissue regions in two flow zzso A zzso flow stream zzso passes over a small area of respiratory zzso and then over the entire zzso zzso surface within the zzso A zzso zzso consisting of most of the total flow, passes over the larger portion zzso of the respiratory zzso Each underlying tissue stack has a zzso layer, an zzso tissue zzso and a blood exchange zzso zzso may occur in any of the zzso within the tissue zzso The model, solved directly for a zzso condition, specifies the zzso zzso over each zzso zzso fluid dynamic zzso solutions for the rat and human for the case with no zzso resistance provided a maximum value for regional zzso zzso zzso zzso phase zzso zzso (also referred to as the zzso mass transfer zzso were calculated based on these zzso zzso The zzso model was applied to assess expected species differences in zzso extraction and in localized tissue metabolism of zzso zzso zzso in rats and in zzso Model estimates of tissue dose of zzso zzso (in zzso zzso zzso in both species were used to evaluate the zzso adjustment factor zzso that should be applied in reference concentration zzso calculations for zzso For human ventilation rates equivalent to light exercise, the zzso was estimated to be zzso at zzso zzso the benchmark concentration for zzso zzso Depending on specific assumptions about distribution of zzso activities in human zzso the range of zzso values was zzso The zzso for heavy exercise with a ventilation rate of 42 zzso was still zzso zzso zzso were concentration dependent, varying between zzso and zzso in the zzso concentration range from 1 and 400 zzso Present default methods zzso a zzso of zzso These zzso calculations with this zzso model should be useful in risk assessment calculations for a variety of zzso and gases that are converted to toxic zzso in cells in the respiratory zzso
