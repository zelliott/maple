A zzso zzso tree, or zzso is a zzso of a zzso tree that allows each leaf label to be used many zzso zzso have applications in zzso the study of zzso zzso gene evolution studies, and computer zzso Here, we consider the problem of zzso a consensus zzso that summarizes a given set of conflicting zzso and present the first zzso zzso for solving zzso In particular, we give a straightforward, fast zzso for building a strict consensus zzso for any input set of zzso with identical leaf label zzso as well as a zzso zzso for building a majority rule consensus zzso for the special case where every leaf label occurs at most zzso We also show that, although it is zzso to find a majority rule consensus zzso in general, the zzso that we call the singular majority rule consensus zzso can be constructed efficiently whenever it zzso
