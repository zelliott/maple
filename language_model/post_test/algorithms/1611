Many platforms for zzso analysis of gene expression contain zzso measures for the same zzso For example, the most highly zzso platforms for gene expression zzso zzso zzso zzso have as many as ten or more probe sets for some zzso Occasionally, individual probe sets for the same gene report different trends in expression across experimental conditions, a situation that must be resolved in order to accurately interpret the zzso We developed an algorithm, zzso for determining the level of agreement between such probe sets, utilizing a statistical test of zzso Kendall's W zzso of zzso and a zzso zzso for the identification of zzso probe zzso We also present methods for consolidating zzso groups into a single value for its corresponding gene and for post hoc analysis of zzso zzso By combining statistical consolidation with sequence analysis, zzso possesses the unique ability to identify biologically meaningful zzso behaviors, including differing behaviors in alternate zzso zzso and zzso patterns of zzso When consolidating zzso behaviors, zzso zzso other methods in detecting both differential expression and overrepresented functional zzso
