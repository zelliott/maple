The increasing use of mouse models for human brain disease studies presents an emerging need for a new functional imaging zzso Using optical zzso and acoustic zzso we developed a functional connectivity zzso zzso system, which allows zzso imaging of zzso functional connectivity in the mouse brain, with a large field of view and a high spatial zzso zzso correlations were observed in eight functional regions, including the zzso bulb, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions, as well as in several zzso The borders and locations of these regions agreed well with the zzso mouse brain zzso By subjecting the mouse to alternating zzso and hypoxic conditions, strong and weak functional zzso were observed, zzso In addition to connectivity images, vascular images were simultaneously zzso These studies show that functional connectivity zzso zzso is a promising, zzso technique for functional imaging of the mouse zzso
