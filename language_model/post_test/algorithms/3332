Age (in zzso of the child has conventionally been used in zzso to estimate the zzso tube zzso zzso The objective of this retrospective study was to test a zzso formula zzso for zzso oral zzso in children and compare it with the conventional zzso formula zzso 

The patient's age, weight, and size of zzso internal diameter zzso were zzso For comparative analysis, the actual zzso size used was compared with predicted zzso size, calculated using both the standard zzso zzso zzso age zzso + 4 zzso and the zzso zzso zzso weight zzso + zzso zzso 

The zzso correlation zzso for age and actual zzso size used was zzso zzso zzso zzso and between weight and actual zzso used was zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso correctly predicted zzso of zzso sizes while the zzso correctly predicted zzso of zzso sizes zzso zzso zzso The measures of agreement between the actual and predicted zzso size were zzso and zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso The difference between the percentages of paired predictions for the zzso and zzso was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso suggesting that, when correctly predicting the actual tube size used, the zzso functions for a different subset of the patient cohort than the zzso 

This study suggests that in this patient zzso the zzso is statistically inferior to the conventional zzso However, our findings also suggest that the zzso may correctly predict zzso sizes in a subset of patients in whom the zzso is zzso
