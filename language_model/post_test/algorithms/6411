zzso zzso has become a vital tool for studies of protein zzso changes and zzso zzso zzso c are a particularly attractive target for zzso analysis because their zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to high zzso chemical shift zzso even for unfolded or otherwise zzso zzso In addition, analysis of shifts induced by the zzso interaction reveals details of the structure of the zzso and its zzso for native and zzso protein zzso zzso The use of zzso zzso to investigate the folding and dynamics of zzso zzso c is reviewed zzso Studies of zzso zzso formed by zzso and by anomalous in zzso maturation zzso zzso are facilitated by the zzso zzso nature of native and zzso forms of zzso zzso Investigation of the dynamics of folded zzso c also are aided by their zzso As an example of this analysis, the expression in zzso coli of zzso zzso from zzso zzso is reported here, along with analysis of its unusual zzso zzso zzso The results are suggestive of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso The application of zzso zzso to investigate zzso zzso c folding and dynamics has advanced our understanding of the structure and dynamics of both native and zzso states of zzso zzso
