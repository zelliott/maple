An accurate scoring function for database search is crucial for zzso identification using tandem mass zzso Although many mathematical models have been proposed to score peptides against tandem mass zzso our method (called zzso zzso is unique in that it combines information on machine zzso mass peak intensity, and correlation among zzso into a hidden zzso model zzso In addition, we develop a method to calculate statistical significance of the zzso zzso We implement the method and test them on two sets of experimental data generated by two different types of mass zzso and compare the results with MASCOT and zzso under the same zzso One experimental results show that zzso has a much higher accuracy (with zzso error zzso than MASCOT (with zzso error zzso and the other experimental results show that zzso identifies 43 and zzso more correct zzso than zzso and zzso zzso
