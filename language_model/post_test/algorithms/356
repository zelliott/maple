zzso and zzso zzso remain constant problems in cardiac surgical zzso In this study, we aimed to test the role of a routine zzso zzso zzso on bleeding and zzso in patients undergoing zzso coronary artery bypass zzso zzso 

Patients zzso zzso zzso undergoing zzso zzso with zzso bypass were zzso zzso into two groups according to zzso zzso in group 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso need for blood zzso was based on zzso discretion and standard zzso tests and in group 2 zzso zzso group, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blood loss, and outcome data were zzso 

There were no differences in consumption of packed cell units, blood loss, zzso for zzso and early clinical outcome between the zzso Patients in the zzso group had significantly lower median units of fresh frozen plasma and zzso compared with the other group zzso zzso zzso The median number of total zzso units zzso zzso cells and blood zzso was significantly reduced in the zzso group compared with the other group zzso 2, range 1-3 units zzso median 3, range 2-4 units, respectively, p zzso zzso The need for zzso acid was significantly diminished in the zzso group compared with the other group zzso zzso zzso respectively, p zzso zzso 

Our results show that routine use of a zzso zzso reduces the consumption of blood products in patients undergoing zzso zzso zzso such an zzso into routine management of these patients may help to improve clinical outcome and reduce the potential risks of zzso complications and total costs after zzso
