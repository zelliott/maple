Association mapping using abundant single zzso zzso is a powerful tool for identifying disease zzso genes for complex traits and exploring possible genetic zzso zzso large numbers of zzso individually is performed routinely but is cost prohibitive for large-scale genetic zzso DNA pooling is a reliable and zzso alternative zzso zzso However, no software has been developed for complete zzso zzso including data zzso zzso frequency zzso and zzso DNA pooling association zzso This motivated the development of the software, zzso zzso DNA zzso to analyze pooled DNA zzso 

We develop the software, zzso for the analysis of zzso zzso zzso is originally implemented with the zzso language, but it can also be executed on a Windows system without installing the zzso zzso provides estimates of the zzso of preferential amplification and zzso zzso zzso considers an extended zzso association test, which can compare zzso zzso between two DNA pools constructed under different experimental zzso Moreover, zzso also provides novel zzso zzso association tests based on zzso combinations and a zzso zzso This new zzso testing procedure overcomes a zzso bottleneck of conventional zzso zzso methods in DNA pooling analyses and can handle data sets having a large pool size and/or large numbers of zzso zzso All of the zzso functions are illustrated in the four bona fide zzso 

zzso is simple to operate and does not require that users have a strong statistical zzso The software is available at zzso
