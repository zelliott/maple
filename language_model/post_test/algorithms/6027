In this paper, we study zzso zzso problem by investigating zzso systems ruled by the one-dimensional zzso zzso zzso We obtain an zzso expression for the zzso escape rate under zzso conditions by employing a zzso potential and its predictions are in excellent agreement with zzso zzso The results exhibit the anomalies due to the zzso in W that the escape rate grows with D and drops as zzso becomes large at a fixed zzso Indeed, particles in the zzso media zzso can escape over the barrier only when D is above a critical value, while this confinement does not exist in the zzso media zzso
