The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso particles with average sizes of 4 and 40 zzso using a zzso bed filter at 40 and 300 degrees C was zzso The collection mechanisms, zzso forces and zzso effect between filtered particles and collectors were analyzed to determine their effect on particle zzso Experimental results showed that the collection efficiency of 4 zzso zzso and zzso particles exceeded that of 40 zzso zzso zzso the 40 zzso zzso particles were collected more efficiently than the 4 zzso zzso because of the differences between the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The interaction between the particles affected the removal of mixed zzso zzso and zzso The particle size distribution zzso of the particles in the exit was governed by the operating temperature, the original size of the filtered zzso the zzso force and the zzso of the particles and the zzso The smallest particles were not those most easily zzso from the zzso bed filter because they zzso with each other or with large zzso The van der zzso force dominated the forces between 4 and 40 zzso zzso The main collection mechanism for 4 and 40 zzso particles was direct zzso The effect of zzso increased with particle size above 40 zzso The strong zzso and zzso effect reduced the collection efficiency of 40 zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the strong zzso force between zzso particles and collectors contributed to the high collection efficiency of the zzso zzso
