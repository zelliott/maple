We obtain simple exact formulas for the zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso with arbitrary zzso terms by considering an incident plane zzso zzso along the optical zzso We provide formulas for the zzso phase front using the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Using the fact that they are zzso we have in the second method found a way to use an improper zzso instead of the usual evaluated zzso to arrive at these zzso As expected, when the condition of total internal reflection is satisfied, there is no contribution to the formation of the zzso zzso
