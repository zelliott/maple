zzso biology offers novel opportunities for zzso zzso regulatory mechanisms and zzso zzso Complex zzso zzso the ones driving expression of the zzso zzso zzso proven difficult to design from existing knowledge, presumably due to the large number of zzso interactions needed to drive the correct expression patterns of genes in zzso zzso This work discusses two novel zzso methods for the custom design of enhancers that employ a zzso zzso validated zzso model, zzso zzso and synthetic zzso These synthetic elements have both utilitarian and academic value, including improving existing regulatory models as well as evolutionary zzso The first method involves the use of simulated zzso to explore the sequence space for synthetic enhancers whose expression output fit a given search zzso The second method uses a novel zzso zzso to find functionally accessible pathways between two zzso zzso These paths describe a set of zzso wherein the predicted expression pattern does not significantly vary at any point along the zzso Both methods rely on a zzso mathematical framework that maps the zzso sequence space to functional zzso
