In this study, general relationships zzso to a wide variety of zzso treatment processes are developed using a number of zzso stirred tank zzso zzso equations resulting from mass balance on zzso and biomass are solved zzso taking the zzso biomass zzso into zzso A relationship between zzso and biomass zzso is developed as a function of zzso residence zzso zzso zzso and mathematical models of zzso are used to represent the actual conditions resulting from varying degrees of zzso zzso and wastewater zzso zzso quantities are used to reduce the number of parameters to be taken into zzso Computer techniques are applied to express the results zzso By means of the zzso approach, the variation of the ratio between the zzso residence time of a given reactor and that of an equivalent zzso tank with the same inlet and outlet conditions is zzso zzso are expressed in the form of zzso to characterize the zzso activated sludge systems and to provide a basis of zzso Experimental data reported in the literature are also evaluated to demonstrate the cases where the existing classical solution to the problem differs from the actual results obtained from the computer program and the design zzso zzso
