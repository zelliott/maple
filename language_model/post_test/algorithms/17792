The problem of zzso protein folding is critical for protein structure zzso The model presented introduces a common definition of protein structures which may be treated as the possible in zzso zzso form of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso space to the zzso path on the zzso map was tested as a possible zzso to represent the zzso structure for simulation of protein zzso The proposed zzso zzso was developed on the basis of the backbone zzso with zzso interactions zzso 

The zzso zzso of zzso was created using the criterion of shortest distance between Phi, zzso angles in native form of protein and the Phi, zzso angles belonging to the zzso No knots were observed in the structure created according to zzso zzso zzso The energy zzso procedure applied to zzso derived zzso directed structural changes toward the native form of the protein with zzso system introduced to the zzso 

Program zzso to create the zzso derived structure available on zzso zzso
