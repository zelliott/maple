The zzso zzso is part of a broader signaling network in which zzso between pathways zzso While the molecular mechanisms of zzso signaling zzso have been studied in detail, the global networks downstream of zzso remain largely zzso The regulatory effect of zzso complex likely depends on zzso zzso in which the zzso binding elements and partner zzso factor binding sites zzso zzso are present in specific zzso 

To address this question and develop a zzso model for zzso zzso we simultaneously performed zzso zzso followed by zzso analysis zzso and zzso expression profiling to identify zzso regulated and zzso zzso gene sets in zzso surface zzso zzso the zzso and gene expression data yielded 150 direct targets, of which 141 were grouped into 3 zzso gene sets zzso zzso transient zzso and zzso based on their zzso changes in expression after zzso zzso We developed a zzso method driven by the Random Forest zzso to model zzso zzso zzso in the target zzso The predicted zzso zzso contain zzso binding element and up to 2 of 7 other zzso factor binding sites zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

Together, the zzso results further the understanding of the interactions between zzso and other zzso factors at specific target zzso and provide the basis for more targeted experimental zzso of the zzso zzso
