One of the major obstacles in zzso is the identification of unknown zzso We tested constraints for zzso the correct structures of 29 known zzso zzso from zzso premier accurate mass chemical zzso zzso mass zzso data without any use of mass spectral zzso zzso zzso formulas were retrieved within the zzso hits for most molecular zzso zzso using the zzso Golden zzso zzso An average of zzso potential structures per formula was downloaded from the zzso chemical database and zzso using the zzso software zzso After chemical zzso zzso retention zzso zzso were predicted for up to zzso potential structures per formula using the zzso zzso group contribution zzso and corrected for contribution of zzso groups using the zzso zzso zzso When matching the range of predicted zzso values against the zzso determined peak zzso all but three incorrect formulas were zzso For all remaining zzso structures, accurate mass electron zzso zzso were predicted using the zzso software and scored against experimental zzso Using a mass error window of 10 zzso for zzso zzso zzso of all zzso structures were removed and the correct structure was reported in zzso within the zzso hits of the zzso
