zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso provides direct detection and mapping of free zzso The continuous wave zzso zzso technique, in particular, has been widely used in a variety of applications in the fields of biology and medicine due to its high sensitivity and zzso to a wide range of free zzso and zzso zzso However, the technique requires long image acquisition zzso and this limits its use for many in zzso applications where relatively rapid changes occur in the magnitude and distribution of zzso zzso there has been a great need to develop fast zzso zzso We report the development of a fast zzso CW zzso technique using spiral magnetic field zzso By spiraling the magnetic field zzso and stepping the main magnetic field, this approach acquires a zzso image in one sweep of the main magnetic field, enabling significant reduction of the imaging zzso A direct zzso zzso image reconstruction algorithm, modified for reconstruction of the zzso images from the projections acquired with the spiral magnetic field zzso was zzso We demonstrated using a zzso zzso zzso system that the spiral magnetic field zzso technique enabled a zzso accelerated acquisition of zzso This technique has great potential for in zzso studies of free zzso and their zzso
