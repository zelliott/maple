zzso sequencing has led to many zzso zzso zzso association zzso Although zzso association analysis can be performed, it is zzso zzso zzso researchers have developed many RV association tests that zzso multiple zzso sites across a genetic region zzso zzso and test for the association between the trait and the zzso zzso After these zzso tests detect an association, it is only possible to estimate the average genetic effect for a group of zzso As a result of the zzso zzso such an estimate can be zzso Although for common zzso one can obtain unbiased estimates of genetic parameters by analyzing a replication sample, for zzso it is desirable to obtain unbiased genetic estimates for the study where the association is zzso This is because there can be substantial zzso of RV sites and zzso even among closely related zzso In order to obtain an unbiased estimate for zzso RV analysis, we developed zzso zzso to reduce the bias of the winner's zzso The unbiased estimates are greatly important for understanding the zzso contribution of zzso to the zzso of complex zzso We also demonstrate both theoretically and via simulations that for zzso RV analysis the genetic zzso for a gene or region will always be underestimated, sometimes zzso because of the presence of zzso zzso or because of the presence of zzso zzso with effects of different zzso or zzso zzso even if zzso play a major role in the zzso zzso a portion of the zzso will remain missing, and the contribution of zzso to the zzso zzso will be zzso
