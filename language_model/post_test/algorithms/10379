zzso screening zzso is a well-established technology which can test up to several million compounds in a few zzso Despite these appealing capabilities, available resources and high costs may limit the number of molecules screened, making diversity analysis a method of choice to design and prioritize screening zzso With a constantly increasing number of molecules available for zzso chemical space has become a key concept for zzso zzso and comparing chemical zzso In this first article, we present a new method to build zzso reference chemical zzso zzso A set of 16 million screening compounds from 73 chemical providers has been gathered, resulting in a database of zzso million standardized and unique zzso These molecules have been used to create three zzso using three different sets of chemical zzso A robust principal component analysis model for each space has been zzso zzso molecules are projected in a reduced two-dimensional zzso zzso The specificity of our approach is that each reduced space has been zzso by a representative zzso encompassing a very large proportion of molecules and reflecting its overall zzso The methodology is illustrated by mapping and comparing various chemical zzso Several tools used in these studies are made freely available, thus enabling any user to zzso zzso matching specific zzso
