The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of a respiratory weaning zzso zzso in zzso cardiac surgery zzso This zzso was made simple enough to be implemented in zzso zzso zzso 

Twenty consecutive zzso patients who underwent scheduled cardiac surgery with normal zzso zzso and respiratory zzso 

A 3 step zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Support zzso at zzso zzso and at zzso zzso was applied every 15 minute by the same zzso A 15 minute period of respiratory stability at one step led to commute to a step ahead until patient was judged zzso for zzso zzso zzso stable during 15 zzso under zzso zzso zzso Once reaching this time, the patient was left under zzso zzso until nurse and doctors in charge decided zzso according to our routine clinical zzso 

the patients were routinely zzso in average zzso zzso later than when judged zzso by the zzso Heart rate zzso and mean zzso pressure rose when they reached the time of effective zzso by comparison to the zzso time zzso 

A zzso has clinical advantage in cardiac surgery as it reduces respiratory weaning zzso It helps to avoiding zzso stress related to delayed zzso Such an zzso is simple enough to be implemented in zzso zzso
