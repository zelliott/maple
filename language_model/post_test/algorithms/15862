zzso evaluation using zzso can accommodate zzso zzso if the necessary zzso components are zzso this may require zzso of zzso components within each zzso zzso Properties of zzso and residual zzso estimates obtained by an empirical zzso approach, which combines zzso and prior estimates, were examined via zzso Prior estimates were obtained using zzso across zzso as if zzso were zzso zzso was improved by incorporation of prior information such that zzso component estimates could be obtained in zzso situations for which a zzso zzso failed to zzso zzso of zzso zzso estimates was greatest when both zzso and prior information were used, but improvement in accuracy of residual zzso estimates associated with incorporation of prior information was zzso zzso between zzso standardized true zzso abilities and zzso that used empirical zzso zzso estimates were larger than those obtained when zzso was zzso zzso of zzso selected, based on standardized zzso from environments with differing genetic and residual zzso became more uniform as the relative weight placed on zzso data in zzso zzso zzso Thus, useful zzso component estimates can be obtained within individual zzso by using empirical zzso methods with zzso estimates as prior zzso this may allow prediction of breeding values that are less influenced by zzso zzso
