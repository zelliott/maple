Since 1997, several countries within the Asian Pacific region have been affected by one or more massive outbreaks of Hand Foot and zzso Disease zzso zzso typing experiments revealed that these outbreaks were caused by strains of human zzso 71 zzso belonging to several different, recently emerged zzso In mainland China, a different situation was zzso The first outbreak, localized in zzso Province, was reported in 2007, and was followed by a zzso outbreak in mainland China in zzso Since then, numbers of reported zzso cases have been persistently zzso 

To gain insight in the zzso behavior of zzso in China, we studied genetic diversity and zzso population dynamics to address whether the increase in number of reported zzso infections reflects a real increase in viral spread or is just the result of increased awareness and zzso We used systematically collected zzso gene sequences of zzso zzso strains collected in zzso province from 2008 to 2010 as part of zzso surveillance activities, and supplemented them with zzso zzso zzso reference zzso collected in China from 1998 to zzso All zzso from zzso Province belonged to zzso zzso zzso population dynamics indicated that the increased reporting of zzso in China since 2007 reflects a real increase in viral spread and continued replacement of viral lineages through zzso zzso acid sequence comparisons revealed substitution of zzso acid in zzso 22, 145 and zzso through time regularly with the zzso gene of zzso strains isolated in mainland China from 1998 to zzso 

zzso strains isolated in mainland China mainly belonged to zzso zzso There was exponential growth of the zzso virus population in 2007 and zzso There was zzso acid substitution through time regularly with the zzso gene which possibly increased viral spread and/or ability of the virus to circulate persistently among the Chinese zzso
