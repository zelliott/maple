A general modeling approach for a broad class of zzso systems is presented that uses the concept of principal dynamic modes zzso These zzso constitute a filter bank whose zzso feed into a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso form to yield a general model for the broad class of zzso zzso Because the practically zzso models (from zzso zzso are of arbitrary order of zzso this approach is zzso to many zzso zzso systems zzso beyond our zzso zzso Two specific methods are proposed for the zzso of these zzso and the associated zzso from zzso zzso zzso I uses zzso of a properly constructed zzso using the first two kernel estimates zzso by existing zzso zzso II uses a particular class of zzso artificial neural networks with zzso zzso zzso The efficacy of these two methods is demonstrated with zzso examples, and their relative performance is zzso The advent of this approach promises a zzso solution to the zzso problem of modeling highly zzso zzso systems, provided that experimental data be available for reliable zzso of the requisite zzso
