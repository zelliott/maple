zzso the so-called zzso zzso could also be applied as an antiseptic if it was understood why the solution killing microbes rapidly does not cause any harm to humans or to zzso Our aim was to find the source of that selectivity by studying its zzso mechanism both theoretically and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso through protein zzso were performed and the time delay of zzso transport due to reaction and diffusion was zzso To calculate zzso penetration depths and estimate bacterial killing times, approximate solutions of the zzso equation were zzso In these calculations evaporation rates of zzso were also measured and taken into zzso 

The rate law of the zzso model predicts that the killing time is zzso to the square of the characteristic size zzso zzso of a body, thus, small ones will be killed extremely zzso For example, the killing time for a zzso is on the order of milliseconds in a 300 zzso zzso zzso Thus, a few minutes of contact time zzso by the volatility of zzso is quite enough to kill all bacteria, but short enough to keep zzso penetration into the living zzso of a greater zzso safely below zzso zzso minimizing zzso effects when applying it as an zzso Additional properties of zzso advantageous for an zzso are also zzso Most importantly, that bacteria are not able to develop resistance against zzso as it zzso with biological zzso which play a vital role in all living zzso 

zzso of zzso between humans and bacteria is based not on their different zzso but on their different zzso We hope initiating clinical applications of this promising local zzso
