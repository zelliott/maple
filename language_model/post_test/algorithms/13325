The high noise level found in zzso electron zzso zzso image data presents a special challenge for three-dimensional zzso reconstruction of the zzso zzso The spectral zzso ratio zzso and related zzso shell correlation zzso functions are commonly used to assess and mitigate the zzso error in the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso usually includes the noise in the zzso region surrounding the particle and therefore does not accurately reflect the signal in the particle density zzso Here we show that the zzso in a reconstructed zzso particle map is zzso zzso to the fractional volume occupied by the zzso Using this relationship, we devise a novel filter (the zzso Wiener zzso to minimize the error in a reconstructed particle map, if the particle volume is zzso Moreover, we show how to approximate this filter even when the volume of the particle is not known, by zzso the signal within a representative interior region of the zzso We show that the new filter improves on previously proposed zzso schemes, including the conventional Wiener filter as well as zzso zzso and zzso the relationship between all of these methods by theoretical analysis as well as zzso evaluation of both simulated and zzso collected zzso The zzso Wiener filter is zzso across a broad range of existing zzso reconstruction techniques, but is particularly well suited to the zzso inversion method, leading to an efficient and accurate zzso
