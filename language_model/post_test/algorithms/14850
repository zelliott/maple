In an effort towards zzso this paper evaluates the performance of five eye movement zzso zzso in terms of their assessment of zzso fixation and zzso zzso The results indicate that performance of these five commonly used zzso vary dramatically even in the case of a simple stimulus evoked task using a single, common threshold zzso The important contributions of this paper are: 1) evaluation and comparison of performance of five zzso to zzso specific zzso behavior 2) introduction and comparison of new standardized scores to provide more reliable zzso performance 3) logic for a reasonable threshold value selection for any eye movement zzso zzso based on the standardized scores and 4) logic for establishing a zzso baseline for performance comparison between any eye movement zzso zzso zzso techniques enable efficient and objective clinical applications providing means to assure meaningful automated eye movement zzso
