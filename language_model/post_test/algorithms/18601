To evaluate the practice of zzso appendectomy zzso in zzso 

On behalf of the Italian Society of Young Surgeons zzso an audit of LA was carried out through a written questionnaire sent to 800 institutions in zzso The questions concerned the diffusion of zzso surgery and LA over the period 1990 through 2001, zzso morbidity and mortality rates, indications for zzso the diagnostic zzso adopted prior to surgery, and use of LA among young surgeons zzso zzso 

A total of 182 institutions zzso participated in the current zzso and accounted for a total number of zzso zzso zzso surgery is performed in 173 zzso institutions, with 144 zzso routinely performing zzso The mean zzso from introduction of zzso surgery to inception of LA was zzso zzso zzso zzso There was an emergent basis for zzso zzso LA procedures zzso hours of zzso zzso zzso procedures were performed on an urgent basis zzso hours of zzso while zzso zzso procedures were zzso The conversion rate was zzso zzso zzso and was due to zzso complications in 197 cases zzso zzso complications ranged as high as zzso while zzso complications were reported in zzso of successfully completed zzso The mean hospital stay for successfully completed LA was zzso zzso zzso zzso The highest rate of zzso complications was reported as occurring during the learning curve phase of their experience (in their first 10 zzso by zzso of the zzso LA was indicated for every case of suspected acute zzso disease by zzso of zzso and zzso order abdominal ultrasound zzso prior to zzso A zzso counseling is deemed necessary only by zzso zzso while an abdominal CT scan is required only by zzso The procedure is completed zzso in the absence of gross zzso inflammation by zzso zzso try to complete the procedure zzso in the presence of zzso zzso while zzso convert to open surgery in cases of suspected zzso Of responding surgeons aged under 40, zzso can perform zzso compared to zzso surgeons of all age zzso 

The low response rate of the present survey does not allow us to assess the diffusion of LA in Italy, but rather to appraise its practice in centers routinely performing zzso zzso In the hands of experienced zzso LA has morbidity rates comparable to those of international zzso The higher diagnostic yield of zzso makes it an invaluable tool in the management zzso of women of zzso zzso its advantages in the presence of severe zzso are less zzso Surgeons remain the main limiting factor preventing a wider diffusion of LA in our country, since only zzso of surgeons from the audited institutions can perform LA on a routine zzso
