In the differential diagnosis of zzso zzso vs zzso melanoma, patient age provides a critical piece of clinical information, because zzso zzso occur mostly in children and zzso occur mostly in zzso Nevertheless, there is overlap in the age zzso of zzso zzso and zzso The issue to consider is how these age zzso and their governing probability zzso can impact the a zzso probability that a zzso is a zzso zzso vs a zzso zzso I introduce a quantitative approach that uses zzso rule together with previous published data on the age zzso in zzso zzso and zzso The resulting zzso yields plots and a table of zzso a zzso probabilities of zzso zzso given patient age occurring within narrow zzso and I believe these provide useful guidelines for using age in the differential diagnosis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
