zzso zzso has attractive features for targeting hypoxic cells in tumors but has limited clinical activity, in part because of poor zzso zzso Here, we identify improved zzso zzso by using a zzso resolved zzso zzso model that considers tissue penetration explicitly during lead zzso 

The zzso model was used to guide the progression of 281 zzso zzso through a zzso zzso For compounds exceeding hypoxic selectivity thresholds in zzso cultures, zzso model parameters zzso of zzso zzso zzso cell killing zzso diffusion zzso in zzso zzso and plasma zzso at well tolerated doses in zzso were measured to prioritize testing in zzso models in combination with zzso 

zzso lead zzso identified zzso and zzso as the most promising hypoxic zzso from two different structural zzso Both were reduced to the corresponding zzso selectively under zzso by zzso cells, with an oxygen dependence zzso similar to that of zzso zzso in particular, showed higher hypoxic potency and selectivity than zzso in tumor cell cultures and faster diffusion through zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both compounds also provided superior plasma zzso in mice and rats at equivalent zzso In agreement with zzso predictions, both were more active than zzso with single dose or zzso radiation against multiple human tumor zzso 

zzso and zzso are improved zzso zzso with potential for targeting tumor zzso in zzso Novel zzso modeling approaches can be used for lead zzso during zzso drug zzso
