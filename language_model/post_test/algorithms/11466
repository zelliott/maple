zzso therapy against zzso appears to be a promising target in zzso zzso However, a zzso risk for zzso on zzso images thought to represent zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso has been observed in clinical zzso To assess the intensity of zzso zzso an MR imaging scale that is both zzso and easily implemented would assist in monitoring and evaluating this adverse zzso 

On the basis of a review of existing cases from a phase II zzso study, a scale was constructed with a 6-point score for the 6 regions on each side of the brain zzso zzso Scores would be obtained for both zzso and zzso zzso and frequently zzso zzso zzso zzso reliability between 2 zzso was evaluated in 20 patients, 10 with known zzso and 10 without, by using the zzso correlation zzso 

The 2 zzso had excellent agreement in the identification of zzso zzso A high zzso agreement was observed for scores of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and for the combined scores of the 2 zzso findings zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso swelling scores were observed to have lower zzso agreement zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The proposed rating scale provides a reliable and easily implemented instrument to grade zzso imaging zzso We currently do not recommend including zzso
