We investigate zzso dynamics on zzso networks to include the effect of zzso as weighted networks are conceivably more pertinent to real-world situations than zzso zzso We consider both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our analysis and zzso indicate that more links in weighted zzso networks can either promote or suppress zzso In particular, we find that as a zzso characterizing the weighting scheme is zzso there can be two distinct zzso a normal regime where more links can enhance synchronization and an abnormal regime where the opposite zzso A striking phenomenon is that for dense networks for which the zzso approximation is satisfied, the point separating the two regimes does not depend on the details of the network structure such as the average degree and the degree zzso This implies the existence of a class of weighted zzso networks for which the synchronization dynamics are zzso with respect to the network zzso We also perform a comparison study with respect to the onset of synchronization in zzso networks and the synchronization stability of networks of identical zzso
