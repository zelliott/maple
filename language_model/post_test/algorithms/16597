This paper proposes an automated target recognition zzso using Support zzso zzso zzso to extract landmark points for zzso features in zzso zzso The features are extracted by subjecting the zzso to the Projected zzso Edge Distribution zzso zzso Edge flags are accumulated in every four columns and spatial distribution of edge flags are represented by a zzso The zzso are the front end of support zzso zzso zzso which possess land zzso are separated from all other zzso The zzso points, automatically determined from zzso zzso are the location of zzso The landmark points which are serving as a guide for construction and measurement of planes, are used to evaluate the zzso relationship, study of growth and development, and also for treatment zzso
