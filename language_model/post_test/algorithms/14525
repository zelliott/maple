In this paper, with the method of zzso dynamics and geometric technique, we investigate the zzso evolution of zzso zzso traits in a zzso community with zzso zzso zzso on one prey type is assumed to go at the expense of specialization on zzso First, we identify the ecological and evolutionary conditions that allow for evolutionary branching in zzso zzso Generally, if there is a small switching cost near the singular strategy, then this singular strategy is an evolutionary branching point, in which zzso population will change from zzso to zzso Second, we find that if the zzso curve is globally zzso zzso population eventually branches into two extreme specialists, each completely specializing on a particular prey zzso However, if the zzso curve is zzso after branching in zzso zzso the two zzso species will evolve to an zzso stable zzso at which they can continue to zzso The analysis reveals that an attractive zzso will always be zzso stable and that no further branching is possible under this zzso
