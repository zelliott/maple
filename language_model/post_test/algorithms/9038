In the course of the zzso analysis of zzso zzso proteins we detected an extremely abundant 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso search against zzso database with zzso zzso restriction revealed its complete identity to Unknown protein 18 from zzso zzso zzso The same sequence has also been submitted as Unknown protein 1 zzso from zzso zzso and as a part of the zzso zzso protein 1 zzso from zzso zzso zzso After careful inspection the record zzso turned out to comprise a set of peptides of zzso origin rather than complete protein zzso In this paper we present extensive data indicating that the zzso in question may originate from type II zzso zzso - a common contaminant in protein zzso We found empirical evidence that it can be detected in several types of zzso samples and its sequence is identical to one of the zzso peptides commonly observed for zzso Nevertheless, the zzso has been zzso as plant protein and thus leads to data zzso We advise extreme caution when dealing with sequences of Unknown protein 18 zzso zzso Unknown protein 1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso since they are at best poorly zzso if not zzso Biological significance To our knowledge, this is the first report indicating that the zzso zzso which is identical to Unknown protein 18 from zzso zzso zzso Unknown protein 1 zzso from zzso zzso and a part of the zzso zzso protein 1 zzso from zzso zzso zzso may originate from type II zzso zzso - a common contaminant in protein zzso We found empirical evidence that it can be detected in several types of zzso samples and its sequence is identical to one of the zzso peptides commonly observed for zzso Nevertheless, the zzso has been zzso as plant protein and thus, without proper quality assessment, leads to biological zzso of zzso zzso
