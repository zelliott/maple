There is no evidence showing an impact from any advanced cardiac life support zzso medications on patient survival following cardiac zzso One potential reason for a lack of such benefit may be medication zzso We formed the hypothesis that medications are given late after zzso zzso limiting any zzso We performed a zzso to determine the time from emergency medical services zzso dispatch to first medication administration, regardless of route, during zzso cardiac arrest zzso Then, the mean time and ranges of reported study medication delivery in clinical trials where medication was the experimental intervention was zzso 

We conducted a comprehensive literature review between January 1990 and August 2005 in zzso using the following zzso zzso zzso zzso cardiac arrest, heart arrest, zzso zzso ambulance, and the names of all zzso zzso We reviewed the abstracts of zzso studies and full manuscripts of 248 published zzso We eliminated the following articles from further analysis: zzso zzso all without human primary data (includes review articles, guidelines or consensus zzso zzso or simulation zzso animal zzso case zzso We used no language zzso From this search, our independent zzso found 17 papers that contained information on time to medication zzso 

We analyzed reporting of drug delivery time to zzso patients in 32 different emergency medical services zzso Time to first medication delivery by any route was a mean of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso around mean zzso zzso Time to intravenous experimental medication administration was a mean of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso around mean zzso zzso 

zzso are given late during zzso cardiac arrest, even in zzso where drug delivery is a key study zzso
