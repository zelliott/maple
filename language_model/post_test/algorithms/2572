zzso determination for protein zzso requires an assessment of their higher order structure, usually by using zzso zzso One of the most common techniques used to determine secondary structure composition of proteins is analysis of the second zzso of the zzso I region of zzso transform infrared zzso zzso A number of zzso have been described for quantitative comparison of zzso zzso I zzso zzso but no systematic evaluation has been conducted to assess these zzso In this study, the two most common methods, spectral correlation zzso and area of overlap zzso are compared for their ability to determine spectral zzso of a protein as a function of changes in pH or zzso Two other zzso were considered as zzso Recently, a zzso compare similarity function found in zzso software has been reported as being useful in comparing zzso I zzso zzso In addition, a new algorithm, termed modified zzso is described zzso These four methods were evaluated for their ability to determine zzso for zzso zzso I zzso zzso of four model zzso The result is a framework for quantitative determination of whether any two zzso differ zzso
