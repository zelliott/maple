Reconstruction of electron zzso of medical zzso from measured depth dose zzso is an attractive tool for commissioning of a zzso Carlo treatment planning zzso However, the reconstruction method is an inverse radiation transport problem which is poorly zzso in the sense it may become unstable due to small zzso in the input zzso zzso the sharp zzso peak in the electron spectrum provides an additional challenge for the zzso reconstruction zzso To improve efficiency and zzso of the reconstruction technique, we developed an zzso based on a separation of the electron spectrum into singular and regular zzso We approximate the singular peak of the spectrum by a narrow weighted zzso zzso The parameters of this zzso function are sought using only the zzso and toe regions of the zzso zzso zzso representation of the spectral peak by a zzso has benefit since only one weight and the mean and zzso must be derived from the zzso curve instead of multiple zzso zzso The regular part of the spectrum is reconstructed from the residual zzso distribution using a zzso method combined with a zzso technique to avoid the zzso zzso The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by comparing predictions to zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso Carlo simulation of medical zzso
