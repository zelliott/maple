To investigate the feasibility and accuracy of the diagnosis of zzso outlet obstruction zzso in men using zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso 

The study included 94 patients with lower urinary tract symptoms zzso to benign zzso zzso All patients underwent zzso rate and zzso residual zzso followed by zzso assessment of zzso and zzso study for zzso The results of the zzso were compared with that of the zzso zzso 

The data of 87 patients were finally enrolled in this zzso According to the zzso judged by the zzso the 87 patients were divided into an obstruction group zzso zzso and a zzso group (35 zzso The differences in the zzso number, the linear passive zzso resistance relation value, and zzso resistance factor value between the 2 groups were significant zzso zzso indicating the practical significance of the zzso method in the diagnosis of zzso Further analysis showed the zzso zzso the zzso has a sensitivity of approximately zzso specificity of zzso and average diagnosis coincidence rate of zzso compared with the zzso zzso number, and zzso the sensitivity zzso and the coincidence rate zzso of the zzso diagnosis for zzso were significantly higher than the sensitivity zzso and the coincidence rate zzso of the examination method of free zzso rate + zzso 

Compared with the zzso zzso rate zzso + zzso zzso can be more accurate and zzso for the diagnosis of zzso in zzso this approach provides a new zzso method of high clinical zzso
