zzso resistance to water zzso embolism determines plant survival during zzso This zzso trait has been described as highly variable in a wide range of tree species, but little is known about the extent of genetic and zzso zzso within zzso This information is essential to our understanding of the evolutionary forces that have shaped this zzso and for evaluation of its inclusion in breeding zzso 

We assessed zzso resistance zzso growth and carbon isotope composition in six zzso zzso populations in a provenance and progeny zzso We estimated the zzso of zzso resistance and compared the distribution of neutral markers zzso and quantitative genetic differentiation zzso for retrospective identification of the evolutionary forces acting on these zzso 

In contrast to growth and carbon isotope zzso no population differentiation was found for zzso zzso zzso was higher than for the other traits, with a low additive genetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly lower than zzso indicating uniform selection for zzso rather than genetic zzso zzso mechanisms underlying zzso are zzso
