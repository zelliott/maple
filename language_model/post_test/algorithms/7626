There is an impending need for zzso zzso of breast cancer zzso to evaluate the efficacy of new zzso therapies in zzso The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate the sensitivity of in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in a human breast cancer zzso 

zzso zzso human breast cancer zzso were zzso by zzso zzso zzso at zzso week 3 and zzso week 5, followed by ex zzso whole tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso measures of vascular zzso in appropriate zzso and zzso zzso zzso to measures of vascular zzso zzso zzso of tumor blood volume, vessel size, and vessel density were zzso and their ability to predict the corresponding zzso zzso assessed using zzso zzso 

All zzso zzso significantly correlated with their zzso zzso and were sensitive to the zzso decreases in tumor blood volume and vessel density from zzso week 3 to zzso week zzso However, zzso analysis revealed there was no significant difference between the zzso accuracy of zzso and zzso zzso 

As zzso zzso are more easily zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso without additional zzso zzso than zzso zzso it makes them promising candidates for assessing breast cancer zzso in zzso
