One of the continuing challenges in zzso has been to assess loading of the spine during dynamic lifting zzso A model was developed to accurately simulate zzso spinal loads and trunk moments from measured muscle zzso and external forces during zzso lifting zzso Model zzso was demonstrated by comparing measured and predicted trunk extension zzso Its purpose was to examine realistic representations of lifting zzso zzso and dynamic trunk mechanics that may influence spinal zzso and to demonstrate that zzso modeling techniques can be applied to the analysis of zzso zzso Spinal loads and trunk moments were predicted from the muscle force zzso and external zzso Muscle zzso forces were determined from the product of zzso zzso data modulated to account for zzso zzso muscle cross zzso area, and muscle force per unit zzso zzso Model output was zzso zzso zzso average predicted muscle force per unit zzso area of zzso N zzso and accurately predicted measured, zzso lifting moments, with an average zzso zzso zzso in the zzso plane and zzso zzso zzso in the lateral zzso zzso indicated that zzso and zzso loading increased significantly with exertion load, lifting zzso and trunk zzso
