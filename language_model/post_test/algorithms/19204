We present a minor but essential modification to the zzso zzso exchange zzso The new zzso method, which requires minor changes of the original sequence only, has advantages over the previously introduced zzso since it is less sensitive to zzso caused by finite pulse zzso The performance of this zzso including the finite pulse effect, was confirmed by zzso calculations and demonstrated on a number of dynamic zzso
