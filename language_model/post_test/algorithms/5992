The growth of zzso coli cells is impaired at temperatures below 21 degrees C and stops at zzso degrees zzso however, growth of a transgenic strain producing the zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso is good at low zzso The zzso coli zzso zzso offers a novel opportunity for examining the essential protein for cell viability at low zzso By screening a large-scale protein map zzso of cells of K-12 and its zzso zzso incubated at 4 degrees C, we identified 22 zzso proteins involved in systems failure of zzso coli when confronted with low zzso Through zzso of zzso Northern zzso and in zzso zzso we systematically identified that zzso interactions are key zzso of their protein functions at low zzso Furthermore, zzso gene deletion experiments suggest that the mechanism of zzso systems failure in zzso coli is zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the resulting failure to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings: zzso indicate the potential importance of zzso in cold sensitivity, cold adaptation and cold tolerance in cellular systems, and zzso suggest the identity of a few key zzso zzso proteins that get zzso and ultimately cause systems failure in zzso coli cells at low zzso
