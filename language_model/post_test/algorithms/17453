zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso inherited disease with a high prevalence of pulmonary zzso zzso zzso The first symptom of zzso may be stroke or fatal zzso associated with the presence of zzso 

To evaluate different screening methods applied for the identification of zzso 

zzso University zzso 

zzso patients with positive findings on contrast zzso zzso who participated in a screening investigation and underwent pulmonary zzso zzso 

Different screening methods were evaluated against the results of zzso In a group of patients with positive findings on zzso we compared results of PA with the zzso severity of zzso results of pulse zzso zzso oxygen zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in room air and while breathing zzso zzso size of zzso shunt in zzso zzso chest zzso and intensity of contrast at zzso 

PA was performed in 25 zzso patients with positive findings on zzso 15 of whom had zzso zzso therapy was recommended in 12 patients, and 3 patients had small zzso not accessible for zzso In 10 patients, zzso could not be demonstrated at zzso The sensitivity and specificity calculated for the screening procedures are as zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for chest zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso in room air; zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso breathing zzso zzso and zzso and zzso respectively, for shunt zzso 

zzso screening with zzso followed by measurement of zzso while breathing zzso oxygen seemed to be the best screening procedure for identification of patients with zzso zzso with chest zzso and pulse zzso was shown to be zzso
