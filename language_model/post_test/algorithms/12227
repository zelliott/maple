This paper describes the zzso architecture for a rhythmic coordination between robots, which suits zzso tasks involving zzso zzso The zzso approach, which is interpreted as a zzso weak zzso to the environment, does not require either the environmental model or continuously monitoring the environment but can adapt the robots to a change in the environment, zzso to the interaction between the robots and the environment at the ball zzso The proposed architecture contains two zzso mechanisms, the zzso stable zzso and the zzso zzso that lead to the emergence of zzso zzso structure for rhythmic zzso This dynamic pattern in the whole system realizes the stable coordinated motion between zzso The authors demonstrate two motion patterns between two robots passing two balls, and confirm the effectiveness of the zzso
