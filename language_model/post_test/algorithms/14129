This study evaluated the acute clinical performance of a new zzso automatic capture zzso developed to work with all lead types and pacing zzso 

During regular zzso implant or replacement, zzso and manual threshold tests were performed in zzso zzso zzso and bipolar zzso if zzso pacing using a customized external zzso zzso zzso The success rate and accuracy of two different modes zzso and zzso of the automatic capture zzso were used to evaluate the zzso zzso events zzso consecutive zzso beats without backup zzso were used to assess zzso Data of 53 patients zzso zzso zzso from four medical zzso were zzso Tested leads included 43 zzso and 10 UP from nine manufacturers, and seven had zzso with low zzso The rate of successful commanded and ambulatory zzso tests was 96 and zzso respectively, with an average absolute threshold difference compared with manual threshold of zzso zzso V at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso V and ambulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no significant difference in performance between zzso zzso zzso and lead zzso No zzso event was zzso 

When successful, the zzso automatic capture zzso accurately determined pacing thresholds in either a UP or zzso pacing zzso among all leads zzso
