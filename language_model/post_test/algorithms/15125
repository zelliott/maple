We introduced a compact representation method named Linear zzso zzso zzso for medical zzso With zzso medical volumes can be represented by a linear combination of bases which are mutually zzso Furthermore, it is possible to choose the distinctive basis for zzso Before zzso correlations between category labels and the zzso of zzso basis are used to choose the zzso Then we use the selected basis for zzso The zzso accuracy can be significantly improved by the use of selected distinctive zzso
