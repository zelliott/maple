In this paper, we present a method of skin imaging called zzso imaging that captures significantly more properties of appearance than standard zzso The observed structure of the zzso surface is greatly dependent on the angle of incident zzso and the angle of zzso zzso protocols to achieve zzso imaging are presented and used to create the Rutgers zzso zzso Database zzso zzso This image database is the first of its kind in the dermatology zzso zzso images of several disorders under multiple controlled zzso and viewing directions are provided publicly for research and educational zzso Using this skin texture database, we employ zzso surface modeling to perform automated skin texture zzso The zzso experiments demonstrate the usefulness of the modeling and measurement zzso
