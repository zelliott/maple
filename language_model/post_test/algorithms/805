In traditional zzso zzso lateral displacement zzso to the beam zzso estimates are much less accurate than zzso ones (along the beam zzso The accuracy of lateral tracking is very important whenever spatial derivatives of both zzso and lateral zzso are required to give a full description of a two-dimensional zzso strain zzso A number of methods have been proposed to improve lateral tracking by increasing the sampling rate in the lateral zzso We propose an alternate method using synthetic lateral phase zzso The algorithm, a direct analog of the phase zzso approach used in zzso displacement zzso zzso the lateral phase first, then performs a zzso detection on this synthetic phase to obtain lateral displacement zzso The zzso is available by simply eliminating either the positive or negative half of the lateral spectrum of the original zzso zzso No new data need to be acquired for this zzso This new zzso was tested on both simulations and zzso from a cardiac phantom zzso zzso show that the method greatly improves the accuracy of lateral zzso especially for low strain cases zzso or zzso The standard zzso of the zzso error of the lateral normal strain obtained with this approach has an approximate factor of 2-3 improvement for low strain zzso The conceptual and zzso simplicity of this new method makes it a practical approach to improve lateral tracking for elasticity zzso
