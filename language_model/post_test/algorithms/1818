Gene zzso provide a rich source of information about the way evolution shapes zzso zzso and zzso In addition to zzso evolutionary events such as gene zzso and loss (as well as horizontal zzso play a major role in gene evolution, and many zzso models have been developed in order to reconstruct and study these zzso However, these models typically make the simplifying assumption that zzso effects such as incomplete lineage sorting zzso are zzso While this assumption may have been reasonable in some settings, it has become increasingly problematic as increased zzso sequencing has led to denser zzso where effects such as zzso are more zzso To address this challenge, we present a new zzso model, zzso that defines gene zzso and loss in a population setting, such that zzso and zzso can be directly zzso Interestingly, this model implies that in addition to the usual gene tree and species tree, there exists a third tree, the locus tree, which will likely have many zzso Using this model, we develop the first general reconciliation method that accurately zzso gene zzso and losses in the presence of zzso and we show its improved zzso of zzso zzso zzso and losses for a variety of zzso including flies, zzso and zzso Also, our simulations show that gene zzso increase the frequency of zzso further illustrating the importance of a joint zzso Going forward, we believe that this unified model can offer insights to questions in both zzso and population zzso
