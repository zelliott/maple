To assess magnetic resonance zzso zzso for the detection and characterization of zzso proved zzso zzso by using an advanced method of zzso in a zzso zzso 

One hundred zzso vessels were examined with zzso zzso and three-dimensional zzso MR zzso in 44 patients with 63 zzso and 15 patients with no aneurysm at zzso zzso zzso was performed zzso with an advanced zzso zzso zzso MR zzso were interpreted independently by three zzso blinded to the zzso zzso results for presence, location, size, and zzso of the zzso Proof of diagnosis was consensus reading of zzso zzso 

Mean sensitivity for detection of zzso was zzso zzso zzso As a screening tool zzso detection of at least one aneurysm zzso zzso zzso mean sensitivity was zzso for all zzso and zzso for zzso larger than 3 zzso This method was not adequate for detection of zzso or size of zzso 

MR zzso with an advanced method of zzso can result in highly sensitive, specific studies for the diagnosis of zzso zzso that are of sufficient size to be considered for surgical treatment, but it is inadequate for characterization of zzso
