Mechanical zzso signals are hypothesized to be transmitted and integrated by connected bone cells before reaching the bone surfaces where adaptation zzso A zzso connected cellular network zzso model is developed to explore how bone cells perceive and transmit the signals through zzso zzso This is part two of a zzso study in which a zzso is developed to study the zzso communication within a grid of bone zzso The zzso signal was zzso as the zzso bone fluid zzso stress in part zzso zzso determined bone adaptation responses zzso et zzso in J Bone Miner Res zzso 1997 and zzso et zzso in J Bone Miner Res zzso 1997) are correlated with the fluid zzso stress by the zzso which adjusts cell sensitivities zzso and signal zzso and connection zzso zzso communication patterns extracted by the zzso indicate the cell population responsible for zzso the zzso zzso and loading threshold is shown to play an important role in regulating the bone zzso
