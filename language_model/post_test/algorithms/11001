This paper presents a novel method for respiratory motion compensated reconstruction for cone beam zzso zzso zzso The reconstruction is based on a time sequence of motion zzso fields, which is generated by a dynamic geometrical object shape zzso The dynamic model is extracted from the zzso projection images of the zzso The process of the motion extraction is converted into an optimal zzso multiple interrelated surface detection problem, which can be solved by computing a maximum flow in a zzso directed zzso The method was tested on 12 zzso zzso zzso scans from three zzso Two sets of zzso zzso volumes, full exhale zzso and full inhale zzso zzso were reconstructed for each daily zzso The reconstruction was compared with three other zzso approaches based on zzso accuracy of motion and zzso zzso ratio zzso was also zzso for image zzso The proposed approach has the best overall performance, with a relative tumor volume zzso error of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso near the tumor area is zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These results show the clinical feasibility to use the proposed method to reconstruct zzso zzso zzso
