A major handicap in cell culture studies using human zzso is the insufficient availability of fresh material on zzso A method was developed for zzso storage and low temperature preservation of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso distribution for functional zzso 

zzso from term zzso were incubated with zzso agents zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso frozen in liquid zzso thawed and then cultured zzso zzso was assessed by comparing frozen and thawed zzso with zzso controls for zzso changes, zzso zzso zzso release, zzso protein 13 zzso zzso and zzso Western zzso zzso studies determined the effect of oxygen and zzso on zzso zzso 

zzso by zzso zzso best maintained zzso zzso zzso integrity and zzso release after freezing and zzso from liquid zzso The effect of oxygen and zzso was used to test the functional viability of cultured zzso after freezing in liquid nitrogen and transfer to dry ice for zzso days on site or for shipment to a remote zzso The tested parameters were similar between controls and zzso treated zzso in the remote lab and the lab of origin, demonstrating the possibility of zzso zzso for functional zzso 

zzso stored zzso zzso zzso shipped frozen can serve as a useful tool for comparative functional studies of zzso zzso zzso The results of this pilot study also open the way for zzso studies associated with drug tailoring for pregnancy zzso
