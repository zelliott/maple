This article presents a practical zzso of an zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso to zzso the low resources of an zzso acquisition and transmission system zzso zzso for dolphins and human zzso The zzso scheme is based on a zzso differential pulse code zzso zzso and uses a zzso zzso to code the difference between the current and predicted zzso The use of the zzso zzso instead of a uniform zzso improves the percent root zzso difference zzso thereby producing a low distortion in the reconstructed zzso Due to its low zzso complexity, the zzso process can be accomplished zzso during the zzso acquisition zzso
