zzso with gaps have traditionally been used as signatures of protein families or as features in zzso zzso Current zzso zzso construct zzso by comparing the repertoire and frequency of zzso blocks in zzso and zzso In this article, we measure the quality of zzso reconstructed by comparing suitably defined sets of gapped motifs that occur in zzso zzso We study the dependence between the quality of reconstructed zzso and the density, number of solid characters, and statistical significance of gapped zzso We consider zzso zzso as well as some of their compact zzso The average performance of suitably defined sets of gapped motifs is comparable to that of popular zzso zzso zzso Extremely long and sparse motifs produce zzso of the same or better quality than those produced by short and dense zzso The best zzso are produced by motifs with 3 or 4 solid characters, while increasing the number of solid characters degrades zzso zzso motifs with low statistical significance degrades performance as zzso In zzso zzso moving from the smallest basis to bases with higher zzso leads to better zzso
