To compare the zzso capability of the 2 currently available commercial zzso software programs with specific zzso zzso for pulmonary zzso zzso zzso and to assess their measurement zzso 

In this study, 55 patients with 66 zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed by using 2 zzso software programs zzso zzso zzso zzso GE zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed visually and zzso features of zzso were evaluated to determine factors affecting zzso by both types of zzso In addition, the measurement accuracy of the software programs was investigated by using an zzso chest phantom containing simulated zzso 

The successful zzso zzso rate was significantly higher in zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso attachment was a zzso influencing zzso feature of zzso zzso for both software zzso As for measurement zzso mean relative volume measurement errors in zzso zzso 10 zzso were zzso with zzso and zzso with zzso The mean relative zzso measurement errors in zzso zzso 10 zzso were zzso with zzso and zzso with zzso 

zzso shows significantly higher zzso success rates than zzso zzso accuracy of volume and zzso of zzso is acceptable in zzso zzso 10 zzso by both software zzso
