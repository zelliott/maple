A general procedure for fitting growth zzso is proposed that can be applied to zzso data even if observations are missing or zzso zzso zzso likelihood estimates for mean zzso are obtained from an zzso zzso Estimates for standard zzso zzso and growth zzso are also zzso The techniques are demonstrated through the use of growth data from a zzso study of zzso cell zzso
