A typical approach to zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso involves measuring the glass transition temperature, zzso using differential scanning zzso zzso Recently, we discussed two zzso methods for the zzso analysis of zzso zzso using X-ray powder zzso zzso Those methods could be used to qualify an zzso zzso as zzso or phase zzso with the implication that zzso zzso are more stable towards zzso The methods were limited by the need for reference zzso patterns of both the zzso drug and zzso In this work, we propose two additional zzso approaches that overcome that limitation and can be used to zzso the degree of zzso in an zzso zzso The first approach is based on the use of a zzso zzso Resolution zzso to extract unknown zzso references as well as qualify zzso The second method, based on zzso zzso zzso can then be used to zzso the degree of zzso by determining the nearest neighbor zzso coordination number for the active pharmaceutical ingredient zzso and zzso It is proposed that the zzso coordination number is related to physical zzso
