This paper investigates the problem of robust zzso state zzso for a class of zzso zzso systems via zzso zzso fuzzy zzso dynamic zzso Attention is focused on the analysis and design of an admissible zzso filter such that the resulting filtering error system is zzso stable with a guaranteed zzso zzso zzso zzso It is assumed that the plant premise zzso which are often the state variables or their functions, are not measurable so that the filter zzso with zzso partition may not be zzso with the state zzso of the zzso Based on zzso zzso zzso functions combined with zzso and some zzso inequality zzso techniques, some new results are presented for the filtering design of the underlying zzso zzso fuzzy zzso zzso zzso examples are given to validate the effectiveness and application of the proposed design zzso
