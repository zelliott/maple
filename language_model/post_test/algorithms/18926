zzso zzso use multiple zzso per gene to measure zzso zzso Standard software takes averages over zzso Important information may be lost if zzso in the zzso affect the zzso of individual zzso 

We present custom software to analyze zzso zzso experiments in human, mouse and other zzso zzso an R package providing functions for zzso analysis at the individual probe level and zzso zzso scripts providing custom tracks in the zzso Genome zzso to check for sequence zzso in probe zzso
