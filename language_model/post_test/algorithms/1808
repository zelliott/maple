zzso protein zzso has been shown to effectively stimulate zzso muscle protein zzso in older zzso However, the impact of the amount of zzso protein zzso on protein zzso and zzso zzso whole body protein balance, and zzso muscle protein zzso remains to be zzso We aimed to fill this gap by including 33 healthy, older men zzso zzso 2 zzso who were randomly assigned to zzso 10, 20, or 35 g of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso of labeled zzso protein was combined with continuous intravenous zzso and zzso infusion to assess the zzso fate of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso rapidly increased following zzso of 10, 20, and 35 g zzso zzso with the lowest and highest zzso values observed following 10 and 35 zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso Whole body net protein balance was positive in all groups (19 zzso 1, 37 zzso 2, and 58 zzso 2 zzso with the lowest and highest values observed following zzso of 10 and 35 zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso muscle protein zzso assessed by zzso incorporation in muscle zzso was higher following zzso of 35 g when compared with 10 zzso zzso zzso or 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso of 35 g zzso protein results in greater zzso acid zzso and subsequent stimulation of de zzso muscle protein synthesis compared with the zzso of 10 or 20 g zzso protein in healthy, older zzso
