zzso zzso zzso techniques, which are able to improve surface zzso resonance zzso sensing performance and reduce restrictions on allowable parameters of zzso metal films, have been zzso realized only in zzso sensors using zzso light as a zzso zzso zzso sensors modulated by zzso techniques have not been reported due to the zzso characterization of zzso phase zzso In this work we develop a specially designed zzso zzso for phase zzso which is totally insensitive to zzso For the first time we successfully apply zzso technique to a zzso zzso zzso This zzso is able to offer two-dimensional imaging of the whole array zzso As a result of zzso zzso resolutions of zzso zzso index unit zzso under the normal condition and zzso zzso under a more time-consuming condition are zzso The application of this zzso was demonstrated by reading zzso for identification of bacteria, and zzso results were confirmed by means of zzso zzso
