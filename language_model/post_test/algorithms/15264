The aim of the study was to evaluate the 10-year probability of hip fracture and a major zzso fracture using the zzso algorithm, vitamin D status, bone mineral density zzso and zzso markers of bone turnover in men over 50 years of age with type 2 diabetes zzso zzso We estimated zzso 10-year fracture zzso levels of zzso D zzso markers of bone zzso and bone mineral density at the zzso zzso spine zzso and zzso neck zzso in 68 men with zzso and compared these with an zzso group zzso The mean zzso age of the zzso group was zzso zzso The prevalence of zzso D zzso zzso zzso was 59 zzso The mean zzso zzso hip fracture and zzso major zzso fracture was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher in the zzso cohort as compared to the healthy zzso zzso zzso D zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly lower in the zzso zzso There was no difference in zzso fracture probability between the two zzso zzso the limitations of our study size, we suggest that the increased zzso in zzso and the zzso of zzso as a secondary risk factor in the zzso zzso may be probable explanations for the zzso between zzso and zzso fracture zzso
