We propose a novel approach to identify the zzso of a neurological disorder based on anatomical and functional connectivity zzso Specifically, we formulate a zzso model that characterizes the network of abnormal functional connectivity emanating from the affected zzso This allows us to zzso zzso connectivity changes into a zzso representation of the zzso We employ the zzso zzso zzso to fit the model and subsequently identify both the afflicted regions and the differences in connectivity induced by the zzso We demonstrate our method on a population study of zzso
