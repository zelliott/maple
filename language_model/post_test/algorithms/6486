zzso are hypothesized building blocks of human movement, discrete ballistic movements of which more complex movements are zzso Using a novel algorithm, zzso were extracted from the zzso movements of 41 persons recovering from zzso Analysis of the extracted zzso showed that, over the course of therapy, patients' zzso tended to increase in peak speed and zzso The number of zzso employed to produce a given movement zzso The time between the zzso of adjacent zzso decreased for zzso zzso less than 1 month zzso but not for zzso zzso greater than 12 months zzso as a zzso zzso became more overlapped for all patients, but more markedly for zzso The strength and consistency with which it zzso patients' recovery indicates that analysis of zzso overlap might be a useful tool for measuring learning or other changes in motor behavior in future human movement zzso
