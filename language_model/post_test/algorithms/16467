zzso zzso zzso is a powerful zzso method for identifying compounds in zzso zzso experiments are very demanding of spectral zzso even small zzso from expected zzso in zzso signals can cause significant zzso in the diffusion zzso This is a particular problem when signals zzso so it is very important to be able to acquire clean data with as little overlap as zzso zzso experiments all suffer to a greater or lesser extent from zzso phase zzso caused by zzso requiring a zzso between such zzso and zzso pulse zzso zzso zzso increase spectral overlap and may cause unexpected and misleading apparent diffusion zzso in zzso zzso These effects are described here and a simple and effective zzso the addition of a zzso zzso pulse immediately before the onset of acquisition to remove the unwanted zzso terms, is zzso As well as zzso significantly cleaner results, the new method allows much longer zzso zzso to be used without problems from zzso and hence greatly increases the range of molecular sizes that can be studied for coupled spin zzso The sensitivity loss is negligible and the added phase cycling is zzso The new method is illustrated for a zzso general purpose zzso pulse zzso zzso
