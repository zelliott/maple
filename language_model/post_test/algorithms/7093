zzso optical zzso zzso zzso is rapidly becoming the method of choice for assessing vessel healing after zzso zzso due to its unique zzso resolution zzso The amount of zzso coverage is an important zzso In addition, the characterization of zzso tissue maturity is also of importance for an accurate analysis, especially in the case of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Previous studies indicated that well-organized mature zzso tissue appears as a zzso smooth, and homogeneous region in zzso images, while zzso signal areas might zzso to immature tissue mainly composed of zzso zzso A new method for automatic zzso tissue zzso based on statistical texture analysis and a supervised zzso technique, is zzso Algorithm training and validation were obtained through the use of 53 zzso images supported by zzso data from zzso New Zealand White zzso A zzso zzso accuracy of zzso and a two-dimensional zzso analysis accuracy of zzso (with sensitivity and specificity of zzso and zzso zzso were found, suggesting that a reliable automatic characterization of zzso tissue was zzso This may potentially expand the clinical value of zzso in assessing the zzso of zzso healing and speed up the current analysis zzso (which are, due to their zzso and zzso character, not suitable for application in large clinical trials and clinical practice), potentially allowing for a wider use of zzso zzso
