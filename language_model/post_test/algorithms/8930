zzso variation within and among populations is influenced by the genetic content of the founders and the migrants following zzso This is particularly true if populations are small, migration rate low and zzso arranged in a zzso zzso Under these circumstances the level of multiple zzso is critical since multiply zzso females bring more genetic variation into founder groups than single zzso zzso One such example is the marine snail zzso zzso that during zzso times has invaded mainland refuge areas and thereafter small islands emerging due to zzso zzso by occasional zzso of multiply zzso zzso We zzso effects of varying degrees of multiple zzso on the genetic variation of island populations zzso by the founders spreading from the mainland, by zzso the population zzso during both the transient zzso process, and after a steady state (with zzso has been zzso During zzso multiple mating by zzso see zzso males increased the zzso by zzso see zzso in comparison with single zzso while in the steady state the increase was zzso see zzso compared with single zzso In the steady state the increase of zzso due to multiple zzso is determined by a corresponding increase in effective population zzso During zzso by contrast, the increase in zzso is larger and it cannot be explained in terms of the effective population size zzso During the zzso phase bursts of high genetic variation spread through the system, and far from the mainland this led to short periods of high diversity separated by long periods of low zzso The size of these fluctuations was zzso by multiple zzso We conclude that following glacial periods of zzso zzso of isolated zzso by this species has been supported by its high level of multiple zzso
