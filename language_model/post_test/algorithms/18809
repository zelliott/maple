zzso association scan zzso data mining has found zzso zzso zzso complex trait zzso But for many traits, much of the explanatory zzso may be truly zzso more like gold dust, whose small marginal effects are zzso by traditional zzso Yet, their collective effects may be quite important in advancing personalized zzso We consider a novel approach to zzso out the genetic gold dust influencing quantitative (or zzso zzso Out of a zzso we randomly grab handfuls of zzso modeling their effects in a multiple linear (or zzso zzso The zzso significance is used to obtain an zzso updated zzso zzso probability associated with each zzso which is repeated over many random draws until the distribution becomes zzso A zzso procedure zzso the list of zzso to define the final zzso zzso from a benchmark simulation of 5 quantitative trait genes among 1,000, in 1,000 random subjects, are contrasted with marginal tests using nominal significance, zzso significance, false discovery rates, as well as with serial selection zzso Random handfuls produced the best combination of sensitivity zzso specificity zzso and true positive rate zzso of all methods tested and better zzso in an independent subject zzso From more extensive simulations, we determine which combinations of signal to noise ratios, zzso typing zzso and sample sizes are zzso with which methods to gather the gold zzso
