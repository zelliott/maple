Time zzso a fundamental property of zzso systems, should be of importance in assessing the status of zzso processes that operate over a wide range of zzso However, measurement of this property in living systems has been zzso We provide a zzso method derived from basic physics assumptions to zzso time asymmetry over multiple scales and apply it to the human heartbeat time series in health and zzso We find that the zzso time asymmetry index is highest for a time series from young subjects and decreases with aging or heart zzso Loss of time zzso may provide a new way of assessing the functionality of living systems that operate far from zzso
