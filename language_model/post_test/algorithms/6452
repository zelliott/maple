A selection of recent results illustrating the application of zzso electron zzso to the study of magnetic zzso in zzso zzso and zzso is zzso Examples are taken from the characterization of zzso zzso zzso Co zzso rings, two-dimensional zzso of naturally occurring zzso zzso in zzso and single zzso Co zzso zzso that can be used to separate the magnetic signal of interest from the mean inner potential contribution to the measured holographic phase shift are zzso and the spatial and phase resolution that can be achieved are zzso
