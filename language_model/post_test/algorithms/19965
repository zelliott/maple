The zzso of active speakers with microphone zzso is an active research line with a considerable interest in many acoustic zzso Many zzso for source zzso are based on the zzso of the zzso zzso function between microphone pairs employing phase transform zzso Unfortunately, the performance of these methods is severely reduced when wall reflections and multiple sound sources are present in the acoustic zzso As a result, zzso the number of active sound sources and their actual directions becomes a challenging zzso To effectively tackle this problem, a zzso zzso framework is zzso Based on a zzso sampling algorithm, a mixture model and its parameters are estimated, indicating both the number of zzso zzso their angle of zzso zzso zzso A set of measured data demonstrates the accuracy of the proposed zzso
