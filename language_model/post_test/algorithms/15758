We compared maximum intensity projections zzso versus original source images zzso in respect to detection of coronary artery zzso by means of magnetic resonance zzso coronary zzso 

MR coronary zzso was performed on 61 zzso zzso and zzso were independently evaluated as to presence of significant zzso in the zzso and zzso segments and compared with zzso zzso 

A total of 315 of zzso zzso coronary artery segments could be evaluated in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso in zzso In segments able to be zzso zzso images demonstrated zzso zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso images showed zzso zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso zzso zzso accuracy was zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso There was no statistically significant difference between both zzso 

The zzso reconstructions showed comparable accuracy to zzso zzso However, zzso zzso is compromised by a higher number of images that were unable to be evaluated due to overlap of coronary arteries with adjacent cardiac zzso
