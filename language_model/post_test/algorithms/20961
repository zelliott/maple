Recent evidence suggests that the number and variety of functional zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso elements within zzso is much higher than previously zzso thus, the ability to zzso predict and analyze zzso has taken on new zzso We have zzso studied the secondary structures in an alignment of six zzso zzso Little is known about the zzso present in this set of zzso and this diverse set of zzso has an optimal level of sequence conservation for observing the correlated evolution of zzso seen in zzso 

We report the results of a zzso search for zzso zzso secondary structures, as well as the results of zzso these predicted secondary structures by structural zzso We find a total of zzso predicted secondary structures, including a new predicted approximately 60 zzso long hairpin motif found primarily inside zzso We find no evidence for zzso Different types of zzso regions are zzso in different classes of predicted secondary zzso zzso contain the longest motifs zzso long, zzso zzso zzso zzso primarily contain groupings of short zzso located near the start zzso and 3' zzso contain very little secondary structure compared to other zzso There is a large concentration of short zzso just inside the boundaries of zzso The density of predicted zzso zzso increases with the length of zzso and the density of predicted secondary structures within zzso coding regions increases with the number of zzso in a zzso 

There are many zzso zzso zzso of unknown function in these zzso zzso as well as interesting spatial zzso of predicted secondary zzso This study increases our knowledge of secondary structure in these zzso zzso
