In the literature, conventional zzso inverse dynamic models are limited in three aspects related to inverse dynamic zzso body segment parameters and zzso zzso First, conventional notation yields separate zzso of the forces and moments with successive coordinate system zzso zzso the way conventional body segment parameters are defined is based on the assumption that the inertia zzso is principal and the zzso of mass is located between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso the conventional zzso zzso uses zzso or zzso angles that are zzso and suffer from zzso In order to overcome these limitations, this paper presents a new generic method for inverse zzso This generic method is based on wrench notation for inverse zzso a general definition of body segment parameters and zzso algebra for the zzso zzso
