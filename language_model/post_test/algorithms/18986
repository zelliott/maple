Mass zzso has become one of the most popular analysis techniques in zzso and Systems zzso With the creation of larger zzso the automated zzso of mass zzso becomes important to ensure that every peak in the sample spectrum is correctly assigned to some zzso and zzso zzso for zzso mass zzso have to be robust with respect to wrongly assigned peaks, as well as efficient due to the amount of mass zzso zzso The zzso of mass zzso leads us to the problem of finding an optimal matching between mass zzso under measurement zzso We have developed two deterministic methods that allow robust zzso of such a zzso The first approach uses a zzso geometry interpretation of the problem, and tries to find two parallel lines with constant distance that stab a zzso number of points in the zzso The second approach is based on finding a zzso common approximate zzso and improves existing zzso by one order of magnitude exploiting the sequential nature of the matching zzso We compare our results to a zzso geometry zzso using a zzso zzso
