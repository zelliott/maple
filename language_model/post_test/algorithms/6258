We sought to zzso the left zzso zzso dysfunction by a geometric index from two-dimensional zzso zzso by implementing an automated fuzzy logic edge detection zzso for the zzso 

The coronary injuries have repercussions on the left zzso producing changes on wall zzso the shape of the zzso and as a whole changes on the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso recordings were performed over the control group and those with the zzso From zzso recordings, individual frames were extracted for at least five cardiac cycles and then zzso of left zzso was done by automated fuzzy zzso In each frame, the volumes are measured and a geometric index, zzso ratio zzso was zzso The zzso fractional zzso zzso zzso fractional zzso zzso and the relative wall thickness zzso were also measured in each zzso 

zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso was observed with zzso zzso measured at zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso was found to be decreased in the dysfunction group and more significant at the zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso 

This work concludes that the regional and global left zzso zzso dysfunction can be assessed by the zzso measured at zzso and zzso from zzso zzso and may contribute to the high rate of cardiovascular zzso
