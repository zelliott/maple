In recent years, displays and lighting require color temperature zzso conversion function because observers have different zzso This paper proposes effective methods to determine the optimal converting point of CT conversion for display and lighting zzso For display application, the concepts of center of gravity and zzso line are applied to determine the optimal converting zzso The zzso enhancement of zzso between the optimal and average is zzso For lighting application, this paper proposes two methods to determine the optimal converting point in the CT zzso which zzso with zzso zzso zzso The enhancement of zzso in two CT modes zzso and zzso are zzso and zzso zzso
