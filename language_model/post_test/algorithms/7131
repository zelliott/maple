In this paper, we propose a novel method for the detection of zzso using mathematical zzso and a support zzso machine zzso First, the contrast in the original mammogram was improved by gamma correction and two carefully designed structural elements were used to enhance any zzso Next, the potential regions were extracted using our proposed zzso zzso Finally, a zzso zzso was used to reduce the number of false zzso The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using the zzso zzso The experimental results demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of our zzso
