zzso the zzso recordings collected at baseline during the European zzso zzso zzso Trial zzso we evaluate the possibility of using zzso the slope of the power spectrum of heart rate zzso signals zzso in the vicinity of f zzso 0, for zzso risk zzso We found no relevant difference in the values of alpha for the zzso zzso On the contrary, in the zzso arm, the distinction in the survival rates of those with high or low zzso was highly zzso Moreover, high risk patients with respect to alpha zzso zzso did not seem to benefit from zzso The results suggest that alpha might convey zzso information that is different than what is expressed by other zzso zzso such as the triangular zzso When combining high risk patients in term of triangular index zzso and low risk patients with respect to alpha zzso the difference in survival on zzso and zzso became very substantial zzso mortality on zzso zzso on zzso p zzso zzso This might offer a possibility of selecting patients likely to benefit from a zzso zzso treatment after acute zzso zzso
