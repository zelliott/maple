Clinical and zzso studies have shown an inverse and independent association between zzso zzso zzso and risk of developing coronary artery zzso The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of the zzso characterized by low HDL values and to assess the impact of HDL plasma levels on the prognosis of patients hospitalized in the zzso unit of our Institute, during 30 months of zzso 

Between February 1999 and February 2002, zzso patients zzso men and 391 zzso who had undergone zzso were enrolled in a cardiovascular zzso The zzso profile was evaluated for all zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso underwent coronary zzso Patients were followed up for a mean period of 30 months, during which the frequency of zzso procedures zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and death were zzso 

Nearly half of the subjects zzso of which zzso zzso showed HDL values zzso 40 zzso and zzso of the population zzso zzso were characterized by extremely reduced HDL zzso zzso or zzso 35 zzso Patients with coronary zzso showed HDL levels lower than those of subjects with negative zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso An inverse relationship was found between HDL and coronary artery disease: the risk of developing the illness decreased by zzso for each increase of 1 zzso in HDL zzso zzso zzso in males zzso 60 years and females zzso 65 years, the coronary artery disease risk association increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso The risk of interventions decreased by zzso for each increase of 1 zzso in HDL zzso zzso zzso both in the total population and in males zzso 60 years and females zzso 65 zzso Finally, patients with HDL zzso 40 zzso showed a higher risk of zzso interventions zzso p zzso zzso in comparison to the subjects with HDL zzso 40 zzso 

This study zzso a) the high prevalence of the zzso characterized by low plasma zzso of HDL among patients hospitalized in a zzso unit; b) lower HDL values in subjects with coronary zzso compared to subjects with normal coronary zzso c) the inverse relationship between HDL and coronary zzso zzso the zzso value of HDL as a predictor of surgical zzso
