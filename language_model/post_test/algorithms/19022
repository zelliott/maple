The zzso method zzso zzso for decomposition of the time reversal operator using focused zzso is a time reversal based method that can detect point zzso in a zzso medium and extract their Green's zzso It is particularly useful when focusing in a zzso zzso This paper zzso the theory of the zzso method to random media zzso and shows that it is possible to extract Green's functions from the zzso signal using this zzso Therefore it is possible to achieve a good focusing even if no point zzso are zzso Moreover, a link is made between zzso and the Van zzso zzso It is deduced from this interpretation that the zzso first zzso of the focused time reversal operator is a well-known focusing zzso The concept of an equivalent virtual object is introduced that allows the random problem to be replaced by an equivalent deterministic problem and leads to an intuitive understanding of zzso in zzso zzso to aberration correction are zzso The reduction of the zzso of the Green's function estimate is zzso Finally, it is shown that the method works well in the presence of strong interfering zzso
