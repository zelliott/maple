zzso analysis is now a standard procedure for analyzing the zzso zzso obtained by zzso zzso These zzso methods assume an zzso zzso since artifacts create zzso spectral zzso Our aim was the development of a zzso artifact removal technique that might be applied to full night zzso with a minimal human zzso This technique should handle one zzso channel, with or without use of one zzso zzso zzso zzso independent component analysis zzso zzso filters zzso have been zzso zzso attention has been given to define the zzso structuring zzso The tests on zzso and real data were checked on the residual zzso spectral components present in the cleaned zzso The best results are obtained by the zzso when the structuring element is an artifact template defined either directly on the zzso or on the zzso zzso zzso Further developments are required to identify and subtract the zzso zzso
