A zzso laser based double zzso sphere setup in combination with an zzso zzso measurement setup was developed and carefully validated for optical characterization of zzso samples in the zzso zzso wavelength zzso A set of 57 liquid optical zzso covering a wide range of zzso and scattering properties, were prepared and measured at two sample zzso The estimated bulk optical properties matched well for both zzso and with theory and literature, without significant zzso between zzso and zzso zzso were derived for the bulk scattering properties zzso zzso and g of zzso zzso which can be used to calculate the bulk scattering properties of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
