The purpose of the present study was to compare the zzso zzso zzso and mean power frequency zzso zzso zzso relationships during zzso ramp and step muscle actions for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso performed 2 zzso zzso voluntary zzso zzso before and after 2 or 3 zzso ramp muscle actions from zzso zzso to 9 zzso step muscle actions zzso 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, and zzso zzso zzso signals were recorded from the zzso and zzso muscles, and zzso and zzso values were zzso for each corresponding percentage of the zzso Absolute and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso relationships were analyzed and interpreted on a zzso and composite pattern basis using zzso zzso and repeated measures zzso For zzso and zzso only zzso and zzso of the individual responses were consistent with the composite zzso models, zzso In addition, the zzso composite zzso values were greater for the zzso than the zzso from 35 to zzso zzso Only zzso of the zzso and zzso of the zzso individual patterns of responses were the same for the ramp and step muscle actions, and differences were also observed for the composite zzso and zzso patterns between the ramp and step muscle zzso Overall, these findings indicated that the zzso patterns of responses for zzso and zzso were different among subjects zzso zzso zzso and were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
