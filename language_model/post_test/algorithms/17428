Clinical zzso measurement is plagued by many sources of error which result in zzso values zzso This study sets out to compare zzso zzso depth zzso zzso selected by the zzso zzso against those recorded with a conventional zzso method and to zzso any reduction in zzso zzso zzso A single zzso recorded zzso zzso at 1 visit in 32 subjects zzso age zzso zzso with moderately advanced chronic adult zzso zzso was recorded over 2 passes at 6 sites per tooth with the Florida Pocket zzso zzso a 3rd generation zzso The zzso zzso compared the 1st pass zzso zzso value zzso to the 2nd pass zzso zzso value zzso and, if the difference between these values was zzso zzso allowed the recording of a maximum of 2 further zzso zzso and 4th pass zzso zzso and zzso 4 zzso zzso were considered to be the maximum subject and tissue zzso The zzso selected the 1st 2 zzso whose difference was zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso If no 2 zzso had a difference zzso or zzso zzso zzso the examiner was required to select the 2 zzso closest to the rules of the zzso zzso sites were available for zzso zzso sites zzso required 2 recordings, zzso sites zzso required 3 recordings and 44 sites zzso required 4 zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso were calculated for zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso The mean of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso whilst the mean of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso the respective medians were zzso zzso and zzso zzso The study demonstrated high zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso produced a reduction of zzso in the mean zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso reduction in the median zzso zzso of zzso
