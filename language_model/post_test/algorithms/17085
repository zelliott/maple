zzso ultrasound zzso which depicts both zzso and zzso offers the potential to improve on the limitations of zzso for the assessment of the natural history of zzso and progression or zzso of the zzso To facilitate zzso and increase the zzso of quantitative zzso zzso a computerized zzso detection system was developed that detects both the zzso and external vessel boundaries in zzso sets of zzso zzso To validate this system, zzso human coronary segments zzso zzso zzso with an area obstruction zzso or zzso zzso zzso to zzso were studied in zzso by zzso The computerized zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso total vessel, zzso complex, and percent obstruction were compared with findings by manual tracing of the zzso images and of the corresponding zzso cross sections obtained at zzso increments zzso zzso zzso Both area and volume zzso by the zzso detection system agreed well with the results obtained by manual zzso showing low mean zzso differences zzso to zzso with zzso not exceeding zzso and high correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso total vessel, zzso complex, and percent obstruction by the zzso detection system correlated well with zzso of areas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and volumes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso differences between the results by the zzso detection system and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found, most likely resulting from shrinkage during tissue zzso The results of this study indicate that this computerized zzso analysis system is reliable for the assessment of coronary zzso in zzso
