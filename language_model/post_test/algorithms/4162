Automatic text categorization is one of the key techniques in information retrieval and the data mining zzso The zzso is usually time-consuming when the training zzso is large and zzso Many methods have been proposed to solve this problem, but few can achieve satisfactory zzso In this paper, we present a method which combines the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the Support zzso zzso zzso zzso is first used to generate reduced zzso representation of topics as feature in zzso It is able to reduce features dramatically but keeps the necessary semantic zzso The Support zzso zzso zzso is then employed to zzso the data based on the generated zzso We evaluate the zzso on 20 zzso and zzso zzso zzso The experimental results show that the zzso based on our proposed zzso model achieves high performance in terms of precision, recall and F1 zzso Further, it can achieve this within a much shorter zzso Our process improves greatly upon the previous work in this field and displays strong potential to achieve a streamlined zzso process for a wide range of zzso
