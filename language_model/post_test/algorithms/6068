The aromatic alcohol most closely resembling the aromatic tail of zzso is zzso This agent is as potent as zzso in blocking zzso sodium zzso The aim of this study was to show the effect of zzso in the zzso on the potency of this compound to block zzso sodium zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso into the zzso of the zzso zzso yielded zzso Block of sodium currents by this compound was studied using zzso expressed zzso rat zzso zzso zzso sodium zzso 

zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso sodium inward zzso The zzso for block of resting channels at a zzso holding potential zzso zzso was zzso zzso the Hill zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inducing either fast or zzso strongly increased the blocking zzso This is an important feature of a zzso zzso The estimated zzso effect concentration for the zzso channel state zzso was 28 zzso the Hill zzso zzso zzso When zzso of channels were zzso using long zzso zzso zzso followed by a 10 zzso zzso period to allow recovery from fast zzso the zzso at zzso zzso holding potential was reduced to 53 zzso 

These results, which show that zzso blocks zzso sodium channels in a zzso manner while having a several fold higher potency than the zzso parent compound, highlight a potentially meaningful principle of increasing the sodium channel blocking potency of zzso zzso
