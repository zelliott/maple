The pressure pulse zzso method for measuring stroke volume zzso and cardiac output zzso has come of zzso Various methods have been proposed, but at this time no single technique has shown clear superiority over the zzso This commentary and review discusses the various methods, and particularly the pressure recording zzso method zzso zzso of the method shows that vascular wall zzso which are not unique to the zzso obese state, represent one more zzso zzso causing inaccuracy in stroke volume and cardiac output zzso As PRAM is an zzso method, its accuracy depends on certain assumptions that may not fully explain the multitude of combinations and permutations that define zzso blood zzso specifically, the area under the pressure curve during zzso and the zzso characteristics of the zzso throughout the cardiac zzso As a result of incomplete theory, referenced specifically to the zzso obese individual, PRAM does not faithfully mimic established reference standards of zzso it systematically zzso stroke volume and cardiac zzso Field zzso that is, equations that are zzso over the full gamut of zzso conditions and vascular pathology, are zzso derived zzso They require input variables that satisfy the natural state of zzso To realize this state of absolute zzso bliss, these variables should zzso be zzso Unfortunately, because of the constraints of zzso shortcuts to the absolute truth are zzso zzso As a result, pressure pulse zzso methods have evolved that employ curve analysis and neural networking techniques, providing zzso zzso of zzso and zzso
