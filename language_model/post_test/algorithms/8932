We analyze the impact of birth zzso zzso zzso in the birth zzso on the dynamics of zzso zzso childhood infectious zzso Previous research has explored the effect of human birth zzso on infectious disease dynamics using parameters appropriate for the developed zzso We build on this work by including in our analysis an extended range of baseline birth rates and zzso which zzso to developing world zzso Additionally, our analysis accounts for seasonal forcing both in zzso and contact zzso We focus in particular on the dynamics of zzso In the absence of seasonal transmission rates or zzso zzso for typical zzso zzso zzso birth zzso zzso either annual or zzso zzso Changes in the magnitude of the birth fluctuations zzso zzso can induce significant changes in the size of the epidemic peaks, but have little impact on timing of disease zzso within the zzso In contrast, changes to the birth zzso phase zzso of the peak in birth zzso within the zzso significantly influence the timing of the zzso In the presence of zzso in contact rates, at relatively low birth rates (20 per zzso birth zzso has little impact on the dynamics but does have an impact on the magnitude and timing of the zzso However, as the mean birth rate increases, both birth zzso and phase play an important role in driving the dynamics of the zzso There are stronger effects at higher birth zzso
