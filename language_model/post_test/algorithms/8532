A zzso approach has been developed to assess the power of zzso backbone constraints with respect to the determination of the zzso structure, once the secondary structure elements are zzso This is part of the general assessment of zzso constraints which are known to be relevant when used in conjunction with all classical zzso The zzso constraints here investigated are the zzso shifts, the residual zzso zzso due to zzso of the zzso in high magnetic fields, and the cross correlation between zzso relaxation and zzso zzso The relative constraints are generated by zzso from a known zzso The elements of secondary structure are supposed to be obtained from chemical shift zzso The problem of the zzso orientation of the zzso is zzso It is shown that the correct fold can be obtained depending on the length of the zzso stretches with respect to the length of the non zzso segments connecting the zzso For example, the correct fold is zzso obtained for the zzso bundle protein zzso zzso while the double zzso motif of zzso zzso is hardly obtained without zzso In cases like zzso zzso the availability of zzso from different metal zzso is zzso whereas less important is the location of the metal zzso with respect to the secondary structure zzso
