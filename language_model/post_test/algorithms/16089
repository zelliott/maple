To determine the prevalence of zzso in a large series of zzso breast zzso appearing as masses on zzso and to assess the sensitivity of a zzso detection zzso zzso that uses zzso measures in the detection of such zzso 

Six hundred zzso consecutive cases of breast zzso detected as masses on zzso were independently reviewed by three zzso who determined if the zzso were zzso All zzso were then analyzed by the zzso zzso 

All three zzso interpreted 375 zzso of the zzso masses as being zzso on at least one zzso The zzso zzso correctly marked zzso zzso of the 375 clearly zzso masses, with a mean of zzso additional mass mark per zzso With a looser definition of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso masses were called zzso by at least one zzso on one zzso The zzso correctly marked zzso zzso of the zzso zzso that were zzso or possibly zzso 

zzso was clearly present in a majority zzso of consecutive zzso breast cancer masses found on zzso in a large clinical zzso zzso of zzso measures is, therefore, an important strategy in the detection of breast cancer with zzso A zzso zzso zzso correctly identified a large proportion zzso of zzso breast zzso
