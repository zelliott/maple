zzso of zzso to multiple sclerosis zzso might have important clinical applications, either as part of a diagnostic zzso or as a means to identify high-risk individuals for prospective zzso We investigated the usefulness of an zzso measure of risk of zzso that is based on genetic zzso zzso We also assessed the added effect of environmental risk factors that are associated with zzso for zzso 

We created a weighted genetic risk score zzso that includes 16 zzso zzso zzso We tested our model with data from zzso individuals with zzso and zzso controls zzso zzso a validation set of zzso individuals with zzso and zzso controls taken from several zzso therapeutic trials zzso zzso and a second validation set of 143 individuals with zzso and 281 controls from the US zzso Health Studies I and II zzso zzso for whom we also have data on smoking and immune response to zzso virus zzso 

zzso with a zzso that was more than zzso zzso from the mean had a significantly higher odds of zzso in all zzso In the derivation sample, the mean zzso zzso was zzso zzso for individuals with zzso and zzso zzso for controls zzso in the zzso validation sample, the mean zzso was zzso zzso for individuals with zzso versus zzso zzso for controls zzso and in the zzso II zzso the mean zzso was zzso zzso for individuals with zzso versus zzso zzso for controls zzso In the derivation zzso the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso zzso a measure of the ability of a model to discriminate between individuals with zzso and zzso for the zzso model was zzso and for the zzso plus sex model was zzso zzso In the zzso and zzso zzso the C statistics for the zzso model were both zzso adding sex to the zzso model increased the C statistic to zzso zzso whereas adding smoking and immune response to zzso to the zzso model increased the C statistic to zzso zzso However, the zzso does not seem to be correlated with the conversion of clinically isolated syndrome to zzso 

The inclusion of 16 zzso zzso into a zzso can modestly predict zzso risk, shows consistent zzso ability in independent samples, and is enhanced by the inclusion of zzso risk factors into the zzso Future zzso of the zzso might therefore make a contribution to zzso that can predict a diagnosis of zzso in a clinical or research zzso
