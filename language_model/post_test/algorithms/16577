The purpose of this study was to explore the zzso zzso relationship that is attributed to normal zzso using zzso cluster analysis, while simultaneously incorporating the full zzso as a data zzso From the central zzso to the second zzso the tooth sizes of 307 subjects zzso males and 119 zzso mean age zzso standard zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with normal zzso were zzso zzso data were zzso separately for the zzso and the zzso When zzso the zzso around zzso zzso zzso was performed with the transformed data based on principal component analysis zzso After the subjects were classified into four groups, the cluster memberships were zzso and the distribution pattern and zzso zzso relationships were zzso Bolton tooth ratio showed a relatively wide range, and this was indicative of the zzso in tooth size in subjects with a normal zzso However, the patterns of the zzso zzso relationship were similar for males and zzso and this result was zzso with the findings of the classic Bolton zzso Using the zzso approach to zzso the zzso data set of an individual patient and then comparing the results with the normal zzso cluster has possible clinical applications in determining the amount and location of zzso control in zzso
