A set of zzso tools are presented that allow convenient calculation of zzso zzso selection of zzso and compound zzso and calculation of beam quality zzso such as zzso layer, zzso and zzso per unit zzso The zzso model of Boone and zzso is adapted to a library of high-level language zzso functions and shown to agree with experimental zzso across a wide range of zzso and beam zzso Modeling of beam zzso is facilitated by a convenient, zzso database of mass and zzso zzso zzso compiled from the National Institute of zzso and zzso The functions and database were integrated in a zzso user interface and made available online at zzso zzso The functionality of the zzso and potential for investigation of imaging system zzso was illustrated in theoretical calculations of imaging performance across a broad range of zzso filter material type, and filter thickness for direct and zzso flat-panel zzso The calculations reveal a number of zzso effects in the energy response of such detectors that may not have been guessed from simple zzso filter techniques, and point to a variety of compelling hypotheses regarding choice of beam zzso that warrant future zzso
