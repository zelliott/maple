zzso neural stimulation is a major problem in current zzso zzso zzso zzso current problems in patients relate directly to zzso strength and zzso zzso Present designs of zzso zzso tend to limit zzso imaging methods such as zzso imaging zzso and zzso imaging zzso because of the effect of induced currents in the patient which produce neural stimulation resulting in zzso sensations and zzso muscle zzso zzso stimulation could also trigger zzso fits and/or cardiac zzso For reduction of induced zzso an important aspect is the zzso zzso It is desirable to design the zzso zzso in such a way as to prevent closed loop circulating currents within the zzso zzso results using a zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso operating in a low mutual zzso mode and using passive zzso control, indicate significant reduction of the zzso within the subject volume of the zzso leading to a reduction of induced currents in a zzso Such a reduction allows safer operation using higher magnetic zzso strengths together with faster zzso Currently very fast scans are prohibited by virtue of the neural stimulation effects produced in present standard zzso zzso
