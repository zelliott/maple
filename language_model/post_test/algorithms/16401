zzso spectrum disorders zzso are associated with complications of pregnancy that zzso fetal zzso zzso the excess of zzso in male gender is poorly zzso We tested the hypothesis that risk of zzso is related to fetal zzso and investigated whether this effect is greater among zzso 

Provincial delivery records zzso identified the cohort of all zzso singleton live zzso in the province of Alberta, Canada, between zzso and zzso These were zzso for zzso via zzso diagnostic codes assigned by physician billing until zzso zzso and zzso risk factors, including FH determined from blood tests of acidity zzso were extracted from zzso The zzso FH status was missing in approximately half of zzso Assuming that characteristics of mothers and zzso would be correlated with zzso we used an zzso zzso to estimate zzso association, allowing for both zzso zzso and specific zzso zzso zzso 

Data indicated that there was excess risk of zzso among males who were hypoxic at birth, not materially affected by adjustment for potential zzso due to birth year and zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis to zzso zzso the adjusted OR under specific zzso assumptions spanned zzso of zzso to zzso 

Our results are consistent with a weak effect of fetal zzso on risk of zzso among zzso zzso zzso is an efficient and flexible tool for modeling missing data in the studied zzso
