The identification of zzso interactions plays key roles in the drug development toward discovery of new drug leads and new therapeutic protein zzso There is therefore a strong incentive to develop new efficient methods for predicting zzso interactions on a zzso zzso In this paper we develop a novel zzso method to make a zzso prediction of zzso interactions from zzso biological data using zzso zzso The proposed method mainly consists of two steps: 1) construction of new compact fingerprints for zzso pairs by an improved zzso hashing algorithm, and 2) application of a zzso zzso to the compact zzso We test the proposed method on its ability to make a large-scale prediction of zzso interactions from compound zzso fingerprints and protein domain zzso and show superior performance of the proposed method compared with the previous zzso methods in terms of prediction zzso zzso efficiency, and zzso of the zzso zzso All the previously developed methods are not zzso feasible for the full zzso consisting of about 200 millions of zzso zzso The proposed method is expected to be useful for virtual screening of a huge number of compounds against many protein zzso
