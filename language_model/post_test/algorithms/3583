Over the past decade, there has been increasing interest in zzso soft tissue zzso This topic has several biomedical applications ranging from medical imaging to robotic assisted zzso In these applications, tissue deformation can be very large due to low tissue zzso and lack of physical zzso As a result, deformation zzso of such zzso often requires a treatment, which reflects zzso zzso While zzso techniques such as zzso finite element methods are well developed, the required intrinsic zzso mechanical parameters of soft zzso that are critical to develop reliable tissue deformation models are not well zzso To address this issue, we developed a system to measure the zzso parameters of small ex zzso tissue zzso This measurement technique consists of zzso an zzso small block of tissue using a computer controlled loading system while measuring the resulting zzso zzso The zzso tissue zzso response is used to calculate the zzso parameters via an appropriate inversion zzso This technique is based on a zzso least squares zzso that uses a zzso finite element model as the direct problem zzso The features of the system are demonstrated with two samples of breast tissue and typical zzso results are zzso
