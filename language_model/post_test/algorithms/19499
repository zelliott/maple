We have developed a simple zzso model to improve the accuracy of zzso zzso in zzso dose calculation for zzso zzso In this model, transmission of particles through a zzso extended opening of a zzso is calculated in conjunction with zzso distribution of the zzso zzso of the dose zzso calculated using the new three-dimensional zzso model and the conventional two-dimensional model to lateral dose profiles zzso measured with zzso zzso beams showed the superiority of the new model over the conventional zzso
