The zzso zzso transport equation is solved for the three-dimensional zzso uniform infinite medium which is illuminated by a point zzso source using a zzso zzso transform under zzso Apart from the zzso evaluation of a zzso zzso transform which connects the spatial distance with the zzso distance in zzso space, the dependence on all variables is found zzso For the special case of a zzso modulated source, even the zzso zzso transform can be carried out zzso Additionally, a special solution for the zzso scattering infinite medium is zzso The zzso Carlo method is used for a successful zzso of the derived zzso
