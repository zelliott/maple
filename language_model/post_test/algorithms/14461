This paper presents the impact of twins and the measures for their removal from the population of genetic zzso zzso when applied to effective zzso zzso It is zzso shown that a twin removal strategy for a zzso provides considerably enhanced performance when investigating solutions to complex zzso zzso protein structure prediction zzso problems in zzso zzso Without twin zzso zzso crossover and zzso operations can become zzso as generations lose their ability to produce significant differences, which can lead to the solution zzso The paper zzso the definition of zzso twins in the removal strategy to not only zzso zzso but also highly correlated zzso within the zzso population, with empirical results consistently exhibiting significant improvements solving zzso zzso
