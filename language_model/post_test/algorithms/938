zzso of zzso zzso scores presents challenging problems in zzso analysis, zzso programming, and zzso It is possible to accelerate these zzso by exploiting the simple pedigree structure of a zzso pedigree consisting of a nuclear family plus all four zzso zzso et zzso zzso have done this by introducing likelihood zzso and transformation rules and Lander & Green zzso by the method of zzso zzso zzso The present paper explores an alternative approach based on zzso zzso in the grandparents and systematic phase elimination in all pedigree zzso All three approaches accelerate the zzso of a single zzso Equally relevant to zzso mapping are search strategies for finding the maximum likelihood estimates of zzso zzso zzso zzso that start with the zzso zzso and switch midway to zzso zzso show zzso These issues are investigated in the context of a simulated 10 locus zzso This same example allows us to illustrate a simple strategy for determining locus zzso
