The zzso of zzso acid targets with zzso zzso is a widely used zzso for the parallel detection of multiple targets in medical and biological zzso Despite its widespread application, DNA zzso technology still suffers from several biases and lack of zzso stemming in part from an incomplete understanding of the processes governing surface zzso In particular, zzso spatial variations within individual zzso zzso are often observed, but the mechanisms underpinning this zzso bias remain incompletely zzso 

This study identifies and zzso a systematic spatial bias in the intensity of surface zzso characterized by markedly increased signal intensity of spots located at the boundaries of the spotted areas of the zzso zzso Combining observations from a simplified zzso block array format with predictions from a mathematical model, the mechanism responsible for this bias is found to be a zzso variation in lateral diffusion of target zzso zzso simulations reveal a strong influence of zzso well geometry on the spatial zzso 

zzso adjustment of the size of the zzso zzso chamber to the area of zzso zzso is a simple and effective measure to minimize or eliminate the zzso bias, resulting in increased uniformity and accuracy of quantitative DNA zzso zzso
