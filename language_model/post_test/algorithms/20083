A new zzso approach is proposed for correspondence analysis of different types of data in zzso zzso The zzso is tested on actual zzso A high degree of correspondence is shown for zzso and genetic distances in the tested set of zzso Two directions of variation in both character spaces have clearly zzso The first direction discriminates zzso the second discriminates zzso The characters responsible for these differences have been zzso After uniting both distance zzso the zzso one and the molecular genetic one, into a single zzso and displaying the summarized distances between species on a plane, the zzso of species remained principally zzso The principal directions of variations were preserved and marked the differences between orders, families, and zzso
