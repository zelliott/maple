In this study, we introduce a novel zzso architecture, in which several zzso of patterns can be processed together with an objective of finding a common zzso The structure revealed at the global level is determined by exchanging prototypes of the zzso of data and by moving prototypes of the corresponding clusters toward each zzso zzso the required communication links are established at the level of cluster prototypes and partition zzso without zzso the security zzso A detailed zzso zzso is developed by zzso the advantages of both fuzzy sets and rough sets, and a measure of quantitative analysis of the experimental results is provided for synthetic and real-world zzso
