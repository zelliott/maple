It is known that in many neurological disorders such as Down syndrome, main brain rhythms shift their zzso slightly, and characterizing the spatial distribution of these shifts is of zzso This article reports on the development of a zzso mixed model for the spatial analysis of resting state brain activity in healthy controls and individuals with Down zzso Time series of zzso brain activity are recorded using zzso and spectral zzso are examined at multiple sensor locations across the zzso We focus on the mean frequency of the power spectral density, and use zzso zzso to examine associations with age, gender and Down syndrome across several scalp zzso zzso smoothing zzso are incorporated based on a zzso zzso random field, and the markedly zzso nature of the spectral response variable is zzso by the use of a zzso zzso A range of models representing different assumptions on the association structure and response distribution are zzso and we conduct model selection using the zzso information zzso zzso Our analysis suggests zzso differences between healthy controls and individuals with Down syndrome, particularly in the left and right zzso regions, and produces smoothed maps indicating the scalp topography of the estimated zzso
