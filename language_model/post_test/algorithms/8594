The present study examined the consistency of zzso zzso analysis zzso and zzso zzso in body composition analysis in a field study of zzso children using a representative group of zzso zzso children from zzso zzso zzso Body composition was assessed using zzso measures zzso four zzso and zzso Various published zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso et zzso zzso for A, Kushner et zzso (1992), zzso et zzso zzso and zzso et zzso zzso for zzso and zzso et zzso zzso for a combined zzso were used to estimate body zzso Using A resulted in a sum of four zzso varying between zzso median values of zzso and zzso zzso in boys and zzso and zzso zzso in zzso When fat mass zzso was calculated from A, zzso and zzso differences in median values were observed, with values varying between zzso and zzso for boys and zzso and zzso for zzso Using different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso only minor inconsistencies were zzso zzso resistance index zzso varied between zzso and zzso zzso for boys and zzso and zzso for zzso Using four different zzso to estimate zzso from zzso data resulted in high zzso zzso in percentage zzso (from zzso to zzso as well as in the prevalence of overweight (from zzso to zzso for boys and from zzso to zzso % for zzso Data obtained using the different zzso zzso showed some, or even zzso inconsistencies as well as systematic zzso (an zzso of zzso at low percentage zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso When comparing zzso with A, zzso systematically overestimated zzso The differences between the results were influenced by zzso gender and zzso zzso inconsistencies were observed at low zzso zzso zzso for girls and for small zzso Although the zzso as well as zzso zzso for both techniques are acceptable, we recommend caution in relation to the zzso used for data zzso The use of an interchange table of percentage zzso derived from different zzso for different zzso groups of zzso thicknesses is zzso
