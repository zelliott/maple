zzso measures of acoustic similarity can reveal patterns of shared vocal behavior in social zzso Many methods for computing similarity have been developed, but their performance has not been extensively characterized in noisy environments and with zzso characterized by complex frequency zzso This paper describes methods of zzso comparison based on dynamic time zzso zzso of the fundamental frequency or zzso Fundamental frequency is estimated using a zzso particle filter adaptation of harmonic template zzso The methods were tested on field recordings of flight calls from superb zzso zzso zzso for how well they could separate distinct categories of call elements zzso The zzso method performed best, but the zzso method was less sensitive to zzso Both zzso methods provided better separation of categories than zzso cross zzso likely due to substantial zzso in the duration of superb zzso flight call zzso
