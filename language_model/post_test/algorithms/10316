To illustrate the use of cluster analysis for identifying zzso of complex patients who may benefit from targeted care management zzso 

zzso cohort zzso 

We identified a cohort of adult members of an integrated health maintenance organization who had 2 or more of 17 common chronic medical conditions and were zzso in the top zzso of total cost of care for 2 consecutive years zzso zzso zzso We used zzso zzso zzso methods to identify clinically relevant zzso based on groupings of zzso zzso Ward's minimum zzso zzso provided the most zzso zzso 

Ward's zzso identified 10 clinically relevant clusters grouped around single or multiple zzso zzso The clusters revealed distinct groups of patients zzso zzso chronic pain and mental illness, obesity and mental illness, frail elderly, cancer, specific surgical procedures, cardiac disease, chronic lung disease, gastrointestinal zzso diabetes, and zzso zzso These conditions zzso with multiple other chronic zzso Mental health diagnoses were prevalent zzso zzso to zzso in all zzso 

Data mining procedures such as cluster analysis can be used to identify discrete groups of patients with specific combinations of zzso zzso These clusters suggest the need for a range of care management zzso Although several of our clusters lend themselves to existing care and disease management zzso care management for other zzso is less zzso zzso analysis methods can be leveraged to develop targeted care management interventions designed to improve health zzso
