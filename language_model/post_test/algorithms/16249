The directional distribution of the ambient zzso dose equivalent from zzso zzso projectiles zzso a thick zzso target is measured and zzso The zzso are carried out with a commercially available dose equivalent meter at zzso zzso zzso and zzso with respect to the beam zzso The experimental results are compared with calculated doses from EMPIRE nuclear reaction code and different empirical zzso proposed by zzso The results are also compared with the measured data obtained from an earlier experiment at a lower zzso energy of 110 zzso for the same zzso zzso
