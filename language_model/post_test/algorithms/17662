zzso associations in solution are opposed by the loss of zzso zzso that results from the restriction of motion of each component in the zzso zzso estimates of zzso are essential for zzso binding zzso as well as for calculating zzso contribution to zzso zzso Recently a zzso framework has been proposed for zzso efficiently the zzso zzso loss zzso while taking explicitly into account the complex zzso interactions between the zzso and the zzso This framework relates the zzso zzso of a zzso in solution to its zzso zzso defined as the volume accessible to the center of mass of the zzso in the presence of the zzso and calculated by using an extension of the cell model zzso for condensed zzso The zzso zzso of pure water, estimated with the CM algorithm, shows good agreement with the experimental zzso The free volume of various zzso in water, calculated within the CM by using molecular dynamics simulations with explicit zzso displays a strong correlation with the zzso polar and total surface zzso This correlation is used to propose a zzso that can be used to calculate routinely the zzso zzso of a zzso in zzso We also applied the CM zzso to calculate the free volume and zzso zzso loss zzso on binding of zzso to a cavity in a zzso zzso Our results agree with previously published estimates of the binding of zzso to this zzso zzso These and other considerations suggest that the cell model is a simple yet efficient theoretical framework to evaluate the zzso zzso loss on molecular association in zzso
