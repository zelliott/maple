The introduction of combined zzso systems has a number of advantages, including the zzso of CT images for PET zzso correction zzso The potential advantage compared with existing methodology is less noisy transmission maps within shorter times of zzso The objective of our investigation was to assess the accuracy of CT zzso correction zzso and to study resulting bias and signal to noise ratio zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso A combined zzso system zzso Discovery zzso was zzso Different size zzso containing variable density components were used to assess the inherent accuracy of a zzso transformation in the conversion of CT images to zzso zzso zzso zzso This was followed by a phantom study simulating zzso imaging conditions, with a zzso to background ratio of zzso An additional variable was the inclusion of contrast agent at different concentration zzso A CT scan was carried out followed by 5 zzso zzso with zzso and zzso transmission zzso Clinical data were acquired in 50 patients, who had a CT scan under normal breathing conditions zzso or under zzso with inspiration zzso or expiration zzso followed by a PET scan of 5 and 3 zzso per bed position for the zzso and transmission scans zzso Phantom and patient studies were reconstructed using segmented zzso zzso and zzso In addition, measured zzso zzso was performed for the phantom study using the zzso transmission zzso Comparing the zzso zzso obtained using the zzso and the rod zzso zzso zzso differences of zzso and zzso were recorded before and after zzso of the measured transmission zzso zzso of up to zzso and zzso were found in the average count density zzso between the phantom images reconstructed with MAC and those reconstructed with zzso and zzso zzso In the case of zzso the difference increased up to zzso with the presence of contrast zzso The presence of metallic implants led to zzso in the surrounding zzso and increasing zzso in the proximity of the zzso The patient study revealed no statistically significant differences in the zzso between either zzso or zzso and zzso zzso The larger differences were recorded in the zzso Both the phantom and the patient studies revealed an average increase of approximately zzso in the zzso for the zzso zzso images compared with the zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso or zzso is a viable alternative to zzso for zzso zzso With zzso careful consideration should be given to interpretation of images and use of zzso in the presence of oral contrast and in the proximity of metallic zzso
