A central focus of complex disease zzso after zzso association studies zzso is to identify low frequency and rare risk zzso which may account for an important fraction of disease zzso unexplained by zzso A profusion of studies using next-generation sequencing are seeking such risk zzso We describe how zzso complex trait zzso zzso from zzso can be used to guide the design of these new studies by selecting cases, controls, or families who are most likely to harbor undiscovered risk zzso We show that genetic risk prediction can select unrelated cases from large zzso who are enriched for unknown risk factors, or zzso families that are more likely to harbor zzso risk zzso We derive the frequency of an undiscovered risk zzso in selected cases and controls, and show how this relates to the zzso explained by the risk score, the disease prevalence and the population frequency of the risk zzso We also describe a new method for zzso the design of sequencing studies using genetic risk prediction in large zzso families using an extension of the zzso zzso for zzso on zzso We explore several study design scenarios using both simulated and real data, and show that in many cases genetic risk prediction can provide significant increases in power to detect zzso and rare risk zzso The same approach can also be used to aid discovery of zzso risk factors, suggesting possible future utility of genetic risk prediction in conventional zzso Software implementing the methods in this paper is available in the R package zzso
