Reliable detection of zzso phase in humans using zzso ambulatory zzso in real-life conditions is challenging and still an zzso zzso The masking effects of everyday behavior and environmental input such as physical activity and light on the measured variables need to be considered zzso Here, we aimed at developing techniques for zzso zzso phase with the lowest subject burden possible, that is, without the need of constant routine zzso laboratory conditions or without measuring the standard zzso zzso zzso core body temperature zzso and zzso zzso In this validation study, subjects (N zzso zzso wore zzso ambulatory monitoring devices and went about their daily routine for 1 zzso The devices measured a large number of zzso zzso and environmental zzso including zzso skin temperatures, cardiovascular and respiratory function, zzso ambient temperature, and the spectral composition and intensity of light received at eye zzso Sleep zzso were logged zzso After the ambulatory phase, subjects underwent a zzso zzso procedure in the laboratory for measuring unmasked zzso phase based on the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso To overcome the complex masking effects of zzso variables during ambulatory zzso multiple zzso techniques were applied in combination with the zzso approach to zzso prediction of zzso zzso The most accurate estimate of zzso phase was achieved using skin temperatures, zzso for ambient light in the blue spectral band, and motion acceleration as zzso with lags of up to 24 zzso Multiple zzso showed statistically significant improvement of zzso of prediction error over the traditional approaches to determining zzso phase based on single zzso zzso acceleration or sleep zzso although zzso was intentionally not included as the zzso Compared to zzso alone, our method resulted in a zzso smaller range of prediction errors and a zzso reduction of error zzso The proposed zzso measurement method could find applications in sleep medicine or in other zzso where knowing the exact zzso zzso phase is important zzso for the timing of light zzso
