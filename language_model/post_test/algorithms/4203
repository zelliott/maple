The technical advances made in zzso have been matched by an increase in the application of fluorescent zzso to answer scientific zzso While analysis of fluorescent zzso images represents a powerful zzso one must be aware of the potential zzso zzso the analysis methods applied involve at least some manual steps which are dependent on an observers zzso Typically these steps are zzso and time zzso but more zzso they are also influenced by an individual zzso bias, drift or zzso This raises concerns about the zzso and zzso of the reported zzso Using calcium zzso in zzso zzso slices as an experimental platform, we demonstrate the influence that manual interventions can exert on an zzso We show that there is a high degree of zzso between observers, and that this can be sufficient to affect the outcome of an zzso To counter this, and to eliminate the disagreement between observers, we describe an alternative fully automated method which was created using zzso package for zzso This method has the added advantage of being fully open source and zzso allowing for this approach to be applied to other zzso
