The zzso of the space of neural responses is an ongoing research program seeking to find natural ways to describe, in geometrical terms, the sets of possible activities in the zzso One component of this program is spike zzso of distance between two spike trains recorded from a zzso zzso spike metrics work by identifying zzso spikes in both zzso We present an alignment spike metric having zzso underlying geometrical zzso the zzso version is zzso and is suitable for further embedding in zzso spaces by zzso zzso methods or related zzso We show how to implement a fast zzso for the zzso of this metric based on zzso graph matching zzso
