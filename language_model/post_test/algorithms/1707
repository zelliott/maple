Recent advances in high zzso sequencing technologies and concurrent refinements in zzso zzso isolation techniques have facilitated the rapid extraction and sequencing of zzso zzso content of microbial zzso The zzso affiliation of these zzso zzso fragments is subsequently obtained using either zzso or word frequency based zzso However, the zzso accuracy of such methods is observed to be limited in typical zzso scenarios, wherein a majority of organisms are zzso zzso In this study, we present a zzso zzso zzso algorithm, called zzso that uses zzso Hidden zzso Models for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained using zzso have been compared with the widely used zzso zzso The performance of zzso zzso was observed to be consistently higher than the zzso zzso In some scenarios, this increase in accuracy is as high as zzso A zzso for the zzso zzso is available at zzso
