zzso zzso of zzso zzso recordings can be assumed as zzso of sources of electrical brain zzso To reject artifact sources, the projection of the estimated counterpart by independent component analysis zzso is often zzso from zzso zzso However, the association of performance of zzso decomposition and the zzso has never been analyzed zzso zzso we find that a source can be completely removed from zzso recordings through the zzso zzso The necessary condition of such results is that the estimated zzso model for every source should be entirely correct, that is, each estimated source is just the scaled version of one zzso Meanwhile, we also find that the zzso cannot sufficiently reject one source zzso This is because the estimated zzso model for some sources is inevitably zzso that is, some estimated sources are still the mixture of a few zzso To improve the accuracy of the zzso it is first necessary to develop better zzso zzso to separate zzso as sufficiently as possible and zzso it is necessary to modify the abnormal polarity of the projection of the estimated source in the zzso zzso zzso simulations validate the effectiveness of the modification on the abnormal polarity in rejecting one zzso
