In modern robotic radiation therapy, tumor movements due to zzso can be zzso The accuracy of these methods can be increased by time series prediction of external optical zzso An zzso based on relevance zzso machines zzso is zzso We evaluate zzso with linear and zzso basis functions on a real patient data set containing 304 motion traces and compare it with a zzso based least mean square zzso zzso the best zzso for this data set so zzso Linear zzso zzso zzso significantly and increases the prediction accuracy for zzso of the zzso We show that real time prediction is possible in case of linear zzso and discuss how the predicted zzso can be used to construct promising hybrid zzso which further reduce the prediction zzso
