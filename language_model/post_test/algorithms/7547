Quality of service zzso and, in particular, reliability and a bounded low zzso are essential attributes of zzso wireless systems for medical zzso However, wireless links are typically prone to bursts of zzso with characteristics which vary over zzso propose a wireless system suitable for real-time remote patient monitoring in which the necessary reliability and guaranteed zzso are both achieved by an efficient error control zzso We have paired an example remote zzso application to this wireless zzso We also developed a tool chain that uses a formal description of the proposed wireless medical system architecture in the architecture analysis and design language to assess various combinations of system zzso we can determine the zzso in terms of zzso ratio and the service zzso and also the size of jitter buffer required for seamless zzso zzso A realistic assessment, based on data from the zzso zzso database, shows that the proposed wireless system can achieve an appropriate level of zzso for real-time zzso monitoring if zzso error control is correctly zzso Additionally, we present guidelines for the design of energy-efficient zzso error control, derived from energy data, obtained from zzso
