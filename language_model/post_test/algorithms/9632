This paper presents a modified zzso neural network zzso model for real-time zzso path planning of mobile robots in zzso zzso The proposed neural network for robots is zzso organized with only local lateral connections among zzso It works in dynamic environments and requires no prior knowledge of target or barrier zzso The target zzso fires first, and then the firing event spreads out, through the lateral connections among the zzso like the propagation of a zzso zzso have no connections to their zzso Each zzso records its parent, that is, the neighbor that caused it to zzso The real-time optimal path is then the sequence of parents from the robot to the zzso In a zzso case where the barriers and targets are zzso this paper proves that the generated wave in the network spreads outward with travel times zzso to the linking strength among zzso Thus, the generated path is always the global shortest path from the robot to the zzso In addition, each zzso in the proposed model can zzso a firing event to its neighboring zzso without any comparing zzso The proposed model is applied to generate zzso paths for a mobile robot to solve a zzso problem, to circumvent zzso zzso obstacles, and to track a moving target in an environment with varying zzso The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulation and comparison zzso
