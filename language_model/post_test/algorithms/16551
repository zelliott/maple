zzso equilibrium zzso exchange and characterizing zzso zzso is essential for zzso mechanisms of function in zzso zzso spin labeling has previously been employed to detect zzso changes triggered by some event, but zzso zzso exchange at equilibrium is more zzso zzso exchange zzso is slow on the zzso time scale, and this proves to be an advantage in directly revealing the presence of multiple zzso as distinguishable components in the zzso spectrum, allowing the direct determination of equilibrium zzso and free energy zzso However, zzso exchange of the spin label side chain can also give rise to multiple components in the zzso zzso Using zzso zzso of T4 zzso it is shown that zzso zzso can be used to: zzso demonstrate equilibrium between zzso resolved states, zzso aid in distinguishing zzso from zzso exchange as the origin of the resolved states, and zzso determine the relative partial zzso volume zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso from the pressure dependence of the equilibrium zzso These zzso properties provide insight into the structure of the zzso Finally, the pressure dependence of internal zzso motion is interpreted in terms of volume fluctuations on the zzso time scale, the magnitude of which may reflect local backbone zzso
