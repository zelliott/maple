An zzso digital simulator using zzso system was developed to mimic the zzso behavior of the human circulatory system under zzso assist device zzso zzso This simulator could calculate the response to the variation of the cardiac function or the driving mode of zzso in the real-time zzso This simulator was used as the mock controlled object to evaluate and improve the zzso of an zzso controller of the drive unit for zzso The zzso zzso ahead controller was introduced as the zzso for the zzso which decides the zzso volume from zzso in order to follow up the reference flow value by changing the zzso zzso It was confirmed that the proposed zzso control system improved the response speed of the zzso driving system automatically according to the variation of the controlled zzso
