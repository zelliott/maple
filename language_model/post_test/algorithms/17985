zzso of measurement uncertainties (or zzso in diffusion zzso parameters is essential to zzso the sensitivity and specificity of these quantities as potential surrogate zzso for zzso processes with diffusion zzso imaging zzso zzso methods such as the zzso Carlo simulation have provided insights into characterization of the measurement uncertainty in zzso However, due to the complexity of real brain data as well as different sources of variations during the image zzso a robust zzso for zzso measurement uncertainty in human brain is zzso Recent studies have shown that wild zzso a novel zzso statistical method, can potentially provide effective zzso of zzso measurement uncertainties in human brain zzso zzso In this study, we further zzso the zzso application of the wild zzso method for typical clinical zzso We evaluated the zzso of wild zzso utilizing zzso simulations with different combinations of zzso protocol parameters and wild zzso experimental designs, and zzso compared estimates of uncertainties from wild zzso with those from zzso Carlo zzso Our results demonstrate that a wild zzso zzso using at least 1000 wild zzso zzso with a type II or type III zzso consistent zzso zzso zzso provides robust evaluations of most zzso zzso
