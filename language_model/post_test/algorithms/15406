zzso therapy remains the main treatment for patients with severe zzso but can cause adverse reactions which may be classified as immediate or zzso The use of targeted prevention with drugs and treatments of blood components in selected patients can contribute to reducing the development of some zzso aim of our study was to develop an zzso capable of guiding zzso to adopt in order to reduce the zzso of immediate zzso zzso 

Immediate zzso reactions occurring over a zzso period in 81 patients with zzso zzso were zzso The patients received zzso with red cell concentrates that had been filtered zzso Various measures were undertaken to prevent zzso zzso zzso washing the red blood cells, zzso administration of an zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso or an zzso zzso 500 zzso zzso 

Over the study period zzso red cell concentrates were zzso and 64 adverse zzso reactions were recorded in 36 zzso The mean zzso of reactions in the 7 years of observation was zzso Over the years the zzso gradually decreased from zzso in 2004 to zzso in zzso 

Preventive measures are not required for patients who have an occasional reaction, because the probability that such a type of reaction zzso is very zzso In contrast, the targeted use of drugs such as zzso or zzso sometimes combined with washing and/or double zzso of red blood cells, can reduce the rate of zzso zzso reactions to about zzso The system for detecting adverse reactions and training staff involved in zzso therapy are critical points for reliable collection of data and zzso of the detection system is recommended for those wanting to monitor the zzso of all adverse zzso including minor zzso
