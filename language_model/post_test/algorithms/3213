An efficient technique to achieve zzso edge enhancement in zzso involves applying a zzso zzso transform on the object zzso Here we demonstrate a simple setup for zzso zzso in zzso ray zzso using a single zzso zzso zone plate zzso for zzso zzso zzso Since the zzso acts as a zzso zzso efficiency problems usually associated with zzso zzso zzso are not present in this zzso As zzso demonstrated, the setup can detect optical path differences as small as zzso with high zzso
