To analyze shifts in the zzso of images, we developed a zzso zzso zzso system that is capable of automatically zzso shifts in the zzso through image analysis with a personal computer zzso The accuracy and usefulness of this software were examined through a comparison of nine portal images with a simulation image and by comparing nine portal images with a zzso image, using a human pelvic zzso The difference between the known magnitude of shift and the magnitude of shift detected with this method was analyzed as detection zzso When the portal images were compared with the simulation image, the zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso of detection errors zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When the portal images were compared with the zzso image, the respective figures were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No significant difference was noted between these two categories of comparison zzso The absolute detection error zzso in all directions was zzso zzso for the comparison of portal images with the simulation image and zzso zzso for the comparison of portal images with the zzso zzso This system seems to be appropriate for zzso of the treatment field by improving the accuracy of zzso as a method of zzso landmark recognition during image zzso
