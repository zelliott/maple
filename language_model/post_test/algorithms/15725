zzso zzso kills zzso coli cells by zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso occurs at the zzso decoding zzso between zzso zzso and zzso The breaking of this single zzso bond results in a complete termination of protein zzso leading to cell zzso A model structure of the complex of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was constructed by means of a new zzso zzso algorithm, in which interactions involving specified parts of the molecular surface can be zzso allowing incorporation of experimental data in the zzso zzso Our model, together with available experimental data, predicts the role of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso In addition, it suggests that bound zzso immunity protein zzso the zzso activity of zzso zzso by zzso zzso of the zzso charged zzso
