There has been recent speculation on the relationship between zzso cardiac function and zzso cardiac zzso The goal of this study was to obtain conclusive evidence regarding the relationship between these zzso 

zzso and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging were performed zzso in 33 zzso zzso fractional zzso and fractional zzso of the left zzso wall length were measured in each procedure and the relationships with zzso cardiac function were zzso 

zzso cardiac function and zzso zzso function in each procedure were significantly zzso zzso zzso for correlations between zzso fractional zzso measured zzso and zzso cardiac function parameters were zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso 

zzso cardiac function zzso well with zzso cardiac zzso zzso showed a strong correlation with zzso fractional zzso and is a good candidate for use as an index for assessment of zzso cardiac zzso
