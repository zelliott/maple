Transfer zzso zzso sequences were searched for in the nine basic zzso divisions of zzso zzso zzso bacteria, plants, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by an original program package implementing a dynamic profile alignment approach for the genetic zzso analysis, in using 22 profiles of zzso of different zzso In total, zzso previously unknown zzso sequences were zzso The locations of the zzso were considered over the regions whose functional meaning is described by standard Feature zzso in zzso Many regions containing the zzso sequences were recognized as known zzso A mode of distribution of the zzso sequences in a zzso was proposed as expansion in a content of the various zzso zzso An analysis of the integrity of zzso zzso III inner promoters in the zzso sequences over the zzso divisions has shown a high possibility of generating new copies of short zzso nuclear element zzso repeats in all zzso zzso zzso The numerous zzso found in the regions of zzso zzso II promoters have suggested an adaptation of zzso zzso III promoter to a binding of zzso zzso zzso
