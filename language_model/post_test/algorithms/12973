zzso zzso is applied to a class of random, in time and space, electromagnetic zzso zzso zzso radiation interacting with linear optical zzso A zzso order zzso describing transformation of a zzso state zzso including four spatial and two zzso positions within the field is used to derive conditions for zzso zzso An example is included which deals with a zzso zzso in a typical zzso on reflection from a reflecting zzso zzso nature of such interaction is explored via considering dependence of the degree of polarization of the reflected zzso on its source and on the structure of the zzso
