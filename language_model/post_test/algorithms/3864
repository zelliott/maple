The instrument drift was found to be less than zzso zzso and from zzso on glass filters of 8 optical density units, a zzso of variation of zzso over the 30 second averaging time was zzso The instrument is sufficiently sensitive to enable monitoring of changes in the cerebral oxygen zzso level of zzso and to enable changes in the concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso to be measured with reasonable zzso It is of the utmost importance in zzso investigations to be certain of the specificity of the technique, and it is vital that reliable zzso of the amount of zzso zzso in brain are made in addition to zzso of the extinction zzso This is still a matter of considerable debate, not only in the isolation and properties of the zzso structured membrane bound zzso which many zzso have been investigating for the last 50 years, zzso and zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso but also in relating to zzso versus in zzso zzso An additional point for consideration is the zzso of employing zzso zzso derived from the rat brain, as several groups have done zzso et al 1986, Ferrari et al zzso and applying them to the human brain and to the infant zzso There may be significant differences in the activity of the zzso and the profound zzso effects which will arise during the end point zzso zzso the presence of fetal zzso must also be considered zzso et zzso zzso The clinical determination of the optical path length is a considerable problem zzso zzso zzso and once again estimates of the zzso correction factor made in animals and dead fetuses may not be valid for living human zzso zzso from our animal studies indicate that zzso can be used to monitor changes in the zzso level of zzso and, in extreme zzso changes in the level of the zzso state of zzso zzso can be reliably measured and are well within the sensitivity of the zzso The results indicate that under small change in zzso the zzso state of zzso zzso appears to be zzso It may be that under normal zzso conditions the zzso state of zzso appears to be apparently unchanged under episodes of mild zzso of short zzso
