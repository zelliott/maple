A fully automated method for coronary zzso detection from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso data is zzso Candidates for coronary zzso are extracted by zzso and component zzso These candidates include coronary zzso zzso in the zzso and in the heart, and other zzso structures such as noise and zzso A dedicated set of 64 features is calculated for each candidate zzso They characterize the zzso spatial position relative to the heart and the zzso for which an automatic zzso scheme was developed, its size and shape, and its appearance, which is described by a set of zzso zzso derivatives for which an efficient zzso scheme is zzso Three zzso strategies were zzso The first one tested direct zzso without feature zzso The second approach also zzso direct zzso but with feature zzso Finally, the third scheme employed zzso zzso In a zzso inexpensive first stage, the most easily recognizable false zzso were zzso The second stage zzso between more difficult to separate coronary calcium and other zzso Performance of zzso zzso nearest neighbor, and support zzso machine zzso was zzso The method was tested on 76 scans containing 275 zzso in the coronary arteries and 335 zzso in the heart and zzso The best performance was obtained employing a zzso zzso system with a zzso neighbor zzso zzso and a feature selection zzso The method detected zzso of coronary zzso at the expense of on average zzso false zzso per zzso A calcium score was zzso for each scan and subjects were assigned one of four risk categories based on this zzso The method assigned the correct risk category to zzso of all zzso
