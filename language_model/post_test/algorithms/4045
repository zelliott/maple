zzso of chemotherapy may affect mortality in zzso high-risk women despite appropriate zzso zzso therapy for zzso zzso zzso positive breast zzso The aim of this study was to determine how zzso mortality rate in these patients compares to that of the general female zzso Furthermore, to identify a subset without excess mortality using clinical and pathological zzso 

From the zzso database of the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group we included zzso zzso patients with zzso positive high-risk breast cancer who in 1996 through 2004 by nationwide guidelines were allocated to five years of zzso an zzso inhibitor zzso or both in zzso zzso zzso and fractional zzso zzso models were used to construct zzso zzso by zzso zzso 

In a zzso model excess mortality was zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with increasing age at surgery while recurrence-free survival zzso was zzso zzso to zzso therapy was associated with excess mortality zzso zzso zzso while treatment with an zzso was associated with a less pronounced mortality excess zzso zzso zzso A zzso standard mortality rate zzso index zzso was built using the zzso zzso obtained in the zzso model, and the same risk factors were used to construct a zzso zzso Both allocated zzso to a group with increased zzso mortality as compared to the general female population, but the zzso was significantly increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso patients who were allocated to low-risk group by the zzso zzso and to a high-risk group by zzso 

Only one quarter of zzso zzso positive breast cancer patients are free of excess mortality when omitting zzso zzso Patients should be informed about importance of adherence to zzso zzso therapy and inclusion of an zzso A zzso may better guide recommendations regarding zzso zzso
