For low volatile zzso the applications of zzso zzso zzso as an air zzso were reported with sampling time chosen in the linear stage of the zzso zzso because of long equilibrium zzso In these zzso conditions, sampling rates zzso expressed as the volume of air sampled by the zzso zzso per unit of time, were used to estimate zzso zzso in zzso In the present study, to achieve good extraction performance and accurate zzso the zzso zzso of several pesticides with zzso were investigated in detail, with a focus on parameters influencing zzso Linear air zzso was found to be the main zzso affecting zzso For exposed zzso with air zzso below zzso zzso zzso increased with increasing air zzso When linear air zzso was equal to or greater than zzso zzso it had little effect on zzso To improve the flexibility of zzso different zzso of zzso were zzso zzso different lengths of fibers exposed, zzso zzso exposed fibers with zzso zzso were zzso zzso to exposed lengths of zzso Using grids, lower zzso and wider zzso time range were zzso zzso for zzso fibers were the lowest among the different experimented zzso The accuracy of zzso was improved and more flexibility of zzso was zzso
