Gene expression zzso from breast cancer zzso tumors are established clinical zzso tools to identify tumor zzso identify patients showing zzso zzso and identify patients likely to have disease zzso However, diverse breast cancer zzso in conjunction with diagnostic clinical zzso show little overlap in the sets of genes zzso One approach to identify a set of consistently zzso candidate genes in these tumors is to employ zzso of multiple independent zzso zzso This allows one to compare expression data from a diverse collection of breast tumor array zzso generated on either zzso or zzso zzso 

We gathered expression data from 9 published zzso studies examining zzso zzso positive zzso and zzso zzso negative zzso zzso tumor cases from the zzso zzso We performed a zzso and identified genes that were universally up or down regulated with respect to zzso versus zzso tumor zzso We surveyed both the zzso promoter and 3' untranslated regions zzso of our zzso genes in each expression group to test whether common sequence elements may contribute to the observed expression zzso zzso a combination of known zzso factor binding sites zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter and zzso zzso and zzso zzso seed zzso we identified numerous motifs that were disproportionately represented between the two gene classes suggesting a common regulatory network for the observed gene expression zzso 

Some of the genes we identified distinguish key transcripts previously seen in array studies, while others are newly zzso Many of the genes identified as zzso in zzso tumors were previously identified as expression markers for zzso transformation in multiple human zzso Moreover, our motif analysis identified a collection of specific zzso target sites which may collectively play a role in the differential gene expression patterns observed in zzso versus zzso breast cancer zzso zzso the gene sets and associated DNA motifs provide a starting point with which to explore the zzso basis for the observed expression patterns in breast zzso
