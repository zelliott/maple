A small zzso zzso diameter zzso is thought to be associated with a higher characteristic zzso of the zzso zzso However, there has been no evidence of a relationship between directly evaluated zzso and directly measured central zzso pressure or the outcome of patients with cardiovascular zzso 

zzso In 135 patients without heart failure zzso who underwent coronary zzso we zzso examined the relationship between the zzso and the central zzso pressure or zzso zzso The zzso adjusted with zzso was zzso correlated with the central pulse pressure zzso zzso zzso model zzso and the effective zzso zzso index zzso zzso model zzso zzso In 197 patients who were hospitalized due to zzso we examined the relationship between the zzso zzso using zzso and the outcome using a Cox zzso hazard zzso zzso patients died from various causes during the follow-up period zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso remained an independent risk factor for zzso death zzso ratio for 1 zzso increase of the zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and cardiovascular death zzso ratio for 1 zzso increase of the zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso 

A small zzso was associated with a higher zzso and zzso stiffening in the patients without zzso as well as with a poor outcome for zzso zzso Although it is easy to evaluate the zzso it may offer important information regarding the zzso load and may be useful for risk zzso of zzso zzso
