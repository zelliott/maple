A set of zzso zzso field equations is presented which describes the dynamics of neural activity in zzso These take into account the most pertinent anatomical and zzso features found in zzso with all zzso values zzso from independent zzso zzso of a white noise fluctuation spectrum from a zzso set of equations shows the presence of strong zzso that zzso to zzso observed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso solutions of a full set of one-dimensional zzso equations include properties analogous to cortical evoked zzso travelling waves at zzso observed zzso threshold type spike activity and limit cycle, chaotic and noise driven zzso at the frequency of the zzso alpha zzso All these types of zzso are generated with parameters that are within ranges reported zzso The strong dependence of the phenomena observed on zzso interactions is zzso These results suggest that the classically described alpha may be zzso in a number of zzso distinct zzso zzso all of which depend on the integrity of zzso population zzso
