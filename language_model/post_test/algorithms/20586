For immobilized zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso resolved zzso zzso can be observed in continuous wave electron zzso resonance zzso zzso for zzso distances as large as 30 A using zzso zzso In this work, zzso are developed for calculating zzso zzso of zzso zzso coupled zzso and then used to define the limits of sensitivity to the zzso distance as a function of geometry and zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of N zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been collected at zzso 34, and 94 zzso These data have been zzso using a combination of simulated zzso and global analysis, to obtain a unique fit to the zzso The values of the zzso distance and the five angles defining the relative orientation of the two zzso are in reasonable agreement with a molecular model built from the known crystal zzso Finally, the effect of rigid body zzso zzso diffusion on the zzso zzso of zzso coupled zzso has been investigated using an zzso based on zzso dynamics zzso These calculations demonstrate the sensitivity of zzso zzso to zzso zzso in the presence of rigid body zzso zzso
