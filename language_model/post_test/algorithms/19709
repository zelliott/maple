In a zzso zzso zzso mismatch zzso zzso largely reflects standard stimuli presented to the same ear as the zzso suggesting an independent representation for each zzso We sought to assess this representation zzso Twenty-two participants, presented left (all 2000 zzso zzso sound pressure level zzso and right (all 800 zzso zzso zzso ear sounds, attended to 1 ear per zzso A series of successive trains of zzso sounds were presented to each zzso Although 1 ear received short (40 zzso standard sounds, the other received an equal number of long zzso zzso zzso In the next train, the standard zzso were switched between the zzso zzso onset zzso ranged from 120 to 440 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso replaced the final standards of some zzso zzso zzso simultaneously moved earlier for the ear changing from long to short standards and later for the ear changing from short to long zzso Based on a simple linear model, more than zzso of the memory trace reflected zzso zzso We conclude that independently zzso memory traces zzso zzso zzso zzso of the representation for the attended subset of stimuli is proposed as core to the mechanism of sustained zzso
