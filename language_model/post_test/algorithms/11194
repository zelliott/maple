zzso zzso methods such as particle filters have been used to track a moving source in an unknown and zzso ocean zzso These methods treat both the source and the ocean parameters as zzso unknown random variables and track them via the zzso zzso probability density zzso zzso filters are zzso methods that can operate on zzso systems with zzso probability density zzso zzso zzso are a natural extension to these zzso A zzso is appropriate in applications where data before and after the time of interest are readily zzso Both past and zzso zzso are exploited in zzso whereas filters just use past zzso zzso and source tracking is performed here using two zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso is demonstrated on experimental data from both the zzso and zzso experiments where the zzso uncertainty is reduced relative to just filtering zzso
