The zzso zzso properties of contracting zzso smooth muscle tissue are estimated from a zzso model based on the experimental data of zzso zzso The area changes are obtained at different muscle lengths from experiments in which zzso muscle zzso unrestricted zzso Then, through an zzso process, the zzso properties are estimated by matching the area changes obtained from the finite element analysis to those derived from the zzso The results obtained indicate that the zzso ratio zzso zzso to zzso zzso is about 4 when the smooth muscle zzso zzso strain zzso indicating that the zzso zzso reduces as the zzso zzso zzso It was found through a sensitivity analysis from the simulation model that the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso are not very sensitive as compared to major zzso ratio to the area changes of the muscle zzso
