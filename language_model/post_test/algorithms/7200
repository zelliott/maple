We address the two inherently related problems of zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso sparse data and propose a new method to integrate these stages in a level set zzso The zzso process uses zzso information rather than zzso zzso for increased zzso and zzso The method supports any spatial zzso of sets of zzso slices having arbitrary positions and zzso We achieve this by introducing a new level set scheme based on the zzso of the level set function by zzso basis zzso The proposed method is validated zzso and/or zzso on artificial data and zzso and CT scans and is compared against the traditional sequential approach, which zzso the images first, using a state-of-the-art image zzso method, and then segments the zzso volume in zzso or zzso In our experiments, the proposed framework yielded similar zzso results to the sequential approach but provided a more robust and accurate zzso In particular, the zzso was more satisfactory in cases of large gaps, due to the method taking into account the global shape of the object, and it recovered better zzso at the zzso of the shapes where the objects disappear from the image zzso As a result, the complete integrated framework provided more satisfactory shape reconstructions than the sequential zzso
