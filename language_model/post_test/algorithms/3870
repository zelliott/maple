The importance and usefulness of local zzso parameters in understanding sequence dependent effects has been described for A- and zzso zzso crystal zzso Each of the two sets of local parameters described by us in the zzso algorithm, namely the local zzso zzso calculated with reference to the mean zzso and the local zzso zzso calculated with reference to the local zzso zzso is sufficient to describe the zzso structures, with the local zzso parameters giving a slightly magnified picture of the variations in the zzso The values of local zzso parameters calculated by zzso zzso are similar to those calculated by zzso program, only if the zzso zzso is not too zzso The mean values obtained using all the available data for zzso zzso are not significantly different from those obtained when a limited data set is used, consisting only of structures with a data resolution of better than zzso A and without any bound drug zzso Thus the variation observed in the zzso zzso appears to be independent of the quality of their zzso No strong correlation is seen between any pair of local zzso parameters but the local zzso parameters are interrelated by geometric zzso An interesting feature that emerges from this analysis is that the local rise along the zzso is highly correlated with the difference in the buckle values of the two zzso in the zzso as suggested earlier for the zzso structures zzso and zzso in zzso & zzso DNA & zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In fact the local rise values become almost constant for both A- and zzso if a correction is applied for the zzso of the zzso In zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences generally have a smaller local rise zzso zzso compared to the other sequences zzso zzso and this seems to be an intrinsic feature of zzso stacking interaction and not related to any other local zzso zzso The roll angles in zzso zzso have small values (less than zzso 8 zzso while mean local twist varies from 24 degrees to 45 zzso The zzso zzso sequences show two types of preferred zzso one with positive roll, small positive slide and reduced twist and another with negative roll, large positive slide and increased zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
