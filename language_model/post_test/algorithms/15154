Copy number zzso zzso have been shown to play an important role in genetic diversity of zzso and in the development of many complex zzso zzso The aim of this study was to perform a standard comparative evaluation of zzso in horses using three different zzso detection programs and to identify zzso regions associated with body size in zzso 

Analysis was performed using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso were detected by three different zzso zzso zzso and zzso Comparative analysis revealed 50 zzso that affected 153 different genes mainly involved in sensory perception, signal zzso and cellular zzso zzso association analysis for body size showed highly significant deleted regions on zzso zzso and zzso zzso regions to the detected zzso on zzso and zzso have also been shown to be correlated with human zzso 

Comparative analysis of zzso detection zzso was useful to increase the specificity of zzso detection but had certain limitations dependent on the detection zzso zzso revealed zzso associated zzso for body size in zzso
