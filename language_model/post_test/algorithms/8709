The expected cell count for a 2 zzso 2 contingency table, governed by the zzso zzso zzso distribution, is expressed as a terminating continued zzso The zzso in the continued fraction are better behaved than the zzso zzso required for the usual moment zzso The expected cell count must be calculated repeatedly in a conditional maximum likelihood analysis of zzso zzso 2 contingency zzso Since the continued fraction can be easily zzso a rapid and zzso stable zzso zzso zzso Once this first moment is known, higher moments can be obtained as shown by Harkness zzso zzso of zzso Statistics 36, zzso A zzso program to implement the continued fraction zzso is given in an zzso
