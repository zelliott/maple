The primary shortcoming of the zzso refocused zzso zzso zzso pulse sequence is the possibility of artifacts introduced during the zzso due to spin diffusion where by extra zzso in the zzso dimension (from other sites in the zzso appear correlated with a given zzso zzso This is a problem when the spinning speeds are too slow (less than 15 zzso to sufficiently average the zzso zzso zzso zzso This would be especially important when working with large volume zzso that are difficult to spin fast enough to completely average the zzso zzso In our experiments we used the zzso zzso zzso method of zzso decoupling during the zzso to remove the artifact zzso This method has the advantage of being quite easy to setup and implement on most modern zzso zzso
