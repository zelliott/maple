A three-dimensional technique was developed for the zzso of the number and zzso geometry of individual zzso oriented along a given zzso As an example application, the number of vertical and horizontal zzso and their respective zzso geometry were determined for a set of six zzso zzso bone specimens zzso female zzso zzso age range zzso zzso zzso optical images at a spatial resolution of 20 zzso were obtained using an automated serial milling zzso The thickness zzso were generally right zzso The mean true thickness for both the vertically and zzso oriented zzso showed a strong relationship with volume fraction zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and mean zzso thickness zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The horizontal zzso were greater in number and were thinner than the vertical zzso The zzso of variation of the zzso vertical zzso thicknesses ranged from zzso to zzso and showed a weak, albeit zzso positive correlation with volume fraction zzso zzso zzso The findings demonstrated substantial zzso variations exist in zzso thickness that are not related to volume zzso Further studies are recommended to determine the potential role of such zzso variations in architecture on zzso zzso
