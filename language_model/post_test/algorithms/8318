When interpreting a shaded surface image the observer must zzso a three-dimensional shape from a two-dimensional zzso The principal zzso cues used in this process are surface orientation and apparent zzso Four zzso zzso were zzso ranging from pure depth to pure surface orientation with two zzso Eight observers assessed these zzso using 40 sets of images showing test objects derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso X-ray zzso zzso and simulated zzso The results demonstrated a highly significant preference zzso less than zzso for surface orientation over depth information for all observers and both imaging zzso The zzso of zzso showed that the observers were in good agreement as to the rank order of the zzso with significant agreement zzso less than zzso for 37 of the 40 sets of zzso The overall preferred zzso was based on a local zzso fitting procedure and contained primarily surface zzso This zzso zzso was extended to include zzso which was used both as an arbitrary surface property to identify parts of a complex object and as a means of conveying zzso zzso Further extension of the zzso to the display of transparent surfaces was facilitated by an zzso model based on purely zzso zzso This enabled even irregular surfaces to be displayed as transparent objects, and was combined with opaque zzso for displaying zzso surfaces in nuclear magnetic resonance zzso
