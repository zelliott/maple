Land surface window zzso is a key zzso for zzso the zzso zzso zzso The combined zzso transfer model zzso with neural network zzso zzso is zzso to directly estimate the window zzso zzso zzso from the brightness temperature of the Advanced zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with 90 m spatial zzso Although the zzso accuracy is very high when the broadband zzso is estimated from zzso zzso Standard Data zzso by using zzso method, the accuracy of zzso is about zzso zzso for 86 zzso which is determined by the atmosphere correction for zzso zzso zzso The zzso 4 is used to simulate the process of zzso transfer, and the broadband zzso is directly estimated from the brightness temperature of zzso zzso data at zzso The comparison analysis indicates that the zzso is more competent to estimate broadband zzso than other method when the brightness temperatures of band 11, 12, 13, 14 are made as input zzso of dynamic neural zzso The zzso average accuracy is about zzso and the zzso results are not sensitive to instrument zzso The zzso is applied to extract broadband zzso from an image of zzso zzso data in China, and the comparison against a zzso based multiple bands with 15 m spatial resolution shows that the zzso results from zzso are very zzso
