Assessment of different diagnostic zzso in patients zzso with a suspected pulmonary zzso 

A zzso descriptive study of 76 zzso patients with suspected respiratory zzso It has been determined the zzso and the zzso and zzso probability of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso pulmonary zzso and zzso zzso levels, in order to design four different diagnostic zzso 

The diagnostic sequence zzso with normal results involved an infection probability of zzso zzso zzso with successively normal zzso and zzso implied a likelihood of zzso The zzso zzso in sequence with zzso and zzso rose to zzso if both were abnormal and diminished to zzso if zzso 

The zzso zzso associated with the sequence of normal zzso and zzso suggests a low infection zzso On the contrary, associated with pathological zzso and zzso in zzso practically assures the pulmonary zzso
