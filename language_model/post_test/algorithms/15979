The size dependent and size independent contributions to the mechanical properties of zzso zzso with zzso air, made for medical ultrasound imaging, have been zzso A relation between the size of zzso in a reference group and their acoustic zzso efficacy was derived by partial least square zzso The developed model was used to estimate acoustic zzso as a function of the measured size distribution for various preparations made during zzso and process zzso The ratio between the measured zzso and model estimated zzso was then used to evaluate variations in the mechanical properties of the zzso shell and the contribution of such variations to the zzso properties of the zzso The statistical zzso was compared with results for the mechanical zzso derived from a theoretical approach and the results from the two methods mutually confirmed each zzso The statistical procedure outlined has been found zzso for studies of other particulate products with size dependent in zzso or in zzso zzso
