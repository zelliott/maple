A single flexible zzso in strong zzso fields is investigated using zzso simulations and zzso zzso For short chains and small fields zzso is zzso For elevated fields or long chains the chain stretches and the zzso zzso zzso in agreement with zzso experiments on linear as well as circular zzso For very large fields a zzso forms consisting of a compact leading head and a trailing stretched zzso
