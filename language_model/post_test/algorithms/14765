A novel noise filtering zzso based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition zzso is proposed to remove artifacts in zzso zzso zzso Three noise patterns with different zzso zzso zzso and base line zzso embedded into simulated and real zzso zzso Traditional zzso zzso Wiener zzso empirical mode decomposition zzso and zzso were used to compare filtering zzso Mean square error between clean and filtered zzso was used as filtering performance zzso zzso showed that high noise reduction is the major advantage of the zzso based zzso especially on zzso zzso
