The general problem of selecting a battery of tests for diagnostic purposes is discussed and zzso zzso methodology is applied to solve it, with battery selection being based on performance zzso such as sensitivity, zzso and the cost of zzso For a battery of tests, the extended majority rule is developed and used to interpret the compound test zzso The major advantage of the model developed in this paper is that it can generate a set of zzso batteries without requiring the calculation of all possible combinations of zzso An example in which the method is applied to a real zzso selection of short-term tests to detect the zzso of zzso zzso
