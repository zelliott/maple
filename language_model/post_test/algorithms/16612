The zzso model simulates hypoxic zzso growth for head and neck cancer as well as zzso and the effects of accelerated zzso and zzso This report outlines zzso design, zzso and the impact of accelerated zzso on the increase in zzso needed to control the extra cell propagation during accelerated zzso Cell kill probabilities are based on Linear zzso theory, with zzso levels and zzso capacity influencing cell zzso zzso is zzso through oxygen level allocation based on zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by increasing the stem cell symmetrical division zzso while the process of zzso zzso zzso zzso increments to the cell population after each treatment zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells requires zzso zzso Controlling the extra cell growth induced by accelerated zzso requires a zzso increase of zzso zzso in agreement with published zzso The average zzso zzso zzso of 3 zzso per fraction results in full zzso zzso after shrinkage to approximately 1 zzso zzso is a zzso efficient model simulating zzso growth and zzso incorporating accelerated zzso and zzso It may be used to explore cell kill outcomes during zzso while varying key zzso and zzso specific zzso such as the degree of zzso
