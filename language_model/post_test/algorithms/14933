The accuracy of monitor unit calculations from a pencil beam based, three-dimensional treatment planning system zzso zzso has been evaluated for open zzso shaped zzso zzso The dose per monitor unit was measured in water and in air for zzso beam qualities from 6 to 15 zzso The fields were shaped either with a zzso zzso zzso or with customized zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso were compared with zzso The agreement between calculated and measured dose per monitor unit depended on field size and the amount of blocking and was within zzso for the zzso zzso The zzso could be traced to limitations in head scatter zzso for the zzso For fields shaped with zzso blocks, the dose per monitor unit was calculated to be within zzso of measured values for all fields zzso The measured and calculated relative phantom scatter for fields with the same equivalent field size were identical for zzso and zzso shaped zzso These results indicate that the accuracy in the zzso calculations for open irregular fields, shaped with zzso or blocks, is satisfactory for clinical zzso
