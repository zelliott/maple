The optimal imaging method for the diagnosis of zzso remains zzso Our aim was to evaluate the added value of zzso imaging for the diagnosis of zzso 

We zzso extracted 35 consecutive patients suspected of having acute zzso who had the zzso 1) a focal zzso zzso of the VA on zzso 2) zzso imaging during the initial hospital stay, and 3) clinical and imaging follow-up within 6 zzso Two zzso classified patients as either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso by reviewing all the available data at hospital zzso except zzso imaging zzso On zzso imaging, 2 zzso searched for signs of acute zzso The 2 zzso were zzso In case of zzso zzso follow-up and zzso zzso zzso used to obtain supportive evidence for or against zzso were considered as the standard of zzso 

In zzso patients in group A, zzso imaging did not demonstrate any signs of acute zzso and zzso zzso changes were attributed to zzso zzso with an unchanged zzso on zzso In zzso patients in group B, zzso demonstrated a mural zzso with zzso zzso on follow-up zzso 

Our results encourage the use of zzso imaging as a zzso diagnostic tool in the event of suspicion of acute zzso and doubtful findings on standard zzso
