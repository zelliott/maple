zzso the zzso of a cooperative whole arm zzso is not easy while enclosing an zzso This difficulty is mainly because of risk of jamming caused by zzso zzso To reduce this risk, this paper proposes a feedback manipulation planning zzso that takes grasp zzso into zzso The idea is based on a zzso field that zzso zzso in object motion inducing directions when the movement is considerably along zzso redundant zzso zzso avoidance problem is then considered by combining the zzso with zzso zzso As experimental results zzso the proposed zzso is effective in avoiding jamming as well as obstacles for a zzso dual arm whole arm zzso
