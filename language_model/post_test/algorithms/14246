zzso zzso electrical zzso zzso could distinguish between zzso and zzso stroke and permit the urgent use of zzso drugs in patients with zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to characterize the zzso zzso 2 zzso system, designed for this purpose, with 32 zzso and a zzso 2 zzso to zzso zzso single zzso measuring zzso Data were collected in seven subjects with brain zzso zzso zzso or chronic stroke, as these resembled the changes in zzso or zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that the reliable bandwidth was only zzso zzso because of front-end components placed to permit simultaneous zzso zzso In raw zzso component data, the zzso of zzso zzso data for one zzso combination across subjects was zzso zzso zzso compared to a largest predicted change of zzso estimated using the zzso of the zzso Using newly developed methods of examining the most sensitive channels from the zzso and zzso imaging constrained to the known site of the zzso no zzso changes between zzso were zzso This study has identified a zzso for accuracy in zzso in acute stroke, identified the size of zzso in relation to this in human recordings, and presents new methods for analysis of zzso Although no zzso changes were identified, we hope this will provide a foundation for future studies in this demanding but potentially powerful novel zzso
