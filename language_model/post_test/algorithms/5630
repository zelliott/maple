World Health Organization zzso zzso and clinical criteria for monitoring zzso zzso treatment zzso offer low accuracy for predicting viral zzso zzso viral load zzso to those at high risk has been recommended and a system to do this has been developed in zzso Systems for use in sub-Saharan African populations were zzso 

A new zzso scoring system for targeting viral load zzso was developed from data from the first 4 years of a Ugandan cohort (N zzso zzso receiving zzso zzso The accuracy of this, the zzso system and the WHO criteria to predict viral failure, through targeting viral load zzso were compared in a separate population of zzso zzso 

The new Ugandan scoring system included zzso cell count, mean cell volume, zzso and zzso clinical events as zzso of viral zzso In the validation population, the Ugandan system undertook viral load zzso in 61 zzso cases offering zzso sensitivity and zzso positive zzso value zzso to predict viral zzso The zzso system undertook viral load zzso in 33 zzso cases producing zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso WHO criteria recommended viral load zzso in 72 zzso cases offering zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso 

zzso developed zzso based on clinical and zzso criteria may offer little additional accuracy over WHO criteria for targeting viral load zzso When possible, confirming viral load before switching therapy is zzso zzso systems are more flexible than WHO criteria in allowing ART providers to choose the proportion of the population that undergo targeted viral load zzso
