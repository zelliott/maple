This paper describes a method for the automated anatomical labeling of the zzso branch extracted from a three-dimensional zzso chest X-ray CT image and its application to a virtual zzso system zzso zzso anatomical labeling is necessary for implementing an advanced zzso diagnosis system of 3-D medical zzso This method performs the anatomical labeling of the zzso branch using the knowledge base of the zzso branch zzso The knowledge base holds information on the zzso branch as a set of rules for its anatomical zzso A zzso region is automatically extracted from a given 3-D CT zzso A tree structure representing the essential structure of the extracted zzso is recognized from the zzso zzso zzso labeling is performed by comparing this tree structure of the zzso with the knowledge zzso As an application, we implemented the function to automatically present the anatomical names of the branches that are shown in the currently rendered image in real time on the zzso The result showed that the method could segment about 57% of the branches from CT images and extracted a tree structure of about zzso in branches in the segmented zzso The anatomical labeling method could assign the correct branch name to about zzso of the branches in the extracted tree zzso zzso names were appropriately displayed in the zzso zzso
