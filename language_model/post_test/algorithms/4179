In this study, we aimed to evaluate zzso the patient organ dose from zzso zzso zzso using zzso Carlo zzso A zzso CT unit zzso 16, zzso Medical zzso was modeled with the zzso zzso zzso software based on the zzso zzso Carlo zzso The X-ray spectrum and the zzso of the bowtie filter for the zzso Carlo modeling were determined from the chamber zzso for the zzso layer zzso of aluminum and the dose profile zzso ratio, zzso in zzso The calculated zzso and zzso were compared with measured values for body zzso with 120 zzso The zzso zzso patient dose distribution was converted to the absorbed dose measured by a Farmer chamber with a zzso zzso factor at the center of a CT water zzso The patient dose was evaluated from zzso zzso for the internal zzso in the zzso The calculated Al zzso was in agreement within zzso with the measured value of zzso zzso The calculated dose profile in air matched the measured value within zzso in a range of 15 zzso from the central zzso The mean doses for soft zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso respectively, under exposure conditions of 120 zzso 200 zzso a beam pitch of zzso and beam zzso of 32 zzso For bones of the zzso and zzso the mean doses were zzso and zzso zzso zzso The doses for bone increased by up to 2-3 times that of soft zzso corresponding to the ratio of their zzso zzso zzso
