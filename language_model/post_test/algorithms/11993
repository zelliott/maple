The probability of conception in a given zzso cycle is closely related to the timing of zzso relative to zzso Although commonly used markers of time of zzso are known to be error zzso most fertility models assume the day of zzso is measured without zzso We develop a mixture model that allows the day to be zzso We assume that the measurement errors are zzso across zzso zzso zzso among couples in the per cycle likelihood of conception is accounted for using a beta mixture zzso zzso zzso is straightforward using zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso The methods are applied to a prospective study of couples at risk of zzso In the absence of validation data or multiple independent markers of zzso the zzso of the measurement error distribution depends on the assumed zzso Thus, the results of studies relating the timing of zzso to the probability of conception should be interpreted zzso
