Solid zzso using zzso zzso as a carrier were studied for improving the dissolution and zzso of zzso a poorly zzso zzso The solid zzso were prepared either by evaporation of the ethanol solutions containing zzso and zzso or by cooling the hot melt of the drug in the zzso The zzso were characterized using differential scanning zzso powder X-ray zzso scanning electron zzso zzso zzso and by constructing the melting point phase zzso In zzso dissolution and in zzso oral zzso in zzso dogs were compared for the solid zzso and a conventional zzso capsule zzso zzso showed that, at a composition of approximately zzso zzso formed a zzso mixture with zzso zzso Both the drug and the zzso were zzso in the solid zzso with a wide range of composition of each zzso The solid zzso substantially increased the in zzso dissolution rate of zzso zzso of the zzso to zzso dogs resulted in a significant increase of oral zzso compared with the conventional zzso capsule zzso These results show that solid zzso is a promising approach for developing zzso drug zzso
