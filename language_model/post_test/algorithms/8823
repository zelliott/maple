zzso secondary zzso mass zzso imaging is a rapidly evolving zzso Its main application is the study of the distribution of small molecules on biological zzso The sequential image acquisition process remains susceptible to measurement zzso that can render imaging data less zzso zzso Most of these artifacts show a repetitive nature from tile to zzso Here we statistically describe these zzso and derive two different zzso to correct zzso Both a generalized linear model approach and the linear zzso analysis approach are able to increase image quality for negative and positive zzso mode data zzso Additionally, performing simulation studies with repetitive and zzso zzso error we show that both zzso are only removing repetitive zzso It is further shown that the spectral component of the data set is not altered by the use of these correction zzso Both zzso presented in this work greatly increase the image quality and improve the zzso usefulness of distorted images zzso
