zzso zzso with fixed time delays are frequently observed in simultaneous recordings from multiple zzso Such zzso patterns are potentially indicative of underlying zzso and it is important to know when a repeatedly occurring pattern is statistically zzso These sequences are typically identified through correlation zzso In this paper we present a method for assessing the significance of such zzso We specify the zzso hypothesis in terms of a bound on the conditional probabilities that characterize the influence of one zzso on zzso This method of testing significance is more general than the currently available methods since under our zzso hypothesis we do not assume that the zzso processes of different zzso are zzso The structure of our zzso hypothesis also allows us to rank order the detected zzso We demonstrate our method on simulated spike zzso
