Relative zzso is a commonly used method for assessing gene zzso however its accuracy and reliability is dependent upon the choice of an optimal zzso control zzso and such choice cannot be made a zzso There is limited information available on suitable reference genes to be used for studies involving human zzso zzso zzso The objective of the current study was to evaluate and identify optimal reference genes for use in the relative zzso of gene expression in human zzso fat zzso of lean, overweight and obese zzso 

Some of the commonly used reference genes including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso using real-time zzso zzso The expression stability of these genes was evaluated using zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the effect of sample size on the validation process was studied by randomly zzso subjects in two zzso of zzso zzso 2 and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso were identified as the most stable genes common to all three zzso and both sample zzso Their use as reference gene pairs might contribute to the enhanced zzso of relative zzso in the studies involving the human zzso zzso zzso
