In recent years the analysis of heart rate zzso zzso has become a suitable method for characterizing autonomous cardiovascular zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the differences in zzso estimated from continuous blood pressure zzso measurement by different methods in comparison to zzso zzso zzso The zzso intervals zzso were simultaneously extracted from the zzso and blood pressure of 9 cardiac patients (10 zzso Colin system, zzso sampling zzso For both data types, zzso peak, and correlation detection zzso were zzso The short-term zzso was calculated using concurrent zzso zzso and zzso zzso The root mean square errors in comparison to zzso slope detection were: zzso zzso for zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso for zzso peak zzso zzso zzso for zzso slope zzso zzso zzso for zzso correlation zzso and zzso zzso for zzso peak zzso Our results show that the zzso obtained with zzso is the most zzso Moreover, slope detection is superior to peak detection and slightly superior to correlation zzso In particular, for zzso signals with higher frequency zzso peak detection often exhibits more artificial zzso Besides measurement noise, respiratory zzso and pulse transit time play an important role in determining zzso The slope detection method applied to zzso should be zzso because it is more robust as regards zzso changes in the signals, as well as zzso zzso As the zzso is not recorded in most animal studies, zzso pulse wave measurement in combination with correlation or slope detection may be considered an acceptable zzso
