Our goal was to compare the predicted outcomes and costs of two diagnostic zzso for zzso zzso 

Two zzso for zzso bleeding were developed, one with zzso zzso and the other with office zzso biopsy as the first zzso Literature review was performed to estimate the probability of either an abnormal result of zzso or a zzso zzso or zzso Cost and sensitivity analyses were zzso 

zzso probability of a zzso zzso biopsy was zzso and estimated probability of an abnormal result of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso thickness zzso 4 zzso was zzso Cost analysis showed that zzso zzso as the first diagnostic test cost $230 per patient on average compared with $244 for zzso zzso with savings ranging from $14 to $20 per patient over a wide range of possible values for estimated zzso 

zzso zzso costs slightly less than office zzso biopsy as the first test in the diagnostic evaluation of women with zzso zzso
