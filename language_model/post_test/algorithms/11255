Open source tools are needed to facilitate the construction, analysis, and zzso of zzso interaction networks for sequencing zzso To address this need, we present zzso an open source network analysis pipeline for zzso association studies and rare zzso zzso Encore zzso zzso Association zzso Networks or zzso networks using two optional zzso our previous zzso method or a generalized linear model zzso Additionally, Encore includes multiple data filtering options, including Random zzso Jungle for main effect enrichment and zzso zzso and zzso filters for enrichment of interaction zzso Encore zzso zzso network zzso for identifying zzso hubs zzso containing a large amount of disease zzso information through the combination of zzso main effects and multiple zzso interactions in the zzso and it provides appropriate files for interactive zzso of a network using tools from our online Galaxy zzso We implemented these zzso in zzso using zzso for zzso parallel analysis on a server or zzso To demonstrate zzso utility in analysis of genetic sequencing data, we present an analysis of zzso zzso data from healthy individuals and those with zzso Lupus zzso zzso Our results verify the importance of the previously associated zzso genes zzso and zzso and these two genes had the highest zzso interaction degrees among the zzso zzso An additional 14 genes previously associated with zzso emerged in our zzso network model of the zzso data, and three novel candidate zzso zzso zzso and zzso were implicated in the zzso In zzso we present a comprehensive tool for zzso network analysis and the first such analysis of zzso data from a genetic study of zzso
