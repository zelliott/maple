Fluorescence data of replicate samples obtained from different zzso zzso or by the same zzso but with different instrument settings can have great intensity zzso In order to compare such data an intensity zzso must be zzso Here we explain a simple zzso method for zzso intensity using only the integrated area of a water zzso zzso By applying this method to data from three different instruments, we show that it is possible to remove zzso intensity factors, and we present results on a unified scale of zzso zzso The method presented is a rapid and simple approach suitable for routine zzso with no need for hazardous zzso
