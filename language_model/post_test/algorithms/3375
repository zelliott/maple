zzso methods for interpretation of flow zzso DNA zzso are required for the widespread clinical use of this zzso The usefulness of a zzso analysis technique in this setting requires that it be operator independent, easy to implement in a clinical laboratory, and provide high sensitivity to the desired zzso Additionally, the technique must be tolerant of the relatively low zzso ratios often found in DNA zzso obtained from clinical zzso Among the factors that have been used to assess the zzso potential of tumors are the presence of an zzso population, the proportion of zzso cells, the zzso of the zzso peak, the DNA index, and the fraction of cells in zzso A computer-based method has been developed for extraction of the zzso features from DNA zzso The program detects zzso in the zzso and uses zzso fits to the cumulative frequency distribution to define cell population zzso A test set of 44 zzso compiled from zzso irrigation specimens obtained from patients with a present or past history of transitional cell zzso zzso was analyzed by five collaborating laboratories forming a Network sponsored by the National Cancer Institute zzso This test set was used to evaluate the performance of the computer-based method by comparing results with those of four expert zzso In this preliminary analysis, perfect agreement was found in the detection of zzso cell populations by all observers and the computer-based zzso zzso of percent zzso cell fraction was also zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
