To gain a deeper understanding of the transmission of visual signals from zzso through the lateral zzso nucleus zzso we have used a simple leaky integrate zzso model to simulate a relay cell in the zzso The simplicity of the model was motivated by two questions: zzso Can an zzso model that is driven by a retinal spike train recorded as synaptic zzso zzso but does not include a diverse array of zzso channels, nor feedback zzso from the cortex, zzso and zzso zzso nucleus, accurately simulate the zzso discharge on a zzso zzso zzso Are any special synaptic mechanisms, beyond simple zzso of zzso necessary to model experimental zzso We recorded cat relay cell responses to zzso homogeneous small or large spots, with zzso that was rapidly modulated in a zzso zzso Model parameters for each cell were zzso with a zzso zzso using a short segment of the zzso The model was then tested on a much longer, distinct data set consisting of responses to numerous repetitions of the noisy zzso For zzso cells that spiked in response to a sufficiently large fraction of retinal zzso we found that this simplified model accurately predicted the firing times of zzso zzso This suggests that zzso of the efficacy of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso or depression are not necessary in order to account for the zzso responses generated by our zzso and that zzso zzso is zzso
