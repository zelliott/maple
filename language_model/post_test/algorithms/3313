Many hospitals use the zzso zzso 960 zzso Growth zzso zzso zzso system and zzso zzso to detect zzso zzso zzso in clinical zzso however, zzso zzso methods are used for further zzso species zzso 

To develop a zzso zzso for zzso species identification from zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso tubes were collected and zzso were isolated and identified by zzso zzso The tubes were zzso by zzso duplex zzso chain reaction restriction zzso analysis zzso zzso The results were combined with key zzso characters of zzso isolated from the tubes to develop a species identification zzso with zzso zzso sequencing of the isolate being used as the gold standard zzso 

By zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tubes were correctly zzso into 100 tubes containing zzso tuberculosis complex, 335 tubes containing zzso zzso and six tubes containing zzso A species identification zzso was developed by combining the zzso zzso results of the tubes with growth rate, zzso and two zzso results of zzso recovered from the zzso 

This zzso zzso can be used for zzso species identification from zzso zzso zzso zzso
