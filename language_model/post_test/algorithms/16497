We developed a method in which the relationship between chemical compounds, characterized by the secondary zzso zzso by a standard method, is first determined by network zzso and then the zzso network is divided into the compound groups by network zzso We applied this method to 279 active zzso of factor zzso found by the first zzso A large network of zzso active compounds connected with zzso edges emerged and was divided into 10 zzso Surprisingly, the chemical structures that were common within the zzso but diverse between them, could be zzso The activity differences between the clusters provide rational clues for the systematic synthesis of derivatives in the lead zzso process, instead of empirical and intuitive zzso Thus, our method for automatically grouping the chemical compounds by a network approach is useful to improve the efficiency of the drug discovery zzso
