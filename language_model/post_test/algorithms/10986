zzso reconstruction has recently been revisited as a promising concept for substantial CT dose zzso The purpose of this study was to assess the potential benefit of zzso affirmed zzso reconstruction zzso in head CT by comparing objective and zzso image quality at reduced tube current with standard dose filtered back projection zzso 

zzso reduced dose head CT zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed in thirty consecutive patients and reconstructed with zzso and zzso Images were assessed in terms of quantitative and qualitative image quality and compared with zzso of standard dose acquisitions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In reduced dose CT zzso use of zzso versus zzso resulted in zzso increase in zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso While reduction of tube current was associated with zzso decrease in zzso quantitative degradation of image quality at lower dose was more than compensated through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of image sharpness were comparable between zzso and zzso reconstructions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso change in zzso zzso Compared to standard dose zzso zzso grading of noise as well as overall image quality scores were significantly improved when zzso was used in reduced dose exams zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

At zzso dose reduction, reconstruction of head CT by zzso provides above standard objective and zzso image quality, suggesting potential for more vigorous dose savings in zzso CT zzso
