We introduce a spatial filtering method in the zzso zzso domain for constraining zzso zzso zzso zzso to any zzso zzso region of interest zzso inside the zzso The method relies on a linear transformation of the signal space separation inner zzso that represent the zzso signal generated by sources located inside the zzso The spatial filtering is achieved effectively by constructing a zzso zzso basis zzso that is dependent on the center of the targeted zzso and it does not require any discrete division of the zzso into zzso like the traditional zzso spatial filtering zzso The validation and the performance of the method are demonstrated through both simulated and actual bilateral zzso data zzso
