A zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso phantom exposed to the zzso zzso zzso The models consisted of a 30 X 30 X zzso zzso phantom and a 15 X 15 zzso 10 X 10 zzso or zzso X zzso zzso zzso zzso slab loaded zzso The phantom was either filled with muscle material or with zzso zzso fat on zzso zzso zzso A mineral oil zzso was placed on the zzso model with its integrated water channels parallel to the electric or magnetic zzso The zzso resolution was 3 zzso and the zzso were excited with a zzso zzso The zzso required zzso time steps to reach steady state, with zzso zzso on a zzso zzso zzso in zzso CPU zzso The electric field components at zzso zzso were obtained by summing the zzso zzso at each grid point during each time step and zzso was zzso The results were zzso compared to existing and published zzso heating patterns with good zzso The zzso electric field zzso had provided a three zzso view into the problem space to investigate and understand wave propagation phenomena in complex zzso zzso that were not feasible with experimental zzso
