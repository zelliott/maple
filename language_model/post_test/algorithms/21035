In comparative zzso zzso that sort permutations by zzso are often used to propose evolutionary scenarios of zzso between zzso One of the main problems of such methods is that they give one solution while the number of optimal solutions is huge, with no criteria to discriminate among zzso zzso et zzso started to give some structure to the set of optimal solutions, in order to be able to deliver more zzso results than only one solution or a complete list of all zzso However, no zzso exists so far to zzso this structure except through the zzso of all solutions, which takes too much time even for small zzso zzso et zzso state as an open problem the design of such an zzso We propose in this paper an answer to this problem, that is, an zzso which gives all the classes of solutions and counts the number of solutions in each class, with a better theoretical and practical complexity than the complete zzso zzso We give an example of how to reduce the number of classes zzso using further zzso Finally, we apply our zzso to zzso the possible scenarios of zzso between zzso sex zzso
