Species distribution modeling zzso is an increasingly important tool to predict the geographic distribution of zzso Even though many problems associated with this method have been highlighted and solutions have been proposed, little has been done to increase zzso among zzso We reviewed recent publications applying zzso and found that zzso nine percent failed to report methods that ensure zzso among studies, such as disclosing the maximum probability range produced by the models and reporting on the number of species zzso zzso We modeled six species of zzso from northern Europe and demonstrate that model results are altered by zzso spatial bias in zzso occurrence data, zzso differences in the geographic extent of the environmental data, and zzso the effects of transformation of model output to zzso data when applying zzso Depending on the modeling decisions, forecasts of the future geographic distribution of zzso ranged from range contraction in zzso of the species to no net loss in any species, with the best model predicting no net loss of habitat in Northern zzso The fact that predictions of range changes in response to climate change in published studies may be influenced by decisions in the modeling process seriously zzso the possibility of making sound management zzso Thus, each of the decisions made in generating zzso should be reported and evaluated to ensure conclusions and policies are based on the biology and ecology of the species being zzso
