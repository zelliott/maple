Over the past several decades, economists, psychologists, and neuroscientists have conducted experiments in which a subject, human or animal, repeatedly chooses between alternative actions and is rewarded based on choice zzso While individual choices are zzso zzso behavior typically follows zzso matching zzso the average reward per choice is equal for all chosen zzso In general, matching behavior does not maximize the overall reward delivered to the subject, and therefore matching appears inconsistent with the principle of utility zzso Here we show that matching can be made consistent with zzso by regarding the choices of a single subject as being made by a sequence of multiple zzso for each instant of zzso If each self is blind to the state of the world and discounts future rewards completely, then the resulting game has at least one Nash equilibrium that zzso both zzso matching law and the zzso of individual zzso This equilibrium is, in general, zzso zzso and can be understood as a mutual defection of the multiple selves in an zzso zzso zzso The mathematical assumptions about the multiple selves should not be interpreted literally as psychological zzso Human and animals do remember past choices and care about future zzso However, they may be unable to comprehend or take into account the relationship between past and zzso This can be made more explicit when a mechanism that zzso on the zzso such as reinforcement learning, is zzso Using specific examples, we show that there exist behaviors that satisfy the matching law but are not Nash zzso We expect that these behaviors will not be observed zzso in animals and zzso If this is the case, the Nash equilibrium zzso can be regarded as a refinement of zzso matching zzso
