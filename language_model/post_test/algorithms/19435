zzso treatment planning calculations of the chest wall are complex due to missing zzso the thin chest wall and the presence of zzso The accuracy of calculated dose is dependent on the type of zzso zzso This work evaluates a collapsed cone zzso and a pencil beam zzso zzso model for zzso planning of the chest zzso Various zzso zzso simulating the chest wall have been examined and calculations were compared with zzso with an zzso chamber in zzso zzso water substitute and in zzso lung substitute zzso A retrospective treatment planning study zzso 6 patients was carried out to evaluate the differences in the dose zzso and monitor units predicted by the two zzso The calculated dose in unit density medium was within zzso for the zzso model and up to zzso for zzso In low density medium and under full scatter conditions, zzso overestimated the dose by zzso whereas zzso overestimated the dose by zzso In the zzso zzso geometry with water and lung media, the zzso overestimated dose to the zzso by up to zzso whereas the dose from zzso was within zzso From the treatment planning study calculated monitor units zzso and doses were consistent with the experimental zzso The zzso model is more accurate for zzso treatment planning of the chest wall and especially when there is significant involvement of lung zzso
