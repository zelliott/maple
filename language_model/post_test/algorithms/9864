We explore a number of zzso zzso methods in terms of their ability to identify signatures of biological processes in a large gene expression zzso We focus on the ability of these methods to find signatures in terms of gene zzso enhancement and on the interpretation of these signatures in the zzso Two zzso approaches, zzso zzso zzso and zzso Factor zzso Modeling zzso perform zzso zzso in the strength of the signatures between the samples suggest that BD will be most useful for systems modeling and zzso for zzso zzso
