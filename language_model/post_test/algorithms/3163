zzso of gene expression in zzso zzso zzso remains poorly zzso While over half the genes are estimated to be regulated at the zzso level, few regulatory motifs and zzso regulators have been zzso 

The study seeks to identify putative regulatory motifs in the upstream regions of 13 functional groups of genes expressed in the zzso zzso cycle of zzso Three zzso programs were used for the purpose, and motifs were searched for only on the gene coding zzso Four motifs -- the zzso the zzso the zzso and the zzso motifs -- were identified, and zero to all four of these occur in the 13 sets of upstream zzso The zzso zzso was absent in functional groups expressed during the ring to early zzso zzso For functional groups expressed in each transition, the motifs tended to be zzso zzso motifs in some functional groups showed zzso zzso by occurring at similar positions relative to the zzso start site zzso this increases their significance as regulatory zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso translation machinery zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, occur with striking zzso zzso In the zzso translation machinery group, zzso motifs occur close to the zzso The same motifs were sometimes identified for multiple functional zzso differences in location and abundance of the motifs appear to ensure different modes of zzso 

The identification of zzso zzso zzso upstream motifs throws light on putative regulatory elements for zzso in zzso
