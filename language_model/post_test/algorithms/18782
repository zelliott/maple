The intermediate zzso and small zzso zzso zzso zzso channels in zzso cells zzso zzso vascular diameter through regulation of zzso membrane zzso However, contribution of zzso and zzso channels to membrane current and potential in native zzso cells remains zzso In freshly isolated zzso cells from mouse zzso zzso with 3 zzso free zzso and 1 zzso free zzso membrane currents reversed at the zzso equilibrium potential and exhibited an inward zzso at positive membrane zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and strong inward zzso zzso zzso channels did not affect the membrane zzso However, zzso of zzso channels, zzso zzso and of zzso channels, zzso zzso significantly reduced the zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso channels are zzso zzso independent, zzso and zzso currents decreased steeply with membrane potential zzso zzso of zzso zzso significantly increased these zzso Moreover, zzso reduction of the zzso to 1 zzso caused an additional increase in zzso and zzso currents so that the currents exhibited theoretical outward zzso Block of zzso and zzso channels caused a significant zzso membrane potential zzso zzso 11 zzso and decrease in zzso in zzso arteries in the absence of an zzso These results indicate that zzso can both activate and block zzso and zzso channels in zzso cells, and that these channels regulate the resting membrane potential and zzso calcium in native zzso
