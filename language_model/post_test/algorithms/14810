Critical care units are equipped with commercial monitoring devices capable of sensing patients' zzso parameters and supervising the achievement of the established therapeutic zzso This avoids human errors in this task and considerably decreases the workload of the zzso zzso However, at present there still is a very relevant zzso zzso that is measured and supervised manually by the critical care zzso zzso zzso urine zzso This paper presents a zzso device capable of automatically recording and supervising the urine output of a critical care zzso A high precision scale is used to measure the weight of a commercial urine zzso On the zzso pan there is a support frame made up of Bosch profiles that zzso the scale from force transmission from the patient's bed, and guarantees that the urine flows properly through the urine meter input zzso The zzso readings are sent to a PC via Bluetooth where an application supervises the achievement of the therapeutic zzso The device is currently undergoing tests at a research unit associated with the University Hospital of zzso in zzso
