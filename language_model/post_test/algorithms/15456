A critical step in understanding how a zzso functions is determining which zzso factors zzso regulate each zzso zzso extensive effort has been devoted to mapping zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso interactions have been identified for most zzso by zzso and expression profiling has been done on strains deleted for most zzso These studies revealed that there is little overlap between the genes whose promoters are bound by a zzso and those whose expression changes when the zzso is deleted, leaving us without a definitive zzso network for any zzso and without an efficient method for mapping functional zzso zzso This paper describes zzso a novel zzso that improves the efficiency of network mapping from gene expression zzso zzso exploits a fundamental observation about the nature of zzso zzso The response to zzso or zzso a zzso is strongest on its direct targets and zzso rapidly as it zzso through the zzso Using zzso zzso data, we show that zzso can predict thousands of zzso functional regulatory zzso using only gene expression zzso The targets that zzso predicts for a zzso are at least as likely to have sites matching the zzso binding specificity as the targets implicated by zzso Unlike most zzso targets, the zzso targets also show evidence of functional zzso This suggests a surprising conclusion: The best way to begin mapping zzso functional zzso interactions may not be by measuring zzso We also show that zzso yields new insights into the functions of several zzso zzso including a well-studied zzso zzso and a completely zzso zzso zzso
