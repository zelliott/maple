To determine the effect of age on the thickness of individual retinal zzso measured with zzso optical zzso zzso zzso in a population of healthy zzso 

One hundred and zzso subjects with an age ranging between 18 and 81 years were examined with zzso Mean layer thickness was calculated for seven retinal zzso in the zzso zzso 1 of the 9 Early Treatment zzso zzso Study zzso zzso in the zzso ring zzso regions 2 to zzso and the peripheral ring zzso regions 6 to 9) following automated zzso using the Iowa zzso zzso In addition, mean zzso retinal nerve fiber layer zzso thickness was zzso The partial correlation test was performed on each layer to determine the effect of age on layer zzso while correcting for zzso zzso sex, and zzso image quality factor as zzso followed by zzso corrections to adjust for multiple zzso 

The thickness of the zzso zzso (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso cell layer (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso peripheral inner zzso layer (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso outer segment layer (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso decreased significantly with increasing zzso zzso zzso thickness (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso increased significantly with increasing zzso other layers showed no significant differences with zzso 

Several zzso layers and the zzso zzso thickness showed significant changes correlated with zzso This should be taken into consideration when analyzing zzso layers and the zzso zzso in zzso studies of retinal diseases and zzso
