An zzso based on the Kalman filter and used for tracking a target in a noisy environment has been applied to monitoring the position of moving boundaries as recorded by a video zzso The method, termed the zzso Data Association zzso is zzso efficient, allowing simultaneous monitoring at many positions along the boundary at video frame rates of 25 zzso The present study uses the tracking procedure to investigate and correlate zzso along zzso zzso The procedure is well suited for real time tracking of zzso biological events including the simultaneous monitoring of zzso in networks of blood vessels, the movement of cells or the trajectory of zzso events monitored by zzso fluorescent zzso
