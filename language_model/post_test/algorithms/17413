The visual system zzso information from the left and right eyes and zzso a visual world that is perceived as single and three zzso To understand neural mechanisms underlying this process, it is important to learn about how signals from the two eyes interact at the level of single zzso Using a sophisticated receptive field zzso mapping technique that employs zzso zzso we have determined the rules of zzso interactions exhibited by simple cells in the zzso zzso zzso in relation to the structure of their zzso zzso We find that zzso interaction zzso of most simple cells are well described as the product of left and right eye zzso Therefore the zzso interactions depend not only on zzso disparity but also on zzso stimulus position or zzso The zzso interaction zzso is consistent with that predicted by a model of a linear zzso filter followed by a zzso zzso The zzso zzso is shown to have a shape of a zzso function with an average zzso of approximately zzso Although the initial zzso convergence of signals is zzso the zzso zzso makes zzso interaction zzso at the output of simple zzso This zzso zzso interaction is a key ingredient for the zzso of zzso zzso an zzso for solving the stereo correspondence zzso Therefore simple cells may perform initial zzso necessary to solve this zzso
