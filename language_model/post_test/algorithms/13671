In this paper we present a novel, zzso and memory efficient way of modeling the spatial dependency of measured spike zzso in zzso recordings of zzso zzso We use compartment models to simulate action zzso in zzso and then apply linear source approximation to calculate the resulting zzso spike zzso on a three zzso grid of measurement points surrounding the zzso We then apply traditional zzso techniques and zzso fitting to obtain a compact mathematical description of the spatial dependency of the spike zzso We show how the compressed models can be used to efficiently calculate the spike zzso from a zzso in a large set of measurement points simultaneously and how the same procedure can be zzso to calculate the spike zzso from a large set of zzso at a single zzso zzso The compressed models have been implemented into an object oriented simulation tool that allows the simulation of zzso recordings that capture the variations in spike zzso that are expected to arise between the different recording zzso The zzso simplicity of our approach allows the simulation of a zzso recording of signals from large populations of zzso while simulating the activity of every zzso with a high level of zzso We have validated our compressed models against the original data obtained from the compartment models and we have zzso by example, how the simulation approach presented here can be used to zzso the performance in spike sorting as a function of zzso zzso
