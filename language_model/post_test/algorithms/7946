Phase imaging with a high-resolution zzso sensor is zzso This is based on a zzso lateral zzso zzso mounted on a zzso transmission zzso zzso The measurement technology is explained both in the scope of wave zzso and geometrical zzso in order to discuss its zzso on a conventional zzso In particular we consider the effect of a non zzso coherent source on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso introduced by microscopic beads or giant zzso zzso validate the principle and show the accuracy of the zzso zzso limited images of living zzso cells are then zzso with a particular focus on the membrane and zzso zzso
