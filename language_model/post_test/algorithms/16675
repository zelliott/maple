zzso information is needed to direct zzso zzso efforts to control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complete and correct zzso data is vital to understanding and addressing the multiple drug-resistant organisms in our zzso 

zzso we describe a system that zzso gathers zzso data from the Department of Veterans Affairs zzso network of zzso Using natural language processing methods, we applied an information extraction process to extract organisms and zzso from the zzso zzso We then validated the extraction against independently derived electronic data and expert zzso 

We estimate that the collected zzso data are zzso complete and that zzso zzso zzso was extracted accurately zzso of the zzso 

zzso natural language processing methods to zzso records appears to be a promising way to extract accurate and useful zzso pathogen surveillance zzso Both scientific inquiry and the zzso reliability will be dependent on the surveillance system's capability to compare from multiple sources and circumvent systematic zzso The zzso constructed and methods used for this investigation could contribute to a comprehensive infectious disease surveillance system or other pressing zzso
