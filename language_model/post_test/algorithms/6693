To characterize the zzso growth functions of the zzso evoked compound action potential zzso in pediatric subjects implanted with the zzso zzso zzso array with respect to zzso position and the presence or absence of a zzso zzso zzso growth function data are compared with zzso zzso zzso programming zzso 

zzso growth functions were measured for all zzso along the zzso array in 16 pediatric zzso Nine of the patients were implanted with a zzso zzso whereas seven had no zzso zzso thresholds and growth function slopes were zzso Fifteen of the 16 patients had zzso threshold and maximum comfort levels zzso zzso levels and zzso thresholds were compared within and among the zzso 

zzso thresholds showed zzso among patients, ranging from 178 to 920 zzso at 32 zzso pulse zzso zzso thresholds did not depend on zzso position along the zzso but were lower in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso determined with the zzso versus the alternating polarity zzso revealed moderate zzso zzso zzso zzso Growth function slopes also showed considerable variation among zzso Unlike zzso slopes decreased from zzso to zzso cochlear locations zzso zzso zzso but showed no difference between the absence and presence of the zzso zzso levels in zzso were correlated with zzso threshold zzso When zzso thresholds were adjusted for each patient by the difference between M level and zzso threshold at zzso 9, however, overall correlation between the two zzso was excellent zzso zzso zzso N zzso zzso 

In pediatric subjects with the zzso zzso zzso zzso growth function thresholds appear to decrease with the presence of the zzso zzso but are unaffected by zzso position along the zzso Growth function zzso however, depends on zzso position along the array but not on the presence of the zzso zzso programming levels can reliably predict stimulus zzso within the patients' dynamic zzso but considerable zzso is seen between zzso thresholds and zzso programming zzso
