Selective internal radiation therapy zzso is a relatively new commercially available zzso technique for treatment of zzso zzso zzso using zzso embedded in zzso zzso which are infused directly into the zzso zzso zzso It is zzso approved for liver zzso secondary to zzso zzso and is under investigation for treatment of other liver zzso such as zzso zzso and neuroendocrine zzso 

A modest number of clinical trials, zzso animal studies, and zzso studies have been zzso Here we review several of the more important zzso 

High doses of beta radiation can be selectively delivered to tumors, resulting in impressive local control and survival zzso zzso zzso analyses have shown that zzso zzso cluster around the periphery of tumor zzso with a high zzso tissue ratio of up to zzso zzso is usually mild, featuring fatigue, zzso zzso abdominal discomfort, and slight zzso of liver function zzso 

Selective internal radiation therapy represents an effective means of controlling liver zzso from zzso zzso Clinical trials have demonstrated improved local control of disease and survival with relatively low zzso zzso of zzso for other zzso zzso and in combination with newer chemotherapy agents and targeted zzso therapies are under way or in zzso A zzso team involving zzso zzso nuclear medicine, medical zzso surgical zzso medical physics, and radiation zzso is essential for a successful zzso zzso selection of patients through the combined expertise of the team can maximize therapeutic efficacy and reduce the potential for adverse zzso
