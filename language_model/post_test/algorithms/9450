In this article, the authors demonstrate a rapid zzso method to measure a full three-dimensional diffusion zzso This method is based on a multiple zzso multiple echo sequence and zzso zzso and zzso magnetic field zzso to measure diffusion along multiple directions zzso The pulse sequence was zzso using a well-known linear inversion metric zzso zzso and successfully tested on both zzso zzso and zzso zzso diffusion zzso
