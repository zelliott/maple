The goal of this study is to evaluate the performance of software for automated zzso and in particular the performance of a new tool zzso that recognizes the characteristic texture of particles of zzso As part of a zzso zzso we use human editing that is based solely on zzso images to create final data sets that are enriched in what the investigator considers to be zzso zzso The zzso shell correlation zzso function is then used to characterize the zzso of different zzso data sets that are derived from the same zzso by two or more alternative zzso We find that the zzso is generally quite similar for zzso data sets obtained by the zzso method and by zzso a zzso zzso The zzso characteristics of the zzso method are, on the other hand, significantly better than those of the zzso based zzso that is to say, the zzso approach produces a smaller fraction of false zzso in the initial set of candidate zzso The zzso efficiency of the two approaches is generally within a factor of two of one zzso In situations when it is helpful to use a larger number of templates zzso however, zzso scales in a much more efficient way than do boxing programs that are based on localized zzso
