A zzso model of the human thigh was coupled with a zzso compartment model to simulate the zzso of zzso muscle fibers with a needle zzso For short zzso zzso the specific characteristics of the needle geometry determined the areas of lowest threshold zzso With increasing distance, these areas shifted toward the zzso center of zzso zzso of the zzso model with a 3-D fiber model showed that the assumption of zzso symmetry underlying the zzso model leads to an zzso of zzso For a zzso zzso fiber zzso with 50 zzso zzso at zzso distances between 50 zzso and 1 zzso the zzso threshold ratios were between zzso and zzso for the muscle fiber model, and between zzso and zzso for zzso membrane properties at 20 degrees zzso For both membrane models, the zzso was more pronounced for large fiber diameters and short stimulation zzso zzso results of the zzso model like zzso relations and predictions of spike initiation sites were zzso
