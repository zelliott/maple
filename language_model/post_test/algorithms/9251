Different potential energy functions have predominated in protein dynamics simulations, protein design calculations, and protein structure zzso Clearly, the same physics applies in all three zzso The differences in potential energy functions reflect differences in how the calculations are zzso With improvements in computer power and zzso the same potential energy function should be zzso to all three zzso In this review, we examine energy functions currently used for protein design, and look to the molecular mechanics field for advances that could be used in the next generation of design zzso In particular, we focus on improved models of the zzso effect, polarization and hydrogen zzso
