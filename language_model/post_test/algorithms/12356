Finding zzso coherent regions in images is the basis for many visual tasks, and is especially important for object zzso Human observers perform this task with ease, relying on a system in which zzso processing seems to have a critical zzso Despite many attempts, computerized zzso have so far not demonstrated robust zzso capabilities under general viewing zzso Here we describe a new, highly efficient approach that determines all salient regions of an image and builds them into a zzso zzso Our algorithm, zzso by weighted zzso is derived from zzso zzso zzso for physical systems, and consists of zzso zzso zzso zzso of various sizes, which may or may not zzso are revealed as zzso without zzso their number or zzso zzso using this zzso are markedly more accurate and significantly faster zzso in data zzso than previous zzso
