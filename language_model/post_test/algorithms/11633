zzso warming has gained high acceptance as a measure for the prevention of zzso zzso However, data on heat transfer with lower body blankets are not yet zzso This study was conducted to determine the heat transfer efficacy of six complete lower body warming zzso 

Heat transfer of zzso warmers can be described as zzso where zzso zzso heat transfer zzso h zzso heat exchange zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso temperature zzso between blanket and surface zzso degrees zzso A zzso covered area zzso We tested the following zzso warmers in a previously validated copper zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso and lower body blanket zzso Medical zzso Eden Prairie, zzso zzso zzso and lower body blanket zzso Industries, Orchard Park, zzso zzso zzso and lower body blanket zzso Sub-Zero Products, Cincinnati, zzso zzso zzso and lower body blanket zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and reusable lower body blanket zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and lower body blanket zzso Medical zzso zzso zzso zzso Heat flux and surface temperature were measured with 16 zzso heat flux zzso zzso temperature was measured using 16 zzso zzso was varied between zzso and zzso degrees C and h was determined by a linear zzso analysis as the slope of zzso zzso heat zzso Mean zzso was determined for surface temperatures between 36 and 38 degrees C, because similar mean skin temperatures have been found in zzso The area covered by the blankets was estimated to be zzso zzso 

Heat transfer from the blanket to the zzso was different for surface temperatures between 36 degrees C and 38 degrees zzso At a surface temperature of 36 degrees C the heat transfer was higher (between zzso W to zzso zzso than at surface temperatures of 38 degrees C zzso zzso The highest heat transfer was delivered by the zzso system zzso zzso the lowest heat transfer was delivered by the zzso system with the single use blanket zzso zzso The heat exchange zzso varied between zzso W zzso degrees zzso and zzso W zzso degrees zzso mean zzso varied between zzso degrees C and zzso degrees C for surface temperatures of 36 degrees C and between zzso degrees C and zzso degrees C for surface temperatures of 38 degrees zzso 

No relevant differences in heat transfer of lower body blankets were found between the different zzso warming systems zzso Heat transfer was lower than heat transfer by upper body blankets tested in a previous zzso However, zzso warming systems with lower body blankets are still more effective than zzso warming systems with upper body blankets in the prevention of zzso hypothermia, because they cover a larger area of the body zzso
