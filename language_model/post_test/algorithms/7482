zzso of detecting zzso or effective connectivity from zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso is highly desirable for better understanding the cooperative nature of the zzso zzso connectivity provides specific dynamic zzso information of zzso time series and reflects the directional zzso influence of one brain region over zzso These zzso influences among brain regions are normally extracted based on the concept of zzso zzso zzso the effective connectivity is zzso using zzso zzso zzso modeling with default model order zzso zzso 1, considering low frequency fluctuation of zzso time zzso This zzso although reduces the modeling complexity, does not guarantee the best fitting of zzso time series at different brain zzso Instead of using the default model order, we propose to estimate the optimal model order based upon zzso order distribution to better characterize these zzso influences at each brain zzso Due to sparse nature of brain connectivity networks, an zzso least square zzso zzso zzso is incorporated to zzso modeling to minimize zzso effective zzso zzso connectivity networks zzso using the proposed optimal sparse zzso modeling are applied to zzso zzso zzso zzso identification and obtained promising results, demonstrating the importance of using optimal zzso relationships between brain regions for zzso disorder zzso
