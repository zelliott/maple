zzso knowledge of carbon zzso content in live wood is essential for zzso tropical forest C stocks, yet generic assumptions (such as biomass consisting of 50% carbon on a zzso zzso remain widely used despite being supported by little chemical zzso zzso data from stem zzso of 59 Panamanian rainforest tree species demonstrate that wood C content is highly variable among zzso species, with an average zzso zzso significantly lower than widely assumed zzso Prior published values have neglected to account for volatile C content of tropical zzso By comparing zzso and zzso wood samples, we show that volatile C is zzso and excluding the volatile fraction zzso wood C content by zzso zzso on zzso Wood C content varied substantially among species (from zzso but was neither strongly zzso zzso nor correlated to ecological zzso wood density, maximum tree zzso or demographic traits zzso relative growth rate, mortality zzso Overall, assuming generic C zzso in tropical wood zzso forest C stocks by zzso a zzso margin of error leading to zzso of zzso zzso C zzso in a zzso forest dynamics plot on zzso Colorado Island, zzso In addition to addressing other sources of error in tropical forest C accounting, such as uncertainties in zzso models and zzso zzso compilation and use of zzso C zzso for tropical tree species would substantially improve both local and global estimates of zzso C stocks and zzso
