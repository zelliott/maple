The aim of our study was to derive and to validate the normal threshold for an automatically measured left zzso transient zzso zzso zzso ratio in patients referred for zzso stress zzso zzso zzso zzso and to assess the value of zzso zzso in detecting severe and extensive coronary artery disease zzso 

zzso limits for the zzso ratio were derived using zzso zzso data from 38 patients with a low zzso likelihood of zzso zzso for zzso were calculated on the basis of data from 179 consecutive patients who had undergone coronary zzso less than 3 zzso after index zzso zzso 41 patients zzso had severe and extensive zzso zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso left anterior descending artery or in 2 or more coronary zzso 64 zzso had no significant zzso zzso zzso and 74 zzso had mild or moderate zzso The criteria were then zzso validated in a cohort of 177 patients, of whom 41 patients zzso had severe and extensive zzso 55 zzso had no significant zzso and 81 zzso had mild or moderate zzso 

By analysis of zzso curves, the best threshold for zzso zzso ratio zzso was the mean zzso zzso ratio in the zzso patients + 2 zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio using this threshold demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for severe and extensive zzso zzso and zzso respectively), and similar sensitivity and specificity were observed in the prospective validation group zzso and zzso zzso In the combined pilot and validation groups, the absence of both abnormal zzso ratio and abnormal zzso was highly specific for the absence of severe and extensive zzso only one zzso of 79 patients with severe and extensive zzso had neither of these abnormal findings on zzso zzso In patients with both abnormal zzso ratio and abnormal zzso 55 of 84 zzso had severe and extensive zzso When patients had one but not both of these findings, 26 of 193 zzso had severe and extensive zzso 

The automatically measured zzso ratio is a useful clinical marker that is sensitive and highly specific for identification of severe and extensive zzso in patients undergoing zzso zzso zzso of abnormal zzso ratio into the zzso zzso image interpretation zzso improves the identification of severe and extensive zzso in zzso zzso
