Two zzso source zzso for the inverse problem of zzso currently zzso They involve the reconstruction of zzso zzso or zzso zzso times from zzso recorded torso surface zzso Each of these zzso have their advantages, however, they have not been systematically compared against each zzso We present results from a simulation study which compared a number of zzso potential zzso zzso singular value decomposition zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso zzso time zzso for the inverse problem of zzso A number of different methods were also used to determine the appropriate level of zzso zzso zzso zzso and composite residual and smoothing zzso to apply to each zzso The simulation study was conducted using an zzso based boundary element zzso model with a variety of cardiac zzso zzso levels of geometric error were introduced to the system and solutions were zzso using each of the inverse zzso zzso show that under pure zzso noise zzso methods performed best at low noise levels while the zzso method was less zzso by higher noise zzso In the presence of correlated geometric error, the zzso method out performed the potential methods, with the zzso method being the most favored zzso method when using the zzso or zzso method to determine the zzso zzso
