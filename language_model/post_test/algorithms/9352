The zzso operation of different design concepts for phase change random access memory zzso cell is studied and compared using a three zzso simulation zzso This zzso zzso comprises four interacting zzso which describe the zzso zzso phase change, and zzso dynamics in the zzso devices during the switching zzso The so-called zzso zzso and lateral cell zzso are evaluated in terms of their current requirements for zzso operations, which is one of the most critical issues for an achievement of high integration zzso The advantages of the confined and lateral cell architecture as compared to the conventional vertical cell concept are zzso demonstrating their benefits of advanced zzso management and minimized current defined zzso The simulation results agree well with experimental features of the zzso operation for the zzso design concepts zzso
