We test the zzso of the zzso approximation in zzso theory by contrasting its predictions with those of zzso dynamics simulations in zzso zzso channels and in a realistic zzso zzso zzso of the two theories in bulk situations is demonstrated in a control zzso In simple zzso channels, considerable differences are found between the two theories with regard to the concentration profiles in the channel and its zzso zzso These differences are at a maximum in narrow channels with a radius smaller than the zzso length and diminish with increasing zzso zzso occurs when the channel radius is over 2 zzso zzso These tests unequivocally demonstrate that the zzso approximation in the zzso theory breaks down in narrow zzso channels that have zzso smaller than the zzso zzso
