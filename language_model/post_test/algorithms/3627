The objective of the present investigation was to determine the feasibility of assessing left zzso zzso ejection and zzso filling via the automatic edge detection method employing zzso blood pool zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Thirty-five patients, who had undergone both zzso zzso and zzso equilibrium blood pool zzso by the zzso method zzso zzso were enrolled in this zzso zzso zzso was performed with a zzso gamma zzso From the left anterior zzso projection, data were acquired at 24 zzso cycle with zzso during the equilibrium zzso zzso zzso was conducted utilizing a zzso gamma camera, with 60 projection views over 360 degrees by 60 zzso per view, in 16 zzso zzso In each frame, left zzso volume was determined by automatic edge detection employing a quantitative gated zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso curve was fitted by the 4th zzso of zzso zzso zzso fraction zzso zzso peak ejection rate zzso zzso peak filling rate zzso zzso and mean filling rate during the initial one-third of zzso time zzso zzso were calculated from the fitted zzso These parameters were also calculated with zzso zzso zzso 

Left zzso ejection and filling parameters were calculated by zzso zzso with the automatic edge detection program for all patient zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and 1/3 zzso between zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and filling rates can be calculated using zzso zzso with the zzso zzso These parameters displayed significant correlations with those values obtained via zzso zzso Additional studies are warranted to determine the reliability of parameters with zzso zzso
