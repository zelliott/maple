The determination of the minimum number of individuals can be very challenging, especially in an zzso of zzso bones and isolated zzso zzso in tooth zzso degree of wear, and zzso wear zzso zzso are generally used to associate isolated teeth zzso However, no quantitative method has yet been established for an objective identification and matching of isolated tooth zzso In this study, we analyze the zzso zzso of adjacent zzso zzso (17 zzso zzso applying both qualitative and quantitative methods to test a zzso approach for crown zzso The surfaces of zzso (for zzso and zzso (for zzso zzso were zzso and digitally zzso zzso zzso and two-dimensional zzso outlines of zzso were analyzed using zzso zzso analysis zzso and geometric zzso methods zzso Additionally, teeth were zzso associated by visual evaluation of the zzso outline and by physical zzso zzso results with less than 50% of tooth pairs correctly associated were obtained by using both methods, shape analysis zzso zzso and the visual evaluation zzso assessment) of the zzso zzso The physical matching of the crowns showed highly variable accuracy ranging between zzso and zzso The quantitative zzso analysis of zzso zzso outlines provided the best results zzso of correctly associated zzso but no statistically significant differences were recorded when compared with the manual zzso Since three tooth pairs out of 17 could not be zzso zzso we suggest that the quantitative analysis of zzso should be used only in addition with other zzso
