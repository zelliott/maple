People increase their vocal output in noisy zzso This is known as the zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to measure the effect as a function of the zzso zzso The noise source was generated by using other zzso in the zzso zzso sound levels were measured in a 108 zzso test zzso The number of zzso varied from one to four and the zzso zzso from zzso to zzso A model was introduced based on the zzso sum of the level found in an zzso room plus the increasing portion of noise levels up to 80 zzso zzso show that the model fits the zzso when a maximum slope of zzso zzso per zzso zzso increase in background level is zzso Hence zzso slopes vary from zzso zzso at 50 zzso background level to zzso zzso at 80 zzso In addition, both zzso and the model predict a decrease of zzso zzso per doubling of absorbing area in a room when the number of zzso is zzso Sound pressure levels increase for a doubling of zzso from 3 zzso for low zzso to 6 zzso for dense zzso Finally, there was correspondence between the model zzso and previous zzso reported in the zzso
