zzso zzso zzso therapies are out of reach for most zzso people in developing countries and, where available, they are limited by their toxicity zzso in pregnant zzso and their zzso New zzso agents are needed to combat emerging zzso zzso and reduce the side effects associated with currently available zzso Toward this end, zzso zzso zzso a new zzso molecular zzso and linear zzso analysis zzso were used to discover novel, zzso and zzso lead zzso zzso Two zzso functions were obtained with the use of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso of zzso These zzso molecular zzso were calculated using a weighting scheme that includes four atomic labels, namely atomic masses, van der zzso volumes, atomic zzso and atomic zzso in zzso zzso The obtained zzso zzso models, using zzso and zzso zzso were able to zzso correctly zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the chemicals in training zzso sets, zzso They showed large zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the training zzso sets, zzso The result of predictions on the zzso zzso zzso test also evidenced the zzso and zzso power of the obtained zzso In addition, zzso zzso analyses zzso the statistical quality of these models zzso of zzso and of zzso zzso they were also used to zzso biological activity zzso scores for each zzso On the other hand, a close inspection of the molecular zzso included in both equations showed that several of these molecular fingerprints are strongly interrelated with each zzso zzso these models were zzso using the zzso zzso zzso These zzso functions were then applied to find new lead zzso agents and six compounds were selected as possible active compounds by zzso zzso The designed compounds were zzso and tested for in zzso activity against zzso zzso Out of the six compounds that were zzso and zzso three molecules zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed high to moderate zzso activity at the concentration of 10 zzso other two compounds zzso and zzso showed high zzso and zzso activity at the concentration of 100 zzso and 10 zzso zzso and the remaining chemical zzso zzso was inactive at these zzso zzso Nonetheless, these compounds possess structural features not seen in known zzso compounds and thus can serve as excellent leads for further zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso models presented here can be considered as a zzso system that could potentially significantly reduce the number of zzso and tested compounds and increase the chance of finding new chemical entities with zzso zzso
