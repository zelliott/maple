We zzso a physical energy function for proteins with the use of the available structural database and perform three benchmark tests of the zzso zzso recognition of native structures in the background of zzso decoy sets of zzso zzso de zzso structure prediction using zzso assembly zzso and zzso molecular dynamics zzso The energy zzso zzso is based on the energy landscape theory and uses a zzso Carlo search to find a set of parameters that seeks the largest ratio zzso for all proteins in a training set zzso Here, zzso is the stability gap between the native and the average in the zzso states and zzso is the energy fluctuation among these zzso Some of the energy parameters zzso are found to show significant correlation with zzso observed zzso zzso In the recognition test, the zzso function assigns the lowest energy to either the native or a zzso structure among many decoy structures for all the proteins zzso zzso zzso prediction with the zzso assembly sampling gives structure models with root mean square zzso less than 6 A in one of the top five cluster centers for five of six proteins zzso zzso zzso prediction using molecular dynamics simulation gives poorer performance, zzso the importance of having a more precise description of local zzso The physical energy function solely zzso from a structural database neither zzso sequence information from the family of the target nor the outcome of the secondary structure prediction but can produce the correct native fold for many small zzso
