With increasing popularity of zzso mapping in economically important animals and experimental species, the need for statistical methodology for zzso zzso mapping becomes increasingly zzso The ability to zzso several linked zzso depends on the number of zzso zzso An obvious approach to increase the zzso events is to increase sample size, but this approach is often constrained by zzso Moreover, increasing the sample size beyond a certain point will not further reduce the length of confidence zzso for zzso map zzso The alternative approach is to use historical zzso We use zzso methods to examine the properties of fine zzso mapping using historical zzso that are accumulated through repeated zzso from an zzso zzso We demonstrate that, using the historical zzso both simple and multiple zzso models can reduce significantly the lengths of support intervals for estimated zzso map locations and the zzso of estimated zzso map zzso We also demonstrate that, while the simple zzso model using historical zzso does not reduce the zzso of the estimated additive and dominant effects, the multiple zzso model zzso We further determine the power and threshold values for both the simple and multiple zzso zzso In addition, we calculate the zzso distance and Fisher information for the simple zzso model, in the hope to further understand the advantages and disadvantages of using historical zzso relative to zzso zzso
