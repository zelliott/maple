This article presents a zzso technique for correcting brain tissue distortion on magnetic resonance imaging zzso scans due to stroke zzso growth and for mapping zzso scans to zzso zzso zzso are imposed upon the images for feature zzso and these features are exactly matched in the different images to be zzso while the other zzso are matched by zzso This technique was tested on serial MR images and zzso sections that were acquired in a nonhuman zzso model of zzso This technique was able to deliver satisfactory zzso zzso It is simple and robust and can be zzso in many applications for comparison of zzso medical images and zzso zzso
