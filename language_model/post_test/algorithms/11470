zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso allows us to treat the disease effectively by selective zzso of the zzso at zzso However, the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have not been zzso Our aim was to evaluate the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso including the frequency and location of zzso zzso and their feeding zzso zzso AND zzso Twenty-five consecutive cases of zzso that underwent zzso zzso and zzso zzso between 2008 and 2011 were zzso zzso zzso images of zzso zzso and selective zzso were reviewed with a particular focus on the zzso zzso 

All 25 cases showed zzso with numbers ranging from 1 to 4 zzso zzso zzso The zzso were located at the zzso junction in 16, close to the vein of zzso in 9, at the zzso zzso in 9, inferior to the zzso zzso in 6, at the zzso junction in 5, and inferior to the zzso zzso or the zzso zzso in zzso The SP at the zzso zzso was frequently fed by the jugular branch of the ascending zzso artery and the zzso zzso The SP at the zzso junction and the vein of zzso was fed by the zzso and zzso branches of the middle zzso artery and the zzso branches of the zzso zzso The SP inferior to the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso was fed by the zzso branches of the zzso artery and the zzso zzso zzso All cases were successfully treated by zzso zzso with zzso packing zzso zzso zzso or selective zzso of the SP zzso zzso zzso 

The presence of SP is a common zzso of zzso Identification of the zzso would be useful for their zzso
