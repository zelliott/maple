The apparent zzso material properties of zzso zzso zzso repair tissue were determined for a series of full thickness defects of 1, 3, or 5 zzso diameter, created in zzso regions of 48 canine zzso zzso zzso cell recordings from zzso tests were compared with zzso contact forces zzso using a corresponding linear zzso finite element zzso The spread of cartilage engagement by a zzso ended zzso was modeled by successively imposing an zzso zzso boundary condition at cartilage surface zzso for which zzso zzso surface penetration was zzso For each zzso test, a zzso curve fitting procedure was used to identify a set of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that closely modeled experimental zzso In the near neighborhood of zzso the finite element solutions were found to be much more sensitive to zzso zzso zzso than to zzso permutations, suggesting that perceived zzso increase may be of lesser value as a zzso of repair tissue zzso Compared to surrounding cartilage, the repair tissue for all zzso sizes had statistically significant decreases in zzso zzso and in zzso ratio (much more so for 3 and 5 zzso defects than for 1 zzso zzso The two larger zzso diameters had significant increases in zzso whereas the 1 zzso defects did zzso While the material property deficits were consistent, substantial and comparable to those in other recent animal models of zzso zzso repair, the zzso per zzso of the observed zzso differences was only zzso
