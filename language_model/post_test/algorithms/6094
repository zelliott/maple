zzso changes, especially surface expansion, accompanying flower zzso formation are investigated at the zzso shoot zzso of zzso with the aid of a zzso replica method and a 3-D reconstruction zzso The observed changes are characteristic enough to differentiate the early development of flower zzso in zzso into distinct zzso zzso formation starts from the fast and zzso growth at the periphery of the shoot zzso zzso with the maximum extension in the zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso first becomes a shallow zzso and it is only later that this shape changes into a zzso The zzso is formed from the shallow zzso due to slower and less zzso growth than at the onset of zzso zzso It is proposed that the shallow zzso is the first zzso zzso the zzso of a putative zzso zzso zzso the flower zzso proper, while the flower zzso proper is the zzso formed at the bottom of this zzso At the zzso side of the zzso the second zzso (a narrow and deep zzso is formed setting the boundary between the flower zzso proper and the shoot zzso zzso Surface growth, leading to the formation of the second zzso is slow and zzso This is similar to the previously described growth pattern at the boundary of the leaf zzso in zzso
