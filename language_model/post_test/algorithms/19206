Low energy zzso zzso of zzso radioactive magnetic resonance zzso allows the zzso study of thin film zzso by enabling zzso zzso on a zzso zzso By stopping the probe zzso in a layer adjacent to a layer of interest, it is possible to study magnetic fields zzso Here we show that, in the simplest case of a zzso zzso layer, this yields an zzso in zzso frequency zzso We also discuss zzso contributions to measured shifts for this zzso With a simple illustrative zzso we show how a zzso zzso layer causes a strongly zzso line broadening in an adjacent zzso We then give some experimental examples of resonance line broadening in zzso
