The role of processes in organic and zzso nature that determine the formation of the atmosphere chemical composition and Earth temperature balance was zzso It was concluded that the biological mechanisms of CO2 removal from the atmosphere are insufficient, and there exist potentially hazardous CO2 sources in zzso nature that can be activated upon zzso of the mean Earth zzso It was shown that the stability of natural systems of maintaining the constant chemical composition of the atmosphere is destroyed due to the zzso by man of zzso zzso which may lead to irreversible changes in Earth's climate with the result that the mean planetary temperature would be elevated to zzso degrees C and zzso This would make impossible the existence of life on our planet, at least in its present zzso A zzso model of the greenhouse effect was constructed in the framework of which zzso estimates of the increase in mean planet temperatures for a wide range of changes in the concentration of greenhouse gases were zzso On the basis of the model, an integral model of changes in Earth's climate was constructed, which takes into account the heat inertia of the ocean and zzso zzso of the upper layers of the zzso It was shown that irreversible zzso changes in Earth's climate zzso zzso may occur in a relatively near future zzso zzso
