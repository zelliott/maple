zzso is generally effective for psoriasis but individual responsiveness and optimal treatment duration for disease clearance are zzso However, easy, rapid and zzso plaque assessment by zzso zzso analysis zzso a novel zzso skin imaging technique, may now make prediction zzso 

The early prediction of zzso plaque clearance during zzso by zzso 

Sixteen zzso plaques in 10 psoriasis patients were serially assessed zzso during zzso for zzso dots representing the zzso zzso zzso blood vessels characteristic of active zzso and the results compared with the clinical zzso 

All plaques showing full zzso clearance at early follow-up also showed complete or almost complete clinical zzso and remained the same zzso All showing no zzso clearance at early follow-up showed at most partial clinical zzso and also remained the same zzso All showing only partial zzso clearance at early follow-up also showed just partial clinical zzso but then generally progressed to full zzso and clinical zzso 

zzso of zzso plaques at early follow-up during patient zzso enables good prediction of likely later clinical zzso thereby potentially avoiding unnecessary further zzso A larger zzso study is now zzso
