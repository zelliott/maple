zzso of zzso zzso has emerged as a most promising therapeutic target for the development of zzso zzso In the present study, an in zzso approach using decision tree, random forest and moving average analysis has been applied to a data set zzso of 76 zzso of zzso zzso for development of models for prediction of zzso activity of zzso zzso A total of 46 zzso and zzso molecular zzso of diverse nature were employed for decision tree and random forest zzso The values of majority of these zzso for each analogue involved in the zzso were zzso using zzso software zzso zzso Random forest correctly classified the zzso into active and inactive with an accuracy of zzso A decision tree was also zzso for determining the importance of molecular zzso The decision tree learned the information from the input data with an accuracy of zzso and correctly predicted the zzso (10 zzso data with an accuracy up to zzso Finally, three molecular zzso of diverse nature (including best zzso identified by decision tree zzso were subsequently used to build suitable models using moving average zzso These models resulted in the prediction of zzso zzso zzso activity with an accuracy of zzso High predictability of proposed models offer vast potential for providing lead structures for the development of potent zzso zzso zzso for the treatment of zzso
