We describe a new apparatus for studying trunk motor zzso zzso trunk forces are exerted in any horizontal direction while seated, with or without the pelvis zzso zzso force magnitude and direction are measured using a novel zzso zzso In addition, reaction forces between the zzso and the seat and between each foot and the ground are measured with three force zzso zzso healthy subjects exerted zzso forces in eight directions, with and without pelvis zzso zzso of trunk force zzso was assessed by comparing them with reaction force zzso The agreement analysis showed a small mean bias of the new system of zzso N for force magnitude and zzso degrees for force zzso The trunk force measurement system was sensitive enough to detect effects of movement direction and pelvis fixation on maximum force zzso When subjects repeated the test at a later date there were no significant differences between the two zzso In conclusion, the new device allows measurement of zzso and dynamic aspects of voluntary trunk zzso in multiple directions while seated and provides zzso zzso for application to zzso zzso The method should prove useful for zzso deficits and recovery of trunk motor control following neurological zzso
