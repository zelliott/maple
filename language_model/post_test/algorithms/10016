Phase synchronization zzso has drawn increasing attention in recent years for its extensive applications in analyzing time series observed from coupled zzso In this paper, we examine the detection of zzso in zzso time series from the viewpoints of signal processing and circular zzso Several definitions of instantaneous phase zzso are first revisited and further unified into a zzso which defines zzso as the argument of the signal with a specific zzso filter zzso With this zzso the constraints for zzso definition are discussed and the effect of noise in zzso zzso is zzso The estimate error of zzso which is due to noise, is shown to obey a scale mixture of normal zzso zzso Further, under the assumption that the zzso of zzso error can be zzso by a particular normal distribution, the estimate of mean phase zzso of zzso time series is shown to be zzso by a factor, which is determined by only the level of zzso zzso Finally, simulations are provided to support the theoretical zzso
