The design and performance of guided zzso horizontal surface acoustic wave zzso zzso devices on zzso zzso are investigated for zzso chemical and zzso sensors in zzso Despite their structural similarity to zzso zzso zzso often zzso slightly deeper within the zzso hence preventing the zzso of zzso zzso The device sensitivity to mass and zzso loading is increased using a thin guiding layer on the device zzso Because of their relatively low zzso wave zzso various zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso cellulose zzso or zzso are investigated as the guiding layers to trap the acoustic energy near the sensing zzso The devices have been tested in zzso and chemical sensing zzso zzso design principles for these applications are discussed with regard to wave guidance, electrical zzso of the zzso zzso from the liquid zzso acoustic loss, and sensor signal zzso In zzso experiments, using zzso zzso thickness of approximately 2 zzso mass sensitivity greater than 1500 zzso is demonstrated, resulting in a minimum detection limit less than 20 zzso For chemical sensor experiments, it is found that optimal zzso thickness must be modified to account for the chemically sensitive layer which also acts to guide the zzso A detection limit of zzso (3 zzso zzso zzso or 180 zzso (3 zzso zzso zzso is estimated from the present zzso for some organic compounds in zzso
