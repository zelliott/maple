Clinical findings have limited value in predicting zzso confirmed median zzso at the wrist zzso To determine the value of clinical findings and an automated zzso zzso device zzso in diagnosing zzso we studied two groups of 75 consecutive patients (an initial group and a validation group, 150 total) referred to an academic zzso laboratory for upper zzso zzso The definitive standard for zzso was the zzso diagnosis after formal clinical and zzso zzso The neurologist was blinded to the results of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In the validation group, the zzso yielded a zzso motor zzso zzso in zzso of hands with a conventional motor response, and the correlation of the zzso zzso with the conventional zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso Of 248 symptomatic hands, the neurologist diagnosed 117 zzso with zzso At zzso zzso the zzso zzso had a sensitivity of zzso for zzso Age, body mass index, sensory symptoms in digits 1 to 3, and nocturnal awakening were independent clinical zzso of zzso Each zzso increase in the adjusted zzso zzso was independently associated with an OR of zzso zzso confidence zzso 40 to zzso for zzso Each zzso increase in the zzso zzso was independently associated with an OR of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso for zzso Compared with a model based solely on clinical zzso an zzso including symptom variables plus the zzso zzso had an odds ratio for correct diagnostic zzso of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso The sensitivity at zzso specificity improved from zzso for the clinical model to zzso for the model with zzso A practical method for zzso clinical and zzso findings to assess the risk of zzso was zzso This method correctly zzso zzso of control and zzso patients into very low- and high-risk groups, zzso We concluded that zzso diagnosis is significantly improved with an zzso
