The purpose of this study was to assess the reliability of zzso computer-generated linear and angular zzso produced by different computer zzso and various combinations of zzso projections compared with direct and CT zzso A computer program was written to provide 4 computer zzso and 4 combinations of zzso projections generating 22 linear and 10 angular zzso zzso from 20 zzso A new technique to produce zzso zzso from a single zzso source using a special zzso was developed, and its reliability was zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of a human dried skull were taken both with 20 zzso landmark markers and without zzso zzso zzso tests based on marker position demonstrated reliability of the zzso there were no statistically significant differences in repositioning the skull over time using the zzso at P zzso In the ideal situation, with minimal head rotation and landmark identification error (with the zzso and zzso zzso the average error of linear zzso was zzso 5 zzso and zzso for the angular zzso zzso trials evaluated the errors in head position zzso zzso of head zzso and in landmark identification (by removing all zzso zzso zzso with zzso groupings concluded that the zzso intercept with manual adjustment zzso using the zzso zzso projection provides not only greater accuracy but also clinical practicality for both linear zzso of zzso zzso zzso and angular zzso of zzso zzso zzso compared with direct or CT zzso zzso zzso The effect of landmark identification error was found to be slightly greater than the head rotation error in the accuracy of zzso linear and angular zzso zzso zzso zzso error for linear and zzso error for angular zzso Lastly, this study concluded that linear zzso in the zzso direction were found to have a slightly larger error than vertical zzso zzso zzso have the least zzso
