The objective of this study was to investigate zzso bone zzso of the zzso first zzso with differing levels of zzso attachment under zzso zzso zzso finite element models of the zzso first zzso with differing levels of zzso attachment were zzso The stress zzso and bone density changes were analyzed under zzso loading to simulate the zzso process of zzso bone based on the theory of strain energy zzso The results showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and root zzso areas experienced higher zzso The stresses and zzso of the zzso bone increased zzso to increased zzso zzso zzso in zzso bone density under extreme loading indicated bone zzso The zzso rate was continual with gradual zzso zzso ligament support marginally decreased with an increased zzso rate under extreme zzso Changes in zzso bone density can reflect the zzso process of zzso tissue under zzso zzso The relationship between the change in density and zzso loading during zzso can provide useful indicators into clinical treatment and diagnosis of the zzso zzso
