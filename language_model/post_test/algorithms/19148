A standard goal of many zzso investigations is to obtain enough insight into a zzso behavior that it becomes possible to predict responses to arbitrary zzso zzso have been developed to solve this system identification problem, and the zzso method presented here adds to this zzso zzso and responses, beginning as functions of time, are transformed to zzso functions of both time and zzso frequency, giving zzso and phase at each frequency and time zzso The transformation is implemented by zzso The kernel describing the system is then derived by simply dividing the response zzso by the stimulus zzso The results are averaged over time, incorporating median filtering to remove zzso zzso kernels match well to the actual zzso with little data zzso Noise tolerance is excellent, and the method works on a wide range of kernels and stimulus zzso The zzso is easy to implement and understand, but can be applied zzso
