zzso wave fields in a zzso bulk acoustic wave zzso are studied using a zzso laser zzso The measurement area is extended outside the active zzso region of the zzso so that wave fields in both the active and surrounding regions can be zzso At zzso at which the region surrounding the zzso does not support zzso zzso acoustic waves, the analysis of the measurement data shows zzso zzso zzso fields outside the active zzso area, as suggested by zzso The magnitude of the imaginary wave zzso is determined by fitting an exponential function to the measured zzso data, and thereby the zzso determined zzso zzso is extended into the region of imaginary wave zzso
