In this present article, genetic zzso and zzso zzso neural network zzso have been integrated in order to reduce the complexity of an zzso zzso A zzso identification method based on zzso and optimal design of experiments is described in zzso The zzso model of an zzso ethanol process, represented by a zzso is zzso using zzso and zzso genetic zzso to determine the optimal operational zzso In order to check the zzso of the zzso zzso the results were compared with the zzso of a deterministic model, whose kinetic parameters were zzso determined as functions of the zzso
