In this paper, a neural network approach to task assignment, based on a zzso map zzso is proposed for a zzso system in dynamic environments subject to zzso It is capable of zzso controlling a group of mobile robots to achieve multiple tasks at different locations, so that the desired number of robots will arrive at every target location from arbitrary initial zzso In the proposed approach, the robot motion planning is integrated with the task assignment, thus the robots start to move once the overall task is zzso The robot navigation can be zzso adjusted to guarantee that each target location has the desired number of robots, even under uncertainties such as when some robots break zzso The proposed approach is capable of dealing with changing zzso The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach are demonstrated by simulation zzso
