New zzso acid sequences of proteins are being learned at a rapid rate, thanks to modern zzso The native structures and functions of those proteins can often be zzso using zzso zzso We show here that it is also possible to zzso the zzso and zzso folding properties of zzso given only simple zzso information: the chain length and the numbers of charged side zzso In particular, our model predicts zzso zzso zzso and zzso folding zzso zzso heat capacity, and free zzso functions of temperature zzso the zzso m values in zzso and zzso the zzso phase zzso and the energy of confinement zzso of the protein inside a cavity of radius zzso All combinations of these phase zzso can also then be zzso from that zzso As one zzso we zzso the pH and salt conditions that would zzso a protein inside a small confined zzso Because the model is zzso it is zzso efficient enough that it could be used to automatically zzso whole zzso with protein stability zzso
