In this work, we investigate the use of ensemble learning for improving Support zzso machines zzso zzso which is one of the important direction in the current research of machine learning, and zzso zzso boosting and random zzso are three powerful and popular zzso Researchers have so far shown that the ensemble methods are quite well in many practical zzso zzso However, for zzso heart disease zzso there are almost no studies investigating their zzso Thus, in this study we evaluate the performance of three popular ensemble methods for diagnosing of the zzso heart zzso To evaluate the performance of investigated ensemble methodology, a comparative study is realized by using a data set containing 215 zzso To achieve a comprehensive comparison, we consider the previous results reported by earlier zzso Experimental results suggest the zzso of ensemble of zzso zzso methods, and we also derive some valuable conclusions on the performance of ensemble methods for zzso heart disease zzso
