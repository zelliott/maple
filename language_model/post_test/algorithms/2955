With the increasing use of images in disease research, education, and clinical medicine, the need for methods that effectively zzso zzso and retrieve these images by their content is zzso This paper describes the zzso of a Web-based retrieval system called zzso zzso zzso & Image zzso zzso which permits exploration of a large biomedical database of digitized spine X-ray images and data from a national health survey using a combination of visual and zzso zzso 

zzso is a zzso framework that consists of four zzso a client zzso a zzso an indexing and retrieval system, and a database of images and associated text zzso The zzso system is demonstrated using text and imaging data collected as part of the second zzso National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso zzso zzso Users search the image data by providing a sketch of the zzso outline or selecting an example zzso image and some relevant text zzso zzso pathology on the zzso can be zzso and weighted to indicate zzso 

During the course of development, we explored different zzso to perform functions such as zzso indexing, and zzso Each zzso was tested individually and then implemented as part of zzso To evaluate the overall system, we first tested the system's ability to return similar zzso shapes from the database given a query zzso zzso evaluations using visual queries only (no zzso have shown that the system achieves up to zzso accuracy in finding images in the database that exhibit similar zzso type and zzso zzso feedback mechanisms have been shown to increase accuracy by an additional zzso after three zzso While we primarily demonstrate this system in the context of retrieving zzso shape, our framework has also been adapted to search a collection of 100,000 zzso zzso images to study the progression of cervical zzso 

zzso is zzso easily accessible, and zzso with other complementary information retrieval zzso The system supports the ability for users to intuitively query large amounts of imaging data by providing visual examples and text zzso and has beneficial implications in the areas of research, education, and patient zzso
