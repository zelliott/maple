Slow Feature Analysis zzso extracts slowly varying features from a quickly varying input zzso It has been successfully applied to modeling the visual receptive fields of the cortical zzso zzso experimental results in zzso suggest that the zzso zzso principle is a general learning principle in visual zzso In this paper, we introduce the zzso framework to the problem of human action recognition by incorporating the zzso information with zzso learning and considering the spatial relationship of body zzso In particular, we consider four kinds of zzso learning strategies, including the original zzso zzso zzso the supervised zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the spatial zzso zzso zzso to extract slow feature functions from a large amount of training zzso which are obtained by random sampling in motion zzso Afterward, to represent action zzso the squared first order zzso derivatives are accumulated over all transformed zzso into one feature zzso which is termed the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso feature encodes the statistical distribution of slow features in an action zzso Finally, a linear support zzso machine zzso is trained to zzso actions represented by zzso zzso We conduct extensive experiments, including two sets of control experiments, two sets of large scale experiments on the zzso and Weizmann databases, and two sets of experiments on the zzso and zzso databases, to demonstrate the effectiveness of zzso for human action zzso Experimental results suggest that the zzso approach zzso is able to extract useful motion patterns and improves the recognition performance, zzso requires less intermediate processing steps but achieves comparable or even better performance, and zzso has good potential to recognize complex zzso zzso
