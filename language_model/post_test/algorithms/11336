Planning with forced zzso zzso constraints has been proposed many times over the years, but there are still major difficulties in realizing these zzso in plan zzso In certain planning zzso all the zzso exist in the initial zzso No matter which approach is adopted to achieve a zzso all the zzso should be achieved in a given sequence from the initial zzso Otherwise, the planning may arrive at a zzso For some other planning zzso there is no zzso in the initial zzso However, zzso may occur during the planning process if certain zzso is achieved by an inappropriate zzso This paper contributes to illustrate that it is the zzso constraints among the goal achievement operations zzso of different zzso that introduce the zzso into the planning problem, and planning with zzso is still a challenge for the zzso search based zzso Then, a novel zzso forward search zzso is proposed which can solve the planning problem with different zzso zzso
