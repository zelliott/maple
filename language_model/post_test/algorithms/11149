It is a challenging task to zzso selection intensity and zzso age from population genetic zzso Here we present a method that can efficiently estimate selection intensity and zzso age from the zzso zzso structure in the vicinity of a segregating zzso under positive zzso We use a zzso approach to model the effect of directional selection on the gene zzso of neutral markers linked to the selected zzso The frequency trajectory of the selected zzso follows the zzso zzso Given the position of the selected zzso we propose a simplified zzso zzso model that can efficiently model the dynamics of the ancestral zzso under the joint influence of selection and zzso This model zzso the ancestral zzso of the sample, which reduces the number of states from an exponential function of the number of zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso That allows zzso zzso from data covering DNA regions as large as several hundred zzso zzso sampling zzso are adopted to evaluate the probability of a sample by exploring the space of both zzso frequency zzso of the selected zzso and gene zzso of the linked zzso We demonstrate by simulation that the method can accurately estimate selection intensity for moderate and strong positive zzso We apply the method to a data set of the zzso gene in an African population and obtain an estimate of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso for the selection zzso The proposed method is novel in jointly modeling the zzso zzso pattern caused by zzso and zzso allowing the analysis of zzso data in zzso zzso Moreover, the method is zzso to data from populations under exponential growth and a variety of other demographic zzso
