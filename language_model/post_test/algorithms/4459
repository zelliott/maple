In this paper, a novel dynamic filtering method using zzso zzso filters is proposed to remove noise from ultrasound echo zzso In the proposed method, a mother zzso is first selected with its central frequency zzso and frequency bandwidth zzso equal to those of the transmitted zzso The actual frequency of the received signal at a given depth is estimated through the zzso zzso Then the mother zzso is zzso using the ratio between the transmitted central frequency and the actual frequency as the scale zzso The generated daughter zzso is finally used as the dynamic filter at this zzso zzso zzso zzso is chosen in this paper because its power spectrum is zzso with that of the transmitted ultrasound zzso The proposed method is evaluated by simulations using Field II zzso zzso are also conducted out on a standard ultrasound phantom using a zzso zzso with the center frequency of 5 zzso The phantom contains five point targets, five circular high scattering regions with diameters of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 zzso respectively, and five zzso with diameters of 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 zzso zzso Both simulation and experimental results show that optimal zzso ratio zzso can be obtained and useful information can be extracted along the depth direction irrespective of the diagnostic zzso
