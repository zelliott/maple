We describe and analyze a model for a zzso zzso neural network, in which the randomness in the model zzso to synaptic failure and random external zzso We show that the network can exhibit both zzso and zzso behavior, and surprisingly, that there exists a range of parameters for which the network switches spontaneously between zzso and zzso We analyze the associated zzso model and show that the switching zzso regime zzso to a zzso in the mean field, and that the switches themselves zzso to rare events in the zzso zzso
