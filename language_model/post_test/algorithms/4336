The zzso zzso 500 zzso ago saw a relatively sudden proliferation of zzso zzso and zzso niche structure that continues to zzso evolutionary zzso Here, adapting standard methods from information theory and statistical mechanics, we model the phenomenon as a zzso phase transition, in the context of zzso relaxation of current zzso evolutionary zzso The result is analogous to recent suggestions that multiple zzso of increasing complexity in the genetic code were driven by rising zzso of available zzso free zzso In the absence of severe zzso zzso zzso zzso are standard features of blind evolutionary process, representing zzso in the ongoing routine of evolutionary punctuated zzso
