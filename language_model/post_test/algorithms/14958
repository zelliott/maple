A method for quantitative analysis of channel zzso was established with the use of zzso of channel zzso In this system, channel zzso was expressed as an exponential function of zzso The two factors in this exponential function were independently zzso one was the progressive index number, controlled by membrane cholesterol, and the other was the zzso directed by channel zzso Mean zzso of channel opening decreased depending on cholesterol zzso in the zzso Its zzso nature suggested that cholesterol regulated the channel characteristics in zzso zzso The theoretical formula to analyze channel zzso from the zzso as a function of temperatures, channel and membrane cholesterol zzso was confirmed to be valid by comparison with experimental zzso
