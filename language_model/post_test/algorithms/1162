A wide range of organisms use zzso clocks to keep internal sense of daily time and regulate their behavior zzso Most of these clocks use zzso genetic networks based on positive and negative regulatory zzso The integration of these zzso at the cellular level zzso strong constraints on their functioning and zzso Here, we study a recently proposed model zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso zzso that incorporates just the essential elements found zzso We show that this type of zzso is driven mainly by two zzso the concentration of a zzso protein and the dynamics of an zzso protein forming an inactive complex with the zzso Thus, the clock does not need to rely on zzso dynamics to zzso which makes it especially resistant to zzso zzso can be present even when the time average of the number of zzso molecules goes below zzso Under some conditions, this zzso is not only resistant to but, zzso also enhanced by the intrinsic zzso zzso
