zzso and biological systems are often distributed so that processors zzso jointly solve a task, without any of them receiving all zzso or observing all zzso zzso independent set zzso selection is a fundamental distributed computing procedure that seeks to elect a set of local leaders in a zzso A zzso of this problem is solved during the development of the zzso nervous system, when sensory organ precursor zzso cells are zzso By studying zzso selection, we derived a fast zzso for zzso selection that combines two attractive zzso First, processors do not need to know their zzso second, it has an optimal message complexity while only using zzso zzso Our findings suggest that simple and efficient zzso can be developed on the basis of biologically derived zzso
