Some mathematical properties of zzso of power functions were zzso The size of correlations between zzso (the zzso of the zzso and zzso depends on the choice of unit of measurement of the physical zzso When the mean of zzso of a set of responses is zzso with the zzso the absolute size of the correlation between the intercept and the zzso increases as the geometric mean of the stimulus measures deviates from zzso When the geometric mean is less than one, the correlation is positive, and when it is greater than one, the correlation is zzso Similar trends hold for a zzso correlation between the zzso and the mean zzso of a set of zzso The power of statistical tests of differences between mean zzso also depends on the geometric mean of the zzso Power is reduced as the geometric mean deviates from zzso zzso are illustrated with real zzso
