The acoustic scanner noise that is generated by rapid zzso switching in echo zzso imaging zzso is an important zzso factor in auditory zzso zzso zzso designs overcome the influence of scanner noise on stimulus presentation by acquiring single brain volumes following a silent stimulus presentation zzso However, conventional sparse imaging requires assumptions about the zzso of the evoked zzso response and reduces the amount of zzso data which can be acquired and hence statistical zzso In this article, we describe an zzso silent steady zzso zzso sampling scheme in which we rapidly acquire a set of zzso volumes following each silent stimulus presentation zzso We avoid zzso signal zzso during the acquisition of the zzso volumes by maintaining the steady state zzso zzso with a train of silent zzso zzso zzso during the silent period, ensuring that signal contrast is constant across successive zzso A validation study comparing zzso to conventional sparse imaging demonstrates that zzso imaging provides time course information that is absent in conventional sparse imaging zzso The zzso sequence has a zzso resolution like zzso zzso imaging within a single trial (unlike conventional sparse imaging, where zzso zzso resolution can only be achieved by compiling data across many zzso trials of the same stimulus zzso This zzso resolution within trials makes zzso particularly suitable for experiments in which a) scanner noise would interfere with the perception and processing of the zzso b) stimuli are several seconds in zzso and zzso is expected to evolve and change as the stimulus zzso and c) it is zzso to present a single stimulus more than once (for example, repetition zzso or familiarity effects would be zzso
