Design and implement a surveillance method for locating Aedes aegypti infestation zzso with the use of larvae traps and spatial zzso techniques, which facilitate the ongoing zzso of zzso abundance in the area by counting the individuals collected in the study zzso 

A total of zzso larvae traps were zzso a rate of one per zzso the most densely populated area of commune five of zzso zzso With zzso information on larvae zzso spatial zzso were conducted with the zzso zzso ordinary zzso and inverse distance weighting zzso 

An alternative method for the surveillance of dengue zzso is zzso This method is based on the use of larvae traps and spatial zzso techniques to obtain area maps supported by specific zzso 

The results show that this strategy is better than the zzso normally used, since it zzso continuous zzso of the level of zzso infestation and consequently, the risk of dengue transmission, based on the extent of zzso aegypti zzso Implementation of this strategy is expected to contribute to more effective planning, zzso and evaluation of prevention and control zzso
