An important application involving zzso zzso systems relates to the problem of finding the best statistical strategy for zzso the encounter rate between zzso We investigate the general problem of how the encounter rate depends on whether organisms move in zzso or zzso random zzso By simulating a limiting generalized zzso model zzso zzso mating partner, zzso we find that zzso walks zzso a significant advantage for increasing encounter rates when the zzso is larger or moves rapidly relative to the target, and when the target density is zzso
