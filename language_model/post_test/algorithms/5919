We present a selective spatial zzso zzso that is specifically zzso for zzso and zzso collision detection cases, which are the essential part of interaction modeling in surgery simulation with zzso zzso zzso surgeries demand zzso rate collision solutions only when instruments are involved in zzso Other collision cases can be processed at slower zzso The proposed selective zzso zzso is capable of zzso among various collision cases and assigning different priorities to their zzso Without making assumptions about any object movement, the zzso derives clipping volume as collision detection regions which tightly zzso the objects of zzso zzso of zzso of the zzso in a surgical simulation are zzso
