Improvement of the spatial resolution in zzso zzso zzso zzso by incorporation of the zzso characteristics of the scanner into the process of zzso image zzso 

All zzso were performed at the zzso PET system zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The acquired zzso zzso were sorted into zzso zzso by means of the zzso zzso zzso algorithm, which allows the usage of zzso zzso for image zzso The scanner characteristics were described by a zzso zzso zzso function zzso which was determined from activated zzso line zzso This information was used to model the physical degradation processes in PET zzso during the course of zzso image reconstruction with the zzso zzso zzso To assess the performance of the high-resolution zzso algorithm, phantom zzso performed at a cylinder zzso the hotspot zzso zzso and the zzso Hoffmann brain phantom as well as different patient examinations were zzso 

Scanner characteristics could be described by a zzso zzso with a zzso at zzso increasing from zzso zzso at the center to zzso zzso at a zzso distance of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso into the iteration formula resulted in a markedly improved resolution of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The evaluation of phantom and patient studies showed that the high-resolution zzso zzso not only lead to a better contrast resolution in the reconstructed activity zzso but also to an improved accuracy in the zzso of activity zzso in small structures without leading to an amplification of image noise or even the occurrence of image zzso 

The spatial and contrast resolution of PET scans can markedly be improved by the presented image zzso algorithm, which is of special interest for the examination of both patients with brain disorders and small zzso
