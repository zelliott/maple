For children with zzso zzso heart disease or acute zzso respiratory failure, providers frequently make decisions based on pulse zzso in the absence of an zzso blood zzso The study objective was to measure the accuracy of pulse zzso in the zzso from pulse zzso zzso range of zzso to zzso 

This institutional review zzso zzso zzso zzso study in 5 zzso included 225 mechanically zzso children with an zzso zzso With each zzso blood gas sample, zzso from pulse zzso and zzso oxygen zzso from zzso zzso were simultaneously obtained if the zzso was zzso zzso 

The lowest zzso obtained in the study was zzso In the range of zzso zzso to zzso 1980 simultaneous values for zzso and zzso were zzso The bias zzso - zzso varied through the range of zzso zzso The bias was greatest in the zzso range zzso to zzso zzso samples, median zzso mean zzso accuracy root mean squared zzso zzso zzso were close to zzso in the zzso range zzso to zzso zzso samples, median zzso mean zzso accuracy root mean squared zzso 

Previous studies on pulse zzso accuracy in children present a single number for zzso This study identified that the accuracy of pulse zzso varies significantly as a function of the zzso zzso zzso measured by pulse zzso on average overestimate zzso from zzso in the zzso range of zzso to zzso Better pulse zzso zzso are needed for accurate assessment of children with zzso in the zzso zzso
