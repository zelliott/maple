A novel method for zzso cancellation during zzso zzso zzso is introduced for use in recordings with two or more zzso The method is based on an echo state neural network which estimates the zzso zzso transfer function between two zzso one lead with zzso activity and another lead without, for the purpose of canceling zzso zzso The network has different sets of weights that define the zzso zzso and output zzso of which only the output set is adapted for every new sample to be zzso The performance is evaluated on zzso signals, with simulated zzso added, by determining the root mean square error between the true zzso signal and the estimated zzso as well as by evaluating the dominant zzso zzso When compared to average beat zzso zzso being the most widely used method for zzso zzso the performance is found to be significantly better with an error reduction factor of zzso depending on zzso zzso The estimates of dominant zzso frequency are considerably more accurate for all zzso zzso than the zzso estimates based on zzso The novel method is particularly well suited for zzso in mobile health systems where monitoring of zzso during extended time periods is of zzso
