In this paper, we address the problem of zzso the parameters of zzso mixture zzso Although the zzso zzso zzso yields the zzso zzso solution, its sensitivity to the selection of the starting parameters is well-known and it may zzso to the boundary of the zzso zzso Furthermore, the resulting mixture depends on the number of selected zzso but the optimal number of kernels may be unknown zzso We introduce the use of the zzso of the probability density function zzso associated to each kernel to measure the quality of a given mixture model with a fixed number of zzso We propose two methods to approximate the zzso of each kernel and a modification of the classical zzso zzso in order to find the optimum number of components of the zzso Moreover, we use two stopping criteria: a novel global mixture zzso criterion called zzso zzso zzso and a minimum description length zzso zzso zzso Our algorithm, called zzso zzso zzso starts with a unique kernel and performs only splitting by selecting the worst kernel attending to zzso We have successfully tested it in probability density zzso pattern zzso and color image zzso Experimental results improve the ones of other state-of-the-art model order selection zzso
