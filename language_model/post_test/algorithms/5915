Construction of speed function is crucial in applying level set method for medical image zzso We present a unified approach for zzso and tracking of the high-resolution Chinese Visible Human zzso zzso The underlying link of these two parts relies on the proposed zzso framework for the speed zzso Our proposed method can be applied to zzso the first slice of the volume data, in the first zzso It can also be adapted to track the boundaries of the homogeneous zzso in the following serial zzso In addition to promising zzso results, the tracking procedure shows the advantage of less amount of user zzso
