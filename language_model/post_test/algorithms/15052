zzso chase zzso MR zzso zzso zzso is a recent development that extends the effective field of view for zzso imaging from the typical single zzso zzso to over 100 zzso This technique is well suited for imaging long vascular territories such as the lower zzso zzso chase peripheral zzso zzso is achieved with overlapping zzso zzso scans during the zzso transit of a single intravenous injection of zzso contrast zzso This technique can depict the arteries from the zzso zzso to the zzso in less than 2 zzso The initial experiences with zzso chase peripheral zzso using an automated zzso that controls both table translation and zzso data acquisition are zzso Suggestions for future refinements to the technique are also zzso
