Several approaches to identification of zzso zzso and zzso of patients with enhanced treatment effect have been proposed in the zzso The SIDES method introduced in zzso et zzso zzso adopts a zzso zzso zzso for screening zzso zzso This article introduces an improved zzso zzso search method zzso The zzso method relies on a zzso procedure that first selects a small number of zzso with the highest zzso ability based on an appropriate variable importance score and then identifies zzso with enhanced treatment effect based on the selected zzso The zzso approach helps increase the zzso ratio by screening out zzso zzso We evaluate operating characteristics of the standard SIDES method and two zzso procedures based on fixed and zzso zzso Our main finding is that the zzso zzso method is a more flexible zzso discovery tool than SIDES and it better handles zzso in complex zzso search zzso The methods presented in the article are illustrated using a clinical trial zzso
