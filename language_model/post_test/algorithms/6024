The aims of this study were to zzso image quality for indirect CT zzso zzso versus zzso and to evaluate different image reconstruction parameters for patients with suspected deep zzso zzso zzso Fifty-one patients zzso zzso zzso were zzso evaluated for pulmonary embolism zzso with standard zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso image reconstruction was done with different slice thicknesses and reconstruction increments in sequential and spiral zzso All reconstructions were read for depiction of zzso and to evaluate best reconstruction parameters in comparison with the thinnest reconstruction zzso zzso Image noise and zzso enhancement were measured as objective criteria for image zzso zzso image quality was rated on a zzso zzso zzso dose was estimated for all zzso In sequential zzso reconstruction zzso was completely detected in zzso cases, partially in zzso cases and was not detected at all in zzso cases, and zzso zzso and zzso cases for the zzso zzso zzso zzso was completely detected in all spiral zzso Image noise ranged between zzso zzso Median image quality was zzso zzso effective dose ranged between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in sequential protocols may lead to false negative zzso zzso spiral scanning protocols for complete depiction of zzso are zzso
