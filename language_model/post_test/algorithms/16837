Medical zzso Systems zzso have been suggested as having great potential to improve health care delivery in low resource zzso One of the major barriers for adopting zzso in this context is a lack of adequate zzso zzso zzso zzso Networking zzso is an approach for establishing network connectivity in situations where it is possible to support physical transport of the digital zzso To date most zzso research has been technically zzso and very few services have been implemented to support zzso systems using the zzso It is thus unclear about the potential that zzso may have for supporting zzso systems in low resource zzso The goals of the paper are zzso first, to gain an initial estimate of interest in different services that can be supported by zzso Second, to find out the necessary frequency associated with each service for supporting health work in low resource zzso 

Fifty questionnaires were distributed to attendants at the International Conference on Global Health that had acknowledged having health work experience in a poor connectivity zzso The respondents were using a zzso zzso scale regarding if 9 different potential zzso services zzso be zzso They also were asked how often data delivery would be necessary for these services to be zzso The Chi square was calculated to measure zzso 

37 responses were received, zzso the response rate of zzso The respondents represented having work experience from 8 months to 15 years from 35 resource poor zzso The Chi square test showed very high statistical significance for zzso agree and zzso for the potential usefulness of the proposed zzso services, with a zzso less than zzso The frequency of data delivery that would be necessary for services to be useful varied zzso 

This study provides evidence of potential for zzso to support useful services that support health work in low resource settings, and that services like access to zzso notification of lab results, backup of zzso and zzso are seem to be most important services that can be supported by zzso The necessary frequency of data delivery for each service, will be highly dependent on zzso In a low resource setting with limited mobility, the physical transport of digital data at a frequency of less than once per week should still be sufficient for useful services like notification of lab results and ordering of medical zzso Research comparing different methods for delivery of zzso data should thus be zzso Further research and collaboration between zzso and Computer Science research communities is recommended in order to help develop zzso services that can be zzso Efforts to enhance awareness among zzso about how zzso can be used to support health services should be zzso
