This study examined the effects of a recently developed automated intensity zzso correction on surface zzso images using the orbit as an zzso Images were obtained using a standard head zzso and a range of surface zzso Slices through the zzso nerve head and cavernous zzso were subjected to the correction zzso Blind zzso rankings of the zzso image quality were zzso zzso zzso were taken of the similarity between zzso humor at two depths from the zzso and of the zzso between zzso fat and zzso muscle zzso The combined qualitative ranks for corrected surface zzso images were higher than for the equivalent zzso images in all zzso zzso zzso correction produced statistically significant improvements in zzso surface zzso images, bringing their intensity uniformity in homogeneous tissue to the level of head zzso zzso The zzso quality of the corrected surface zzso images was superior to head zzso images, due to increased spatial resolution combined with improved signal to noise ratio across the zzso
