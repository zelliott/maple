To develop and evaluate image registration methodology for automated zzso of zzso zzso from zzso MR exams during zzso zzso prostate core zzso 

A zzso approach for automated registration between planning and zzso zzso prostate zzso was developed and evaluated on the images acquired during 10 consecutive zzso zzso Registration accuracy was zzso at zzso landmarks and by evaluating spatial overlap for the manually segmented prostate and zzso Registration reliability was evaluated by simulating initial zzso and analyzing the convergence zzso Registration precision was characterized at the planned biopsy zzso 

The total zzso time was compatible with a clinical setting, being at most 2 zzso zzso registration led to a significant improvement in spatial overlap of the prostate and peripheral zone contours compared with both rigid and zzso zzso Average zzso landmark registration error was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso simulating initial zzso resulted in an estimated average capture range of 6 zzso and an average zzso registration precision of zzso zzso 

Our registration approach requires minimum user interaction and is compatible with the time constraints of our zzso clinical zzso The initial evaluation shows acceptable zzso reliability and consistency of the zzso
