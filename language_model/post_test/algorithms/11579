The zzso zzso zzso has been zzso and a second zzso assembly was released 17 May zzso Exhaustive searches were made to identify all zzso genes and zzso from the earlier release of 26 October zzso zzso genes assembled as completely as possible from these data were used to do additional searches of the newer assembly and all zzso genes and zzso in the available zzso sequence data have been identified, compared to human zzso and assigned zzso There are 54 zzso genes in zzso and 1 nearly intact zzso zzso zzso is missing much of its zzso zzso however, 45 zzso genes are completely zzso Eight others are lacking only one or two zzso or zzso zzso is known only from an zzso This may be a 55th zzso gene if it represents an accurate zzso In addition to zzso there are 16 other zzso fragments or small pieces of zzso zzso At the zzso family level, 17 of 18 zzso families are found in zzso zzso is the only zzso family missing and it is not seen in any other fish sequence data zzso The zzso family shows the largest degree of zzso In the zzso family, only zzso and zzso are zzso as recognizable zzso across zzso zzso boundaries are largely preserved across zzso million years of zzso
