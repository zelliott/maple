zzso zzso have become an important class of materials for electronic zzso Design of these devices requires understanding such processes as zzso zzso spatial dynamics of zzso and energy and charge zzso which in turn involve complex coupled zzso zzso Here we study zzso zzso dynamics in the zzso zzso by using a zzso method suitable for the simulation of zzso molecular dynamics in extended molecular systems with sizes up to hundreds of zzso The method is based on the zzso propagation of the zzso and transition zzso density zzso along the zzso The simulations reveal formation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso bound zzso with a typical period of 34 zzso and allows us to identify specific slow and fast nuclear motions strongly coupled to the electronic degrees of zzso The effect of chain imperfections and chemical defects on the dynamics is also zzso A complementary two-dimensional analysis of corresponding transition density zzso provides an efficient way to monitor zzso zzso zzso of the zzso by identifying the underlying changes in charge zzso and bond zzso zzso correlated electronic and zzso zzso signatures of zzso zzso are predicted, and zzso to energy zzso in complex zzso are zzso
