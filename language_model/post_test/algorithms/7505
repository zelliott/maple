An approach to study population differences in cerebral zzso is zzso This is done by zzso extending the concept of zzso cerebral blood vessel networks as spatial zzso and zzso zzso graph similarity in a zzso zzso zzso zzso We argue that zzso graph zzso with information about their proximity to selected brain structures adds zzso information and consequently leads to a more expressive zzso Using zzso then allows us to zzso graph similarity in a zzso zzso To demonstrate our approach, we assess the hypothesis that gender differences manifest as variations in the architecture of cerebral blood vessels, an observation that previously had only been tested and confirmed for the Circle of zzso Our results strongly support this hypothesis, zzso we can demonstrate zzso statistically significant zzso from random gender zzso in a zzso setup on 40 healthy zzso
