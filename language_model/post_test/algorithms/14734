Stereo matching is an open problem in computer vision, for which local features are extracted to identify corresponding points in pairs of zzso The results are heavily dependent on the initial zzso We apply image decomposition in zzso levels, for reducing the search space, zzso time, and zzso We propose a solution to the problem of how deep zzso should the stereo measures start, trading between error zzso and time consumption, by starting stereo calculation at varying resolution levels, for each zzso according to fuzzy zzso Our zzso enhances the overall execution time since it only employs deeper resolution levels when strictly zzso It also reduces errors because it measures similarity between windows with enough zzso We also compare our zzso with a very fast zzso approach, and one based on fuzzy zzso Our zzso performs faster and/or better than all those approaches, zzso thus, a good candidate for robotic vision zzso We also discuss the system architecture that efficiently zzso our zzso
