An important issue in stem cell biology is to understand how to direct differentiation towards a specific cell zzso To zzso the zzso previous studies have focused on identifying the responsible gene regulators, which have, however, failed to provide a systemic view of regulatory zzso To obtain a unified description of the regulatory zzso we characterized major stem cell species by employing a zzso zzso variable model zzso The zzso method allowed us to zzso the cell zzso zzso factors, using zzso sequences as well as expression zzso 

We used a list of genes enriched in each of 21 stem cell zzso and their upstream zzso zzso The zzso study allowed us to uncover the regulatory zzso for each stem cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the proliferation phase, and zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso Furthermore, the identities of the stem cell clusters were well revealed by the constituent genes that were directly targeted by the zzso zzso our zzso framework was demonstrated to be useful through a detailed case study of stem cell differentiation and can be applied to problems with similar zzso
