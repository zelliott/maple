The performance of zzso ceramic filters for zzso zzso at high temperatures was evaluated in this zzso The filtering structure was composed of two zzso a thin zzso membrane deposited on a zzso ceramic support of high zzso The goal was to minimize the high pressure drop inherent of zzso structures, without decreasing their high collection efficiency for small zzso The zzso support was developed using the technique of ceramic replication of zzso foam zzso of 45 and 75 pores per inch zzso The filtering membrane was prepared by zzso a thin layer of zzso zzso paste on one face of the zzso zzso had their zzso and fractional collection efficiency analyzed for zzso of an airborne suspension of zzso rock in temperatures ranging from ambient to 700 degrees zzso zzso revealed that collection efficiency decreased with gas temperature and was enhanced with zzso zzso Also, the support layer influenced the collection zzso the 75 zzso support was more effective than the 45 zzso zzso collection efficiency dropped considerably for particles below 2 zzso in zzso The maximum collection occurred for particle diameters of approximately 3 zzso and decreased again for diameters between 4 and 8 zzso Such trend was successfully represented by the proposed zzso which is based on the classical mechanisms acting on particle zzso zzso zzso seems to be the zzso collection zzso with particle zzso acting as detachment zzso
