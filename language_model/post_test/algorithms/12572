Analysis of motion patterns is an effective approach for anomaly detection and behavior zzso Current approaches for the analysis of motion patterns depend on known scenes, where objects move in zzso zzso It is highly desirable to automatically construct object motion patterns which reflect the knowledge of the zzso In this paper, we present a system for automatically learning motion patterns for anomaly detection and behavior prediction based on a proposed zzso for robustly tracking multiple zzso In the tracking algorithm, foreground zzso are clustered using a fast accurate fuzzy zzso zzso Growing and prediction of the cluster zzso of foreground zzso ensure that each cluster zzso is associated with a moving object in the zzso In the zzso for learning motion patterns, zzso are clustered zzso using spatial and zzso information and then each motion pattern is represented with a chain of zzso zzso Based on the learned statistical motion patterns, statistical methods are used to detect anomalies and predict zzso Our system is tested using image sequences acquired, respectively, from a crowded real traffic scene and a model traffic zzso Experimental results show the zzso of the tracking algorithm, the efficiency of the zzso for learning motion patterns, and the encouraging performance of zzso for anomaly detection and behavior zzso
