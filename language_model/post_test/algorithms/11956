The zzso approach to modeling of the plant cover dynamics is zzso This approach takes into account that the cover consists of individual interacting plants, zzso is a zzso According to the principle of zzso angle of zzso this approach can be considered as approaching the object earlier considered from the energy standpoint zzso and zzso 1953; zzso zzso An element of the model of community, balance model of plant zzso was considered in part I of the zzso The community model is zzso zzso it considers the growth and dying of plants in relation to their mutual geometrical arrangement in the zzso zzso of division and zzso of the territory among the plants of community are important elements of the community zzso These mechanisms use the zzso zzso Some results of the development and analysis of the model of community are considered, such as the possibility of zzso competition in homogeneous communities and zzso rule considered as zzso of the most general principles of plant population zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso approach to modeling can be an effective tool for analysis of the influence of many zzso features of the community structure on its zzso zzso
