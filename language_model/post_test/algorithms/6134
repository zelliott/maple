We describe a novel statistical scoring method based on a zzso geometry approach to predict the functional impact zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso domain zzso of the tumor zzso zzso which is the most frequently zzso gene in human zzso zzso scores zzso for each zzso were calculated to reflect differences in the compositional preferences of four zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso The zzso were then combined into a residual score profile zzso representing the zzso values for all zzso zzso in the zzso zzso were grouped into functional categories based on their zzso activities zzso measured in zzso functional zzso using zzso elements from eight different zzso While these functional categories showed significant differences in average zzso the latter lacked resolution power to predict the zzso activities of individual zzso In contrast, using decision tree models, we found that the zzso predicted zzso with an accuracy varying between zzso and zzso depending on the zzso Lastly, we used the best model to predict the functional outcome of all zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso and compared the predictions with their frequency of occurrence in human zzso We found that zzso predicted as functional zzso accounted for approximately zzso of all zzso zzso found in zzso while zzso predicted as zzso zzso represented approximately zzso of the zzso These results show that this zzso approach provides a fast and reliable method for predicting the functional impact of zzso zzso associated with zzso
