An zzso approach was achieved for fitting zzso linear functions to zzso responses of biological zzso This zzso is used to estimate the parameters of the two (or more) zzso functions and the separation zzso zzso zzso by statistical zzso Although it is often unknown whether the response of a biological variable is adequately described by one zzso zzso function or by zzso linear zzso zzso with separation zzso an F test is proposed to determine whether one zzso line is the optimal fitted zzso A zzso program has been developed for zzso the optimal parameters and the coordinates of the separation zzso A few sets of data illustrating this kind of problem in the analysis of zzso zzso and the zzso responses are zzso
