We introduce a three-dimensional zzso zzso active zzso zzso for the shape zzso of DNA molecules from stereo zzso zzso We estimate the shape by matching the projections of a 3-D global shape model with the zzso we choose the global model as a 3-D filament with a zzso skeleton and a specified zzso zzso The active zzso zzso zzso updates the zzso zzso which requires us to evaluate the projections and match them with the zzso at every zzso Since the evaluation of the projections of the global model is zzso expensive, we propose a fast zzso based on locally zzso it by zzso zzso zzso We introduce the concept of zzso and derive a zzso zzso zzso Since the two-dimensional projections of such a blob at any 3-D orientation can be expressed as a linear combination of a few basis functions, matching the projections of such a 3-D template involves evaluating a weighted sum of inner products between the basis functions and the zzso The weights are simple functions of the 3-D orientation and the zzso are evaluated efficiently by zzso zzso We choose an internal energy term that penalizes the average zzso zzso Since the exact length of the DNA zzso is known a zzso we introduce a constraint energy term that forces the curve to have this specified zzso The sum of these energies along with the image energy derived from the matching process is minimized using the zzso zzso zzso We validate the zzso using real, as well as zzso data and show that it performs zzso
