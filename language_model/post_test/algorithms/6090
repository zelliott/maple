Using the zzso image processing software environment, we developed a software-based system capable of zzso zzso size from skin prick tests zzso in zzso for research and routine zzso 

At 20 zzso the outlines of up to 20 zzso were marked with a pen and transferred with translucent adhesive tapes to a white paper form carrying zzso zzso The form was scanned at 200 zzso The software automatically zzso the scanned image and calculated the sizes of the zzso In a pilot study, serial zzso with zzso in increasing zzso were performed in 12 healthy volunteers in duplicate on both zzso zzso We matched the application results with a reference created from the scanned zzso 

zzso analysis showed reference and software calculation reaching very high zzso The comparison of zzso resulted in a low zzso zzso of variation zzso of zzso This was superior to the conventional measurement of horizontal zzso zzso or zzso diameter zzso zzso 

We present an accurate tool for exactly calculating zzso zzso size in zzso
