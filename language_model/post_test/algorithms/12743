zzso shift zzso is an important quantitative feature for evaluating severity of brain zzso by various zzso including traumatic zzso zzso In this study, we sought to determine the accuracy and the zzso value of our computer zzso that automatically measures the zzso of the brain on zzso zzso zzso images in patients with head zzso 

zzso the zzso zzso into three zzso we had designed an zzso to estimate the zzso zzso We zzso applied our zzso to the initial CT images of 53 patients with head injury to determine the automated zzso zzso and validated it against that measured by human zzso Both zzso were separately used to predict the neurological outcome of the zzso 

The zzso ranged from 0 to 30 zzso It was greater than 5 zzso in images of 17 patients zzso In 49 images zzso the difference between zzso and zzso was zzso zzso To detect zzso zzso zzso our zzso achieved sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso For mortality zzso zzso was no worse than zzso 

In zzso automated zzso was accurate and predicted outcome as well as that measured zzso This approach might be useful in constructing a fully automated zzso diagnosis zzso
