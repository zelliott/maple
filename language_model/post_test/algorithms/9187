A small detector or limited zzso rotation angles may cause data zzso in which case the entire object cannot be completely zzso However, a small region of interest zzso may be zzso in certain zzso zzso Two zzso methods have been proposed for exact zzso zzso Here we evaluate the capability of zzso reconstruction using an zzso zzso zzso method, which directly zzso the inverse problem of the system zzso zzso reconstruction using the zzso method is compared with that using the two zzso zzso Comparisons are based on reconstructions of four specifically zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso each reconstructed zzso is coupled with its counterpart in the zzso case to evaluate the accuracy of the reconstructed zzso We found that, zzso in two zzso situations the zzso can be reconstructed by both the zzso methods and the two-dimensional zzso method, but the zzso method may produce a larger zzso zzso for a zzso case zzso zzso that neither zzso zzso is zzso the zzso method provides a quantitative zzso zzso and zzso for the well-known zzso zzso problem, neither the zzso methods nor the zzso method can perform an exact zzso zzso but the zzso method provides zzso zzso zzso We also propose an analysis using the truncated projection zzso and its zzso inverse zzso which can help to determine the zzso zzso using zzso methods for a given zzso zzso
