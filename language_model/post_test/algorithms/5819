This paper examines the usefulness of zzso zzso in a zzso feedback loop that adjusts the difficulty of an upper zzso rehabilitation zzso zzso zzso zzso rate, skin zzso zzso and skin zzso were used both by themselves and in combination with task performance and zzso Data fusion was performed with zzso analysis, and a special zzso version was implemented that can gradually adapt to a zzso Both healthy subjects and zzso patients participated in the zzso The accuracy of the zzso controller was defined as the percentage of times it matched the subjects' zzso The highest accuracy rate was obtained for task performance zzso zzso for both healthy subjects and zzso with zzso zzso yielding relatively low accuracy zzso zzso The zzso approach increased accuracy of zzso zzso to zzso for healthy subjects and zzso for zzso Combining zzso with task performance yielded an accuracy rate of zzso for healthy subjects and zzso for zzso zzso suggest that zzso zzso are not reliable as a primary data source in motor rehabilitation, but can provide supplementary zzso However, it is questionable whether the amount of additional information justifies the increased complexity of the zzso
