Renal sympathetic nerve activity zzso recorded from the zzso preparation is a continuously fluctuating variable in terms of period and zzso reflecting a coordinated zzso level of output from the zzso zzso Yet current methods of analysis cannot simultaneously measure both of these zzso A new accurate technique for assessing changes in global sympathetic activity is zzso We made a novel application of a computerized peak detection zzso zzso zzso to recordings of synchronized sympathetic nerve zzso The procedure was applied to this new area to retrieve information about the characteristics of synchronized zzso zzso in synchronized zzso activity were detected from short-term (20 zzso integrated recordings in which zzso changes had been digitized at 200 zzso and stored on zzso The program scanned the data series for significant increases followed by significant decreases in a small cluster of zzso zzso The program permits the input of the cluster sample sizes for the test zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and also the minimum height to be defined as a zzso Once each synchronized zzso peak had been zzso its corresponding zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso The program successfully characterized zzso in a group of eight cats and yielded results comparable to other analysis zzso The zzso zzso period showed two modes of synchronized zzso one related to the cardiac cycle and a faster 8- to zzso zzso The synchronized peak zzso and zzso showed zzso frequency zzso The relationship between each of the three variables was zzso only the peak height and zzso were significantly related to each zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
