Little is known about the risk of progression to hazardous alcohol use in people currently drinking at safe zzso We aimed to develop a prediction model zzso for the development of hazardous drinking in safe zzso 

A prospective cohort study of adult general practice attendees in six European countries and Chile followed up over 6 zzso We recruited zzso attendees between April 2003 to February zzso zzso European and zzso Chilean attendees recorded zzso scores below 8 in men and 5 in women at recruitment and were used in zzso zzso 38 risk factors were measured to construct a risk model for the development of hazardous drinking using zzso zzso zzso The model was corrected for over fitting and tested in an external zzso The main outcome was hazardous drinking defined by an zzso score zzso in men and zzso in zzso 

zzso of attendees were zzso of whom zzso participated again after six zzso The risk factors in the final zzso model were sex, age, country, baseline zzso score, panic syndrome and lifetime alcohol zzso The zzso zzso average zzso across all six European countries was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso g effect size for the difference in log odds of predicted probability between safe drinkers in Europe who subsequently developed hazardous alcohol use and those who did not was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso External validation of the zzso in Chilean safe drinkers resulted in a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso g of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso risk model for development of hazardous consumption in safe drinkers compares zzso with risk zzso for disorders in other medical settings and can be a useful first step in prevention of alcohol zzso
