In order to fully uncover the information potentially available in the zzso zzso we model it as a zzso zzso zzso To zzso the model, we do not apply any form of zzso or zzso reduction, and solve the problem of zzso using sparse zzso We find that only a few small clusters (with average size of zzso zzso are useful in predicting the activity of other zzso and demonstrate remarkable consistency within a subject as well as across multiple zzso Moreover, we find that: zzso the areas that can predict activity of other zzso are consistent with previous results related to networks activated by the specific zzso task, as well as networks related to the default mode zzso zzso there is a global zzso state dominated by two prominent (although not zzso streams, originating in the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso these zzso span default mode and zzso networks, and interact in several regions, notably the zzso and zzso the zzso zzso is a central zzso of the default mode network, in terms of its ability to determine the future evolution of the rest of the zzso
