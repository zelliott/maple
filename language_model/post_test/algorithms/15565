zzso electron zzso rocking zzso zzso from inclined planes in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso display a significant asymmetry around the Bragg zzso zzso and zzso calculations of the rocking zzso show that such an asymmetry can be attributed to the zzso of coherent zzso surface layers implanted with zzso zzso The surface layers are characterized with two zzso their zzso h and the strain component zzso zzso normal to the thin foil zzso The zzso rocking curve asymmetry is zzso for sufficiently high values of h zzso approximately 2 zzso to strongly depend on zzso zzso which is directly related to the density of implanted zzso atoms in the surface zzso zzso also show that a significant rocking curve asymmetry is only observed for intermediate values of zzso zzso of about a few percentage zzso
