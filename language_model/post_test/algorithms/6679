A hearing aid zzso zzso is presented that uses a richer representation of the sound environment than previous zzso The proposed zzso is designed to zzso adapt slowly (in approximately 10 zzso between different listening zzso zzso when the user leaves a single zzso lecture for a zzso zzso zzso switch rapidly (about 100 zzso between different dominant sound sources within one listening situation, such as the change from the user's own voice to a distant speaker's voice in a quiet conference room; zzso instantly reduce gain for strong transient sounds and then quickly return to the previous gain setting; and zzso not change the gain in silent pauses but instead keep the gain setting of the previous sound zzso An acoustic evaluation showed that the zzso worked as zzso The zzso was evaluated together with a reference zzso in a pilot field zzso When evaluated by nine users in a set of speech recognition tests, the zzso showed similar results to the reference zzso
