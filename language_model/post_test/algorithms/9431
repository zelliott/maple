zzso of liquids into zzso zzso zzso has been a challenging task due to production limitations stemming from solution zzso phase stabilization, molecular zzso and zzso zzso We report an extension of Precision zzso zzso zzso technology for the production of zzso liquid-filled zzso containing an oil or zzso core and contrast these results to zzso zzso 

zzso technology zzso a zzso zzso to produce a liquid core jet surrounded by a zzso zzso jet, which is further zzso by a zzso carrier zzso typically zzso zzso zzso alcohol in zzso Jet diameters are controlled by the zzso flow rate of each zzso The compound jet is then disrupted into uniform zzso droplets via a zzso acoustic wave and shell material is hardened by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a narrow size distribution and the formation of a continuous shell leading to efficient zzso of various liquid zzso The intermingling of core and shell zzso and the zzso of different molecular zzso zzso zzso and zzso labeled zzso to the core or shell phase provided additional evidence of phase separation and molecular zzso zzso We also demonstrate the zzso release of bovine serum zzso zzso in an zzso zzso 

zzso technology provided exceptional control of the overall size and shell thickness of zzso filled with various types of oil or zzso This technique may enable advanced delivery profiles of pharmaceuticals or zzso
