The temperature dependence of electron transport through zzso II zzso measured as oxygen evolution, was investigated in zzso zzso zzso with white light of 450 zzso of zzso zzso zzso The experiments were performed in zzso conditions at temperatures between 273 and zzso zzso The results show zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of oxygen zzso The experimental data was examined with the Marcus theory of electron transfer modified to take into account the oxygen evolution zzso For this purpose, the Gibbs free energy of zzso of the electron transfer reaction, zzso is replaced in the classical Marcus equation with the expression zzso - zzso where zzso and zzso are respectively the zzso and zzso of zzso and T is the temperature in zzso The result of the derivation is a zzso of zzso zzso functions, or states, zzso zzso 69 250 zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso 1), where zzso is expressed in zzso oxygen zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is the electronic zzso zzso element between electron donor zzso and zzso zzso wave functions, zzso the reorganization free energy, zzso the zzso constant, zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is the standard zzso of the zzso zzso The mathematical simulations revealed the presence of six zzso zzso or zzso bands with zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The resolution of the zzso bands is about zzso zzso to multiple band zzso The theoretical analyses showed that zzso the oxygen evolution in zzso is essentially dependent on zzso in the zzso term of the modified Marcus equation zzso 1), and zzso the reorganization energy, zzso decreases zzso with increasing temperature, and is also dependent on the electron zzso zzso It is concluded that the temperature dependence of the large enhancement of oxygen evolution observed in this work zzso at least partly, in zzso structural zzso in the zzso II reaction zzso
