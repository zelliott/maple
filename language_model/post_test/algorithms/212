The present report describes the development of a technique for automatic zzso recognition in digitally recorded lung zzso This method is based on the extraction and processing of spectral information from the respiratory cycle and the use of these data for user feedback and automatic zzso The respiratory cycle is first zzso in order to zzso its spectral information, and its zzso is then zzso After this zzso the zzso image is processed by a two-dimensional zzso filter and a zzso in order to increase the contrast and isolate its highest zzso zzso zzso Thus, in order to generate more compressed data to automatic recognition, the spectral projection from the processed zzso is zzso and stored as an zzso The higher magnitude values of the array and its respective spectral values are then located and used as zzso to a zzso zzso artificial neural network, which results an automatic indication about the presence of zzso For validation of the methodology, lung sounds recorded from three different zzso were zzso The results show that the proposed technique achieves zzso accuracy in the detection of zzso for an isolated respiratory cycle and zzso accuracy for the detection of zzso when detection is carried out using groups of respiratory cycles obtained from the same zzso Also, the system presents the original recorded sound and the zzso zzso image for the user to draw his own conclusions from the zzso
