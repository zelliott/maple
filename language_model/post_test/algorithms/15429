We present a novel image analysis tool that allows the zzso zzso of complex root system zzso in a range of plant species grown and zzso in a variety of zzso The automatic component of zzso takes a zzso approach, utilizing the powerful expectation zzso zzso zzso to examine regions of the input image, calculating the likelihood that given zzso zzso to zzso This information is used as the basis for an zzso approach to root detection and zzso which effectively fits a root model to the image zzso The resulting user experience is akin to defining routes on a zzso satellite navigation system: zzso makes an initial zzso estimate of paths from the seed point to root zzso and the user is able to easily and intuitively refine the results using a visual zzso The proposed method is evaluated on winter wheat zzso zzso images (and demonstrated on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and rice zzso zzso and results are compared with manual zzso Four zzso traits are calculated and show clear illustrative differences between some of the wheat zzso zzso however, provides the structural information needed to support extraction of a wider variety of biologically relevant zzso A separate viewer tool is provided to recover a rich set of architectural traits from zzso core zzso
