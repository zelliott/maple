We propose a method of correction for multiple comparisons in zzso zzso based zzso zzso zzso zzso We introduce a modification to the zzso zzso in which zzso weights and zzso of zzso change are zzso in distinct zzso This approach allows the calculation of image zzso based on the zzso weights zzso In the first instance we estimate image zzso by looking at local spatial correlations in residual images generated using random zzso we then go on to show how the zzso of the zzso can be obtained zzso by measuring the correlations between the adjacent weight zzso In simulations we show that the zzso of the zzso is highly zzso and depends on the source zzso We show that, for the minimum zzso zzso knowledge of image zzso is sufficient to allow for correction of the multiple comparison zzso zzso threshold estimates, based on the zzso extent (or cluster zzso in flattened space, provide accurate corrected false positive error rates for these highly zzso smooth zzso
