The goal of the present work was to examine the zzso behavior of zzso scale packed zzso beds during long-term cyclical operation at high loads using an experimental zzso with a high resolution measuring device of bed zzso One zzso zzso and one zzso zzso were examined in a 140 zzso zzso Both zzso exhibited zzso behavior during zzso zzso The zzso were less pronounced with decreasing zzso stress zzso The occurrence of zzso was an indication for zzso memory behavior of the zzso zzso During long-term cyclical operation at high loads of the column filled with zzso zzso zzso of the steadily with time decreasing flow rate were observed for the first zzso These zzso were attributed to the zzso of the zzso particles network representing a system with materials with fading zzso Such zzso systems with zzso are known to exhibit inherent zzso A decoupling of the two processes of bed zzso and decrease of bed zzso was zzso The presented results explain why zzso zzso zzso often yields unsatisfactory zzso data and why unwanted phenomena like medium wall detachment or other symptoms of deteriorated zzso beds are frequently zzso
