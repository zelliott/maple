To understand most cellular zzso one must understand how genetic information is zzso A formidable challenge is the dissection of gene regulatory networks to delineate how zzso cells coordinate and govern patterns of gene expression that ultimately lead to a zzso In this paper, we review several approaches for modeling zzso gene regulatory networks and for reverse engineering such networks from experimental zzso Since we are interested in zzso the zzso regulatory mechanisms of colon cancer zzso we use this important biological problem to illustrate various aspects of modeling gene zzso We discuss four important models: gene networks, zzso regulatory systems, zzso networks, and zzso zzso zzso We review state-of-the-art functional zzso techniques, such as gene expression zzso zzso element zzso zzso target gene zzso and gene zzso by zzso zzso which can be used to extract information about gene zzso We can employ this information, in conjunction with appropriately designed reverse engineering zzso to construct a zzso model of gene regulation that sufficiently predicts experimental zzso In the last part of this review, we focus on the problem of reverse engineering zzso regulatory networks by gene zzso We zzso formulate this problem and discuss the role of experimental resolution in our ability to reconstruct accurate models of gene zzso We zzso by discussing a promising approach for zzso a zzso regulatory system from zzso data obtained by gene zzso
