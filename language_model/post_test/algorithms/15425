Public health agencies use mass zzso locations to quickly administer vaccines to protect a population against an zzso The selection of such locations is frequently determined by available staffing levels and in some places, not all potential sites can be opened, often because of a lack of zzso Public health agencies need assistance in determining which zzso sites are the prime ones to open given available staff to minimize travel time and travel distance for those in the population who need to get to a site to receive zzso 

zzso zzso zzso methods to identify the prime zzso locations from a predetermined set of potential locations zzso zzso and determine which locations may not be able to achieve the zzso necessary to reach the zzso immunity threshold based on varying zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were used to select the ideal zzso mass vaccination zzso 

zzso County, Pennsylvania, served as the study zzso 

The most favorable sites were selected and the number of individuals required to be vaccinated to achieve the zzso immunity threshold for a given zzso ranging from zzso to 7, was zzso zzso that did not meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention zzso recommendation for zzso were zzso 

At zzso zzso zzso all mass zzso locations met the required zzso to achieve the zzso immunity threshold within 5 zzso As zzso increased from 2 to 7, an increasing number of sites were inadequate to meet zzso zzso 

zzso the top zzso sites and zzso those with zzso challenges allows health departments to adjust zzso shift zzso or the number of zzso This method has the potential to be expanded to select zzso locations under a number of additional zzso
