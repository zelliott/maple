This study aimed to determine whether the zzso risk zzso model zzso predicts the different components of resource zzso in open heart zzso 

Data for all adult patients undergoing heart surgery at the University Hospital of zzso Sweden, between 1999 and 2002 were zzso zzso zzso were calculated for the surgery and intensive care and ward stay for each patient zzso transplant cases and patients who died zzso zzso analysis was applied to evaluate the correlation between zzso and zzso The zzso accuracy for prolonged zzso intensive care unit zzso stay was assessed by the zzso zzso zzso The zzso power was evaluated by calculating the areas under receiver operating characteristics zzso 

The study included zzso zzso The mean cost for the surgery was zzso dollars, in the zzso zzso dollars, and in the ward 3,500 zzso Total cost was significantly correlated with zzso with a correlation zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso the correlation zzso was zzso for the surgery cost, zzso for the zzso cost, and zzso for the ward zzso The zzso p value for zzso prediction of more than 2 days' stay in the zzso was zzso indicating good zzso The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was zzso The probability of an zzso stay exceeding 2 days was more than 50% at a zzso of 14 or zzso 

In this zzso study, the additive zzso zzso could be used to predict zzso cost and also an zzso stay of more than 2 days after open heart zzso
