zzso that zzso bacteria, called zzso are well-known for their extreme zzso in which an individual zzso shares many different parts with many zzso The mechanisms for creating these mosaics are largely unknown but are believed to be zzso either zzso or partly zzso In order to reconstruct the history of these zzso we need to identify the positions where zzso may have occurred, and develop zzso to generate and explore the possible zzso 

We first show that, provided that their gene order is zzso zzso of zzso can be zzso even if large parts of their sequences lack any zzso similarity and are zzso hypothetical zzso We give such an alignment for 31 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that can be used in any similar zzso These alignments provide the zzso needed for a zzso study of zzso We next reconstruct the most likely zzso history of the set of 31 zzso under the hypothesis that zzso are partly zzso This history relies on the zzso identification of missing zzso 

This first zzso study of modular zzso acts as a proof of zzso We show that alignments of whole zzso are feasible for large sets of zzso and that this representation yields data that can be used to reconstruct parts of the evolutionary history of these zzso
