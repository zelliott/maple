A fully automated zzso zzso modeling zzso for coronary arteries is zzso It zzso a subset of standard zzso X-ray zzso projections that zzso to one single cardiac zzso The zzso is based on a fast marching approach, which selects zzso in zzso space that belong to the vascular structure and introduces a zzso zzso The local zzso propagation speed is determined by a combination of corresponding zzso projections filtered with a vessel enhancing zzso The best achievable accuracy of the zzso is evaluated on simulated projections of a virtual heart zzso showing that it is capable of zzso coronary zzso with an accuracy that is mainly limited by projection and volume zzso zzso zzso The zzso is reasonably insensitive to residual motion, which means that it is able to cope with inconsistencies within the projection data set caused by limited gating accuracy and zzso Its accuracy on clinical data is evaluated based on expert ratings of extracted models of 17 consecutive clinical cases (10 zzso 7 zzso A success rate of zzso zzso with no or slight zzso is achieved compared to zzso success rate of zzso extracted zzso
