In this article, we aimed to reduce the effects of geometric errors and measurement noise on the inverse problem of zzso zzso zzso We used the Kalman filter to solve the inverse problem in terms of zzso potential zzso The geometric errors were introduced into the problem via wrong determination of the size and location of the heart in zzso An error model, which is called the enhanced error model zzso was modified to be used in inverse problem of zzso to compensate for the geometric zzso In this model, the geometric errors are modeled as additive zzso noise and their noise zzso is added to the measurement noise zzso The Kalman filter method includes a process noise zzso whose zzso should also be estimated along with the measurement zzso To estimate these two noise zzso two different zzso were zzso zzso an zzso based on zzso zzso expectation zzso zzso The results showed that it is important to use the correct noise zzso to obtain accurate zzso The geometric zzso if ignored in the inverse solution zzso yielded incorrect zzso potential zzso However, even with a noise model as simple as the zzso the solutions could be significantly zzso
