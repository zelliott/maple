The purpose of this study is to evaluate the zzso of zzso tissue parameters by zzso modeling of zzso zzso derived under conditions that are realistic for zzso zzso imaging and to assess the zzso approach of zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso with a realistic noise level were simulated by means of an zzso distributed zzso reference model using typical values reported in literature on plasma flow, zzso area product, and volume zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso The simulated zzso were subsequently analyzed by a zzso model containing these zzso quantities as fit parameters as well as by two reduced models with only three and two parameters formulated for the case of a zzso and a zzso scenario, zzso The competing models were ranked according to zzso information criterion zzso balancing the bias versus zzso zzso To zzso the information available from all three models, zzso parameters were estimated using zzso weights that zzso the relative strength of evidence in favor of each zzso As compared to the full model, the reduced models yielded equivalent or even superior zzso values for scenarios where the structural information in the tissue zzso on either the plasma flow or the zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso took effect to a considerable extent in half of the zzso and improved the precision of the estimated tissue zzso As theoretically expected, the plasma flow was subject to a systematic (but largely zzso zzso whereas the other three zzso tissue parameters could be determined in a zzso robust and almost unbiased zzso The presented concept of zzso analysis of noisy zzso data using three zzso models under an zzso paradigm offers promising prospects for the zzso zzso of zzso tissue zzso
