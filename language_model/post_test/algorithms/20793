For complex biological networks, zzso representations are highly desired for understanding some design principles, but few drawing methods are available that capture zzso features of a large and highly zzso network, such as a protein interaction zzso Here we propose the circular perspective drawing zzso method to zzso global structures of large complex zzso The presented zzso combines the zzso search zzso analogous to the zzso descent method with a random zzso swapping strategy for an enhanced calculation zzso The zzso depicts a network in an aesthetic manner by showing connection patterns between different parts of the network instead of detailed links between zzso Global structural features of networks exhibited by zzso provide clues toward a comprehensive understanding of the network zzso
