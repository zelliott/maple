This paper introduces a new support zzso machine zzso zzso to obtain sparse solutions in the primal zzso zzso providing a new method for feature selection based on zzso This new approach includes additional constraints to the classical ones that drop the weights associated to those features that are likely to be zzso A zzso zzso has been used, where zzso indicates the fraction of features to be zzso This paper presents two versions of the proposed sparse zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso the latter having a reduced zzso burden with respect to the first zzso Additionally, an explanation is provided about how the presented approach can be readily extended to zzso zzso or to problems where groups of features, rather than isolated features, need to be zzso The zzso have been tested in a variety of synthetic and real data sets and they have been compared against other state of the art zzso linear feature selection methods, such as zzso zzso and doubly zzso zzso The results show the good feature selection ability of the zzso
