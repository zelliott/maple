The aim of this work is to zzso the skin zzso properties of a male rat by means of a purely zzso mathematical model based on zzso second zzso Additionally, in the attempt of proposing a reliable tool allowing the skin zzso (or zzso determination on the basis of experimental data, the model automatically accounts also for two typical experimental zzso In particular, drug dissolution in the donor environment and receiver sampling technique zzso of the receiver volume is withdrawn and immediately replaced by fresh zzso are zzso The results of this zzso are then compared with those coming from a common simplified zzso zzso is chosen as model drug and a zzso zzso degrees zzso Franz cell apparatus is used to perform zzso zzso This study suggests that zzso zzso through the rat skin can be well described by the proposed model and that some differences arise in the evaluation of the zzso resistance performed by means of our model or the usual simpler zzso
