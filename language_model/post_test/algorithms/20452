Our approach identified zzso of children zzso zzso 18 years of zzso and zzso of adults zzso 18 to 65 years of zzso as chronically ill and thus at high risk for zzso zzso Most high-risk children were identified through prescriptions for steroids, zzso zzso or both or because they were enrolled in the asthma zzso Most high-risk adults were identified because of prescriptions for steroids, insulin, or oral zzso zzso because they had received zzso zzso or because they were enrolled in the diabetes zzso zzso coverage rates for all seniors zzso zzso or zzso 65 years of zzso increased from zzso in 1984 to more than zzso in the zzso campaign zzso zzso rates were much lower for high-risk children zzso and adults zzso 

zzso coverage rates can still be substantially improved for adults younger than 65 years of age and children at high risk for zzso zzso
