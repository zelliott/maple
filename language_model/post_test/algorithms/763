The zzso zzso (short interfering zzso zzso Web zzso zzso zzso the design of short zzso that can specifically zzso zzso expression of target zzso These short sequences are about 21 zzso in zzso and when zzso as double stranded zzso and introduced into cell culture, can reduce or eliminate the function of the target zzso Depending on the length of a zzso there are potentially numerous combinations of possible zzso Some experimental evidence has already shown that not all zzso in a gene have the same effectiveness at zzso gene zzso Our tool incorporates published design rules and presents the scientist with information about uniqueness of the zzso within the zzso zzso stability of the double stranded zzso duplex, zzso content, presence of zzso and other features that may contribute to the effectiveness of a zzso
