zzso zzso provide a valuable source to study background diversification rates and investigate if the rates have changed over zzso Unfortunately most zzso dated zzso are sparsely sampled zzso than zzso of the described zzso and zzso sampling is not zzso Instead, zzso are frequently sampled to obtain at least one representative per zzso zzso zzso and thus to maximize diversity zzso zzso So far, such complications have been ignored, potentially zzso the conclusions that have been zzso In this study I derive the likelihood of a zzso process with zzso zzso diversification rates and diversified zzso zzso Using simulations I test if the true parameters and the sampling method can be recovered when the trees are small or medium sized zzso than 200 zzso The results show that the diversification rates can be zzso and the estimates are unbiased for large trees but are biased for small trees zzso than 50 zzso Furthermore, model selection by means of zzso Information zzso favors the true model if the true rates differ sufficiently from alternative models zzso the zzso model is recovered if the extinction rate is large and compared to a zzso zzso Finally, I applied six different diversification rate zzso from a zzso pure birth process to a decreasing zzso rate zzso process but excluding any rate shift zzso three large-scale empirical zzso zzso zzso and snakes with respectively zzso zzso and 41 sampled zzso All three zzso were constructed by diversified zzso zzso as stated by the zzso However only the snake zzso supported diversified zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso zzso test revealed that none of the tested models provided a good fit to the observed zzso The model zzso such as homogeneous rates across species or no rate shifts, appear to be zzso
