The accuracy with which zzso Carlo models of zzso beams generated by linear zzso zzso can describe zzso dose zzso depends on the modeled zzso of the electron beam profile incident on the zzso zzso It is known that the electron focal spot zzso affects zzso and zzso zzso here, the authors explore the extent to which source zzso reduces zzso output for smaller fields and larger spot zzso A zzso zzso Carlo zzso model has been used to investigate the variation in zzso zzso and zzso output factors with electron spot zzso A zzso is developed separating head scatter factors into source zzso and zzso filter zzso zzso between head scatter factors defined in terms of zzso energy zzso collision zzso and zzso are explored using zzso Carlo zzso Estimates of changes in zzso source zzso and zzso filter factors with field size and focal spot zzso are obtained by calculating doses deposited in a narrow 2 zzso wide virtual zzso zzso The impact of focal spot size on phantom scatter is also zzso Modeled electron spot sizes of zzso zzso zzso generate acceptable matches to measured zzso zzso However the zzso zzso field output factor is quite sensitive to electron spot zzso the measured output only being matched by calculations for a zzso zzso spot zzso Because the zzso of the zzso primary zzso and zzso zzso zzso energy zzso zzso zzso collision zzso zzso do not scale precisely with total zzso energy zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso but with zzso zzso For most field sizes, zzso collision zzso is independent of the focal spot size; but for a zzso zzso field size and zzso zzso spot zzso it is reduced by around zzso mostly due to source zzso The phantom scatter factor of the zzso zzso field also shows some spot size zzso decreasing by zzso zzso as spot size is increased from zzso to zzso zzso The dependence of zzso source zzso and output factors on the focal spot size makes this a significant factor in zzso Carlo modeling of small zzso 1 zzso zzso Changes in zzso zzso with spot size are not sufficiently large to accurately pinpoint spot zzso zzso while zzso Carlo models based exclusively on zzso data can quite accurately predict zzso profiles and zzso in the absence of experimental methods of determining incident electron beam profiles it will remain necessary to measure zzso output factors, zzso modeled spot sizes to ensure good matching between the zzso Carlo and the measured output zzso
