We used a zzso zzso method to produce DNA zzso zzso with unique probe sequences tiled throughout the zzso of zzso zzso and across predicted zzso zzso zzso expression of protein coding and zzso coding sequences was determined for each major stage of the life cycle, including adult males and zzso We detected zzso activity for zzso of zzso genes and zzso expression for zzso of the zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso interference data and to gene zzso revealed distinguishable levels of expression for different classes of genes and higher levels of expression for genes with essential cellular zzso zzso zzso was observed in about zzso of predicted zzso and zzso previously unknown zzso forms were zzso Genes within zzso regions of zzso with zzso zzso had highly correlated zzso these regions ranged in length from 10 to 900 zzso zzso The expressed zzso and zzso sequences are more likely to be zzso zzso than zzso ones, and about zzso of them appear to be zzso zzso Our results provide a draft expression map for the entire zzso zzso which reveals a much more extensive and diverse set of expressed sequences than was previously zzso
