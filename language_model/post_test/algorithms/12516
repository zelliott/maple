To evaluate the efficacy and safety of air zzso in preventing early recurrence of zzso zzso in diabetic zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso study including 40 eyes (from 40 zzso with persistent or zzso zzso zzso related to zzso diabetic zzso At the end of zzso 20 cases zzso zzso were assigned to complete zzso exchange while the other 20 cases zzso zzso were left with zzso zzso 

Early zzso bleeding occurred in 9 out of 40 zzso (3 cases from the study zzso and 6 cases from the control zzso p zzso zzso There was no statistically significant difference in visual zzso zzso pressure or zzso of zzso zzso recurrence between both groups during zzso zzso zzso In the study group there was a higher rate of lens zzso zzso 

Air zzso seems a simple and efficient way of preventing early recurrence of zzso zzso in diabetic zzso Higher rate of lens zzso appearance may counteract this advantage thus this technique could be safely and zzso used in zzso zzso
