We present the first elementary model predicting how zzso zzso vary for a range of experimental variables for zzso offset zzso zzso zzso a recently proposed technique for the effective retrieval of zzso zzso of subsurface layers in zzso scattering zzso The model was able to reproduce the key observations made from the first zzso experiments, namely the dependence of zzso signal zzso on the spatial offset between the zzso and collection points and the relative contributions to the overall spectrum from the top layer and zzso The application of the zzso concept to a zzso system is also zzso The model also clearly indicates that an zzso zzso rather than a zzso zzso which was used in the earlier experiments, would yield much improved zzso
