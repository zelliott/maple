zzso learning theory plays a key role in understanding the behavioral and neural mechanisms of choice behavior in animals and zzso zzso intermediate variables of learning models estimated from behavioral data, such as the expectation of reward for each candidate choice zzso zzso have been used in searches for the neural zzso of zzso elements in learning and decision zzso The aims of the present study are as zzso zzso to test which zzso model best captures the choice learning process in animals and zzso to zzso how action values are represented in different parts of the zzso zzso zzso We compared different behavioral learning zzso to predict the choice sequences generated by rats during a zzso task and analyzed associated neural activity in the nucleus zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The major findings of this study were as zzso zzso modified versions of an zzso learning model captured a variety of choice strategies of rats, including zzso and zzso behavior, and predicted zzso choice sequences better than the best zzso zzso zzso and zzso information about action values and future actions was coded in both the zzso and zzso but was less dominant than information about trial types, selected actions, and reward zzso The results of our zzso analysis suggest that the primary role of the zzso and VP is to monitor information important for updating choice zzso Information represented in the zzso and VP might contribute to a choice mechanism that is situated zzso
