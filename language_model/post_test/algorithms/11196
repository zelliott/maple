The transient response of a resonant structure can be altered by the attachment of one or more substantially smaller zzso zzso here is a coupled array of zzso harmonic zzso whose resonant zzso are distributed across a frequency band that encompasses the natural frequency of the primary zzso zzso energy introduced to the primary structure, which has little to no intrinsic zzso is transferred into and trapped by the attached zzso It is shown that, when the properties of the array are zzso to reduce the settling time of the primary zzso transient response, the apparent zzso is approximately zzso to the bandwidth of the array (the span of resonant zzso of the attached zzso zzso simulations were conducted using an zzso zzso zzso zzso to find system parameters that result in the fastest settling zzso This zzso was conducted for a range of system characteristics including the overall bandwidth of the zzso the ratio of the total array mass to that of the primary structure, and the zzso of mass, zzso and zzso among the array zzso This paper reports optimal values of these parameters and demonstrates that the resulting minimum settling time decreases with increasing zzso
