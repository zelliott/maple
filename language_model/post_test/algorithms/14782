A wireless camera sensor network is useful for surveillance and monitoring for its visibility and easy zzso However, it suffers from the limited capacity of wireless communication and a network is easily zzso with a considerable amount of video zzso In this paper, we propose an autonomous video coding rate control mechanism where each camera sensor zzso can autonomously determine its coding rate in accordance with the location and zzso of target zzso For this purpose, we adopted a biological model, zzso zzso model, inspired by the similarity of biological spatial patterns and the spatial distribution of video coding zzso Through simulation and practical experiments, we verify the effectiveness of our zzso
