This paper is concerned with the recovery of temporally coherent estimates of zzso structure and motion of a dynamic scene from a sequence of zzso stereo zzso A novel approach is presented based on matching of zzso zzso elements zzso between views, as this primitive encapsulates both spatial and zzso image structure for zzso zzso Match constraints are developed for bringing zzso into correspondence across zzso zzso With correspondence established, temporally coherent disparity estimates are obtained without explicit motion zzso Further, the matched zzso also will be shown to support direct recovery of scene flow zzso zzso zzso evaluation with ground truth data incorporated in both local and global correspondence zzso shows the considerable benefit of using zzso as a matching primitive and its advantages in comparison to alternative methods of enforcing zzso zzso in disparity zzso Additional experiments document the usefulness of zzso matching for zzso scene flow zzso
