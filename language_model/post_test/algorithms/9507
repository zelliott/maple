A new decoupling composite pulse sequence is proposed to remove the broadening on spin zzso zzso spinning zzso zzso arising from the zzso zzso with a zzso nucleus zzso It is illustrated on the zzso spectrum of an zzso zzso which is broadened by the presence of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence has the advantage over the continuous wave zzso zzso to efficiently zzso the zzso zzso without reintroducing the zzso zzso The zzso decoupling sequence is first described in a zzso version zzso where one zzso only needs to be zzso It clearly avoids the zzso zzso in order to achieve a better resolution than using the CW zzso In a second improved version, the zzso sequence is zzso studied in the vicinity of the perfect zzso zzso The zzso at half maximum zzso of 65 zzso using zzso CW decoupling decreases to 48 zzso with zzso decoupling and to 30 zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso The main phenomena are explained using both experimental results and zzso zzso
