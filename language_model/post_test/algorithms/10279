Central composite design zzso 5 levels and 4 zzso response surface methodology zzso and artificial neural zzso zzso zzso were used to evaluate the response of broiler zzso zzso and feed conversion ratio zzso to dietary standardized zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso total sulfur zzso acids zzso and zzso zzso A total of 84 battery zzso units of 5 birds each were assigned to 28 diets of zzso containing 5 levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from 11 to 17 d of zzso The experimental results of zzso were fitted with the zzso and artificial neural network zzso A zzso analysis (for zzso zzso and a genetic zzso (for zzso zzso were used to zzso the optimal response for zzso and zzso For both zzso and zzso the goodness of fit in terms of zzso and zzso error corresponding to zzso and zzso models showed a substantially higher accuracy of prediction for ANN models zzso model: zzso zzso zzso zzso model: zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso models zzso model: zzso zzso zzso zzso model: zzso zzso zzso The zzso maximum analysis on zzso and minimum analysis on zzso models revealed that the maximum zzso may be obtained with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in diet, and minimum zzso may be obtained with zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in zzso The zzso results of zzso models showed the maximum zzso may be achieved with zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in diet, and minimum zzso may be achieved with zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in zzso The results of this study revealed that the platform of zzso (for conducting growth trials with minimum zzso zzso model, and zzso (for experimental data modeling and zzso may be used to describe the relationship between dietary zzso zzso and broiler performance to achieve the optimal zzso
