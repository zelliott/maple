In this paper we present a new scheme of a zzso zzso learning algorithm, in which the kernel and the zzso zzso are zzso chosen on the base of previous experience with similar learning zzso The construction of such a scheme is motivated by the problem of prediction of the blood zzso levels of diabetic zzso We describe how the proposed scheme can be used for this problem and report the results of the tests with real clinical data as well as comparing them with existing zzso
