zzso zzso in zzso technology raise important questions regarding the differences in performance between various cameras and their respective zzso zzso Our study seeks the answer to this question via measurement of phantom zzso wall thickness zzso on images obtained from three state-of-the-art zzso 

A zzso phantom with an insert modeling a healthy heart was scanned using cardiac acquisition protocols with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed using advanced reconstruction techniques available on the cameras and our own independent zzso The zzso measurement was used as a figure of merit in performance zzso 

When using 50% zzso zzso measured for the data acquired using zzso zzso and SS and reconstructed with independent standardized software were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso when using the manufacturers' own zzso zzso zzso zzso for each image zzso from zzso to zzso produced much more uniform zzso 

No significant differences were observed between image resolutions when data acquired from different cameras were reconstructed with an independent zzso However, different manufacturers' reconstruction zzso produced zzso that differed by up to about zzso when using a set threshold of zzso
