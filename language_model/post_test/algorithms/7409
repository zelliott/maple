zzso acid zzso molecules play important roles in many biological processes including gene expression and zzso Their secondary structures are crucial for the zzso zzso and the prediction of the secondary structures is widely zzso Our previous research shows that cutting long sequences into shorter zzso predicting secondary structures of the chunks independently using zzso methods, and reconstructing the entire secondary structure from the predicted chunk structures can yield better accuracy than predicting the secondary structure using the zzso sequence as a zzso The zzso zzso and reconstruction processes can use different methods and zzso some of which produce more accurate predictions than zzso In this paper, we study the prediction accuracy and efficiency of three different zzso methods using seven popular secondary structure prediction programs that apply to two zzso of zzso with known secondary structures, which include both zzso and zzso zzso as well as a family of viral zzso zzso whose structures have not been predicted zzso Our zzso zzso framework based on zzso allows us to study the problem in a parallel and robust zzso 

On average, the maximum accuracy retention values are larger than one for our zzso methods and the seven prediction programs over 50 zzso zzso meaning that the secondary structure predicted using zzso is more similar to the real structure than the secondary structure predicted by using the whole zzso We observe similar results for the 23 zzso zzso except for the zzso program using the centered zzso zzso The performance analysis for 14 long zzso sequences from the zzso virus family outlines how the zzso mapping of zzso and predictions in the zzso framework exhibits shorter turnaround times for short zzso zzso However, as the lengths of the zzso sequences increase, the zzso mapping can surpass the zzso mapping in zzso 

By using our zzso framework together with statistical analysis on the accuracy retention results, we observe how the zzso zzso methods can outperform predictions using the whole zzso Our zzso approach also enables us to predict secondary structures for very long zzso zzso which is not feasible with traditional methods zzso
