The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term zzso degradation of zzso zzso anchors made of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Starting in 2008, the zzso biological behavior of a zzso zzso anchor was studied in a consecutive series of rotator cuff zzso zzso Twenty patients undergoing rotator cuff repair secured with zzso zzso zzso anchors with at least a zzso follow-up were evaluated by physical, zzso and zzso zzso zzso evaluations of the operated zzso American zzso and zzso Surgeons zzso Rowe, zzso zzso Test zzso zzso and Single Assessment zzso zzso zzso scores were also zzso CT scan data measured in zzso units zzso evaluated the material density at the anchor zzso Soft tissue and zzso bone readings were also zzso zzso scores were determined at the screw sites using an zzso quality score zzso 1 to zzso 

Fifteen men and 5 women were evaluated an average of 37 months after surgery zzso 36 to zzso CT scans and zzso showed no zzso anchor material zzso A total of 28 anchors were implanted in the 20 zzso The anchors were usually replaced with zzso zzso zzso zzso was present in 20 of 28 zzso of the anchor sites and was nearly complete or complete zzso 3 or 4 zzso in 14 of 28 zzso Mean anchor site density zzso zzso was not different from the mean zzso bone density zzso zzso zzso Rowe, zzso zzso and zzso scores improved from zzso zzso zzso zzso and 45 preoperatively to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at zzso zzso All zzso clinical outcome measures were statistically greater than the zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso anchor completely zzso and no remnant was present 3 years after zzso zzso was confirmed in 20 of 28 zzso anchor sites and was nearly complete or complete in 14 of 28 zzso The zzso zzso zzso anchor is zzso 

Level IV, therapeutic case zzso
