The objective of this study was to assess the spontaneous cerebral zzso based on the zzso transform of zzso zzso zzso signals in subjects at risk for zzso zzso 

A total of 32 subjects were recruited from the university to participate in this zzso 20 were normal subjects zzso zzso and the other 12 were subjects at risk for zzso stroke zzso zzso cerebral zzso signal was monitored for 10 zzso from the left prefrontal lobe using zzso 

With spectral analysis based on zzso zzso five frequency intervals were identified zzso zzso zzso II, zzso zzso III, zzso zzso IV, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso in the frequency intervals from I to V and of the zzso in frequency intervals I and V in subjects at risk for stroke were found to be significantly lower compared to the zzso in normal zzso 

The reduction of spontaneous zzso in these subjects suggests an increased zzso in the cerebral zzso This indicates the possibility of applying spontaneous zzso based on the zzso transform of zzso signals, to assess the risk in subjects with zzso
