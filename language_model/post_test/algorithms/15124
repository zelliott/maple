We show that under reasonable conditions the zzso maximum likelihood estimate zzso of the distribution function from zzso and case 1 zzso data is inconsistent, in contrast to the consistency properties of the zzso from only zzso data or only zzso zzso However, the conditional zzso is shown to be zzso zzso examples are provided to illustrate their finite sample zzso
