This discussion summarizes the interaction of zzso periods and upper rate behaviors in modern zzso demand zzso devices, the data regarding and nine events initiating VA zzso and engineering solutions proposed and/or implemented to address the problem of zzso zzso zzso Among the causes of zzso are premature zzso zzso loss of zzso capture, a return to the demand mode after zzso magnet mode zzso programming from a mode that does not guarantee zzso zzso to a mode in which zzso tracking can occur, noise, certain situations involving zzso behavior, loss of zzso and the inability of a zzso zzso to allow a rapid change in zzso zzso Engineering solutions to prevent the occurrence of zzso include a zzso zzso zzso zzso period zzso differential zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the ability to discriminate between P waves of zzso origin and those resulting from retrograde zzso from the zzso Features such as the ability to zzso the zzso for one cycle after zzso the magnet or noise zzso modes or programming to a new mode, zzso the zzso for a single cycle following a zzso or zzso to zzso pacing for one cycle following a zzso have been developed to recognize initiating zzso A third solution, a zzso termination algorithm, can recognize and terminate zzso varying the zzso delay to determine whether P waves move in a corresponding manner and using a zzso sensor to confirm the need for a fast heart rate are other possibilities in the detection of zzso zzso data features may also be used to evaluate the appropriateness of programmed zzso This discussion concludes that zzso is no longer a significant clinical entity when more advanced zzso zzso are zzso
