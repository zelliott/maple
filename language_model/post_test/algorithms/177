We previously described a zzso architecture that replaces the single zzso weights on each receive channel with zzso finite impulse response zzso zzso The filter weights are designed to zzso the contrast resolution performance of the imaging zzso Although the zzso zzso offers significant gains in contrast resolution, the zzso suffers from low sensitivity, and its performance rapidly degrades in the presence of zzso In this paper, a new method is presented to improve the zzso of the zzso zzso to electronic noise as well as variation or uncertainty in the array zzso A method is also described that controls the zzso levels of the zzso zzso spatial response by applying an arbitrary weighting function in the filter design zzso The robust zzso zzso is analyzed using a generalized zzso resolution metric that zzso a zzso clinical imaging performance as a function of zzso size and channel input zzso Fundamental performance limits are compared between 2 robust zzso zzso - the dynamic focus zzso zzso zzso and the group focus zzso zzso zzso - the conventional zzso zzso zzso and the zzso filter zzso zzso zzso from this study show that the new zzso and zzso zzso are more robust to electronic noise compared with the optimal contrast resolution zzso zzso Furthermore, the added zzso comes with only a slight loss in zzso zzso zzso from the generalized zzso resolution metric show that a zzso robust zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso until receive channel input zzso drops below -5 zzso whereas the zzso optimal contrast resolution zzso performance zzso around 50 zzso zzso The effects of moderate phase zzso characterized by an a zzso zzso strength of 28 zzso and an a zzso zzso at zzso correlation length of zzso zzso are zzso d on the robust zzso zzso Full sets of robust zzso zzso filter weights are constructed using an in zzso model scanner and the zzso zzso zzso Using the derived zzso a series of simulated point target and zzso zzso zzso images are generated to investigate further the potential increases in contrast resolution when using the robust zzso zzso Under the investigated conditions, the zzso optimal contrast resolution zzso and the zzso robust zzso with added zzso constraint increase zzso zzso by 247 and zzso compared with the conventional zzso zzso zzso Finally, experimental phantom and in zzso images are produced using this novel receive zzso The simulated and experimental images clearly show a reduction in clutter and an increase in contrast resolution compared with the conventionally zzso zzso This novel receive zzso can be applied to any conventional ultrasound system where the system response is reasonably well zzso
