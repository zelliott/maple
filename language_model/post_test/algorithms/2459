Transport of essential zzso across biological zzso is one of the fundamental characteristics of living zzso Although zzso is an essential zzso little is known about the cellular mechanisms of chemical zzso zzso transport in zzso We report here the kinetic and pharmacological transport characteristics of zzso and its zzso zzso and zzso derivatives in primary cultures of zzso and isolated zzso of rainbow zzso zzso from the current study suggest an apparent zzso linear transport system for zzso in both cell zzso However, we recorded zzso Hill zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso exposed to zzso in the presence of zzso The zzso of zzso in the presence of zzso was zzso higher than zzso of zzso alone (at zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso Cellular zzso of zzso was found to be energy zzso Interestingly, we observed a decrease in zzso transport with increasing zzso whereas zzso zzso increased with increasing pH in the presence zzso in both cell zzso The cellular zzso of zzso demonstrated a pronounced competitive interaction with a structurally similar compound, zzso The zzso of zzso as well as its zzso derivatives was found to be sensitive to the zzso transport blocker zzso irrespective of the cell zzso zzso mercury zzso zzso an zzso of zzso transport in both cell types, but zzso the transport of reduced forms of zzso in zzso Based on the zzso choice and comparable pharmacological properties, we advocate that multiple zzso transport systems are probably involved in the cellular transport of zzso in zzso
