It is widely recognized that the zzso process is prone to errors and that the future of DNA sequencing by zzso is predicated on the ability to successfully cope with such zzso However, the occurrence of zzso errors results in the zzso difficulty of the reconstruction of DNA sequencing by zzso The reconstruction problem of DNA sequencing by zzso with errors is a strongly zzso zzso So far the problem has not been solved zzso 

In this paper, a new approach is presented to solve the reconstruction problem of DNA sequencing by zzso which realizes the zzso part of the zzso zzso The proposed zzso accepts both the negative and positive zzso The zzso experiments show that the zzso behaves zzso especially for the case with zzso repetitions and positive zzso
