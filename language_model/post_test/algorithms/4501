Linear discrimination, from the point of view of zzso linear algebra, can be treated as solving an zzso system of linear zzso In order to generate a solution that is robust in the presence of noise, these problems require zzso Here, we examine the zzso involved in the linear discrimination of cancer gene expression data with respect to outcome and tumor zzso We show that a filter factor zzso based upon zzso Value zzso yields insight into the zzso zzso of the zzso separation when applied to gene expression zzso We also show that this representation yields useful diagnostic tools for guiding the selection of zzso zzso thus leading to improved zzso
