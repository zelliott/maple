zzso of cerebral zzso blood volume zzso is important for understanding vascular zzso To enable measurement of zzso with zzso zzso zzso spin labeling zzso a theoretical framework was developed using the effects of zzso incoherent motion zzso The zzso zzso zzso in the zzso model was evaluated at zzso T in zzso of rat brain under zzso zzso by variations of both zzso delay zzso and zzso transfer ratio zzso zzso and its volume fraction decreased at values of zzso zzso and the zzso apparent diffusion zzso zzso increased with zzso suggesting that zzso is closely correlated with zzso Thus, the difference between zzso zzso with and without zzso zzso is related to zzso The zzso values measured by this approach were compared with values obtained using the zzso of tissue and vessel zzso technique with zzso which varies zzso levels without changing spin labeling zzso zzso values from both methods were highly zzso The measured zzso values were zzso correlated with cerebral blood flow zzso for a zzso range of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso approach is simple and easy to implement for human and animal zzso zzso
