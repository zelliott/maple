The transport of the secondary electrons resulting from zzso zzso interactions is essential to energy zzso and zzso In order to develop an accurate zzso zzso for zzso zzso which can predict the dose distribution in zzso media and at the beam edges, we have investigated the feasibility of applying electron transport theory zzso zzso zzso 15, 123 zzso to zzso dose zzso In particular, the transport of and energy deposition by Compton electron and electrons and zzso resulting from pair production were zzso The primary photons are treated as the source of the secondary electrons and zzso which are transported through the zzso medium using zzso zzso theory zzso zzso zzso 15, 123 zzso The initial angular and kinetic energy zzso of the secondary electrons (and zzso emanating from the zzso interactions are incorporated into the zzso Due to different mechanisms of creation and zzso functions, the transport of and the energy deposition by the electrons released in these two processes are studied and modeled separately based on first zzso In this article, we focus on determining the dose distribution for an individual interaction zzso We define the Compton dose deposition kernel zzso or the zzso dose deposition kernel zzso as the dose distribution relative to the point of interaction, per unit interaction density, for a zzso zzso beam in an infinite homogeneous medium of unit zzso The zzso of this zzso modeling of dose deposition was evaluated through zzso zzso Carlo zzso zzso agreement between these two calculations of the dose distribution and the average energy deposited per interaction was zzso Our results demonstrate the zzso of the electron zzso method to zzso dose zzso
