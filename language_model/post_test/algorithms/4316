To determine whether parameters obtained from zzso incoherent motion zzso imaging zzso using multiple zzso can improve characterization of common focal liver zzso zzso compared with the apparent diffusion zzso zzso zzso 

Our Institutional Review Board approved this retrospective study and informed consent was zzso In all, 142 patients with 169 zzso underwent liver magnetic resonance imaging zzso including zzso with multiple b factors at zzso zzso and zzso parameters including true diffusion zzso ), zzso zzso ), and zzso fraction zzso were calculated for each zzso and compared using dedicated zzso 

zzso and zzso were significantly lower in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than in benign zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the differential diagnosis of zzso from benign zzso zzso zzso value: zzso showed better diagnostic performance than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also showed better diagnostic performance than zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso from benign zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso and f were significantly higher in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso provided better diagnostic performance than zzso in zzso benign from zzso zzso zzso and f were significant parameters for diagnosing zzso zzso
