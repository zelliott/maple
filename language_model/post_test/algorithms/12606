The separation of six soy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was approached by a zzso zzso design studying zzso zzso components at the following zzso methanol zzso zzso and sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sodium zzso buffer zzso concentration was kept constant at 10 zzso zzso Nine experiments were performed and the apparent mobility of each zzso was zzso as a function of the zzso zzso A novel response function zzso was formulated based on the production of the mobility differences, mobility of the first and last zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The inspection of the response surface indicated an optimum zzso composition as 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing 40 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso promoting baseline separation of all zzso in less than zzso zzso The proposed method was applied to the determination of total zzso in soy germ capsules from four different pharmaceutical zzso A zzso extraction procedure with zzso zzso zzso under zzso at room temperature was zzso Peak assignment of unknown zzso in certain samples was assisted by zzso procedures, migration behavior and zzso zzso zzso Three zzso zzso derivatives were tentatively zzso A few figures of merit for the proposed method include: zzso zzso better than zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso intermediate precision zzso better than zzso zzso zzso zzso at two concentration levels, 20 and 50 zzso zzso varied from zzso to zzso Furthermore, the proposed method exhibited zzso in the concentration range of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso varying from zzso to zzso zzso zzso The capsules purity varied from zzso to zzso
