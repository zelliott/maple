zzso of the zzso zzso is an uncommon but challenging complication of pediatric elbow zzso The purpose of this investigation was to characterize the clinical and zzso presentation of fishtail zzso and outline a treatment zzso 

Fourteen patients were treated at a zzso children's hospital between 1995 and zzso Mean age at presentation was 10 years zzso zzso to 12 zzso zzso clinical zzso zzso and treatment data were zzso Mean follow-up was zzso years from recognition of fishtail zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso 

Average time from index injury to presentation of fishtail zzso was zzso years zzso zzso to 9 zzso Twelve patients zzso presented with pain and mechanical zzso Seven patients were initially treated with zzso of whom 2 eventually underwent zzso zzso Ultimately 7 patients underwent zzso and 1 open zzso and loose body zzso 5 of these patients required further surgery for zzso mechanical zzso One patient underwent zzso zzso and zzso to maintain zzso zzso After initial zzso zzso 6 of 7 patients zzso had pain relief, and all patients demonstrated improved range of motion and/or relief of mechanical zzso At most recent zzso 6 patients zzso had persistent pain, and only 2 zzso had normal elbow zzso Four of the 5 patients who lost 20 or more degrees of extension had zzso head zzso or zzso The remaining 9 patients had a reduced zzso zzso Loss of extension in those with and without zzso of the zzso head was 32 and 6 degrees, zzso 

Fishtail zzso is a rare but zzso complication of pediatric elbow zzso Clinical presentation with loss of motion and/or pain is often zzso zzso zzso may improve symptoms in the short term, but long-term prognosis is zzso zzso of the zzso head is associated with worse functional zzso Early detection and surgical strategies to prevent zzso migration of the zzso and development of zzso zzso zzso head dislocation, and zzso may improve outcomes in patients with fishtail zzso
