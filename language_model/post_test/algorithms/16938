The description of a protein fold is a hard problem due to significant zzso of main structural units, zzso and zzso and their mutual zzso An adequate description of the structural units is an important step in objective protein structure zzso which to date is based on expert judgment in a number of zzso zzso determination and description of structural units is more complicated for zzso than for zzso due to zzso zzso both in composition and zzso We have developed an zzso that can significantly modify zzso detected by commonly used zzso and zzso zzso and represent the result as a zzso zzso a table describing certain zzso zzso In our approach, zzso (rather than zzso are considered as holistic zzso Both hydrogen bonds and geometrical zzso are explored for the determination of zzso The zzso is implemented in zzso zzso It was tested for prediction zzso of zzso from 93 zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein domain families, and showed zzso of correct zzso The zzso allows to detect zzso in a given protein structure, zzso zzso zzso as well as input three-dimensional structures with highlighted zzso and their structural zzso
