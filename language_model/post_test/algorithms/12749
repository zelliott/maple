zzso such as zzso zzso require hardware spike sorting in order to 1) obtain zzso activity and 2) perform data reduction for wireless data zzso Such systems must be zzso zzso zzso zzso and able to operate in real zzso Several zzso zzso and zzso zzso for spike sorting are described and evaluated in terms of accuracy versus zzso The zzso energy operator is chosen as the optimal zzso algorithm, being most robust over noise and relatively zzso zzso derivatives is chosen as the optimal zzso method, maintaining high accuracy across zzso ratios with a complexity orders of magnitude less than that of traditional methods such as zzso zzso We introduce the zzso algorithm, which is shown to be the best zzso method for hardware spike zzso
