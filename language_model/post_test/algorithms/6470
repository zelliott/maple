The absence of electronic equilibrium in the vicinity of zzso or zzso zzso in the head can zzso deposited dose with treatment planning zzso that assume all treatment volume as homogeneous zzso In this paper, zzso Carlo simulation zzso and zzso with a specially designed zzso phantom were applied to investigate the effect of zzso and zzso zzso on dose zzso with the zzso zzso zzso The dose zzso near the zzso interface caused by secondary electron zzso leads to zzso of dose by the vendor supplied treatment planning software zzso at up to 4 zzso from an zzso The dose delivered to the target area away from an zzso interface may be underestimated by up to zzso by zzso due to zzso of zzso of zzso beams passing through air zzso While the zzso near the zzso interface cannot be eliminated with any plug pattern, the zzso due to zzso of the zzso beams in air cavities can be eliminated by plugging the sources whose beams intersect the air zzso Little zzso was observed next to zzso zzso zzso Carlo results were confirmed by zzso This study shows that the employed zzso Carlo treatment planning is more accurate for precise zzso of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso for targets in the vicinity of zzso zzso
