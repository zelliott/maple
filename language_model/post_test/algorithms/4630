zzso analysis of zzso is widespread in zzso A new challenge for analyzing the zzso time series data is to identify genes that are periodically zzso Such challenge occurs due to the fact that the observed time series usually exhibit zzso such as noise, short zzso and zzso sampled time zzso Most methods used in the literature operate on evenly sampled time series and are not suitable for zzso sampled time zzso 

For evenly sampled data, methods based on the classical zzso zzso are often used to detect periodically expressed zzso Recently, the zzso zzso has been applied to zzso sampled gene expression data for spectral zzso However, since the zzso method assumes that there is a single stationary zzso wave with infinite support, it introduces zzso periodic components in the zzso for data with a finite zzso In this paper, we propose a new spectral zzso zzso for zzso sampled gene expression zzso The new method is based on signal reconstruction in a zzso signal space, where a direct spectral zzso procedure is developed using the zzso zzso zzso on simulated noisy gene expression profiles show that our zzso is superior to the zzso zzso and the classical zzso zzso based method in detecting periodically expressed zzso We have applied our zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso gene expression data and the results show that the zzso is able to detect biologically meaningful periodically expressed zzso 

We have proposed an effective method for identifying periodic genes in zzso sampled space of zzso time series gene expression zzso The method can also be used as an effective tool for gene expression time series zzso or zzso
