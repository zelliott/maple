The separation of mixed auditory signals into their sources is an eminent zzso and engineering zzso We reveal the principles underlying a zzso neural zzso solution to this zzso This approach is zzso to zzso that views the signal constituents as independent zzso of random zzso We demonstrate zzso that in the absence of salient frequency zzso the decomposition of speech signals into local zzso packets allows for a zzso zzso speaker zzso As the main result, we present zzso limitations inherent in the approach, where we propose strategies of how to deal with this zzso Our results offer new perspectives toward efficient noise cleaning and auditory signal separation and provide a new perspective of how the brain might achieve these zzso
