The influence of zzso zzso on NO reduction by selective zzso reduction process has been investigated zzso in an zzso tube zzso The zzso zzso are composed of two species of zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso ratio of their two components varies from 1/3 to zzso The results show that all the investigated zzso could decrease the optimal temperature for NO reduction zzso but the contributions of their components are zzso The performance of zzso additive composed of CO and zzso depends mainly on zzso zzso The function of CO component is shifting the temperature window for NO reduction to lower temperature slightly and narrowing the temperature window a zzso The temperature window with zzso additive composed of zzso and zzso is distinct from that with its each zzso so both zzso and zzso component make important zzso While the fraction of CO is no more than that of zzso in zzso zzso composed of them, the performance of zzso zzso is dominated by zzso zzso while the fraction of CO becomes larger, the influence of CO component becomes zzso zzso the modeling results using a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism exhibit the same characteristics of the temperature window shift as observed zzso By reaction mechanism analysis, the distinct influences of zzso zzso or zzso component on the property of zzso additive are mainly caused by the different production rates of zzso radical in their own zzso zzso
