This paper describes the use of adult facial template in zzso facial zzso 

Eighty adults, mean age zzso were selected for the zzso zzso images of the subjects were obtained under a zzso and controlled environment with two zzso Vivid 900 zzso Japan) optical zzso devices assembled as a zzso A set of left and right scanned images was taken for each subject and each scan took an average of zzso zzso These scanned images were processed and merged to form a composite three-dimensional soft tissue reproduction of the subjects using commercially available reverse zzso zzso The differences in facial zzso were measured using shell zzso zzso zzso The facial template was used to compare differences between males zzso females groups and two subjects with facial zzso 

The difference between the male and female facial templates was zzso zzso zzso zzso The areas of greatest zzso were at the zzso zzso area and lower jaw zzso The results of the surface zzso maps between the templates and subjects with facial zzso showed that the results could be applied for zzso zzso 

The construction of the adult facial templates provides an interesting perspective into measuring changes in groups of patients and also acts as a useful template for the comparison of skeletal zzso
