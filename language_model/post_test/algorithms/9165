In many zzso zzso of DNA to zzso is terminated by a zzso stretch of DNA following a hairpin zzso zzso such zzso zzso zzso can shed light on the organization of bacterial zzso and can improve zzso zzso Previous zzso methods to predict zzso zzso have been slow or limited in the organisms they zzso 

We describe zzso a new zzso method to rapidly and accurately detect zzso zzso zzso We predict the locations of zzso in zzso zzso zzso representing the largest collection of predictions zzso In zzso zzso we can detect zzso of known zzso with a false positive rate of just zzso comparable to the best-known zzso Outside the zzso division, we find that zzso termination plays a large role in the zzso and zzso zzso the zzso (including the zzso zzso and several other zzso In zzso and zzso zzso zzso are frequently formed by closely zzso complementary instances of zzso DNA zzso signal zzso We zzso the propensity for zzso to include these zzso In the process, we provide the first discussion of potential zzso signals in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and we discuss the preference for a particular zzso of zzso signal sequences within zzso 

Our new fast and accurate method for detecting zzso zzso has allowed us to identify and analyze zzso in many new zzso and to identify DNA zzso signal sequences in several species where they have not been previously zzso Our software and predictions are freely zzso
