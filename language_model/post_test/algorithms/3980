zzso the probability of the occurrence of a zzso outcome or condition is important in biomedical zzso While assessing discrimination is an essential issue in developing and zzso zzso prediction models, less attention has been paid to methods for assessing model zzso zzso refers to the degree of agreement between observed and predicted probabilities and is often assessed by testing for zzso The objective of our study was to examine the ability of zzso methods to assess the zzso of zzso zzso zzso We examined lack of internal zzso which was related to zzso of the zzso zzso model, and external zzso which was related to an zzso model or to shrinkage of the linear zzso We conducted an extensive set of zzso Carlo simulations with a locally weighted least squares zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso to examine the ability of zzso methods to assess model zzso We found that zzso methods were able to provide evidence of moderate departures from zzso and indicate omission of a moderately strong zzso zzso of the link function was harder to zzso Visual patterns were clearer with higher sample sizes, higher zzso of the outcome, or higher zzso zzso methods were also able to identify the lack of zzso in external validation samples when an zzso zzso model had been zzso In conclusion, zzso smoothing methods are adequate tools to zzso assess zzso and merit wider zzso
