zzso models of synaptic plasticity propose that single zzso perform a directed random walk of fixed step sizes in synaptic strength, thereby embracing the view that the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity constitute a zzso zzso zzso However, fluctuations in synaptic strength present a formidable challenge to such an zzso We have previously proposed that single zzso must zzso an integration and filtering mechanism between the induction of synaptic plasticity and the expression of synaptic plasticity in order to control zzso We analyze a class of three such mechanisms in the presence of possibly zzso plasticity induction zzso zzso expressions for the mean expression time in these zzso One of these filtering mechanisms constitutes a discrete zzso filter that could be implemented on a small collection of molecules at single zzso such as zzso and we analyze this discrete filter in some zzso After considering zzso induction zzso we examine our own zzso model of zzso zzso for which the probability density functions of the induction of plasticity steps have previously been zzso We determine the dependence of the mean time to express a plasticity step on zzso and zzso firing rates in this model, and we also consider, zzso the long-term stability against fluctuations of patterns of zzso connectivity that typically emerge during zzso zzso
