The measurement of individual single-channel events arising from the gating of zzso channels provides a detailed data set from which the kinetic mechanism of a channel can be zzso In many cases, the pattern of zzso in the open and closed states is very complex, and the kinetic mechanism and parameters are not easily zzso Assuming a zzso model for channel zzso the probability density function for open and closed time zzso should consist of a sum of zzso zzso One method of approaching the kinetic analysis of such a system is to determine the number of zzso and the corresponding parameters which comprise the open and closed dwell time zzso These can then be compared to the relaxations predicted from the kinetic model to zzso where possible, the kinetic zzso We report here the use of a linear technique, linear zzso value decomposition, to determine the number of zzso and the exponential zzso Using simulated zzso and comparing with standard zzso analysis, the singular value decomposition techniques provide advantages in some situations and are a useful adjunct to other single-channel analysis zzso
