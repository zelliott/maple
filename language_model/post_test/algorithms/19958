This paper presents an improved reinforcement learning method to minimize electricity costs on the premise of satisfying the power balance and generation limit of units in a zzso with zzso zzso zzso the zzso control requirements are analyzed and the objective function of optimal control for zzso is zzso Then, a state variable zzso zzso Price zzso which is used to express the most possible transitions of the system is developed so as to reduce the complexity and zzso of the zzso and a zzso architecture including agents, state zzso action variables and reward function is zzso Furthermore, dynamic zzso reinforcement learning, based on change rate of key state zzso is established to carry out optimal policy zzso The analysis shows that the proposed method is beneficial to handle the problem of zzso of zzso and speed up learning in the unknown large-scale zzso Finally, the simulation results under zzso zzso Agent Development zzso demonstrate the zzso of the presented method in optimal control for a zzso with zzso zzso
