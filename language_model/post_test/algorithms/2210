A zzso agent based, evolutionary algorithm, modeling zzso zzso genetic variation, zzso expression and selection was used to study the dynamic interactions affecting a zzso zzso The results suggest that strong irreversible constraints affect the evolution of resistance to zzso zzso genes evolve differently in asexual organisms compared with sexual ones in response to various patterns of zzso zzso zzso populations zzso and zzso are less likely to develop genetic resistance in response to multiple pesticides or if pesticides are used at low doses, whereas sexual populations zzso for example) are more likely to become resistant to pesticides if zzso to the zzso relates to mate zzso The adaptation of genes not related to the emergence of resistance will affect the dynamics of the evolution of zzso zzso the number of pesticides reduces the probability of developing resistance to any of them in asexual organisms but much less so in sexual zzso zzso applications of zzso were slightly less efficient in slowing emergence of resistance compared with simultaneous application of a mix in both sexual and asexual zzso zzso only one sex of the zzso speeds the development of zzso The findings are consistent to most of the published zzso models but are closer to known experimental results, showing that zzso agent based simulation models are more powerful in explaining complex zzso
