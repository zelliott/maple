In the present study, we proposed a modification in one of the most frequently applied zzso procedures in zzso data analysis: the percentage of zzso zzso In contrast with other techniques, the calculus and interpretation of this procedure are straightforward and can be easily zzso by visual inspection of the zzso zzso Although the percentage of zzso data has been found to perform reasonably well in N zzso 1 data, the magnitude of effect estimates that it yields can be distorted by trend and zzso zzso the zzso procedure focuses on removing the baseline trend from data prior to zzso the change produced in the behavior as a result of zzso A simulation study was carried out in order to compare the original and the modified procedures in several experimental zzso The results suggest that the new proposal is unaffected by trend and zzso and that it can be used in case of unstable zzso and zzso related zzso
