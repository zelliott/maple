zzso experiments carried out over several generations and analyzed using genetic models including zzso dominance, and zzso effects deserve careful zzso zzso should be zzso with respect to the specific aim of the zzso Using an experiment with guinea pigs as an example, designs were zzso for three different criteria: zzso where the zzso of the zzso zzso of all parameters in the genetic model is zzso zzso where a specific subset of parameters is of special interest and the respective zzso is zzso and zzso where a linear function or a set of linear functions of the parameters in the model is of zzso The linear function used in this particular case relates to the comparison of a composite line of two breeds and a zzso zzso system at zzso The designs produced by a sequential design zzso depend very much on the zzso zzso zzso that are optimal for the comparison of zzso and zzso are very inefficient for the zzso of the whole set of parameters in the model or the specific subset of special interest in this zzso Assuming that the underlying genetic model is correct, zzso and zzso at equilibrium may be compared extremely efficiently using only crosses arising in the first three generations of zzso
