Better dosing is needed for zzso including zzso zzso to prevent emergence of resistant bacterial zzso Here, we assess the zzso zzso zzso related to a 10 zzso minimum zzso concentration zzso target in zzso children (4 to 120 zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso 

Standard administration of zzso was with three 10 zzso zzso loading zzso and zzso with 10 zzso or 15 zzso zzso During zzso 9 samples zzso were collected per patient and the zzso analyzed with zzso Mixed zzso Model zzso 

Thirty-five percent of zzso in older children zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso in younger infants zzso zzso were below the target zzso The global zzso population zzso parameters were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso V zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso were zzso The older children had zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso V zzso zzso zzso and the younger zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso V zzso zzso zzso zzso error was reduced from zzso to around zzso in the final zzso 

Older children in the zzso may require relatively higher doses of zzso However, a study in a larger population is zzso
