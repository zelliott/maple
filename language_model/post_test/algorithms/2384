During the past few years several zzso alternatives to the Cox zzso hazards model have appeared in the zzso These methods extend techniques that are well known from zzso analysis to the analysis of censored survival zzso In this paper we discuss methods based on zzso trees and zzso zzso zzso two zzso using both Survival Trees and zzso and compare the strengths and weaknesses of the two zzso One of the strengths of zzso is that its model fitting procedure has an implicit check for zzso of the underlying hazards zzso It also provides an explicit model for the conditional hazards function, which makes it very convenient to obtain zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso methods automatically partition a zzso into groups of cases that are similar in survival zzso zzso obtained by survival trees and zzso are often zzso Trees and zzso in survival analysis should provide the data analyst with two useful tools when zzso survival zzso
