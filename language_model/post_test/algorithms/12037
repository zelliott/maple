zzso methods have been developed for standardized assessment of zzso zzso in clinical and zzso studies of spinal zzso However, zzso zzso may be caused by a variety of other zzso To examine the zzso of zzso assessed zzso zzso as an index of zzso zzso fractures, we developed an zzso for zzso differential zzso zzso based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative assessment of lateral spinal zzso zzso were obtained in a population of 50- to 80-year-old German women zzso zzso zzso and men zzso zzso zzso surveyed in the context of the European zzso zzso Study zzso zzso methods zzso 3 zzso and 4 zzso criteria, zzso were validated against zzso and against bone mineral density zzso at the zzso and the zzso zzso According to zzso 36 persons zzso had at least one zzso zzso zzso among 516 zzso zzso 154 had severe zzso 132 had other spinal disease and 219 had normal zzso 14 persons zzso could not be unequivocally zzso The prevalence of zzso assessed zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso in women and from zzso to zzso in men, depending on the stringency of the zzso zzso The agreement between zzso and zzso methods was zzso In men, zzso of cases with zzso zzso were classified as zzso zzso zzso or other spinal disease) by zzso compared with zzso in zzso Among these, most had wedge zzso of the zzso zzso On the other hand, up to zzso of zzso zzso fractures in men and up to zzso in women were missed by zzso in particular zzso fractures at the zzso zzso In the group with zzso zzso fractures by zzso the proportion of persons with osteoporosis according to the WHO criteria zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in women and zzso in men, compared with zzso in women and zzso in men with zzso zzso by various zzso Although zzso zzso by most definitions were significantly and zzso related to zzso as a continuous variable in both sexes zzso zzso zzso ranged between zzso zzso and zzso zzso a much stronger association existed between zzso and zzso fractures defined by zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso group individuals with severe zzso had significantly higher zzso values at the zzso neck zzso zzso zzso and zzso spine zzso zzso zzso compared with the normal zzso On the basis of internal zzso and external zzso zzso we conclude that assessment of zzso zzso fracture by quantitative methods alone will result in considerable zzso especially in zzso zzso for differential diagnosis as used within zzso can be helpful for a standardized zzso of zzso zzso in studies of spinal zzso
