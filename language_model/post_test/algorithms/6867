The conversion of zzso in zzso into hydrogen gas could serve the dual role of renewable energy production and waste zzso The chemical energy in a zzso rich synthetic wastewater was recovered as hydrogen gas in this zzso Using fractional zzso design batch experiments, the effect of varying pH zzso and zzso concentration zzso g zzso and their interaction on hydrogen gas production were zzso Mixed bacterial cultures obtained from a zzso pile, a potato field, and a soybean field were heated to inhibit zzso zzso and to enrich zzso zzso zzso It was determined that the highest rate zzso zzso zzso of hydrogen production occurred at a pH of zzso and a zzso concentration of zzso g zzso a conversion efficiency of zzso zzso zzso zzso The highest conversion efficiency was zzso zzso zzso zzso
