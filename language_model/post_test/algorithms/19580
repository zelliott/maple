zzso solutions of the differential equations system describing the transitions between energy levels can help in the understanding of the physical mechanisms governing zzso zzso zzso but they are not suitable for the analysis of complex experimental zzso glow zzso On the other hand, simplified descriptions, as mixed or general order zzso require many additional assumptions that may limit the zzso of the results or are mostly zzso In this paper, the accuracy of such approximations has been evaluated for different zzso ratios and it has been found that differences between the fitted and the simulated parameters arise from the zzso of the models because zzso condition seems to be valid in all the considered zzso
