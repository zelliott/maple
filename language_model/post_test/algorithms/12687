Modern zzso zzso employs diverse software tools and multidisciplinary expertise to analyze zzso brain zzso The classical problems of gathering meaningful data, fitting specific models, and discovering appropriate analysis and zzso tools give way to a new class of zzso zzso of large and incongruous data, integration and zzso of zzso resources, and data zzso We zzso implemented and validated a new paradigm for addressing these challenges in the zzso zzso Our solution is based on the zzso Pipeline environment zzso zzso a zzso zzso environment for constructing and executing complex data processing zzso We developed zzso database and visual language programming zzso within the zzso Pipeline that enable the construction of complete, elaborate and robust zzso zzso for analyzing zzso and other zzso These zzso facilitate open sharing and communication of data and zzso concrete processing zzso result zzso and study replication among different investigators and research zzso The zzso Pipeline features include distributed zzso infrastructure, zzso execution environment, efficient integration, data provenance, validation and distribution of new zzso tools, automated data format conversion, and an intuitive zzso user zzso We demonstrate the new zzso Pipeline features using large scale zzso studies based on data from the International zzso for Brain zzso zzso and the Alzheimer's Disease zzso Initiative zzso zzso guides, zzso instructions and downloads of the zzso Pipeline environment are available at zzso
