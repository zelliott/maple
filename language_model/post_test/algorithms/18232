The minimal change in a stimulus property that is zzso by zzso has been often zzso using the receiver operating characteristic zzso curve, but recent studies introduced the use of the related Fisher information zzso Whereas zzso analysis and zzso zzso the information available for discriminating between two zzso global aspects of the information carried by a zzso are zzso by the mutual information zzso between stimuli and zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to be related to each other when zzso is zzso Here the responses of zzso recorded in the inferior zzso of zzso guinea pigs in response to ensembles of sounds differing in their zzso time differences zzso or zzso correlation zzso were zzso Although the zzso is not zzso large, there are strong relationships between zzso and zzso zzso measures are used to demonstrate the importance of the zzso statistics of these zzso These zzso may reflect the zzso of the zzso between stimuli and responses under constraints on the coded stimulus range and the range of firing zzso zzso whereas the zzso of zzso in conjunction with the zzso statistics of the spike trains, is enough to create zzso whose zzso discrimination capabilities are close to the behavioral limits, the same rule does not achieve zzso BC discrimination that is as close to behavioral zzso
