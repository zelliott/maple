zzso operator models zzso zzso hidden zzso models zzso and can be represented in a structurally similar zzso zzso The mathematical theory of zzso gives rise to a family of zzso fast, and zzso correct learning zzso whose statistical efficiency, however, depends zzso on the zzso of two auxiliary transformation zzso This zzso task is zzso indeed, even zzso zzso accessible zzso criteria is not zzso Here we derive how a bound on the modeling error of an zzso can be expressed in terms of these auxiliary zzso which in turn yields an zzso procedure for them and finally zzso us with a complete learning zzso the zzso zzso Models learned by this zzso have an assured error bound on their zzso The performance of this zzso is illuminated by comparisons with two types of zzso trained by the zzso algorithm, with the zzso algorithm, another recently found learning zzso for zzso and with zzso state representations zzso & Sutton, 2001 ) trained by methods representing the state of the art in that zzso
