Artists use different means of stylization to control the focus on different objects in the zzso This allows them to portray complex meaning and achieve certain artistic zzso Most prior work on zzso rendering of videos, however, uses only a single painting style, with fixed global zzso irrespective of objects and their layout in the zzso This often leads to inadequate artistic zzso Moreover, brush stroke orientation is typically assumed to follow an everywhere continuous directional zzso In this paper, we propose a video painting system that accounts for the spatial support of objects in the images or videos, and uses this information to specify style parameters and stroke orientation for zzso zzso Since objects occupy distinct image locations and move relatively smoothly from one video frame to another, our zzso zzso rendering approach is characterized by style parameters that zzso vary in space and zzso zzso style parameters enable more artistic freedom, such as zzso increase or decrease of contrast, exaggeration or abstraction of different objects in the scene in a temporally coherent zzso
