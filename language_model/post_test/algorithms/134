The giant zzso zzso zzso has successfully invaded 19 European countries as well as parts of North zzso It has become a problematic species due to its ability to zzso native zzso and to cause public health zzso zzso population zzso to species invasion can help reconstruct invasion history and may promote more efficient management zzso We thus zzso levels of genetic variation and population genetic structure of zzso zzso in an invaded area of the western Swiss zzso as well as in its native range (the zzso using eight nuclear zzso zzso together with zzso DNA markers and zzso On both nuclear and zzso zzso native populations exhibited significantly higher levels of genetic diversity compared to invasive zzso confirming an important founder event during the invasion zzso zzso populations were also significantly more differentiated than native zzso zzso zzso analysis identified five clusters in the native range that corresponded to geographically and ecologically separated zzso In the invaded range, 10 clusters zzso Unlike native zzso invasive clusters were characterized by a mosaic pattern in the landscape, possibly caused by anthropogenic zzso of the species via roads and direct collection for ornamental zzso Lastly, our analyses revealed four main divergent groups in the western Swiss zzso likely as a consequence of multiple independent establishments of zzso zzso
