A unified, zzso single zzso zzso zzso approach to microbial zzso has been zzso zzso sequence typing zzso databases consist of known zzso of standardized zzso zzso Normally, seven fragments are zzso a sequence type zzso consists of the zzso of these fragments that are found in a particular zzso A computer program that can identify highly zzso sets of zzso in entire zzso databases has been zzso The zzso either define a particular zzso ST or provide a high value for zzso index of diversity zzso and may thus be generally zzso to that zzso zzso sets that are diagnostic for zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso sets for zzso zzso and zzso zzso were identified and real-time zzso methods to interrogate these zzso were zzso zzso zzso sets were also identified in other zzso zzso This widely zzso approach allows rapid genetic zzso of infectious zzso
