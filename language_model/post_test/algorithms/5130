The zzso working group has recently suggested a rigorous framework for clinical practice guidelines zzso addressing diagnostic tests and test strategies based on the impact of alternative approaches on zzso zzso The framework mandates explicit evidence zzso ratings of the quality of evidence, and specifying recommendations as strong or zzso 

To test the feasibility and performance of the zzso approach, we applied this framework to zzso issues in the diagnoses of deep zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso panel with interest in zzso and zzso development identified pertinent clinical zzso Our search for relevant studies included existing zzso and systematic zzso We summarized the data in form of evidence tables and developed recommendations including, when needed, a formal consensus zzso 

We provide three groups of recommendations for clinicians practicing in settings with access to different types of zzso tests -- highly sensitive, moderately sensitive, and no availability of zzso We consider the use of clinical prediction rules in guiding the diagnostic process, the potential for negative zzso or zzso ultrasound zzso to rule out disease, and the role of follow-up testing zzso following positive zzso result, zzso following negative zzso and serial zzso depending on the probability of zzso at the start of diagnostic zzso We recommend the zzso that clinicians without access to a highly or moderately sensitive zzso test rely on US to guide zzso zzso that those with access use the highly sensitive zzso to zzso in patients with low or moderate probability of zzso (by the Wells zzso whether US is zzso that in patients with low zzso probability zzso and a negative zzso zzso highly or moderately zzso they follow patients without further zzso that in patients with high zzso probability they perform a zzso ultrasound without zzso zzso
