When phase shifting zzso zzso is employed for 3-D shape zzso the object must be kept zzso during the projection and acquisition of the multiple fringe zzso Errors will occur when the object moves and if the projection and capture of fringe patterns are not fast zzso In this paper, a new approach is proposed to tackle the problem, consisting of two zzso zzso the rotation zzso and translation zzso describing the movement of the object are estimated using a set of marks placing on the surface of the zzso Then the expressions of the fringe patterns under the influence of zzso object movement are zzso which are employed to determine the correct phase map, leading to accurate measurement of the zzso zzso and experiments are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed zzso
