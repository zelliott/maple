Research suggests that abnormal coordination patterns between the zzso and pelvis in the zzso plane observed in patients with Parkinson's disease and the elderly might be due to zzso in zzso trunk zzso The purpose of this study was to develop a tool to estimate zzso trunk zzso during walking and to investigate its functional zzso Fourteen healthy young subjects participated in this zzso They were instructed to walk on the treadmill and zzso data was collected by zzso motion analysis zzso zzso trunk zzso was estimated from the angular displacement between trunk segments and the amount of zzso around vertical axis of zzso The zzso due to arm swing zzso out the zzso due to the zzso trunk zzso during walking and the zzso rotation was of low zzso independent of changes in walking speeds within the range used in this study zzso zzso zzso zzso trunk zzso increased with increasing walking zzso zzso the suppression of zzso rotation of zzso may have a positive influence on head stability as well as allowing zzso between trunk zzso Furthermore, the increased zzso at increased walking speed would facilitate the higher frequency rotation of the trunk in the zzso plane required at the higher walking zzso
