The zzso of zzso in the pediatric population is zzso and the zzso of zzso is equal to zzso Sometimes, primary zzso and zzso overlap and only zzso can differentiate the two disorders but its use is complex, expensive and highly zzso The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the value of the clinical assessment associated with the patient's history in selecting children with zzso and to validate the therapeutic algorithm, thereby employing zzso only for selected zzso 

A population of 118 patients was considered, selected by means of a questionnaire that indicated zzso and a clinical evaluation that confirmed the zzso The studied group underwent clinical assessment complete with zzso survey as well as nocturnal pulse zzso zzso and zzso zzso Regardless of the zzso size, all the selected children underwent zzso and were evaluated after 3 months with the help of a zzso zzso examination and nocturnal pulse zzso 

In all the patients we witnessed the disappearance of zzso A zzso of children benefited from the surgical zzso A zzso continued to present minor zzso A zzso continued to snore in a zzso manner, but without zzso these children were zzso after a further 6 months with nocturnal pulse zzso and no zzso zzso was zzso There were no significant differences between the degree of upper airway obstruction and the surgical zzso 

The history and clinical exam are sensitive tools, even though relatively zzso Our results confirm the zzso of the history and clinical exam as a screening method as well as the role of the surgical procedure that can re-establish the zzso of the upper airways and to contrast the zzso zzso as a result of the effect of the surgical zzso If it is true that primary zzso and zzso are a zzso our approach regarding surgery may be defined as a form of prevention regarding a pathology with potential zzso zzso cannot be carried out routinely due to the lack of zzso zzso and because of its excessive zzso It is an option to be used only in unsuccessful zzso and for those children who have complicated presentations from the zzso
