An automated zzso for zzso breast tissue types based on optical zzso zzso zzso data is zzso Eight parameters are derived from the zzso zzso profiles and their means and zzso zzso are calculated for each tissue type from a training set zzso zzso selected based on zzso zzso A zzso discrimination score is then used to assess the samples from a validation zzso The zzso results for a set of 89 breast tissue samples were correlated with the zzso findings, yielding specificity and sensitivity of zzso If further perfected to work in real time and yield even higher sensitivity and zzso this zzso would be a valuable tool for biopsy guidance and could significantly increase procedure reliability by reducing both the number of zzso zzso and the number of false zzso
