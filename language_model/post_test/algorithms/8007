Finding an accurate approximation of a discriminating function in order to evaluate its zzso is a common problem in the field of machine zzso A new type of neural network, the zzso generates a complicated wave function whose global maximum value is crucial for zzso zzso To obtain an zzso approximation of this zzso we present a zzso scheme based on zzso supported zzso zzso zzso by the zzso architecture as well as zzso method, this scheme stems from the zzso analysis zzso developed in the theory of zzso This approximation method will be performed, first, one scale at a time and, second, as a global zzso zzso will be proved and results zzso
