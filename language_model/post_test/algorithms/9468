The definition of a distance measure plays a key role in the evaluation of different zzso solutions of gene expression zzso In this empirical study we compare different zzso solutions when using the Mutual Information zzso measure versus the use of the well known zzso distance and zzso correlation zzso 

Relying on several public gene expression zzso we evaluate the zzso and separation scores of different zzso zzso It was found that the use of the zzso measure yields a more significant differentiation among erroneous zzso zzso The proposed measure was also used to analyze the performance of several known zzso zzso A comparative study of these zzso reveals that their zzso zzso are ranked almost zzso when using different distance measures, despite the found correspondence between these measures when zzso the averaged scores of groups of zzso 

In view of the results, further attention should be paid to the selection of a proper distance measure for analyzing the zzso of gene expression zzso
