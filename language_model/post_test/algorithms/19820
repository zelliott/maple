The respiratory related target motion and setup error will lead to a large margin in the gastric zzso The purpose of this study is to investigate the zzso benefit and the possibility of incorporating the zzso zzso technique with online zzso zzso in the zzso gastric cancer zzso 

zzso errors and target motions of 22 zzso gastric cancer patients with surgical clips were zzso zzso movement was recorded using the digital zzso and the probability distribution functions zzso of the target motions were created for both the free breathing zzso and zzso zzso For zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso treatment plans, zzso the free breathing treatment plan zzso and the zzso zzso treatment plan zzso using the same beam parameters were performed among 6 randomly selected zzso Different margins for FB and zzso plans were zzso The plan dose map was convoluted with various zzso of the setup errors and the target zzso Target coverage and dose to zzso at risk were compared and the zzso probability was zzso 

The mean setup errors were zzso in the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso (AP) zzso The mean target motion for the free breathing zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso direction, zzso The target coverage was comparable for all the original zzso zzso showed lower dose to the liver compared with zzso zzso but no significant difference in the zzso zzso zzso showed better sparing in zzso zzso and similar in liver zzso 

Combining zzso technique with online image guided zzso can minimize the organ motion and improve the setup zzso The zzso comparison showed the dose could be escalated to zzso without increasing the critical zzso zzso although further clinical data is zzso
