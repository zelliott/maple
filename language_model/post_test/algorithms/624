zzso zzso a component of zzso fluid, buffers fluid loss from zzso To explain this, a quantitative theory for zzso concentration zzso at a partially zzso zzso lining was zzso The theory predicts a fall in zzso reflected fraction R with increased zzso zzso To test this, knees of zzso rabbits were infused with zzso and zzso zzso at constant zzso zzso rates of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso mixed zzso fluid and zzso fluid after zzso 3 h were zzso by zzso liquid zzso R was calculated as (1 - zzso zzso using zzso to adjust for joint zzso dilution in zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration after zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 31), exceeded the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso and zzso zzso were reduced relative to zzso The changes in zzso demonstrated zzso molecular zzso of zzso R from cavity to zzso zzso fell zzso from zzso at 6 zzso zzso to zzso at 89 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis, zzso zzso R values calculated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso or the low zzso zzso zzso were similar negative functions of zzso zzso R for zzso zzso zzso zzso calculated from zzso concentration ratios, was effectively zero zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confirming that zzso not initial zzso zzso is the reflection zzso zzso zzso of the results evaluated the zzso zzso reflection zzso as zzso In conclusion, the existence of concentration zzso during joint fluid drainage was supported by the demonstration of a negative relation between zzso rate and zzso zzso and zzso
