The zzso layer zzso zzso cell extends its zzso tree to all six layers of the zzso zzso and serves as a major building block for the cortical zzso zzso zzso cells have been the subject of extensive experimental and modeling studies, yet zzso models of these cells that faithfully reproduce both their zzso zzso behavior as well as key zzso active properties, including zzso spikes and zzso action zzso are still zzso Based on a large body of experimental recordings from both the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso cells in adult rats, we characterized key features of the zzso and zzso firing and zzso their zzso We used these features to zzso the density of a set of zzso channels over the zzso and zzso surface via zzso zzso with an evolutionary algorithm, thus generating a set of detailed zzso models that faithfully replicate the zzso action potential activated zzso spike firing and the zzso firing response to current steps, as well as the experimental zzso of the zzso Furthermore, we show a useful way to analyze model parameters with our sets of models, which enabled us to identify some of the mechanisms responsible for the dynamic properties of zzso zzso cells as well as mechanisms that are sensitive to zzso zzso This automated framework can be used to develop a database of faithful models for other zzso zzso The models we present provide several zzso predictions and can serve as a powerful tool for theoretical investigations of the contribution of zzso dynamics to network activity and its zzso zzso
