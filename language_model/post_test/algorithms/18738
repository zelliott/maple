The pulmonary circulation is influenced by the zzso nervous system, yet whether this is zzso important during exercise in man is not zzso The aim of this study was to assess the pulmonary vascular response to zzso induced by the maintained zzso of the muscle zzso in the zzso zzso Nine healthy subjects performed zzso zzso exercise at 50% of their zzso voluntary contraction force for 2 zzso Exercise was followed by circulatory zzso so as to maintain the muscle zzso activated for 2 zzso zzso circulatory zzso zzso Blood pressure zzso and zzso determined estimates of zzso pulmonary artery pressure zzso and cardiac output were obtained at various intervals throughout the two zzso Compared with baseline values, zzso in zzso (by zzso zzso zzso cardiac output (by zzso zzso zzso and mean zzso pressure zzso by zzso zzso zzso were noted during zzso exercise zzso zzso zzso all P zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso persisted during zzso (all P zzso zzso whereas cardiac output returned to resting zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso induced by zzso exercise affects the pulmonary zzso possibly by inducing zzso and/or stiffening the large zzso zzso The exaggerated zzso of the sympathetic nervous system that has been evidenced in zzso patients could therefore be implicated in their abnormal pulmonary zzso responses and intolerance of zzso
