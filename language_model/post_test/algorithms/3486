This paper describes zzso that can identify patterns of brain structure and function associated with Alzheimer's disease, zzso normal aging, and abnormal brain development based on imaging data collected in large human zzso Extraordinary information can be discovered with these zzso dynamic brain maps reveal how the brain grows in childhood, how it changes in disease, and how it responds to zzso zzso brain maps can reveal genetic influences on brain structure, shedding light on the zzso debate, and the mechanisms underlying inherited zzso zzso Recently, we created zzso movies of brain structure for a variety of zzso These identify complex, shifting patterns of brain structural deficits, revealing where, and at what rate, the path of brain deterioration in illness deviates from zzso zzso criteria can then identify situations in which these changes are zzso accelerated, or when medication or other interventions slow zzso In this paper, we focus on describing our approaches to map structural changes in the zzso These methods have already been used to reveal the profile of brain anomalies in studies of zzso zzso depression, zzso and zzso zzso bipolar disorder, zzso disorder, fetal alcohol syndrome, zzso syndrome, Williams syndrome, and in methamphetamine zzso Specifically, we describe an image analysis pipeline known as cortical pattern matching that helps compare and pool cortical data over time and across zzso Statistics are then defined to identify brain structural differences between groups, including localized zzso in cortical zzso gray matter density zzso and zzso in cortical zzso zzso features, not seen in individual brain scans, often emerge when zzso brain data are averaged in this zzso zzso examples are presented to show the profound effects of development and various diseases on the human zzso zzso spreading waves of gray matter loss are tracked in zzso and zzso and these sequences are related to normally occurring changes in healthy subjects of various zzso
