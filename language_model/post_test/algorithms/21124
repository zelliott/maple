We introduce the zzso zzso for de zzso detection of zzso motifs and zzso in zzso zzso zzso models the zzso genes within one species as sharing a core zzso motif and each zzso gene group as sharing a zzso zzso module zzso characterized by a similar composition of zzso Without using a predetermined alignment result, zzso zzso updates the core motif shared by zzso genes and traces the zzso zzso that contain the core zzso zzso achieved substantial improvements in both precision and recall as compared with peer zzso on a number of synthetic and real data zzso zzso zzso to analyze the binding regions of the zzso factor zzso zzso factor in embryonic stem cells zzso we discovered a motif that differs from a previously published zzso motif identified by a zzso experiment, but the new motif is consistent with zzso zzso The zzso motif was found to be a collaborating motif to the zzso motif in zzso We used quantitative zzso zzso zzso analysis to test whether zzso could distinguish functional and zzso binding zzso All seven tested binding sites in zzso zzso had higher zzso signals as compared with the other seven tested binding sites located outside of predicted zzso zzso is available at zzso
