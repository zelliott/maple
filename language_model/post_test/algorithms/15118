The mechanism of organic zzso evaporation during zzso and its role during zzso zzso has been zzso zzso and zzso studies were carried out in a zzso zzso filled with zzso zzso solution, which was maintained at constant temperature and constant stirring rate in the turbulent zzso zzso of dissolved zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was examined by the decline in organic zzso concentration in the zzso bath, which was monitored by gas zzso The evaporation from the bath followed zzso zzso under dilute conditions zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso yielding an overall zzso zzso zzso The value of P was theoretically related to the zzso zzso of turbulence under conditions that favor zzso transport zzso According to theory, factors that favored zzso control (as opposed to zzso zzso were those that favored a high Henry's law constant zzso elevated temperature near the normal boiling point zzso of the organic zzso and properties of the dissolved organic zzso zzso low normal zzso and low zzso zzso These theoretical hypotheses were confirmed by zzso zzso the zzso determined P with process variables raised to the appropriate power according to theory, zzso zzso zzso zzso P approximately zzso speed, zzso zzso diameter, d zzso volume of zzso bath, zzso and the product of zzso zzso and diffusion zzso zzso zzso and zzso illustrating that at constant temperature, the tendency of the evaporation system to obey zzso transport control follows the same order of increasing Henry's law constant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To establish the relationship of evaporation with zzso zzso the decline in zzso concentration was determined in both the continuous and dispersed zzso zzso during zzso By applying a mass balance with respect to zzso in the zzso bath, the cumulative zzso profile of the zzso was accurately predicted from the zzso functions of the zzso of zzso loss from the bath with and without zzso zzso These results have potential use for zzso zzso design of zzso apparatus, and scale up of zzso zzso
