The zzso zzso c zzso zzso signal has potential as a clinical marker of changes in zzso oxygen zzso We examine the zzso signal response to reduced oxygen delivery in the healthy human zzso We induced a reduction in zzso oxygen zzso from baseline levels to zzso in eight healthy adult humans, while minimizing changes in end tidal carbon dioxide zzso We measured changes in the cerebral zzso of oxidized zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using broadband zzso zzso zzso and estimated changes in cerebral oxygen delivery zzso using pulse zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are presented as median zzso zzso At the zzso of zzso zzso decreased by zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso decreased by zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso total zzso concentration increased by zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and change in zzso difference concentration zzso decreased by zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso Change in zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso but not with either change in total zzso concentration or zzso This is the first description of cerebral zzso during zzso in healthy zzso Studies are ongoing to investigate the clinical relevance of this signal in patients with traumatic brain zzso
