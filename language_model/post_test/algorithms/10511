In this paper, we present an zzso reconstruction zzso for discrete zzso called discrete zzso reconstruction technique zzso DART can be applied if the scanned object is known to consist of only a few different compositions, each corresponding to a constant gray value in the zzso Prior knowledge of the gray values for each of the compositions is exploited to steer the current reconstruction towards a reconstruction that contains only these gray zzso Based on experiments with both simulated CT data and experimental zzso data, it is shown that DART is capable of computing more accurate reconstructions from a small number of projection images, or from a small angular range, than alternative zzso It is also shown that DART can deal effectively with noisy projection data and that the zzso is robust with respect to errors in the zzso of the gray zzso
