A new zzso using the geometric active zzso model with the fusion of color and intensity zzso to segment medical images is presented in this zzso The prior knowledge used here are zzso defined in different color spaces and represented as thresholds searched by the genetic zzso Then the prior knowledge is merged into active zzso model with its zzso evolution by the level set zzso The experiments on clinical zzso images and zzso have successfully demonstrated its superiority of the proposed zzso over the existing active zzso models which deal with image zzso zzso
