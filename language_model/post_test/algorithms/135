Although zzso gastric bypass zzso is a highly effective treatment for clinically severe zzso not all patients achieve desirable weight loss and zzso There is some evidence that weight loss can induce a disproportionate reduction in resting zzso rate zzso This reduction in zzso can be related to zzso mass zzso loss, as zzso is the greatest responsible for variations in energy expenditure at zzso zzso low zzso zzso rate may zzso surgical patients to weight zzso 

zzso individuals were divided into two groups: patients who have kept a healthy weight 2 years after surgery and patients who showed weight regain of at least 2 zzso 2 years after the zzso zzso patients have signed a consent zzso Body mass index and excess weight loss were zzso zzso and body fat percentage were zzso zzso is a zzso component that can be zzso into muscle mass and zzso zzso The zzso was calculated as the result of zzso total fat weight from total body weight in zzso We also wanted to know if the zzso formulas to assess zzso overestimate energy expenditure in these zzso zzso tests were used to analyze the two zzso 

We found out that the zzso of the weight regain group was statistically inferior to the mean of the healthy weight zzso difference between the two groups was about 260 zzso We also found out that the zzso formulas overestimate the zzso in the weight regain zzso 

This study suggests that a lower zzso may contribute to weight regain in patients who undergo zzso It is important to ensure ways to elevate energy expenditure in the patient, such as increasing the percentage of zzso mass in the body and the practice of physical zzso
