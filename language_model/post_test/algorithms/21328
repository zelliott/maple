zzso complementary zzso are useful zzso zzso for the detection of zzso and genes zzso proteins for which only a partial zzso acid sequence is zzso Usually this involves the synthesis of zzso of zzso complementary to all possible bases in zzso positions of zzso As an alternative we have prepared and characterized a series of unique zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso parameters and the melting temperatures of hybrid duplexes containing zzso and zzso base pairs showed that they are considerably more stable than duplexes containing zzso and zzso base zzso The stability of a duplex decreased zzso with the number of zzso introduced at positions at least a zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso detects rat liver zzso zzso zzso on a zzso gel zzso with a zzso temperature only 10 degrees C below the measured melting temperature in zzso We suggest that the complexity of zzso zzso used for screening gene libraries can be reduced by the design of single zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso to pair with zzso or zzso zzso to pair with zzso or zzso and zzso to pair with zzso or zzso at positions of zzso zzso still retain zzso stability of hybrid zzso
