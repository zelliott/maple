A limitation in traditional zzso population zzso model building is the difficulty in handling interactions between model zzso To address this issue, a method was previously introduced which couples zzso zzso zzso and model fitness evaluation to a zzso hybrid genetic zzso for global zzso of the model zzso In this study, the zzso of this approach for zzso model building is evaluated by comparing zzso correct and zzso zzso relationships in a simulated zzso resulting from automated zzso zzso zzso zzso methods, and zzso hybrid genetic zzso approaches to zzso identification and zzso information criteria values, model structures, zzso and model zzso values resulting from manual zzso versus zzso hybrid genetic zzso approaches to model building for seven zzso Both manual zzso and zzso hybrid genetic zzso approaches to model building were applied, blinded to the results of the other approach, for selection of the compartment structure as well as inclusion and model form of zzso and zzso zzso residual error, and zzso from a common set of model zzso For the simulated zzso zzso zzso modeling identified three of four true zzso and two zzso zzso zzso identified two of four true and 0 zzso zzso and the zzso hybrid genetic zzso identified three of four true zzso and one zzso zzso For the clinical zzso the zzso information criterion was a median of zzso points lower zzso of zzso point decrease to zzso point zzso for the best zzso hybrid zzso candidate model versus the final manual zzso model: the zzso information criterion was lower by greater than 10 points for four compounds and differed by less than 10 points for three zzso The root mean squared error and absolute mean prediction error of the best zzso hybrid genetic zzso candidates were a median of zzso points higher zzso of zzso point decrease to zzso point zzso and zzso points lower zzso of zzso point decrease to zzso point zzso respectively, than that of the final zzso zzso In addition, the best zzso hybrid genetic zzso candidate models had successful convergence and zzso steps for each compound, used the same compartment structure as the manual zzso approach for 6 of 7 zzso zzso compounds, and identified 54 % (7 of zzso of zzso included by the manual zzso approach and 16 zzso relationships not included by manual zzso zzso The model zzso values between the final manual zzso and best zzso hybrid genetic zzso models differed by a median of zzso % zzso zzso zzso % and zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, the zzso hybrid genetic zzso approach was able to identify models capable of zzso zzso rate parameters for four compounds that the manual zzso approach did not zzso The zzso hybrid genetic zzso represents a general zzso model building methodology whose ability to rapidly search the feasible solution space leads to nearly equivalent or superior model fits to zzso zzso
