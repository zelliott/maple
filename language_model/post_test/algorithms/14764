This work presents a new approach for collaboration among sensors in Wireless Sensor zzso These networks are composed of a large number of sensor zzso with constrained zzso limited zzso zzso memory, power sources, zzso Nowadays, there is a growing interest in the integration of Soft zzso technologies into Wireless Sensor zzso However, little attention has been paid to zzso zzso zzso Systems into collaborative Wireless Sensor zzso The objective of this work is to design a collaborative zzso network, in which each sensor zzso an adapted zzso zzso System, which presents significant advantages such zzso experts can define zzso knowledge with uncertainty and zzso collaborative knowledge can be separated from control or modeling knowledge and the collaborative approach may support neighbor sensor failures and communication zzso As a real-world application of this approach, we demonstrate a collaborative modeling system for zzso in which an alarm about the development of olive tree fly is zzso The results show that zzso sensors are suitable for a wide range of applications and that the behavior of a zzso sensor may be modified by zzso and knowledge of neighbor sensors in order to obtain a more accurate and reliable zzso
