zzso image zzso such as the reconstruction of zzso zzso projection values, of zzso data, zzso zzso zzso or zzso events, and of magnetic resonance imaging data is zzso very zzso One of the most time-consuming steps is the zzso Recently, a novel general purpose architecture zzso for distributed computing became zzso the cell broadband engine zzso To maximize image reconstruction speed we modified our zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and our perspective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cone beam for flat-panel zzso and zzso the code for the zzso The zzso are zzso or zzso driven, run with floating point accuracy and use linear zzso or nearest neighbor zzso zzso between detector zzso For the zzso case, 512 projections per half zzso zzso detector channels, and an image of size zzso was zzso The zzso zzso performance was assessed by zzso a full circle scan of 512 projections of size zzso into a volume of size zzso zzso The field of view was chosen to completely lie within the field of measurement and the zzso or zzso size was set to zzso to the detector element size projected to the center of rotation divided by square root of zzso Both the PC and the zzso were clocked at 3 zzso For the parallel zzso of 512 projections into a zzso image, a zzso of 11 zzso zzso and 15 zzso zzso was measured on the PC, whereas the zzso achieved 126 zzso zzso and 165 zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of 512 projections into the zzso volume took zzso zzso on the PC and is as fast as zzso s on the zzso zzso the cell greatly zzso today's zzso zzso based on zzso processing zzso Using both zzso of our dual zzso blade zzso Computer zzso allows to zzso zzso 330 zzso and one can complete the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
