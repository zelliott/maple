The imaging performance of a high-resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso system employing liquid xenon zzso as the zzso detection medium was zzso The arrangement comprises a ring of detectors consisting of zzso zzso time projection zzso chambers and two zzso of large area avalanche zzso for the measurement of zzso charge and zzso zzso A key feature of the zzso system is the ability to identify individual zzso interactions with high energy resolution and high spatial resolution in three dimensions and determine the correct interaction sequence using Compton reconstruction zzso The simulated zzso imaging performance was evaluated by computing the noise equivalent count rate, the sensitivity and point spread function for a point source according to the zzso zzso The image quality was studied with a zzso zzso zzso of these simulation studies included noise equivalent count rate zzso at zzso zzso at 188 zzso zzso zzso at 184 zzso for an energy window of zzso zzso and a coincidence window of 1 zzso for mouse zzso zzso The absolute sensitivity at the center of the field of view was zzso zzso zzso and zzso resolutions of zzso point sources reconstructed with a zzso maximum likelihood expectation zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso at zzso throughout the field of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso diameter were resolvable in the zzso image of a zzso zzso The simulations show that a zzso system would provide new capabilities for significantly enhancing PET zzso
