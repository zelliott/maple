zzso impulse radio zzso sensors should comply entirely with the regulatory spectral limits for elegant zzso Under this premise, it is desirable for zzso zzso to improve frequency zzso to guarantee the transmission zzso Meanwhile, zzso zzso division zzso zzso is significant to mitigate mutual zzso in zzso sensor zzso zzso by the considerations, we suggest in this paper a low complexity pulse forming technique, and its efficient zzso on zzso is zzso The zzso pulse is derived preliminarily with the objective of minimizing the mean square error zzso between designed power spectrum density zzso and the zzso zzso zzso this pulse is zzso modified until its zzso completely zzso to spectral zzso The zzso restriction is then analyzed and different zzso have been zzso zzso demonstrates that our technique can produce zzso zzso with frequency zzso far zzso the other existing signals under arbitrary spectral mask zzso Compared to other zzso design schemes, the designed zzso can maintain mutual zzso without any penalty on frequency zzso and zzso are much superior in a zzso network, especially with synchronization zzso
