This paper presented the usage of statistics over the set of the features representing the electroencephalogram zzso zzso Since zzso is more accurate when the pattern is simplified through representation by important features, feature extraction and selection play an important role in zzso systems such as neural zzso zzso zzso neural network zzso zzso were formulated and used as basis for detection of zzso zzso Three types of zzso signals zzso signals recorded from healthy volunteers with eyes open, zzso patients in the zzso zone during a zzso zzso and zzso patients during zzso zzso were zzso The selected zzso zzso zzso zzso and the power levels of power spectral density zzso values obtained by zzso methods of the zzso signals were used as zzso of the zzso trained with zzso zzso The zzso results confirmed that the proposed zzso has potential in detecting the zzso zzso
