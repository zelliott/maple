A zzso sampling approach is proposed for dynamic zzso with Cartesian zzso It relies on the use of sampling patterns composed of several different zzso and exploits an image model where only some parts of the image are zzso whereas the rest is assumed zzso Given the parameters of such an image model, the methodology followed for the design of a zzso sampling pattern adapted to the model is zzso The zzso approach is compared to zzso zzso as used by traditional acceleration methods such as zzso zzso by zzso the zzso using the zzso zzso or zzso zzso and random sampling used by modern compressed zzso zzso On the considered image model, it allows more flexibility and higher zzso than lattice sampling and better performance than random zzso The method is illustrated on a zzso carotid blood zzso mapping MR zzso Combining the zzso approach with the zzso technique allows up to zzso acceleration zzso zzso and in zzso zzso results validate the zzso Compared to lattice and random zzso zzso sampling provides significant gains at high acceleration zzso
