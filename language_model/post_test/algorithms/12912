A new upper bound on the capacity of zzso and zzso optical wireless links using selection transmit diversity over exponential atmospheric turbulence channels with intensity zzso and direct detection is derived when zzso zzso keying zzso formats are zzso In this strong turbulence zzso optical zzso scenario, average capacity is investigated subject to an average optical power constraint and not only to an average electrical power constraint when the transmit diversity technique assumed is based on the selection of the optical path with a greater value of zzso zzso results for the mutual information are further demonstrated to confirm the zzso results for different diversity zzso
