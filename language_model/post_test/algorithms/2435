zzso zzso from certain zzso zzso structural zzso and zzso zzso in tissue is altered by zzso We evaluate the potential of these changes in zzso to predict a diagnosis of zzso and to estimate the risk of developing zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were interrogated over zzso zzso and zzso was collected from 290 to zzso Two hundred zzso zzso were performed on 49 zzso patients undergoing zzso Data are analyzed using parallel factor analysis to determine zzso and zzso zzso of the underlying zzso that contribute to the total detected zzso zzso 

Using zzso normal distribution fits and zzso techniques, sensitivity and specificity of zzso and zzso respectively, are achieved when zzso zzso samples versus others, while zzso and zzso respectively, are achieved when zzso normal zzso patients as being either at zzso or low-risk of developing zzso cancer based on their personal and family history of zzso Performance of zzso cancer increases when the normal group does not include benign zzso and zzso zzso Performance of zzso versus low-risk zzso decreases when normal samples include both zzso and zzso zzso zzso over zzso and zzso respectively, have the best diagnostic performance for cancer detection and zzso zzso 

Assessing the zzso zzso could be useful in screening women at increased risk of developing zzso zzso
