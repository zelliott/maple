The process of artificial zzso of zzso olive oil due to heating in an zzso atmosphere was studied by testing an actual kinetic model of the process and monitoring the zzso zzso degradation of the zzso contained in zzso To this end, a series of zzso degradation experiments were carried out on zzso olive oil samples under zzso conditions at 98, zzso zzso zzso and 180 degrees C using a zzso silicon oil zzso The experimental procedure used in this study carefully followed the recommendations regarding the study of olive oil zzso set out in the zzso zzso The change in zzso concentration with time was monitored at selected temperatures using a zzso zzso operating in an organic phase zzso The zzso energy for the zzso degradation process determined using the zzso method was found to be practically constant throughout most of the zzso Furthermore, the application of the so-called zzso method to this process enabled the specific constant rates to be determined at the zzso selected zzso In addition, a confirmation of the zzso energy value was obtained by the zzso method and the zzso of the kinetic model equation zzso the experimental curve representing the whole process was zzso Finally, further very interesting observations were made, for instance, the zzso concentration values of zzso at selected temperatures between 98 and 180 degrees zzso
