In this brief, a synthesis procedure for cellular neural networks zzso with zzso cloning templates is zzso The design zzso is based on the use of the evolutionary zzso of the particle swarm zzso zzso with the application to zzso zzso The proposed synthesis procedure takes into account requirements in terms of zzso to zzso zzso zzso results show that the networks also guarantee good performances in terms of correct recall in the presence of noisy zzso
