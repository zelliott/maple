A fast zzso measurement sequence using inversion recovery zzso zzso imaging at steady state zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso time for a full zzso recovery is not required in the zzso saving acquisition time significantly for high-resolution zzso zzso Imaging parameters of the zzso zzso SS sequence were zzso to minimize the bias from the zzso zzso zzso and to maximize the accuracy and reliability of zzso zzso which are critical for its zzso Compared with the conventional inversion recovery zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso SS method preserves similar accuracy and zzso while saving zzso in acquisition zzso zzso zzso zzso SS provided quantitative zzso mapping with 1 zzso 1 zzso 4 zzso resolution and zzso coverage zzso zzso in approximately 4 zzso
