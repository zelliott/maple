Is discrimination of the envelope of an acoustic signal based on spectral or zzso zzso To investigate this question for the cricket zzso zzso pattern envelopes were constructed by the addition of several sine waves and modified by systematic phase zzso The zzso response of female zzso towards such zzso but also zzso pulse patterns was zzso on a locomotion zzso zzso patterns that exhibited a zzso frequency of 25 zzso as the dominant frequency were attractive and although changes of phase modified the zzso pattern, the values of attractiveness remained zzso zzso of the zzso component reduced the zzso zzso zzso in which other frequency components exhibited a larger zzso than the zzso component were less zzso However, the combination of an unattractive pulse period with the attractive zzso frequency of 25 zzso in a pattern revealed that such stimuli were unattractive despite the presence of the zzso zzso A comparison of the attractiveness of all patterns revealed that female zzso evaluated the duration of pulse period over a wide range of duty zzso The combined evidence showed that pattern envelopes were processed in the zzso and not in the spectral zzso
