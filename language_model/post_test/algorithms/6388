The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of the zzso stimulant zzso zzso on the zzso response rate and on the parameters k and zzso of zzso zzso In the first experiment, rats were trained on a multiple variable zzso zzso zzso Each rat was then given two zzso injections of a randomly assigned zzso dose zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at 48 h zzso The overall response rate, the individual VI response rate, and the k and zzso parameters of the zzso equation were zzso In the second experiment, two groups of animals were trained drug-free on the same zzso zzso the animals in one group received six zzso injections of zzso zzso zzso at 48 h intervals while subjects in the other group received vehicle injections, 15 zzso before each experimental zzso Seven days after the last injection, a challenge dose zzso zzso of zzso was administered and performance was zzso zzso increased overall response rate and decreased zzso without changing zzso Previous exposure to zzso did not induce zzso of these zzso These results indicate that zzso has similar effects on k and zzso as those produced by other indirect zzso agents, and supports previous findings suggesting zzso as a potential drug of zzso
