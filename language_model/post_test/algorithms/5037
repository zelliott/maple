zzso of zzso networks is studied using tools from zzso approximation and integration zzso For functions with suitable integral representations in the form of networks with infinitely many hidden units, upper bounds are derived on the speed of decrease of approximation error as the number of network units zzso These bounds are obtained for various norms using the framework of zzso zzso zzso are applied to zzso zzso
