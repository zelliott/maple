Though highly desirable, neither a single experimental technique nor a zzso approach can be sufficient enough to zzso a protein zzso The incorporation of zzso constraints, which can be rationalized based on conventional zzso zzso might lead to considerable improvement of the simulation zzso In this regard, our analysis of 180 proteins in different zzso states allows prediction of the overall protein dimension based on the chain zzso zzso the protein molecular weight, with an accuracy of zzso
