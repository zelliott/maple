In this paper, we present a carrier phase recovery zzso zzso using a modified zzso zzso based phase locked loop zzso combined with a zzso zzso phase zzso Compared to the original zzso zzso + zzso reduces the required buffer size using a novel zzso zzso In addition, by removing the differential zzso and employing zzso phase recovery it also improves the zzso In zzso we show that the laser zzso tolerance of zzso + zzso is comparable to blind phase search zzso algorithm, which is known to be one of the best zzso zzso in terms of performance for arbitrary zzso zzso In 28 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments, it is also demonstrated that zzso + zzso can increase the transmission distance by at least zzso compared to zzso for each of zzso Finally, the zzso complexity is discussed and a significant reduction is shown for our zzso with respect to zzso
