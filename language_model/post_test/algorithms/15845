A generalized decision tree or clinical zzso for treatment of high-risk zzso surgical patients was developed from a zzso model based on empirical zzso First, a large data bank was used to do the zzso zzso describe zzso zzso and oxygen transport patterns that zzso zzso zzso and tissue zzso functions in survivors and zzso zzso define optimal therapeutic goals based on the zzso oxygen transport values of high-risk zzso zzso zzso compare the relative effectiveness of alternative therapies in a wide variety of clinical and zzso zzso and zzso to develop criteria for zzso of therapy to the zzso of the zzso optimal goals using cardiac index zzso oxygen delivery zzso and oxygen consumption zzso as proxy outcome zzso Second, a general purpose zzso was generated from these data and tested in preoperatively zzso clinical trials of high-risk surgical zzso zzso outcome was demonstrated with this generalized zzso The concept that the zzso values represent zzso that have survival value has been zzso by several other zzso We now propose a unique approach to refine the generalized zzso to develop customized zzso and individualized decision analysis for each patient's unique zzso The present article describes a preliminary evaluation of the feasibility of artificial intelligence techniques to accomplish individualized zzso that may further improve patient care and zzso
