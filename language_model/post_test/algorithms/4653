zzso vascular diseases are zzso able by zzso zzso zzso of these methods are that they are expensive, time-consuming and intolerable to critically ill zzso zzso as an inexpensive bedside method, promises to become an zzso Among other harmonic imaging methods, the diminution harmonic imaging zzso method is known, which determines zzso parameters by analyzing ultrasound contrast agent zzso diminution zzso based on constant zzso zzso The shortcoming of zzso is that the used mathematical model can only determine these parameters by least squares fitting the model onto the zzso 

In this work, the underlying mathematical model is further developed such that it becomes possible to directly calculate the parameters from the image zzso Furthermore, the new model offers an improved way to estimate the spatial distribution of the destruction zzso necessary for accurately determining the destruction power of the ultrasound pulse on the contrast zzso 

The direct calculation of the zzso zzso is much faster than the former fitting of the zzso zzso as well as destruction zzso are displayed as color-coded zzso In an example, a region with zzso deficits (as shown in a MR image of the same zzso is clearly zzso 

zzso the parameters as color-coded images zzso result interpretation for the diagnosing zzso The results are preliminary and still have to be zzso but they suggest that the new zzso model improves the significance of ultrasound as a diagnostic zzso
