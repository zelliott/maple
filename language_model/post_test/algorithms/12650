zzso learning methods are emerging as a valuable tool for decoding information from neural imaging zzso The noisy signal and the limited number of training patterns that are typically recorded from functional brain imaging experiments pose a challenge for the application of statistical learning methods in the analysis of brain zzso To overcome this difficulty, we propose using prior knowledge based on the behavioral performance of human observers to enhance the training of support zzso machines zzso We collect behavioral responses from human observers performing a categorization task during functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso We use the zzso function generated based on the observers behavioral choices as a distance constraint for training an zzso We call this method zzso zzso zzso Our findings confirm that zzso zzso zzso zzso
