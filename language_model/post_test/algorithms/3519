Recently Chen and zzso have demonstrated both zzso and zzso that their chaotic simulated zzso zzso has better search ability for solving zzso zzso problems compared to both the zzso approach and zzso simulated zzso zzso However, zzso may not find a globally optimal solution no matter how slowly zzso is carried out, because the chaotic dynamics are completely zzso In contrast, zzso tends to settle down to a global optimum if the temperature is reduced sufficiently zzso Here we combine the best features of both zzso and zzso thereby proposing a new approach for solving zzso problems, zzso zzso chaotic simulated zzso by using a noisy chaotic neural zzso We show the effectiveness of this new approach with two difficult zzso zzso problems, zzso a traveling salesman problem and a channel assignment problem for cellular mobile zzso
