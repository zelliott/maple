zzso zzso zzso offers the potential to more closely conform dose zzso to the target, and spare zzso at risk zzso Its clinical value is still being zzso The present study aims to compare zzso with zzso guided zzso zzso zzso for patients with medium size zzso brain zzso 

Five patients planned with zzso were zzso with the zzso method using the zzso system zzso zzso The planning target volume zzso and relevant zzso were zzso and compared relative to zzso plans using dose statistics, zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Oncology Group zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The median and mean zzso were 78 zzso and 85 zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso The differences in zzso doses for the whole group zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso achieved by zzso was zzso compared to zzso with zzso Using zzso guidelines, zzso plans provided acceptable zzso coverage for all zzso plans compared to minor coverage zzso in zzso zzso plans; acceptable zzso index for both plans zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and comparable conformity index zzso zzso As a consequence of the zzso method of arc delivery, the zzso nerves received mean and maximum doses that were zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso higher respectively with zzso zzso The maximum zzso zzso and zzso dose were zzso to zzso higher, and zzso lower respectively with zzso zzso However, all doses remained below the tolerance threshold (5 zzso for zzso and 50 zzso for zzso zzso and were clinically zzso 

The zzso method provided improved zzso coverage, albeit small, in this group of convex zzso Although the zzso doses were higher using the zzso plans, all doses remained within the clinically defined threshold and were clinically zzso Further improvements may be expected using other methods of zzso planning that do not limit the treatment delivery to zzso zzso Each zzso system needs to be individually assessed as the paradigm zzso may provide different zzso
