This paper presents an enhanced version of the previously proposed zzso inverse approach zzso to calculate zzso zzso forces and evaluates the proposed methodology in a comparative zzso zzso combines an inverse dynamic analysis with an zzso approach that zzso muscle physiology and zzso performance over the entire zzso To solve the resulting zzso zzso zzso problem, we neglected muscle zzso contraction speed and an approximate zzso zzso problem zzso was zzso zzso the enhanced version of zzso proposed in this paper takes into account muscle zzso contraction zzso The zzso problem is solved using a sequential convex zzso procedure zzso The comparative study includes zzso zzso and two commonly used approaches from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso muscle control zzso SO and zzso make simplifying assumptions to limit the zzso zzso Both methods zzso an instantaneous performance zzso Furthermore, SO does not impose muscle zzso All methods are applied to a gait cycle of six control zzso The relative root mean square error averaged over all subjects, zzso between the joint zzso simulated from the zzso zzso and the joint zzso obtained from the inverse dynamic analysis was about twice as large for SO zzso zzso zzso as compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was at least twice as large for zzso zzso zzso zzso than for all other zzso As compared with zzso muscle zzso patterns predicted by zzso better agree with experimental zzso zzso This study shows that imposing muscle physiology as well as globally zzso performance is important to accurately calculate zzso forces underlying zzso
