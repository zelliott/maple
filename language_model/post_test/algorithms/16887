A group test gives a positive zzso outcome if it contains at least zzso (at most zzso positive items, and an arbitrary outcome if the number of positive items is between thresholds zzso and zzso This problem introduced by zzso is called threshold group zzso It is a zzso of classical group zzso Chen and zzso extended this problem to the zzso version and first proposed efficient zzso zzso In this article, we extend threshold group testing to the zzso model in which a test has a positive outcome if it contains at least zzso zzso and at most zzso zzso By using zzso + k - zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso we provide zzso zzso for the threshold group testing model with zzso and at most zzso zzso The decoding complexity is zzso log zzso for fixed parameters zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
