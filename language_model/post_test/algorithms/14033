The purpose of this study was to find out whether zzso bone zzso on dental panoramic zzso zzso are statistically significantly different between zzso and zzso zzso We wanted to develop a simple method of common zzso analysis that could represent a simple, inexpensive and readily available screening tool for zzso 

zzso images of 36 women with primary osteoporosis were compared with 20 zzso images of zzso women of the same age zzso zzso zzso were zzso using public computer zzso zzso zzso was assessed by six zzso zzso zzso indexes were divided into zzso regarding the presence of zzso Relative bone density zzso was assessed using a zzso zzso zzso zzso Nine zzso indexes were calculated as relations of zzso values measured on specific sites of the zzso 

The zzso of average values of zzso indexes with and without a tooth were zzso to zzso times higher in the zzso group of zzso Average of zzso indexes differed statistically significantly between the groups zzso Three zzso indexes differed statistically significantly between groups zzso 

zzso bone zzso on zzso are statistically significantly different between zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso is statistically significantly lower in the zzso group of zzso We developed a simple method of common zzso analysis, which could represent a simple, inexpensive and readily available screening tool for zzso
