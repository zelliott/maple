The purpose of this study was to devise a simple method to determine whether or not a drug's zzso rate constant favored the selection of that drug for an oral zzso drug delivery system zzso Computer simulations were used to observe the drug zzso in the zzso the gastrointestinal zzso and the cumulative amount absorbed following administration of an zzso zzso and 24-hr zzso zzso For each zzso the drug's intrinsic zzso rate constant, zzso was systematically varied from zzso to 10 zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso controlled the zzso rate whenever drug release was zzso However, the release rate did not determine the length of time that a zzso controlled the zzso zzso Instead, the duration of zzso zzso increased as the zzso value zzso When zzso zzso or zzso 2 zzso the zzso controlled more than zzso of the zzso zzso and 24-hr dosing zzso zzso when zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso the zzso failed to control zzso In conclusion, this investigation developed a technique to ascertain the zzso step when a zzso zzso releases a drug that zzso zzso zzso This technique was employed to construct a zzso that allows its users to estimate the duration of control by an zzso zzso or 24-hr zzso based on the zzso value for the zzso
