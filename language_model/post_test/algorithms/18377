Level or jump detectors generate the reconstructed time series from a noisy record of zzso zzso The reconstructed time series is used to create zzso zzso for the kinetic analysis of the zzso model of the investigated zzso zzso It is shown here that some additional lines in the software of such a detector can provide a powerful new means of zzso zzso For each current level that can be recognized by the zzso an array is zzso The new software assigns every data point of the original time series to the array that belongs to the actual state of the zzso From the data sets in these zzso zzso are zzso zzso and experimental time series analyzed by zzso detectors are used to demonstrate the benefits of these zzso First, they can serve as a test of the reliability of jump and level zzso Second, they can reveal beta zzso as resulting from fast gating that would usually be hidden in the overall zzso zzso Probably the most valuable feature is that the malfunctions of the zzso detectors turn out to depend on the zzso model of the zzso zzso Thus, the errors revealed by the zzso can be used to distinguish between different putative zzso models of the measured time zzso
