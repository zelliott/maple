zzso element analysis has been widely used in the field of foot and footwear zzso to determine zzso pressures as well as stresses and strains within soft tissue and footwear zzso When dealing with anatomical structures such as the foot, zzso mesh generation accounts for most of the model development time due to geometric complexities imposed by branching and embedded zzso zzso zzso which can be more easily zzso has been the approach of choice to date in foot and footwear zzso Here we use the zzso finite element program zzso zzso Providence, zzso to examine the advantages and disadvantages of zzso and zzso elements under zzso and zzso zzso material zzso and zzso contact conditions, which are commonly seen in foot and footwear zzso This study demonstrated that for a range of simulation conditions, hybrid zzso elements zzso zzso consistently performed well while hybrid linear zzso elements zzso zzso performed zzso On the other hand, enhanced zzso zzso elements with improved stress zzso zzso zzso performed as well as the hybrid zzso elements in terms of contact pressure and contact zzso stress zzso Although the enhanced zzso zzso element simulations were zzso expensive compared to zzso element simulations in both barefoot and footwear conditions, the enhanced zzso zzso element zzso seems to be very promising for foot and footwear applications as a result of decreased labor and expedited model development, all related to facilitated mesh zzso
