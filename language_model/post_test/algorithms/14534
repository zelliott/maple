This paper presents a new three-dimensional zzso ultrasound reconstruction zzso for generation of zzso images from a series of two-dimensional zzso zzso acquired in the mechanical linear scanning zzso Unlike most existing zzso ultrasound reconstruction zzso which have been developed and evaluated in the zzso scanning zzso the new zzso has been designed to capitalize the zzso pattern of the mechanical linear zzso where all the zzso slices are precisely parallel and evenly zzso The new reconstruction algorithm, referred to as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a new zzso of the zzso zzso smoothing zzso The zzso filter has been improved upon the original zzso filter in two zzso First, the zzso indicator function has been incorporated into the least square cost function to enable the zzso filter to approximate zzso spaced data of the zzso image zzso contained in zzso zzso and reduce zzso noise of the observed image zzso contained in filled zzso Second, the zzso function has been zzso to the least squares cost function as a mechanism to balance between the degree of zzso reduction and the degree of detail zzso The zzso filter has been evaluated and compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso Reduction zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso Median zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso on reconstructing a synthetic zzso zzso image and a clinical zzso carotid artery zzso in the mechanical linear scanning zzso This preliminary evaluation indicates that the zzso filter is more effective in both zzso reduction and geometric reconstruction of zzso ultrasound images than the other zzso
