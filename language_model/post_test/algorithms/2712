zzso has become an important tool in zzso zzso zzso imaging systems based on the use of one or more pinhole zzso now reach zzso resolution but zzso suffer from a compromise between sensitivity and resolution due to the pinhole zzso We propose a zzso zzso system based not on zzso but on zzso zzso zzso which is rare in medical imaging systems for nuclear zzso The zzso zzso are zzso for 27 zzso for low-energy imaging with zzso We believe that this new system, zzso can simultaneously improve on sensitivity and resolution compared to today's state-of-the-art zzso A full three-dimensional simulation of the system has been performed including the zzso lenses, zzso and zzso and zzso zzso Images of zzso zzso have been reconstructed using an zzso image reconstruction zzso zzso was zzso zzso throughout the 1 zzso diameter zzso field of view and rod sizes of around 100 zzso diameter were distinguishable in the images of simulated zzso zzso These results indicate an increase in resolution by a factor of 5 during a simultaneous increase in sensitivity by a factor of 2 compared to the current state-of-the-art zzso zzso zzso
