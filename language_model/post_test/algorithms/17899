Network intrusion detection aims at distinguishing the attacks on the Internet from normal use of the zzso It is an indispensable part of the information security zzso Due to the variety of network behaviors and the rapid development of attack fashions, it is necessary to develop fast zzso intrusion detection zzso with high detection rates and low zzso zzso In this correspondence, we propose an intrusion detection zzso based on the zzso zzso In the algorithm, decision zzso are used as weak zzso The decision rules are provided for both zzso and continuous zzso By combining the weak zzso for continuous features and the weak zzso for zzso features into a strong zzso the relations between these two different types of features are handled naturally, without any forced zzso between continuous and zzso zzso zzso initial weights and a simple strategy for avoiding zzso are adopted to improve the performance of the zzso Experimental results show that our zzso has low zzso complexity and error rates, as compared with zzso of higher zzso complexity, as tested on the benchmark sample zzso
