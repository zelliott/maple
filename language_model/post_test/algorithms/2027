Reliable assignment of an unknown query sequence to its correct species remains a zzso problem for the growing field of DNA zzso While great advances have been achieved recently, species identification from zzso can still be unreliable if the relevant zzso has been insufficiently zzso We here propose a new notion of species membership for DNA zzso membership, based on fuzzy set zzso illustrate its successful application to four real data sets zzso fishes, butterflies and zzso with more than zzso random zzso Two of the data sets comprise especially dense zzso zzso In comparison with current DNA zzso methods, the newly proposed minimum distance zzso plus fuzzy set approach, and another zzso simple method, zzso close zzso outperform two zzso sophisticated zzso and zzso zzso The new method proposed here has great power in reducing zzso species identification compared with other methods when zzso of the query are absent from the reference zzso
