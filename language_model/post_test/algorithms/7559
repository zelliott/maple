This paper presents a set of effective and efficient features, namely strip features, for detecting objects in zzso zzso Although shapes of a specific class usually have large zzso zzso some basic local shape elements are relatively zzso Based on this zzso we propose a set of strip features to describe the appearances of those shape zzso Strip features capture object shapes with zzso and zzso strip patterns, which significantly enrich the efficient features such as zzso and zzso zzso The proposed features can be efficiently calculated via two kinds of zzso Moreover, the proposed features can be extended to a zzso version zzso zzso strip zzso to alleviate the zzso caused by zzso We zzso strip features for object detection under an improved boosting zzso which adopts a zzso criterion to balance the zzso and efficiency for feature zzso We evaluate the proposed approach for object detection on the public data sets, and the experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed zzso
