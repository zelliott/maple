A zzso shadow zzso zzso was used to measure the shape of the cat zzso with a normal mobile zzso and with an immobile zzso as it was zzso loaded with zzso zzso pressures up to zzso zzso The shape was monitored throughout the loading and unloading zzso and three complete cycles were zzso The zzso zzso were made in five zzso In three zzso the zzso was then immobilized with a drop of glue placed on the head of the zzso zzso zzso were calculated by zzso shape images zzso by zzso The zzso are presented in the form of zzso zzso shape and displacement images, of displacement profiles, and of zzso zzso for selected zzso zzso patterns with a mobile zzso show that zzso zzso are larger than zzso zzso with the maximum zzso displacement occurring in the zzso region in all cats except zzso zzso vary from cycle to cycle and display zzso For both the zzso and zzso cases, the zzso response is zzso The response is zzso with lateral zzso being larger than zzso zzso With a mobile zzso zzso zzso exhibit more pronounced asymmetry than do zzso zzso
