We study phase ordering dynamics of zzso periodic striped patterns on the zzso network that is derived from a two-dimensional regular lattice with zzso random zzso It is demonstrated zzso that addition of spatial disorder in the form of shortcuts makes the growth of zzso much slower or even frozen at late zzso
