The promising potential of cloud computing and its convergence with technologies such as mobile zzso wireless networks, sensor technologies allows for creation and delivery of newer type of cloud zzso In this paper, we advocate the use of cloud computing for the creation and management of cloud based health care zzso As a representative case study, we design a Cloud Based zzso Health Care Service zzso that performs real time monitoring of user health data for diagnosis of chronic illness such as zzso Advance body sensor components are zzso to gather user specific health data and store in cloud based storage zzso for subsequent analysis and zzso In addition, infrastructure level mechanisms are proposed to provide dynamic resource elasticity for zzso Experimental results demonstrate that zzso accuracy of zzso is achieved with our zzso system and the predicted patterns of CPU usage offer better opportunities for zzso resource zzso
