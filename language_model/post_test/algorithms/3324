We aim to construct higher order zzso methods for zzso simulating zzso chemical kinetic systems in this zzso By adding a random correction to the primitive zzso scheme in each time step, we greatly improve the accuracy of the zzso zzso This gain in accuracy actually comes from the reduction in the local zzso error of the scheme in the order of zzso the marching time step zzso While the local zzso error of the primitive zzso method is zzso for all moments, our zzso random correction zzso method, in which the correction term is a zzso random zzso can reduce the local zzso error for the mean to zzso and both zzso random correction zzso methods, in which the correction term is a zzso random zzso can reduce the local zzso error for both the mean and zzso to zzso zzso results demonstrate that these novel methods more accurately capture crucial properties such as the mean and zzso than existing methods for simulating chemical reaction zzso This work constitutes a first step to construct high order zzso methods for simulating jump zzso With further refinement and appropriately modified zzso selection procedures, the random correction methods should provide a viable way of simulating chemical reaction systems accurately and zzso
