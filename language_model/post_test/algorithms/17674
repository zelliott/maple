We present a real-time simulation system that enables modeled zzso systems to interact with physical experimental systems, and is specifically aimed towards execution of the dynamic clamp zzso Model reference current injection zzso operates under zzso Linux zzso or zzso and provides a simple zzso language for describing zzso system zzso Features include zzso of commands to implement zzso zzso the ability to output zzso zzso through any variable or zzso of the model, the means to conduct time zzso and assess the zzso performance of the real-time system, and an installation program that installs the software and accompanying device drivers with minimal input from the zzso Tested models operate as fast as 30 zzso with actual maximum rates dependent on model zzso We present sample models that exhibit the main features of the modeling zzso zzso demonstrate the abilities of the system by creating a hybrid network of real and simulated zzso and playing a zzso synaptic zzso into a synaptic zzso zzso We conclude by introducing a zzso reconstruction technique that is useful for establishing the presence of significant experimental error in zzso of the dynamic clamp zzso
