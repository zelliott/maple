The mean transit time of a zzso through a sample of tissue is a quantitative marker most closely related to regional tissue blood zzso zzso an accurate zzso of the mean time of transit of an zzso zzso through a sample of zzso zzso obtained by contrast zzso may provide a quantitative zzso estimate of zzso zzso We hereby present an zzso for the determination of the mean transit time by computerized analysis of a series of zzso zzso zzso The zzso comprises the evaluation of the zzso impulse response function of a selected region of interest, using a zzso technique based on a fast zzso transform and a frequency domain division of the zzso measured in the sample, by that measured in a predetermined reference zzso An extensive computer simulation study was designed to facilitate the zzso of the steps of zzso We present the results of the evaluation study performed in order to assess the accuracy of the procedure in zzso zzso zzso Within a wide range of parameters chosen to define these functions, the analysis is shown to be essentially independent of the rise and zzso times of the impulse response function of the tissue sample as well as of the simulated zzso The effects of random noise introduced into the simulated intensity zzso and of their variable zzso were zzso The mean transit time was found to be accurately evaluated within about zzso of error for the variety of zzso and noise levels zzso The zzso error did not correlate with the accuracy of the evaluation of the mean transit time, indicating that the zzso error cannot be used as an estimate of the accuracy of the zzso The zzso methods and the results of the computer study are discussed in zzso The approach is proposed to be used as part of a more general technique for the quantitative measurement of regional zzso tissue blood zzso
