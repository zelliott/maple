This study sought to determine whether aggressive zzso control zzso zzso would result in more optimal clinical outcomes and less morbidity than moderate zzso control zzso zzso in diabetic patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft zzso zzso 

Maintaining serum zzso levels between 120 and 180 zzso with continuous insulin infusions decreases morbidity in diabetic patients undergoing zzso zzso Studies in surgical patients requiring prolonged ventilation suggest that aggressive zzso control zzso zzso may improve zzso however, its effect in diabetic zzso patients is zzso 

zzso diabetic patients undergoing zzso were zzso zzso to aggressive zzso control zzso zzso or moderate zzso control zzso zzso using continuous intravenous insulin solutions zzso units regular insulin in 100 zzso normal zzso beginning at the induction of zzso and continuing for 18 hours after zzso zzso end points were the zzso of major adverse events zzso adverse events zzso 30-day zzso zzso zzso zzso events, deep zzso infections, and zzso zzso the level of serum zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso 

There were no differences in the zzso of major adverse events between the groups (17 moderate vs 15 zzso P zzso zzso Patients with aggressive control had a lower mean zzso at the end of 18 hours of insulin infusion zzso zzso 12 zzso moderate vs 103 zzso 17 zzso zzso P zzso zzso Patients with aggressive control had a higher zzso of zzso events (4 vs zzso P zzso zzso 

In diabetic patients undergoing zzso surgery, aggressive zzso control increases the zzso of zzso events and does not result in any significant improvement in clinical outcomes that can be achieved with moderate zzso Clinical zzso zzso zzso
