To compare the survival, zzso and cost of treating women with intermediate risk zzso cancer with zzso zzso cuff zzso versus observation followed by treatment for zzso zzso 

A zzso analysis was performed comparing two treatment strategies for intermediate risk zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso limited to the zzso with greater than 50% zzso invasion or poor differentiation or cervical zzso All patients undergo zzso zzso and zzso strategy zzso zzso cuff zzso strategy zzso Strategy 2 patients who develop zzso recurrence undergo diagnostic zzso followed by zzso and zzso All six principles of zzso analysis were zzso zzso actual payer costs were zzso not zzso 

Although the treatment for zzso cuff recurrence is expensive, since only zzso of patients develop a zzso zzso there was a zzso decreased cost by not treating patients with zzso zzso rate zzso zzso zzso Also, although the complication rate for zzso is greater than zzso since only zzso of patients develop a zzso recurrence and require zzso projected complication rates for the two strategies are zzso Survival would be decreased zzso by withholding zzso zzso zzso zzso With zzso high-dose rate zzso zzso 1), the cost per life saved would be zzso US zzso 

Using a zzso analysis, we have shown that withholding zzso zzso for patients with intermediate risk zzso cancer results in a zzso decrease in cost, has a similar radiation complication rate, and results in a zzso decrease in zzso
