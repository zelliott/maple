zzso of area based measures of breast density have led several research groups to develop zzso measures of breast density, for use in predicting risk and in zzso zzso In this paper, we describe our initial experiences using an automated zzso zzso mammogram form, zzso to estimate the volume of the breast that is dense from digitized film zzso We performed analyses on zzso zzso of zzso women, who were part of the zzso Alumni zzso and had zzso taken within the Scottish Breast zzso zzso between 1989 and zzso Absolute volume of dense breast tissue zzso zzso and the percentage of the volume of the breast that is dense zzso were zzso The median zzso zzso of zzso volume was 66 zzso zzso to zzso and of zzso was zzso zzso to zzso zzso but not zzso volume, was positively related to a six category zzso zzso of visually assigned zzso breast density zzso in zzso per category increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso produced lower zzso volume for zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso views, but zzso differences for zzso were zzso The mean zzso difference for zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso and of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso We present these initial data as a background for future zzso work using zzso
