zzso general knowledge from zzso screening data is made difficult by the significant amount of noise, arising primarily from false zzso in the zzso The paradigm established for screening an zzso zzso library on zzso support, an zzso library, has a significant amount of built-in zzso Because of this zzso the resulting data can be interpreted through a rigorous statistical analysis zzso thereby significantly reducing the number of false zzso Here, we develop the statistical models used to analyze data from zzso screens of zzso libraries to derive unbiased true hit zzso These hit rates can also be calculated on zzso of the collection such as those compounds containing a zzso acid or those with molecular weight below 350 zzso The relative value of the hit rate on the subset of the collection can then be compared to the overall hit rate to determine the effect of the zzso or physical property on the likelihood of a zzso having biological zzso Here, we show the effects that various functional groups and the standard physical properties, molecular weight, hydrogen bond donors, hydrogen bond zzso log zzso and zzso bonds, have on the likelihood of a compound being biologically zzso To our knowledge this is the first published account of the use of zzso screening data to zzso the effects of physical properties and zzso on the likelihood of compounds showing biological activity over a broad range of zzso relevant zzso
