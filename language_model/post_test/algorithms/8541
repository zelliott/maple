zzso zzso testing zzso is an useful method for identifying patients with zzso zzso but its role in the evaluation of therapeutic efficacy is zzso The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between negative zzso after therapy introduction zzso zzso and symptom recurrence during follow-up zzso zzso 

We studied 56 severely symptomatic patients (age 27 zzso 19 zzso with zzso (7 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Once empirical pharmacological therapy was zzso all patients underwent another zzso zzso evaluation test - zzso zzso was not modified after zzso zzso The probability of symptom recurrence was analyzed with the zzso method and compared by zzso test in patients with negative and positive zzso 

zzso zzso after therapy was related to a significantly lower probability of recurrence during follow-up zzso versus zzso in 12 months, zzso 

A good correlation exists between acute and long-term efficacy of pharmacological therapy for zzso zzso so that serial zzso may be considered a good method for identifying an effective therapeutic zzso
