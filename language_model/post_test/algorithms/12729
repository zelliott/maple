Bone age zzso rating is associated with a considerable zzso zzso which would be eliminated with an automated computerized zzso The aim of the study was to validate the zzso method, an automated determination of BA, in American children of four zzso 

The study is based on a publicly available database of hand zzso of healthy children, established in a zzso National Institutes of zzso zzso zzso of the left hand were recorded between 1993 and 2006 in Los Angeles, including zzso images with two independent manual BA ratings and 280 additional images for which the manual ratings were not zzso Images were evenly split between zzso African American, Hispanic, and Asian children, and the age range was zzso zzso 

The automated method analyzed all images with BA zzso years for boys and zzso years for zzso The zzso zzso error between the two manual ratings was zzso years, whereas the zzso zzso between the automated BA and the average of the two manual ratings was zzso zzso The mean BA minus age was zzso versus age for each sex and zzso The largest zzso from zero was seen for Hispanic and Asian children older than 12 years, who were about 1 year advanced relative to the zzso and Pyle zzso 

The automated method can analyze images of all zzso within a BA range of zzso years for boys and zzso years for girls, and can therefore eliminate the problem with zzso zzso in BA zzso
