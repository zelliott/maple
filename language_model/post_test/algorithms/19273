A new zzso zzso zzso to derive absolute dose maps from images acquired with the zzso zzso electronic portal zzso (based on zzso silicon zzso has been developed incorporating the dependence of detector response on primary and transmitted radiation and on field zzso zzso zzso and zzso validation were performed at different depths zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in solid water to investigate various application zzso zzso data were obtained against zzso chamber zzso zzso experiments were performed on zzso fields and comparison was carried out against calculated dose maps as well as against film zzso zzso fields were acquired independently and zzso images were summed zzso with the new zzso allowing complex fields to be verified in conditions most closely resembling clinical zzso Excellent results were obtained for the zzso zzso and zzso depths on a set of 34 modulated fields including both split and zzso zzso zzso the gamma index analysis (with distance to agreement and dose thresholds set to 3 zzso and zzso respectively), only zzso of the field area showed gamma zzso 1 at zzso zzso depth zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso and zzso with films at 10 zzso zzso Tests were also performed to verify zzso at zzso angles different from 0 zzso No statistical differences were obtained for the comparison between split and zzso fields and between different zzso zzso zzso significant statistical differences were obtained when comparing independent samples of 240 fields verified either with zzso or with zzso Fields verified with zzso presented a mean area with gamma zzso 1 of zzso zzso while for film this value was zzso zzso zzso zzso Absolute zzso proved to be reliable with the zzso detector with the zzso zzso The minimal settings at depths of zzso or zzso zzso would allow the use of the detector at any zzso angle without the need for any special fixation zzso
