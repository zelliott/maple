Recently zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso presented a new zzso reconstruction zzso for zzso zzso sag by zzso zzso An equivalent but simpler derivation of the model equations is zzso The zzso is tested on a sphere, a zzso and a zzso These tests reveal significant height errors that zzso with distance from the zzso zzso Additional zzso steps are introduced to circumvent these zzso A consistent and significant reduction in height errors is observed across the test zzso Finally, zzso used the zzso zzso p as a measure of zzso zzso Further investigation shows that the finite zzso representation affected the reported zzso The zzso should therefore be used with caution as an efficacy zzso
