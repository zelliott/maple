In magnetic resonance imaging zzso it is possible to cancel the effects of severe zzso of the magnetic field even if the field profile is zzso The new zzso method is based on zzso zzso zzso combined with two zzso zzso that are applied simultaneously during zzso and zzso zzso two- and three-dimensional images can be obtained in zzso fields where the breadth of the water resonance extends over several zzso
