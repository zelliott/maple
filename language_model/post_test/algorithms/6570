The main source of hypotheses on the structure and function of new proteins is their zzso to proteins with known zzso zzso relationships are typically established through sequence similarity searches, multiple alignments and zzso zzso In cases where the number of potential relationships is large, for example in zzso zzso with many thousands of members, alignments and zzso become zzso zzso accumulate errors and lose zzso In search of a better way to analyze relationships in large sequence zzso we have developed a zzso application, zzso zzso zzso of zzso which uses a version of the zzso graph layout zzso to zzso zzso sequence similarities in either two-dimensional or three-dimensional zzso
