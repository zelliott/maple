The zzso of the hidden structure of a population is an essential issue in population zzso Recently, several methods have been proposed to zzso population structure in population zzso 

In this study, a new method to zzso the number of clusters and to assign individuals to the zzso populations is zzso This approach does not make any assumption on zzso and linkage zzso The implemented criterion is the zzso (via a simulated zzso zzso of the averaged genetic distance between a zzso number of zzso The performance of this method is compared with two zzso zzso zzso and zzso using simulated data and also a real human data zzso 

The simulations show that with a reduced number of zzso zzso zzso the number of clusters and presents a reduced proportion of correct zzso The accuracy of the new method is approximately the same as for zzso Also, in zzso and linkage zzso cases, zzso performs zzso In these situations, zzso and the new method show an equivalent zzso with respect to the number of zzso zzso although the proportion of correct groupings is slightly better with the new zzso zzso equilibrium with the zzso procedures improves the precision of the zzso zzso All methods have a good precision for zzso zzso zzso but only zzso estimates the correct number of clusters for zzso as low as zzso In situations with a high number of clusters or a more complex population structure, zzso performs better than zzso and zzso The results for a human data set zzso with the new method are zzso with the geographical regions previously zzso 

This new method used to zzso the hidden structure in a population, based on the zzso of the genetic distance and not taking into consideration any assumption about zzso and linkage zzso performs well under different simulated scenarios and with real zzso zzso it could be a useful tool to determine genetically homogeneous groups, especially in those situations where the number of clusters is high, with complex population structure and where zzso and/or linkage equilibrium are zzso
