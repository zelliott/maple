To test the zzso ability of a new method for detecting local zzso cell loss using zzso optical zzso zzso zzso 

This study included 58 zzso and 48 healthy eyes from Japanese zzso Combined thickness of the zzso cell layer and inner zzso layer zzso was measured on a zzso cube scan in zzso zzso Average zzso thickness within a zzso elliptical zzso and minimum zzso thickness on 360 zzso extending from the inner to the outer radius of the elliptical zzso were zzso Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso to discriminate between healthy eyes and early zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared between zzso 

zzso were zzso glaucoma, and 15 were zzso zzso The mean minimum zzso thickness was zzso zzso in healthy eyes and zzso zzso in zzso eyes zzso zzso zzso For the zzso zzso the zzso of variation for average zzso and minimum zzso were zzso and zzso in zzso eyes, and zzso and zzso in healthy eyes, zzso Minimum zzso thickness zzso zzso was significantly higher zzso zzso zzso than average zzso thickness zzso for early glaucoma, whereas minimum zzso zzso zzso was comparable zzso zzso zzso to average zzso zzso for advanced zzso The minimum zzso thickness zzso was comparable zzso zzso zzso to average zzso retinal nerve fiber layer zzso thickness zzso for early zzso 

In Japanese patients with zzso of zzso glaucoma, the minimum zzso on zzso may be useful for detecting early zzso
