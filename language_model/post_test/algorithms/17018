We have studied the prediction of zzso protein secondary structures by neural zzso zzso secondary structures are allocated to zzso acid zzso using zzso and Sander's dictionary of protein secondary structures and the neural network is taught the protein secondary zzso The input layer of the neural network allows sequences of zzso including 20 zzso zzso chain break, B, X and zzso We consider zzso secondary structures into groups of 3, 4 and zzso In each case, we calculate the percentage of correct zzso We discuss the effect of zzso on the protein secondary structure zzso In addition, we include the application of a neural network with a modular architecture to prediction of protein secondary zzso We compare the results from neural networks with a modular architecture and with a simple zzso zzso
