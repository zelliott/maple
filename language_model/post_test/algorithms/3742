zzso of exposure to biological threat agents has relied on ever more sensitive methods for pathogen zzso but that usually requires pathogen proliferation to dangerous, near zzso zzso Recent events have demonstrated that assessing exposure to a biological threat agent well in advance of onset of illness or at various stages zzso is invaluable among the diagnostic zzso There is an urgent need for better diagnostic tools that will be sensitive, zzso and zzso Since human clinical cases of illness induced by zzso agents are, zzso rare, use of animal models that closely mimic the human illness is the only in zzso zzso Such studies can be very difficult and zzso therefore, maximizing the information obtained from in zzso zzso to peripheral blood zzso cells zzso provide an opportunity to investigate zzso zzso in host zzso In our quest to study zzso zzso B zzso induced host gene expression patterns, we addressed two core issues using zzso analysis and zzso zzso Our first objective was to determine gene expression patterns in human zzso exposed to zzso in zzso Second, we compared the in zzso data with host responses gene expression patterns in zzso using zzso from an animal model of zzso intoxication that closely replicates the progression of illness in zzso We used zzso zzso to study global gene expression patterns in zzso intoxicated with zzso We applied a supervised learning method for class prediction based on the zzso neighbor zzso for the data obtained in zzso exposed to zzso in zzso against a training data zzso This data set included gene expression profiles derived from in zzso zzso to eight different pathogens zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso toxin A, Venezuelan zzso encephalitis, and zzso in zzso We found that despite differences in gene expression profiles between in zzso and in zzso systems, there exists a subset of genes that show correlations between in zzso and in zzso zzso which can be used as a predictor of exposure to zzso in zzso
