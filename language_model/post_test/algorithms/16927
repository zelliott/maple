Little is known about the long-term dynamics of widely interacting cortical and zzso networks during the zzso zzso Using large-scale zzso recordings of zzso patients during zzso zzso we investigated zzso and long-range synchronization between multiple brain regions over several zzso For such zzso data, summary information is required for understanding and zzso the underlying zzso Here, we suggest that a compact yet useful representation is given by a state space based on the first principal zzso Using this zzso we report, with a remarkable similarity across the patients with different locations of zzso placement, that the seemingly complex patterns of brain zzso during the zzso cycle can be represented by a small number of characteristic dynamic zzso In this space, transitions between behavioral states occur through specific zzso from one mode to zzso These findings suggest that, at a coarse level of zzso resolution, the different brain states are correlated with several dominant zzso patterns which are successively activated across zzso zzso
