A sequence databases are growing zzso results from sequence comparison searches using fast search methods such as zzso and zzso tend to be long and difficult to zzso In this paper, we present a new method to extract domain information from sequence comparison searches by zzso the resulting alignments according to their similarity to the query zzso zzso tree structures and zzso are used to organize the alignment data such that structurally zzso elements can be easily zzso The zzso nature of the data structures used and the flexible zzso based interface provide an efficient and intuitive means to explore the alignment data at different levels so the main zzso as well as zzso related features can be zzso
