Force generation in zzso zzso systems is thought to result from an angular displacement of the zzso zzso 1 zzso tail domain with respect to the zzso filament zzso In muscle, raised temperature increases the force generated by S1, zzso a greater change in tail domain angular zzso We used zzso zzso zzso to investigate the structural zzso of this force increase by measuring zzso zzso reflection intensity during zzso length zzso This technique allows definition of zzso orientation with respect to the zzso zzso zzso intensity changes were approximately zzso at low temperatures but became increasingly distorted as temperature was zzso with the formation of a double intensity peak at maximum zzso This increased distortion could be accounted for by assuming a shift in orientation of the tail domain of zzso zzso toward the orientation at which zzso intensity is zzso which is consistent with a tail domain rotation model of force generation in which the tail approaches a more perpendicular projection from the thin filament axis at higher zzso In power stroke simulations, the angle between zzso tail mean position during zzso and the position at maximum intensity decreased by zzso degrees, corresponding to a mean tail displacement toward the perpendicular of zzso zzso for a zzso force increase of zzso zzso from 4 to 22 degrees zzso Our findings suggest that at least zzso of zzso compliance is associated with the tail zzso
