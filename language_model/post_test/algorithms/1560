This study introduces a novel zzso interface zzso based on an oddball paradigm using stimuli of facial images with loss of zzso face information zzso inversion of zzso To the best of our knowledge, till now the zzso processing of human faces has not been applied to zzso but widely studied in cognitive zzso zzso Our experiments confirm that the zzso zzso potential zzso components zzso and zzso positive potential zzso have reflected early structural zzso of faces and can be modulated by the zzso processing of zzso With the proposed novel zzso we investigate the effects of zzso components zzso zzso and zzso on target detection for zzso An zzso zzso platform is developed to analyze zzso and evaluate the target detection performance using linear zzso analysis without complicated feature extraction zzso The online zzso accuracy of zzso and information transfer rate of zzso bits zzso using stimuli of zzso faces with only single trial suggest that the proposed paradigm based on the zzso processing of faces is very promising for visual zzso zzso zzso
