Records of social interactions provide us with new sources of data for understanding how interaction patterns affect collective zzso Such human activity patterns are often zzso zzso they consist of short periods of intense activity followed by long periods of zzso This zzso has been shown to affect spreading zzso it zzso epidemic spreading in some cases and slows it down in other zzso We investigate a model of zzso zzso In our model, repeated interactions between susceptible and infected individuals in a short period of time is needed for a susceptible individual to contract zzso We carry out zzso simulations on real zzso network data to find that zzso activity patterns facilitate epidemic spreading in our zzso
