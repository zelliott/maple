We present a novel, low complexity method for the detection of the first and second of heart sounds zzso and zzso zzso and the periods of zzso and zzso without using an zzso zzso The zzso uses a technique called empirical mode decomposition to produce intensity envelopes of the main heart sounds in the time zzso The performance of the zzso was evaluated using 14,000 cardiac periods from 100 normal and abnormal digital zzso zzso The sensitivity of the detection method was zzso for both zzso and zzso and the precision zzso zzso zzso was zzso for both zzso and zzso
