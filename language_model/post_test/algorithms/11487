In the present study, a portable system based on a zzso has been developed to zzso different kinds of zzso In order to do this zzso a zzso zzso zzso network zzso implemented in a zzso has been zzso Due to memory limits when working with zzso it is necessary to zzso the use of both program and data zzso Thus, a zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso has been developed in order to zzso the necessary parameters to zzso the zzso in a zzso The measures have been carried out by zzso techniques using a zzso made of seven different zzso Next, the neural network has been trained on a PC by means of the zzso in zzso using the data obtained in the experimental zzso The zzso has been programmed with the obtained parameters and then, new samples have been zzso using the portable system in order to test the zzso zzso are very promising, as an zzso recognition rate has been achieved in the training phase, which suggests that this kind of procedures can be successfully used not only for honey zzso but also for many other kinds of zzso
