This study examined the zzso reliability of different measures extracted from Hoffmann zzso zzso zzso curve that are used to assess zzso zzso The following measures were zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso at a stimulus intensity associated with zzso of the maximum zzso zzso the slope of the zzso line of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso the peak of the first zzso of the zzso zzso curve, a new measure introduced in this zzso 

The zzso was zzso in the zzso for 24 subjects (12 males and 12 zzso on 5 separate zzso zzso was applied to the Achilles zzso prior to stimulation to test the sensitivity of the measures on test day zzso The stimulus intensity was gradually increased from below the threshold for an zzso response to above the maximum zzso zzso zzso The means of 5 evoked zzso at each intensity level were used to create both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso for each subject across test zzso zzso of reliability involves the consideration of both the stability and consistency of the zzso A repeated measures analysis of zzso evaluated the stability of the group means across test zzso The consistency of scores within individuals was determined by calculating the zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso of the zzso confidence zzso of zzso was used to assess significant differences between zzso 

The zzso measures were both stable and consistent across the first 3 test zzso Achilles zzso zzso resulted in a profound reduction zzso on test day 4, and then there was a return to baseline levels on test day zzso The zzso for zzso at a stimulus intensity associated with zzso of the maximum zzso was zzso The zzso for the slope of the zzso line of the zzso zzso curve was zzso while it was zzso for the peak of the first zzso of the zzso zzso zzso However, there was no statistical significance zzso between the 3 zzso measures of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had an zzso of zzso zzso to careful zzso zzso 

The peak of the first zzso of the zzso zzso curve was shown to have comparable sensitivity and reliability as other more established zzso 

The first zzso of the zzso zzso curve provides the rate of change, rather than zzso making it a robust measure of zzso arc zzso The higher zzso for the first zzso offers greater statistical power, which is of practical zzso
