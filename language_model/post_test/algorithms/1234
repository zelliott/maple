zzso zzso imaging is a technique which is under investigation as a zzso method of tracking subsurface temperature zzso and/or associated cellular response during zzso In previous work, a finite element image reconstruction zzso for converting surface potential zzso recorded at discrete zzso positions into spatial maps of zzso values was zzso This paper reports on a series of significant improvements in the basic image reconstruction zzso Specifically, the ability to recover both the zzso and zzso components of tissue electrical zzso have been zzso In addition, the image enhancement schemes of zzso total variation zzso zzso dual zzso and zzso spatial zzso zzso have been zzso Through a series of simulation studies involving both zzso and zzso zzso having discrete regions and zzso electrical property profiles, a significantly improved ability to recover spatial images of electrical properties in the zzso imaging context is zzso The results show that the new zzso is much more tolerant of measurement noise with levels up to zzso causing relatively modest zzso in image quality zzso to zzso which was needed previously in order to produce high quality zzso The recovered electrical properties, themselves, both zzso and zzso are also found to be quantitative in value with errors in the zzso range occurring in the majority of cases, although zzso can reach zzso or more when noise levels as high as zzso are zzso zzso zzso simulations show that maximum temperature errors are significantly reduced (to approximately 2 degrees C relative to more than 10 degrees C in previous zzso zzso with the new zzso however, temperature zzso of better than zzso degree C on average are still found to be difficult to achieve with electrical zzso imaging even when the enhanced image reconstruction approach is zzso
