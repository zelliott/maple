zzso is an MR technique conventionally implemented with zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to compare zzso zzso processing and 2 zzso zzso processing zzso zzso where an zzso image is created for each echo and then averaged to create a single zzso and zzso where a zzso image is generated from an average frequency zzso Linear and zzso mask functions were investigated for all 3 processing zzso 

Comprehensive zzso were zzso Single and zzso data were acquired at zzso in 10 zzso zzso ratio was measured in various zzso zzso of the same structures were ranked in different zzso images by trained zzso 

When image evaluation was based on zzso of zzso ratio, the zzso mask and zzso scheme were zzso However, when image evaluation was based on ranks of qualitative zzso the linear mask and zzso scheme were zzso Although the zzso mask and zzso scheme allow increased contrast of zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso red nucleus, and zzso nucleus, they do not necessarily increase the information content of the image; rather, they result in a harsh contrast that is visually zzso to zzso and wherein more subtle structure is relatively less zzso 

zzso masked zzso zzso is the recommended zzso of zzso zzso for zzso use; however, zzso masked zzso zzso may have use in computer-based zzso or zzso
