We present zzso zzso zzso and zzso a free program package for analyzing and visualizing zzso Carlo and molecular dynamics zzso The aim of zzso is to collect as many analyses as possible in one program, creating a powerful tool and making it unnecessary to use many different programs for evaluating zzso This should greatly zzso and simplify the zzso of analyzing zzso zzso is written in zzso zzso zzso and licensed under the terms of the zzso General Public zzso zzso It is easy to install zzso independent, no external zzso and easy to zzso In this article, we present some of the zzso that are implemented in zzso - many of them widely known for a long time, but some of them also to appear in literature for the first zzso All shown analyses only require a standard MD trajectory as input zzso
