It has been proposed that the zzso elastic zzso of zzso bone depend upon a zzso measure of zzso called fabric as well as the zzso structural zzso zzso zzso Mechanics zzso 4, zzso 1986, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso developed explicit relationships for the elastic constant, structural density and fabric zzso In this study the zzso elastic zzso structural density, and fabric components were measured for 11 zzso bone specimens from five bovine zzso and for 75 specimens from three human zzso zzso and fitted to these relationships using a least squares zzso The relationships explained between 72 and zzso of the zzso in the elastic zzso The relationships between the elastic zzso and squared or cubed power functions of structural density had better zzso value over the entire distribution of the data than did expressions with linear functions of structural zzso
