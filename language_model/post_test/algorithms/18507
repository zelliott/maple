A wide range of zzso systems are described by zzso dynamic models zzso presented as a set of ordinary differential equations in the zzso explicit form: zzso see zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso where zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a set of basis functions satisfying the zzso zzso We investigate the problem of evaluation of model zzso zzso (the system zzso using experimental data about the time dependence of the dynamic parameters of the system zzso A new method of system identification for the class of similar zzso dynamic models is zzso It is shown that the problem of identifying an initial zzso model can be reduced to the solution of a system of linear equations for the zzso of the dynamic model zzso zzso It is proposed to determine the set of dynamic model zzso zzso using the criterion of minimal zzso zzso for the time dependence of the set of dynamic parameters zzso An important special case of the zzso model, the zzso model, is zzso Test problems of identification using this method are presented for two zzso zzso the Van der Pol type zzso zzso zzso and the strange zzso of zzso a widely known example of dynamic systems showing the zzso zzso
