Parkinson's disease zzso can present with a variety of motor disorders that zzso throughout the day, making assessment a challenging zzso zzso measurement tools can be burdensome to the patient and zzso and lack the zzso resolution needed to accurately and zzso track changes in motor symptom severity throughout the zzso zzso zzso systems that continuously monitor zzso motor disorders may help to solve this problem, although critical shortcomings persist in identifying multiple disorders at high zzso resolution during zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to advance the current state of the art by zzso introducing hybrid sensor technology to zzso acquire surface zzso zzso and zzso data during zzso activity and zzso analyzing the data using dynamic neural network zzso to capture the evolving zzso characteristics of the sensor data and improve motor disorder recognition of zzso and zzso zzso were trained zzso zzso and tested zzso zzso zzso zzso to recognize zzso and zzso at zzso resolution based on sensor data features and expert zzso of video recording during zzso monitoring periods of zzso daily zzso The zzso were able to make accurate distinctions between zzso zzso and normal movement despite the presence of diverse voluntary zzso Motor disorder severity zzso averaged zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity based on 1 sensor per symptomatic zzso These initial findings indicate that new sensor technology and software zzso can be effective in enhancing zzso zzso system performance for monitoring zzso motor disorders during zzso zzso
