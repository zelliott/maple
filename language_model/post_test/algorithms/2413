There is increasing evidence that the presence of an ongoing systemic inflammatory response is a zzso predictor of poor outcome in patients with zzso The aim of this study was to investigate whether an zzso zzso score, the zzso nutritional index zzso is associated with overall survival zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso 

All patients with a new diagnosis of zzso presenting to the Medical Oncology Department, zzso Hospital between 1993 and 2011 zzso were zzso zzso and clinical data were zzso Patients in whom the combined zzso zzso zzso zzso total zzso count zzso zzso zzso was zzso at zzso were allocated a zzso score of zzso Patients in whom this total score was zzso were allocated a score of zzso zzso and zzso analyses were performed to identify zzso variables associated with zzso Independent zzso of survival identified on zzso analysis were validated in an independent, zzso cohort of 68 zzso 

zzso analyses showed that zzso zzso zzso spread zzso the presence of zzso disease zzso portal vein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer score zzso were all zzso of zzso in the training zzso zzso analysis revealed the zzso zzso presence of zzso disease zzso and degree of zzso spread zzso as independent zzso of worse zzso in this zzso The zzso retained independent zzso value in the validation set zzso 

The presence of a systemic inflammatory response, as measured by the zzso is an independent and zzso validated predictor of poor zzso in patients with zzso
