Random zzso under neutral or zzso conditions are studied by considering plausible evolutionary zzso on zzso zzso collections of sequences zzso interconnected via zzso zzso zzso for the same zzso structure zzso We use simple exact lattice models for the mapping between sequence and zzso zzso zzso of states based on model zzso interactions are determined by exhaustive zzso zzso We compare results from two very different interaction schemes to ascertain zzso of the zzso In both models, sequences in a majority of neutral nets center around a single zzso zzso of maximum zzso stability, tolerating the largest number of neutral zzso General zzso considerations show that these zzso by themselves lead to higher zzso evolutionary populations at zzso zzso On average, native zzso stability increases toward a maximum at the zzso zzso resulting in zzso arrangements of native zzso in sequence zzso These observations offer a unified perspective on sequence design, native stability, and zzso stability of zzso These principles are zzso from native stability to any measure of fitness provided that its variation with respect to zzso is essentially zzso
