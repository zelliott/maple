A study was conducted to determine if zzso and zzso are concentrated in the zzso grade components of zzso zzso Four zzso zzso test samples were each taken from 23 lots of zzso corn marketed in North zzso zzso from the Federal zzso zzso Service divided each test sample into 3 grade zzso zzso damaged kernels zzso zzso broken corn and foreign material zzso and zzso whole kernels zzso The zzso and zzso concentration was measured in each component and a mass balance equation was used to calculate the total concentration of each zzso in each test zzso zzso across all test samples, the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso components were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso across all test samples, the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso components were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso components combined accounted for only zzso of the test sample mass, but accounted for zzso and zzso of the total zzso and zzso mass in the test sample, zzso Both zzso mass zzso and zzso concentration zzso in the combined zzso and zzso components had high correlations with zzso concentration in the zzso The highest correlation occurred when zzso mass zzso in the combined zzso and zzso components was related to zzso concentration in the lot zzso Similar results were obtained for zzso This study indicated that measuring either zzso or zzso in the combined zzso and zzso grade components could be used as a screening method to predict either zzso or zzso in a bulk lot of zzso zzso
