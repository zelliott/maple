A recently introduced zzso zzso to extend time scales of zzso detailed simulations is zzso The algorithm, zzso is based on zzso the dynamics to a sequence of zzso between zzso and constructing a zzso model for the motion along a reaction zzso The zzso of a zzso transition in a blocked zzso is zzso and shown to be accurate, more efficient than straightforward molecular dynamics by a factor of about 9, and zzso A general zzso argument predicts a linear zzso with the number of milestones for zzso processes and an exponential zzso for transitions over zzso The zzso is also trivial to zzso As a side result, zzso also produces the free energy profile along the reaction coordinate and is able to describe zzso motions along one (or a zzso degrees of zzso
