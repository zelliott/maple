In zzso we want to image the entire range of zzso of the elastic components found in zzso zzso In order to achieve this, the zzso dynamic range should equal the entire zzso dynamic range in the zzso Various sources of noise limit the dynamic range of zzso The zzso strain filter concept offers an zzso and zzso way of observing these zzso In this paper, we describe a method that achieves the expansion of the zzso dynamic zzso It involves the application of variable strains in combination with selective storage of strain data that have optimal zzso zzso zzso This expands the current dynamic range of zzso by orders of magnitude when compared to single zzso zzso The process is explained theoretically using the strain filter zzso and 1 D as well as zzso tissue simulations are used to corroborate the zzso
