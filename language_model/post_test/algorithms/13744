Common methods of treatment allocation for zzso and/or zzso zzso clinical trials can result in substantial differences between the number of patients allocated to each treatment zzso This can occur in the overall trial for a zzso block design or within individual zzso when using a zzso zzso This may lead to a bias in the zzso Also, these procedures can be zzso with the possibility of an zzso selection zzso An easily implemented method of zzso is proposed which attempts to overcome these problems by balancing treatment allocations both within strata and across the trial as a zzso The method keeps a running tally on total treatment allocation numbers at all zzso zzso When a patient zzso a zzso decision rule is applied, and the allocation is deterministic if certain zzso limits are zzso and random zzso The method is an extension of the big stick design of Soares and zzso and is related to both zzso key number zzso methods and the schemes of zzso and zzso zzso studies are used to demonstrate that major imbalances possible with other schemes do not occur using this method, and that the potential for selection bias is much zzso
