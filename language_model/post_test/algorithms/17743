The purpose of this study was to evaluate the rates of successful airway control using zzso tubes zzso or zzso mask airways zzso and compare them between zzso and zzso wearing full zzso protective zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 10 per zzso twice attempted inserting zzso and zzso on a mannequin model of airway management in a zzso prospective zzso Times to successful zzso and failure rates were zzso zzso had a slightly higher failure rate inserting zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso not zzso zzso mean times to successfully inserting zzso were 38 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso seconds zzso zzso zzso Both groups inserted zzso more rapidly than zzso zzso zzso zzso and their failure rates in zzso use were zzso In view of the relative zzso by which zzso were inserted as compared with zzso by fully protected zzso the incorporation of zzso in zzso dealing with emergency airway management in a zzso mass casualty scenario deserves further zzso
