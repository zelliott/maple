Alternative zzso is currently seen to explain the vast disparity between the number of predicted genes in the human zzso and the highly diverse zzso The mapping of expressed sequences tag zzso consensus sequences derived from the zzso database onto the zzso provides an efficient way of predicting zzso zzso gene structure and alternative zzso zzso However, the alternative zzso events are obscured by a large number of zzso artificial zzso boundaries arising due to zzso contamination or alignment zzso The current work describes a methodology to associate quality values to the predicted zzso zzso High quality zzso boundaries are used to predict zzso and alternative zzso ranked by confidence values, aiming to facilitate large-scale analysis of alternative zzso and zzso in zzso 

zzso the current methodology, zzso zzso is observed in zzso zzso zzso out of which zzso are alternatively zzso The zzso derived from the zzso confidence values for 17 of these zzso events frequently correlate zzso with zzso experiments performed for 40 different tissue zzso As an application of the confidence measure, an evaluation of distribution of alternative zzso revealed that majority of zzso zzso to the coding regions of the zzso However, still a significant fraction maps to zzso regions, thereby indicating a functional relevance of alternative zzso in untranslated zzso 

The predicted alternative zzso zzso are zzso in the zzso database at zzso
