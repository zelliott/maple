A novel method based on continuous zzso transform zzso for predicting the number and location of zzso in membrane proteins is zzso Two bacteria proteins are chosen as examples to describe the prediction of zzso zzso zzso by using this zzso zzso of an appropriate zzso and zzso data types are discussed in the zzso The results indicate that zzso is a promising approach for the prediction of zzso
