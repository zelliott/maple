After a brief review of the use of zzso variables to accommodate the correlation among multiple outcomes of mixed types, through theoretical and zzso zzso the consequences of such a construction are zzso The effects of including zzso variables on marginal zzso in these models are contrasted with the situation for jointly normal zzso A simulation study illustrates the efficiency and reduction in bias gains possible in using joint models, and analysis of an example from the field of zzso illustrates potential practical zzso
