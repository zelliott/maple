Finding genes for complex traits is one of the major challenges of modern human zzso Current developments of molecular techniques facilitated use of large zzso and marker sets of thousands of zzso zzso zzso However, one of the problems occurring in statistical analysis of such large data sets is that the likelihood is very low and zzso may easily zzso In this work we describe a method permitting to avoid zzso during zzso of a likelihood function, using different zzso Our method makes practically possible analysis of thousands of individuals and thousands of zzso The method is easy to implement without major change of the code of existing zzso It also helps to reduce the amount of computer memory used in analysis without noticeable zzso of the program running zzso The zzso was implemented in the software packages for segregation and linkage analysis, which are available from zzso
