The zzso zzso zzso is the first animal whose zzso is completely zzso providing a rich source of gene information relevant to zzso biology and human zzso This abundant sequence information permits a broad-based gene zzso approach in zzso zzso in which chemically zzso zzso populations are screened by zzso for deletion zzso in a specific targeted zzso By handling zzso zzso growth, zzso DNA templates, zzso screens, and zzso recovery all in zzso zzso plates, we have scaled up this approach to isolate deletion zzso in zzso genes to zzso Four chemical zzso including zzso methane zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced zzso deletions at comparable zzso The deletions averaged approximately zzso zzso in size when using a approximately 3 zzso screening zzso The vast majority of detected deletions removed portions of one or more zzso likely resulting in loss of gene zzso This approach requires only the knowledge of a target gene sequence and a suitable zzso and thus provides a zzso systematic approach to gene zzso for any zzso that can be handled in high density zzso
