We present a new zzso zzso potential for recognizing the native state of proteins from their zzso zzso This potential was extracted from a large set of protein structures determined by X-ray zzso using zzso a software based on the recent theory of the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso This geometric construct reflects the size difference among atoms in their full zzso zzso property not accounted for in a typical zzso Delaunay zzso The ability of this potential to identify the native zzso over a large set of zzso was zzso zzso show that this potential zzso a potential constructed with a classical Delaunay zzso in decoy discrimination zzso The addition of a statistical hydrogen bond potential to our zzso potential allows a significant improvement in the decoy discrimination, in such a way that we are able to predict successfully the native structure in zzso of zzso
