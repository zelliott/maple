zzso declines in African great zzso populations due to disease outbreaks have been reported in recent years, yet we rarely hear of similar disease impacts for the more solitary Asian great apes, or for smaller zzso We used an zzso model of different zzso social systems to illustrate that interactions between social structure and demography create zzso zzso on the pathogens that can establish and persist in zzso host species with different social zzso We showed that this varies by disease transmission zzso zzso transmitted infections zzso require high rates of zzso to persist within a zzso zzso In particular, for a zzso social system, zzso require extremely high rates of zzso for zzso and remain at extremely low prevalence in small zzso but this is less constrained in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso transmitted infections zzso spread and persist at high prevalence in medium and large primates with moderate zzso establishment and persistence in zzso primates require higher relative rates of zzso zzso contact structure - the social network - creates different constraints for different transmission zzso and our model underscores the importance of zzso contacts on infection prior to intergroup movement in a structured zzso When alpha males dominate sexual zzso the resulting disease transmission dynamics differ from when social interactions are dominated by zzso grooming events, for zzso This has important repercussions for pathogen spread across zzso Our framework reveals essential social and demographic characteristics of primates that zzso them to different disease risks that will be important for disease management and conservation planning for protected zzso zzso
