In this paper we propose an energy-efficient object tracking zzso in wireless sensor networks zzso Such sensor networks have to be designed to achieve energy-efficient object tracking for any given arbitrary zzso We consider in particular the zzso moving objects with given zzso for each pair of sensor zzso and link transmission zzso This problem is formulated as a zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed for solving the zzso zzso Experimental results showed that the proposed zzso achieves near zzso in energy-efficient object zzso Furthermore, the zzso is very efficient and zzso in terms of the solution zzso
