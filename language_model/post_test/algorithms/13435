Ever larger zzso are being constructed due to the explosion of genetic data and development of zzso zzso reconstruction zzso However, most methods for calculating divergence times are limited to zzso that are orders of magnitude smaller than recently published large zzso Here, we present an zzso and zzso of a divergence time method using penalized likelihood that can handle zzso of thousands of zzso We implement a method that combines the standard zzso zzso with a zzso simulated zzso approach to overcome zzso zzso We compare this approach with existing software including zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso code, example files, zzso and documentation for zzso are available at zzso
