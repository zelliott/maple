We describe an approach for acquiring high quality zzso zzso fine structure zzso zzso zzso with wide energy range at high pressure using diamond zzso cell zzso zzso the serious interference of diamond Bragg zzso is essential for combining zzso and zzso techniques in high pressure research, yet an effective method to obtain accurate zzso spectrum free from zzso induced zzso has been zzso It was found that these zzso whose energy positions are very sensitive to the relative orientation between zzso and incident zzso zzso can be effectively eliminated using an zzso zzso based on repeated zzso over a small angular range of zzso orientation, zzso within zzso degrees relative to the zzso beam zzso zzso zzso zzso are reported for zzso zzso recorded by traditional ambient pressure and high pressure zzso methods, showing similar quality at 440 zzso above the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso glass were obtained at high pressure up to 53 zzso providing important insight into the structural zzso of zzso glass at high zzso This method is expected be zzso for in zzso zzso zzso using a diamond zzso cell up to zzso zzso
