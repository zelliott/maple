We previously developed a zzso approach to identify zzso of zzso defined by restriction zzso mapping or DNA sequencing that are associated with significant zzso zzso Our approach was limited to segments of DNA in which little zzso zzso In such cases, a zzso can be constructed from the restriction site or sequence data that represents the evolutionary steps that zzso the observed zzso The zzso is used to define a zzso statistical design to identify zzso steps associated with significant zzso zzso The central assumption behind this strategy is that any zzso zzso causing a zzso effect is embedded within the same evolutionary history that is represented by the zzso The power of this approach depends upon the confidence one has in the particular zzso used to draw zzso In this paper, we present a strategy for zzso the set of zzso that are consistent with a particular sample of either restriction site or zzso sequence data and that includes the possibility of zzso We first evaluate the limits of zzso in constructing zzso Once these limits have been determined, we construct the set of zzso and zzso zzso that is consistent with these zzso Our zzso procedure also identifies zzso that are candidates for being products of zzso If zzso is extensive, our zzso subdivides the DNA region into two or more zzso each having little or no internal zzso We apply this zzso procedure to three data sets to illustrate varying degrees of zzso ambiguity and zzso
