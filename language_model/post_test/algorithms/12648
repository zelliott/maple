Continuous zzso of zzso zzso neural networks zzso zzso with infinite zzso are studied in this zzso A continuous zzso is a collection of connected zzso and it has been recognized as a suitable model for describing the zzso of continuous stimuli in neural zzso The existence of the continuous zzso depends on many factors such as the connectivity and the external zzso of the zzso A continuous zzso can be stable or zzso It is shown in this brief that a zzso zzso can possess multiple continuous zzso if the synaptic connections and the external zzso are zzso in zzso Moreover, both stable and unstable continuous zzso can coexist in a zzso zzso expressions of the continuous zzso are zzso zzso are employed to illustrate the zzso
