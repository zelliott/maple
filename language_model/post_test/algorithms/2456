To demonstrate the feasibility of using zzso zzso zzso with zzso contrast zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was induced in male zzso zzso zzso zzso One week later, the animals received zzso zzso zzso and were zzso On the excised hearts, zzso with several tube zzso zzso zzso and 140 zzso late zzso enhancement zzso zzso and zzso zzso were then zzso We used a zzso threshold for the CT images and several threshold limits zzso 3, 4, 5, 6 zzso and full zzso at zzso zzso for the zzso images to delineate the zzso zzso Total zzso volume and zzso fraction of each heart were zzso 

zzso size measured by zzso at 140 zzso showed good correlation with the reference zzso zzso zzso an zzso tube zzso however, significantly underestimated zzso zzso In our study, the zzso method, using the zzso zzso provided the most accurate determination of zzso zzso zzso using the zzso and zzso threshold limits, significantly overestimated zzso zzso 

The zzso technique has been found suitable for the evaluation of zzso in an ex zzso experimental zzso zzso has the ability to detect zzso even at low zzso settings, but accuracy is limited by a high image noise because of reduced zzso zzso
