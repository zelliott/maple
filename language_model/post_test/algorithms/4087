zzso zzso signals can provide high zzso resolution and high signal to noise ratio recordings of local neural activity from the surface of the zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso zzso zzso zzso increases in zzso signals are highly correlated with movement and other cognitive tasks and can be zzso zzso However, significant additional information may be present in zzso zzso but adding additional higher order zzso interactions can be zzso from a zzso zzso if not zzso 

In this paper we present a new method of calculating high frequency interactions between zzso called zzso zzso zzso zzso that builds on mathematical techniques currently used in neural signal analysis, along with an zzso that zzso the zzso by orders of magnitude by leveraging zzso zzso graphics processing unit zzso zzso 

Using the zzso zzso of zzso we identify many types of zzso zzso interactions from human zzso recordings on global and local scales that have not been identified by previous zzso zzso zzso patterns are observed for zzso zzso in both low- zzso zzso and high-resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is a commonly used metric for identifying correlated signals, but the standard zzso calculations do not allow for temporally varying zzso In contrast zzso allows and identifies zzso changes in zzso without identifying zzso noise zzso 

zzso can be used to identify zzso neural interactions whose high zzso load is well suited to zzso zzso
