zzso between the zzso zzso and functional features of proteins is one of the most important open questions in the field of molecular zzso To this problem, we apply a technique known as data mining for discovering associations across protein zzso structure, and zzso We were able to find various association rules on the zzso essential to some protein zzso Moreover, zzso associations were found between proteins having different zzso The results suggest that data mining might be a powerful tool in protein zzso
