zzso image similarity is a central topic in computer zzso In this paper, we propose to measure image similarity by learning from the online Flickr image zzso We do so zzso Choosing 103 Flickr groups, building a zzso zzso zzso to zzso test images into a group, taking the set of responses of the zzso as features, calculating the distance between feature zzso to measure image zzso Experimental results on the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso 2007 zzso show that our approach performs better on image matching, zzso and zzso than using conventional visual zzso To build our similarity measure, we need zzso zzso that are accurate and can be trained quickly on very large quantities of zzso We adopt an zzso zzso with a zzso intersection zzso We describe a novel fast training zzso for this zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso training zzso This method can produce a kernel zzso that is more accurate than a linear zzso on tens of thousands of examples in zzso
