The spatial distribution and pattern of local contact stresses within the knee joint during activities of daily living have not been fully zzso The objective of this study was to determine if common contact stress patterns exist on the zzso zzso of human knees during simulated zzso To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso and applied it to the contact stresses on the zzso zzso of 12 human zzso knees subjected to zzso loads mimicking zzso The contact stress profiles at different locations on the zzso zzso were zzso where regions with similar contact stress patterns were identified across zzso Three consistent regional patterns were found, among them two most prominent contact stress patterns were shared by 9-12 of all the knees and the third pattern was shared by zzso zzso The first pattern was located at the zzso aspect of the zzso zzso plateau and had a single peak stress that occurred during the early stance zzso The second pattern was located at the zzso aspects of the lateral plateau and consisted of two peak stresses zzso with the timing of peak zzso force at early and late zzso The third pattern was found on the anterior aspect of zzso contact region on the zzso plateau consisted of double peak zzso The differences in the location and profile of the contact stress patterns suggest that the zzso and lateral zzso function to carry load at different points in the gait zzso with the zzso aspect of the zzso zzso consistently distributing load only during the early phase of stance, and the zzso aspect of the lateral zzso consistently distributing load during both the early and late zzso of zzso This novel approach can help identify abnormalities in knee contact mechanics and provide a better understanding of the mechanical pathways leading to post-traumatic zzso
