We present a novel method, zzso for zzso the probability of identity by descent zzso for a pair of related individuals at a zzso given dense zzso data and a pedigree of arbitrary size and zzso zzso overcomes the challenges of exact zzso zzso of zzso in zzso of potentially large size and eliminates the difficulty of accommodating the background linkage zzso zzso that is present in zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso is much more accurate at zzso the true zzso sharing than methods that remove zzso by pruning zzso and is highly robust to pedigree errors or other forms of zzso zzso The method is fast and can be used to estimate the probability for each possible zzso sharing state at every zzso from a zzso zzso array for hundreds of thousands of pairs of zzso We use it to estimate zzso and zzso zzso sharing between zzso pairs of subjects all of whom are related through a single, large and complex zzso pedigree and zzso with the zzso zzso zzso We find that we are able to identify the true pedigree relationship for individuals who were misidentified in the collected data and estimate empirical kinship zzso that can be used in follow-up zzso mapping zzso zzso is implemented as an open source software package and is freely zzso
