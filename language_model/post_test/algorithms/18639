Four different approaches for determining the electron relaxation rates in zzso zzso are investigated, using a zzso zzso complex of a protein as an zzso All four approaches rely on the determination of the zzso zzso relaxation enhancements, zzso of the zzso zzso and the backbone zzso zzso Three of the methods zzso the field dependence of the zzso zzso It is found that the zzso of each of these methods depends on whether the zzso condition, zzso applies to the electron relaxation, zzso being the zzso frequency of the electron spin S and zzso the correlation time of the electron zzso If the zzso condition is zzso the electron relaxation rate can be obtained from the ratio of the zzso rates of one or more zzso at two magnetic field strengths zzso zzso On the other hand, if the zzso condition does not apply, more elaborate methods must be used that, in general, require a determination of the zzso rates over a larger range of magnetic field strengths zzso zzso However, in the case of zzso metal zzso with relatively slow electron relaxation rates only two magnetic field strengths zzso if the zzso rates of a zzso nucleus are included in the analysis zzso zzso In the fourth method zzso zzso the electron relaxation is estimated as a zzso in a structure zzso using distance constraints derived from zzso zzso rates at only one magnetic field zzso In general, only methods B and C give zzso electron relaxation zzso
