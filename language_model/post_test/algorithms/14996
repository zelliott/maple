As zzso sequencing reveals the range of structural classes generated through the evolution of zzso analysis of the zzso to which they belong can contribute important insights for understanding their zzso zzso Current database search techniques fall short of identifying the majority of distant sequence relationships at statistically significant zzso We developed the zzso program in an effort to enhance the sensitivity and utility of current database search zzso 

We have developed and used the zzso program to identify both new zzso members and to reconstruct several known zzso zzso using zzso database zzso An analysis of the zzso rates generated in the analysis and other control experiments provides evidence that high zzso scores indicate real evolutionary zzso zzso is also a useful tool for identifying zzso relationships within zzso and for testing hypotheses about related protein zzso
