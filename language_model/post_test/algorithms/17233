Short tandem repeat zzso markers are highly zzso and widely used in human identification and genetic zzso We demonstrate fast and reliable zzso based on the four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso array zzso zzso human zzso DNA was amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso products were mixed with pooled zzso zzso as an absolute standard and zzso from a zzso zzso zzso were performed in zzso zzso zzso zzso with a one-hour turnaround time, with no degradation over 27 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso detection was achieved by using a zzso device zzso zzso The zzso zzso for the unknown sample were identified by comparing the zzso peak zzso of the zzso to those of the pooled zzso by using a straightforward zzso An extremely high level of confidence in matching the bands was indicated with negligible zzso zzso zzso between adjacent zzso This scheme is zzso for zzso zzso with high resolution, high speed and high zzso
