This report describes an early version of a technique for zzso surface zzso zzso signals into the constituent motor unit zzso action potential zzso A surface sensor array is used to collect four channels of zzso amplified zzso zzso The decomposition is achieved by a set of zzso that uses a specially developed zzso zzso Intelligence zzso In the automatic mode the accuracy ranges from 75 to zzso An zzso Editor is used to increase the accuracy to zzso zzso in signal epochs of about zzso zzso The accuracy was verified by comparing the zzso of action zzso from the zzso signals detected simultaneously by the surface sensor array and by a needle zzso We have zzso up to six zzso action potential trains from the zzso signal detected from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso anterior zzso However, the yield is generally low, with typically zzso or zzso 5 zzso per zzso Both the accuracy and the yield should increase as the zzso are developed zzso With this technique it is possible to investigate the behavior of zzso in muscles that are not easily studied by needle zzso We found that the inverse relationship between the recruitment threshold and the firing rate previously reported for muscles zzso by spinal nerves is also present in the zzso zzso and the zzso which are zzso by zzso zzso However, these two muscles were found to have greater and more widespread values of firing rates than those of large limb zzso
