In this article we present the first zzso zzso study of the zzso zzso zzso and their electronic zzso zzso terms zzso for the zzso zzso Efforts were made to reveal the location of zzso between the two lower, 1 zzso and 2 zzso zzso be designated as zzso zzso the zzso between the two zzso 2 zzso and 3 zzso zzso be designated as the zzso zzso this zzso We found that these zzso are located along the zzso zzso zzso The study is carried out by analyzing two-state zzso such as the zzso and zzso zzso transformation angles zzso also as the mixing zzso and the corresponding zzso zzso zzso also as the Berry zzso or the zzso zzso In addition, a detailed zzso study is carried zzso Here the emphasis is on driving the diagonal elements of the zzso D zzso and analyzing situations for which the corresponding zzso zzso zzso is zzso The reliability of two-state results is carefully examined by comparing them with corresponding outcomes derived for the zzso zzso In addition we also calculated the zzso surfaces related to the two lower states and studied to what extent they are affected by the zzso zzso The results obtained in this treatment were found to be in full agreement with the zzso zzso
