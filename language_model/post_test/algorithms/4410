An zzso for zzso a sound source with two microphones is introduced and used in real-time zzso This zzso is inspired by biological zzso of zzso time difference as occurring in the barn zzso and is a modification of the zzso proposed by Liu et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in that it creates a three-dimensional map of coincidence zzso This eliminates zzso artifacts found during tests with the original zzso The source direction is found by determining the zzso at which the minimum of the response in an zzso zzso zzso The system was tested with a zzso unit in real-time in an office environment with signal types ranging from broadband noise to pure zzso Both open loop zzso unit zzso and closed loop experiments zzso unit zzso were zzso In real world situations, the zzso performed well for all signal types except pure zzso zzso room simulations showed that zzso accuracy decreases with decreasing zzso zzso
