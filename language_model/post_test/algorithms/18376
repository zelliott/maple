Drug release from zzso zzso systems has been investigated zzso with zzso as well as zzso zzso The model used combines the zzso and diffusion zzso and thus takes the effects of a finite dissolution rate into zzso The release profile has been determined zzso by using well-established zzso zzso An approximate zzso formula for the amount of released drug has been zzso which is valid during the early stages of the release zzso This zzso zzso approximation was compared to the zzso result, and to drug release models existing in the zzso From this comparison it was concluded that the zzso approximation provided a good description of the major part of the release profile, irrespective of the dissolution zzso zzso literature models, based on instantaneous zzso provided a good description of the release only when drug dissolution proceeded very rapidly in comparison with the diffusion zzso zzso the new zzso zzso approximation zzso the formulas existing in the literature, since it provides a superior description of the release of slowly zzso zzso
