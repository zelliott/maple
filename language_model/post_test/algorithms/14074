zzso game dynamics in finite populations can be described by a frequency dependent, zzso zzso zzso We consider a zzso game between two strategies, A and zzso There are discrete zzso In each generation, individuals produce offspring zzso to their zzso The next generation is sampled randomly from this pool of zzso The total population size is zzso The resulting zzso process has two absorbing states corresponding to homogeneous populations of all A or all zzso We zzso frequency dependent selection by comparing the zzso probabilities to the corresponding probabilities under random zzso We derive conditions for selection to favor one strategy or the other by using the concept of total zzso In the limit of weak selection, we obtain the 1/3 zzso if A and B are strict Nash zzso then selection favors replacement of B by A, if the unstable equilibrium occurs at a frequency of A which is less than zzso
