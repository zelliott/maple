This study investigated zzso zzso for a zzso zzso zzso system using zzso Carlo zzso The zzso zzso Carlo code was used to simulate the zzso treatment head, and the zzso code was implemented to calculate central axis zzso curves, zzso dose profiles, and relative output factors for various circular zzso sizes of 5 to 60 zzso zzso stopping power ratios necessary for clinical reference zzso of the zzso system were also evaluated by zzso Carlo zzso Additionally, a beam quality conversion factor, zzso for the zzso system was evaluated for zzso zzso chambers with different wall zzso The accuracy of the simulated beam was validated by agreement within zzso between the zzso Carlo calculated and measured central axis zzso zzso and zzso dose zzso The calculated output factors were compared with those measured by a zzso detector and an zzso chamber in zzso The zzso output factors agreed within zzso with the calculated values down to a 10 zzso zzso The output factors with the zzso chamber decreased rapidly for zzso below 20 zzso These results were confirmed by the comparison to those from zzso Carlo methods with zzso sizes and materials corresponding to both zzso It was demonstrated that the zzso in the 5 and zzso zzso zzso for the zzso detector is due to the water zzso of the silicon material, and the dose zzso for the zzso chamber is due to its large active volume against zzso below 20 zzso The calculated stopping power ratios of the 60 zzso zzso from the zzso system (without a zzso zzso agreed within zzso with those of a 10 X 10 zzso field from a conventional linear accelerator with a heavy zzso filter and the incident electron energy, 6 zzso The difference in the stopping power ratios between 5 and 60 zzso zzso was within zzso at a 10 zzso depth in zzso Furthermore, zzso values for the zzso system were in agreement within zzso with those of the conventional 6 zzso accelerator for the zzso zzso chambers with different wall zzso
