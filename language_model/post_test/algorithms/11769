In this paper, we design an zzso of computing a constrained multiple sequence alignment zzso for zzso for guaranteeing that the generated alignment zzso the zzso constraints that some particular zzso should be aligned zzso If the number of zzso needed to be aligned together is a constant zzso then the zzso of our zzso zzso for aligning K sequences is O zzso where zzso is the maximum of the lengths of zzso In addition, we have build up such a zzso software system and made several experiments on the zzso zzso which mainly function in catalyzing the degradation of zzso zzso The resulting alignments illustrate the zzso of our zzso
