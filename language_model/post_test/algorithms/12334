zzso in the zzso state zzso by the zzso of three photons and it has been proposed that their simultaneous detection can be used for medical zzso The zzso yield has been observed to be enhanced in low zzso levels in some zzso but has never been measured in biologically relevant zzso In this study, the delayed zzso zzso yield, at both high and low zzso levels, has been extracted by fitting the time dependence of the zzso yield to a set of coupled differential zzso The differential zzso in a simple yet seemingly satisfactory fashion, account for the zzso capture to form zzso its zzso and the zzso of the two spin zzso Our results indicate that the delayed zzso fraction is zzso in water (or zzso samples and exhibits no (or zzso small) dependence on the dissolved oxygen zzso If one assumes that the direct component contributes a fraction expected by zzso on free electrons zzso then the total zzso fraction is zzso in the samples of biological zzso
