The minimal requirements of a zzso potential that can refine protein structures are the existence of a correlation between the energy with native similarity and the scoring of the native structure as the lowest in zzso To develop such a force field, the relative weights of the zzso zzso zzso potential supplemented by an explicit zzso potential were adjusted by global zzso of energetic and structural criteria for a large set of protein zzso generated for a set of 58 zzso zzso The average correlation zzso of the energy with zzso significantly improved from zzso for the original zzso potential to zzso for the zzso force zzso The fraction of proteins for which the native structure had lowest energy increased from zzso to zzso Moreover, use of an explicit zzso potential improves scoring performance of the force zzso Promising preliminary results were obtained in applying the zzso zzso to refine protein zzso using only an energy criterion to choose the best decoy among sampled zzso For a set of seven zzso zzso of the zzso improve, zzso get worse, and zzso are not zzso
