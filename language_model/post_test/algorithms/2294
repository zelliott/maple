A method has been developed to measure a zzso zzso kernel using zzso equipment available in most radiation therapy zzso The kernel is used in a zzso zzso zzso in our three-dimensional treatment planning zzso The kernel is assumed to be zzso with respect to zzso position, zzso zzso and is divided into zzso and long-range zzso with a different measurement technique for zzso The data required to obtain the short-range component are measured by scanning across a zzso geometry incident on a water zzso The zzso of the measured profile is zzso to one-dimensional projections across the zzso Because the kernel is zzso zzso only one profile measurement is required for each zzso A CT reconstruction technique is used to extract the zzso dependence of the kernel from the strip zzso Electronic noise in the acquisition system yields significant uncertainties in the kernel shape for distances beyond 3 zzso The long-range portion of the kernel is obtained by examining zzso ratios zzso The zzso of the zzso at the center of a circular field is zzso to the kernel value at the distance corresponding to the radius of the zzso The kernel measurement method was tested by comparing measured and calculated zzso profiles at a variety of zzso zzso was within zzso within the field boundary and zzso outside the field boundary for all zzso
