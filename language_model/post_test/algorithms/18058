With the sequence of the zzso zzso zzso and several global zzso and protein life cycle expression profiling projects now completed, zzso the underlying networks of zzso control important for the progression of the zzso life cycle is highly pertinent to the development of new zzso To date, relatively little is known regarding the specific mechanisms the zzso employs to regulate gene expression at the zzso level, with studies of the zzso zzso zzso sequence having revealed few zzso elements and associated zzso zzso Although it is possible the zzso may evoke mechanisms of zzso control drastically different from those used by other zzso organisms, the extreme zzso nature of zzso zzso zzso regions zzso zzso zzso presents significant challenges to in zzso zzso element zzso 

We have developed an zzso called Gene zzso zzso zzso zzso that uses a zzso scoring function and a zzso zzso zzso routine to identify with zzso regulatory elements in the zzso and repeat zzso zzso zzso zzso When applied to promoter regions of genes contained within 21 zzso gene clusters generated from zzso zzso life cycle zzso data using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identified 34 putative zzso elements associated with a variety of zzso processes including sexual development, cell invasion, zzso variation and protein zzso Among these candidates were novel zzso as well as many of the elements for which biological experimental evidence already exists in the zzso zzso To provide evidence for the biological relevance of a cell zzso element predicted by zzso reporter gene and zzso mobility shift zzso were zzso 

This zzso analysis demonstrates that in zzso regulatory element discovery can be successfully applied to challenging zzso zzso zzso such as that of zzso zzso The fact that regulatory elements were predicted from a diverse range of functional gene clusters supports the hypothesis that zzso elements play a role in the zzso control of many zzso zzso biological zzso The putative regulatory elements described represent promising candidates for future biological investigation into the underlying zzso control mechanisms of gene regulation in malaria zzso
