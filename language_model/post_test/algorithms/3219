zzso responses in Second zzso Generation zzso imaging zzso are a valuable method to zzso aspects of tissue structure, and may be a means to differentiate normal and diseased zzso Due to multiple zzso the polarization data is lost in zzso zzso Here we investigate if this information can be retained through the use of optical clearing which greatly reduces the scattering zzso and increases the corresponding mean free zzso To this end, we have measured the zzso intensity as a function of laser polarization and the zzso signal zzso in zzso zzso and zzso muscle over a depth range of 200 zzso We find that the laser polarization is highly zzso in the zzso zzso at depths corresponding to only 2-3 scattering zzso zzso 10 zzso This zzso of the laser is also reflected in the zzso zzso of the zzso signal as it is created over a range of polarization zzso In strong contrast, both polarization signatures are significantly retained through zzso zzso of tissue thickness following treatment with 50% zzso Moreover, the measured polarization responses for both zzso and zzso muscle are consistent with the extent of reduction of the respective scattering zzso upon zzso We suggest the method will be zzso to zzso imaging of zzso disorders as well as cancer through several hundred zzso of zzso zzso
