In this paper, a zzso zzso zzso zzso artificial neural network zzso was implemented to identify the zzso patterns of the zzso spinal zzso At the first step, the simplified 3-D spine model was constructed based on the zzso and zzso X-ray zzso The features of the central axis curve of the spinal zzso patterns in 3-D space were extracted by the total zzso zzso The discrete form of the total zzso including the zzso and the zzso of the central axis of the simplified 3-D spine model was derived from the difference zzso The total zzso values of 17 zzso from the first zzso to the fifth zzso spine formed a zzso space of 17 zzso The King zzso model was tested on this zzso ANN identification zzso The 17 total zzso values were presented to the input layer of zzso zzso In the output layer there were five zzso representing five King zzso zzso A total of 37 spinal zzso patterns from zzso patients were zzso These 37 patterns were divided into two zzso The training group had 25 patterns and testing group had 12 zzso The zzso training group was further divided into five zzso Based on the definition of King zzso system, each subset contained all five King zzso The network training was conducted on these five zzso by the zzso method, one of zzso zzso and the early stop zzso In each one of the five zzso sessions, four zzso were alternatively used for zzso learning and one subset left was used for validation zzso Final network testing was conducted with remaining 12 patterns in testing group after the zzso ANN was trained by all five zzso in training zzso The performance of the neural network was evaluated by comparing between two network zzso one with one hidden layer and another with two hidden zzso The results are shown in three zzso The first table shows network errors in zzso learning and the second table shows identification rates in validation zzso The network errors and identification rates in the last round of network training and testing are shown in the third zzso Each table has a comparison for both one hidden layer and two hidden layer zzso
