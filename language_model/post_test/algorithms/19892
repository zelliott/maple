The fundamental property of the zzso signal is the split of identity, meaning the separation of qualitative and quantitative information in form of the local phase and the local zzso zzso Especially the structural zzso independent of brightness and contrast, of the local phase is interesting for numerous image processing zzso Recently, the extension of the zzso signal from zzso to zzso covering also intrinsic zzso structures, was zzso We show the advantages of this improved concept on ultrasound zzso and zzso zzso zzso we use the zzso zzso signal for the envelope detection of zzso zzso This leads to advantages for the extraction of the zzso signal from the modulated carrier zzso We illustrate this, first, by visual assessment of the images, and second, by performing zzso tests to a zzso distribution, indicating a clear improvement of statistical zzso The evaluation is performed for multiple window sizes and zzso zzso zzso Finally, we show that the zzso zzso signal allows for an improved zzso of local features on zzso zzso
