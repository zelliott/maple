A couple of recent applications of zzso zzso zzso experiments as applied to zzso systems involve the zzso zzso transfer difference zzso zzso method and zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a promising tool for rapid screening of a large library of compounds to identify zzso zzso binding to a target zzso Additionally, it is also useful in mapping the binding zzso presented by a zzso zzso to its target zzso In this latter application, the zzso technique is essentially similar to the zzso experiment, which is used to map zzso or zzso acid contact surfaces in zzso In this work, we present a complete relaxation and zzso exchange zzso zzso theory zzso zzso zzso Moseley et zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso for these two closely related zzso As in our previous work, we show that when exchange is fast on the relaxation rate scale, a simplified zzso theory can be formulated using a generalized average relaxation rate zzso Its range of zzso is established by comparing its predictions with those of the exact zzso theory which is valid for all exchange zzso Using some ideal model systems we have analyzed the factors that influence the zzso zzso intensity changes when the zzso from some zzso on the zzso protein are zzso The results show that the intensity changes in the zzso signals in an zzso zzso experiment are very much dependent zzso zzso the zzso time, zzso the location of the saturated zzso zzso with respect to the zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso correlation times for the molecular species, zzso the zzso of the zzso forming complex, and zzso the zzso zzso As an example of a typical application of the zzso experiment we have also simulated the zzso effects for a hypothetical zzso bound to a zzso The zzso theory for zzso and the associated zzso are useful in a quantitative interpretation of the intensity changes in the zzso in both the zzso and zzso provided the identity of the zzso zzso experiencing direct zzso zzso is zzso The zzso presented here is likely to be useful in the design of zzso zzso to a specific target protein and in the quantitative mapping of binding zzso and zzso between molecules in zzso
