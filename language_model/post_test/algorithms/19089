A common approach for identifying zzso influenced by positive selection involves scanning large portions of the zzso for regions that are inconsistent with the neutral equilibrium model or represent zzso relative to the empirical distribution of some aspect of the zzso Once identified, partial sequence is generated spanning this more localized region in order to zzso the zzso spectrum and evaluate the data with tests of neutrality and zzso This method is widely used as partial sequencing is less expensive with regard to both time and zzso Here, we demonstrate that this approach can lead to biased maximum likelihood estimates of selection parameters and reduced rejection rates, with some zzso combinations resulting in clearly misleading zzso Most significantly, for a commonly used sample size in zzso population zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the estimate of the target of selection has a large mean square error and the strength of selection is severely under estimated when the true selected site has not been zzso We propose sequencing approaches that are much more likely to accurately zzso the target and estimate the strength of zzso Additionally, we examine the performance of a commonly used test of selection under a variety of zzso and single sweep zzso
