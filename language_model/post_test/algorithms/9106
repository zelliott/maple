In pattern recognition, feature extraction techniques have been widely employed to reduce the zzso of zzso zzso In this paper, we propose a novel feature extraction zzso called zzso preserving zzso analysis zzso based on the zzso criterion and fuzzy set theory for face zzso In the proposed algorithm, the membership degree of each sample to particular classes is zzso calculated by the fuzzy zzso neighbor zzso zzso to characterize the similarity between each sample and class centers, and then the membership degree is incorporated into the definition of the zzso scatter and the zzso zzso The feature extraction criterion via maximizing the ratio of the zzso scatter to the zzso scatter is zzso Experimental results on the zzso Yale, and zzso face databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed zzso
