The existing low and high temperature theories of zzso zzso are not linked because two conditions imposed on state functions in the low temperature theory are not compatible with the classical zzso on which the high temperature theory is zzso The conditions do not occur in a geometrical theory of quantum phenomena in which particles and waves have separate zzso When applied to zzso zzso this theory covers the whole temperature zzso
