A study of the zzso heart rate zzso zzso hidden dynamic is performed hour by hour, in order to investigate the evolution of the zzso structure of the underlying nervous zzso A hierarchy of zzso hypotheses of zzso zzso models with increasing order zzso is tested against the hidden dynamic of the zzso time zzso The minimum accepted zzso order supplies information about the zzso of the zzso hidden dynamic and consequently of the underlying nervous zzso The zzso model with minimum order is detected for each hour of the zzso time series extracted from seven zzso zzso records of patients in different zzso conditions, some including zzso zzso zzso Heart rate, zzso and zzso index plots are reported to serve as a reference for the description of the patient's cardiovascular frame during each examined zzso The minimum zzso order shows to be a promising index for zzso the average zzso of the zzso nervous system's zzso
