In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for efficient zzso medical image zzso zzso according to the zzso for Next generation zzso systems zzso framework for pattern representation and zzso The proposed scheme involves zzso low-level feature extraction from images followed by the zzso of the feature space to form zzso zzso meaningful zzso The zzso of the feature space is realized by an zzso zzso that uses an zzso approach to automatically determine the number of zzso Then, the zzso property of zzso is zzso the similarity between two clusters is estimated as a function of the similarity of both their structures and the measure zzso zzso were performed on a large set of reference zzso images, using different kinds of features to zzso the low-level image zzso Through this zzso it is shown that the proposed scheme can be efficiently and effectively applied for medical image retrieval from large databases, providing zzso semantic interpretation of the results, which can be further extended by knowledge representation zzso
