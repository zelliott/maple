Our objective was to determine the efficacy of zzso zzso using zzso electrodes, in the treatment of patients with zzso zzso zzso 

In a zzso period zzso 68 zzso in 59 patients (age range, zzso zzso were treated zzso with zzso zzso using zzso needle zzso The mean zzso diameter was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Fifty-one of 59 patients were in zzso class A, and eight were in class zzso zzso was performed by zzso CT at 1, 4, and 6 months and every 6 months after zzso The mean follow-up was zzso months zzso zzso zzso Survival and zzso survival rates were evaluated separately by statistical zzso Any complications were reported during zzso 

zzso survival rates were zzso zzso and zzso at 1, 3, and 5 years, zzso Median survival time was zzso months zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor diameter was associated with the probability of zzso zzso among patients with zzso diameters of 3 zzso or less, zzso among patients with zzso diameters of 3-5 zzso and only zzso among patients with zzso diameters of more than 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso In 34 zzso of 59 patients during zzso new zzso zzso with the treated zzso developed in the liver zzso zzso Median zzso survival rates were zzso zzso and zzso at 1, 2, and 3 years, zzso One major complication occurred zzso that required zzso 

zzso zzso with zzso zzso is safe and effective in the treatment of zzso
