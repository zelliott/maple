The Nottingham zzso zzso zzso zzso was developed and validated in a single zzso in 2007 as a predictor of 30 day zzso It has subsequently been shown to predict longer term and functional zzso We wished to assess the ability of zzso to predict outcomes in other zzso and to investigate the change in outcome after hip fracture over zzso 

The zzso was calculated for all patients with data from three UK hip fracture zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Nottingham zzso including zzso zzso and 1901 patients, zzso The zzso zzso was used to zzso the zzso to 30 day mortality across the three units using a random selection of 50% of the data zzso zzso was assessed using the zzso goodness of zzso 

The median zzso zzso zzso values were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Nottingham zzso zzso There was no correlation between 30 day mortality and time zzso zzso The proportion of patients with zzso zzso 4 showed a weak correlation with time zzso zzso The original zzso equation zzso mortality in the zzso zzso A modified equation shows good zzso for all three zzso zzso day mortality zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The hospital was not a predictor of 30 day zzso 

The zzso with an updated zzso is a robust predictor of 30 day mortality after hip fracture repair in geographically distinct UK zzso
