The objective of this study is to show how zzso modeling can be used to increase our understanding of liver enhancement in dynamic computer zzso It relies on two models: zzso a vascular model, based on zzso rules, is used to generate the zzso zzso vascular zzso zzso the physical process of CT acquisition allows to zzso zzso series of images, aimed at tracking the propagation of a contrast material through the vessel network and the zzso The coupled models are used to simulate the enhancement of a zzso tumor at different acquisition times, showing a maximum zzso during the zzso zzso
