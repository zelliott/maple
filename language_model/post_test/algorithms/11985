Recognizing that if there is no exposure, there is no toxicity leads us to the conclusion that if there is exposure, toxicity can ensue when exposure exceeds a certain dose and/or time and that it will be dependent on zzso and zzso Analysis of the fundamental description of toxicity zzso where T stands for zzso D for zzso K for zzso and E for zzso yields the recognition of three independent time zzso the first being an intrinsic property of a given compound (what does the chemical do to the zzso which is the dynamic time zzso The second time scale is an intrinsic property of a the zzso (what does the zzso do to the zzso which represents the kinetic time zzso The frequency of exposure denotes the third time scale, which is independent of the dynamic and kinetic time zzso zzso of exposure depends on the experimental design or on nature, but not on the zzso or zzso A zzso condition occurs when the frequency becomes so high that it is indistinguishable from continuous zzso Continuous exposure forces the two other time scales to become synchronized thereby reducing complexity to three zzso dose, effect and one time zzso Keeping one of those variables constant allows for the study of the other two variables zzso under zzso or zzso or zzso zzso However, any departure from continuous exposure will introduce the full complexity of four independent variables zzso and zzso dynamic and frequency time zzso zzso on the effect zzso zzso at the same zzso The examples discussed in this paper demonstrate how nature in the form of long zzso provides zzso conditions when either kinetic or dynamic half lives force synchronization of all three time zzso However, for compounds having very short dynamic or kinetic zzso only continuous exposure will provide a synchronized time zzso A decision zzso approach is being used to illustrate how to reduce the enormous complexity generated by five variables zzso effect and up to three time zzso in zzso to manageable proportions by identifying and modeling the zzso zzso zzso in the manifestation of zzso
