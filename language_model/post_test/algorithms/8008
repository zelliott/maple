zzso zzso zzso zzso functions zzso has been an important and yet challenging task due to the extremely high complexity of this kind of functions and the zzso increasing percentage of the number of zzso in the entire set of zzso functions as the number of input variables zzso In this paper, an zzso named zzso learning and zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, which is capable of effectively implementing zzso The novel zzso first trains the zzso offset sequence and zzso zzso into logic zzso operations of a sequence of zzso and then determines the zzso values of the zzso zzso zzso that perform both the zzso of zzso and the function mapping the hidden zzso to the output zzso The zzso is validated by two typical examples about the problem of zzso the circular region and the well-known zzso parity zzso function zzso
