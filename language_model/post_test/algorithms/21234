This paper proposes a novel method to detect transparent living cells in a transparent zzso chamber by optical zzso of an zzso or an zzso zzso Through the analysis of the zzso zzso pattern, one of the parameters of the cells, including the size, zzso index, or position, can be extracted by the analysis software developed in this zzso zzso are carried out to discuss the key issues of this zzso device, and our simulation is verified by zzso patterns of transparent zzso on zzso zzso recorded via a digital zzso
