The zzso zzso activity of people who zzso could provide invaluable information about the association of neural processing and zzso However, the zzso has never been adequately studied during speech in which zzso naturally zzso This is zzso in part, to the masking of the zzso signal by artifact from sources such as the speech zzso and from zzso zzso The aim of this paper was to demonstrate the ability of independent component analysis zzso to remove artifact from the zzso of zzso children recorded while they are speaking and zzso The zzso of 16 male children who zzso and 16 who did not zzso was recorded during a reading zzso The recorded zzso that contained artifact was then subjected to zzso The results demonstrated that the zzso assessed during zzso speech had substantially more noise than the zzso of speech that did not contain zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, it was shown that zzso could effectively remove this artifact in all 16 children zzso zzso zzso The results from one child highlight the findings that zzso can be used to remove dominant artifact that has prevented the study of zzso activity during zzso speech in zzso
