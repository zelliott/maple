Current zzso methods require external marker data to zzso sort image data and generate CT zzso In this work we develop an automated zzso sorting zzso that performs without the aid of data collected from an external respiratory zzso The sorting zzso requires an overlapping zzso scan zzso The overlapping protocol provides a spatial link between couch zzso Beginning with a starting scan position, images from the adjacent scan position (which spatial match the starting scan zzso are selected by maximizing the zzso cross correlation zzso of the images at the overlapping slice zzso The process was continued by zzso zzso all couch positions using the selected images until an entire zzso volume was zzso The zzso produced 16 phase volumes to complete a zzso zzso Additional zzso zzso were also produced using external marker zzso and phase angle sorting zzso The image quality of the volumes produced by the different methods was zzso by calculating the mean difference of the sorted overlapping slices from adjacent couch zzso The zzso sorted images showed a significant decrease in the mean difference zzso zzso zzso for the five zzso
