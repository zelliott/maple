A zzso interface is provided to a simulated network of zzso zzso The interface allows special zzso and zzso zzso zzso to be zzso with conventional programming zzso This hybrid combination allows the power of zzso to be combined with the power of zzso to provide innovative solutions to complex zzso The network uses zzso zzso instead of zzso zzso A mesh zzso is used instead of a zzso zzso The performance of the mesh zzso network compares favorably with that of conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso to incorporate zzso and long-term memory are zzso
