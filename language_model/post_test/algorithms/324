Many zzso applications of zzso laser zzso require zzso spectral phase zzso The optimal phase profile can be programmed on the pulse by zzso pulse zzso A promising zzso zzso for such zzso experiments is evolution strategy zzso Here, we report a four fold increase in the rate of convergence and ten percent increase in the final yield of the zzso compared to the direct zzso approach, by using a new version of zzso in combination with zzso zzso and zzso zzso Such a fast learning rate is of paramount importance in zzso for reducing the artifacts of laser zzso optical degradation, and zzso
