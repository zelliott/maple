The three-dimensional structure of a protein can be treated as a complex network composed of zzso zzso and the network properties can help us to understand the relationship between structure and zzso Since the zzso acid network of a protein is formed in the process of protein zzso it is difficult for general network models to explain its evolving zzso Based on the perspective of protein zzso we propose an evolving model for zzso acid zzso In our model, the evolution starts from the zzso acid sequence of a native protein and it is guided by two generic assumptions: zzso the neighbor preferential rule and the energy preferential zzso We find that the neighbor preferential rule zzso the general network properties and the energy preferential rule zzso the specific biological structure zzso zzso to native zzso our model mimics the features of zzso acid networks zzso
