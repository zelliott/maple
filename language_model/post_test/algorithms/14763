This paper focuses on online scene learning and fast camera zzso which are two key problems currently limiting the performance of wide area zzso reality zzso zzso we propose to use zzso random trees to deal with the online scene learning zzso The zzso can provide more accurate recognition rates than traditional methods, especially with large scale zzso zzso we use the enhanced zzso zzso to obtain a fast camera zzso zzso Compared with traditional zzso our method can significantly reduce the zzso complexity, which zzso to a large degree the process of online camera zzso Finally, we implement our zzso in a zzso manner by using a zzso zzso Camera zzso scene zzso scene learning and zzso are separated into four threads by using zzso hardware zzso While providing real-time tracking performance, the resulting system also possesses the ability to track multiple maps zzso Some experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the zzso of our zzso
