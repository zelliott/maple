With the development of zzso techniques, there is an increasing need of information processing methods to analyze the high zzso zzso zzso is one of the most promising candidates because of its zzso flexibility and zzso However, there is no zzso zzso approach outperforming its counterparts, and it is hard to evaluate and combine the results from different techniques, especially in a field without much prior knowledge, such as zzso This paper proposes a zzso approach to extract the information from results of different zzso techniques, so that a better interpretation of the data distribution can be zzso A special distance measure is defined to represent the statistical zzso of each cluster produced by various zzso zzso The zzso is applied on both artificial and real data zzso show that the proposed approach is able to extract the information efficiently and accurately from the input zzso zzso
