Four models, standard diffusion approximation zzso single zzso Carlo zzso zzso and zzso similarity zzso are developed and evaluated as forward calculation tools in the zzso of tissue optical zzso The inverse calculation uses the ratio of the zzso and phase difference at two locations close to an intensity modulated zzso source to recover the reduced scattering zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso theory allows recovery of optical properties zzso within zzso for media with zzso The performance of the zzso model is similar to zzso with limited enhanced zzso The zzso approximation may limit the use of the zzso model for zzso zzso and/or the zzso may not be accurately calculated by this zzso The zzso model is the best, recovering zzso within zzso regardless of the zzso However, the necessary restriction of the searched zzso space is zzso The performance of zzso is similar to that of diffusion theory for media with zzso and better for zzso zzso determines zzso within zzso and reduced scattering within zzso In practice, satisfactory estimates zzso 5 to zzso can be achieved using SDA to recover zzso and zzso to recover zzso for media with zzso
