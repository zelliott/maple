zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso is a potential method to detect and zzso a zzso zzso capture therapy zzso compound, zzso zzso in the zzso However, optimal positioning of MRS zzso to capture tissue with zzso zzso concentration can be zzso Three zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso provides spectral data covering a large spatial volume, which is a major advantage in detecting and zzso zzso zzso detection limit in phantom conditions was determined at zzso T using a zzso zzso zzso protocol with clinically acceptable nominal spatial resolution and zzso zzso tests for zzso phantom were performed using both single zzso MRS and zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso detection limit was approximately zzso zzso and zzso zzso accuracy was better than zzso The results suggest that zzso would be a feasible method for in zzso zzso evaluation in clinical zzso
