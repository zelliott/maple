To decide whether the use of blood zzso monitoring in critical care practice is zzso We performed a systematic health technology assessment as blood zzso monitoring has been implemented widely but its clinical value in critically ill patients has never been evaluated zzso 

zzso other databases, and citation zzso 

We searched for zzso combined with critically ill patients as the target patient zzso Two zzso independently selected studies based on relevance for the following questions: Does zzso zzso 1) perform well in a laboratory zzso 2) provide information in a number of clinical zzso 3) relate to zzso zzso 4) increase workers' confidence? 5) alter therapeutic zzso 6) result in benefit to zzso 7) result in similar benefits in your own zzso 8) result in benefits which are worth the extra zzso 

We concluded that blood zzso measurement in critically ill zzso 1) is accurate in terms of measurement technique but adequate understanding of the zzso zzso is required for its correct zzso 2) provides not only diagnostic but also important zzso zzso 3) should be measured directly instead of estimated from other zzso zzso 4) has an unknown effect on zzso workers' zzso 5) can alter therapeutic zzso 6) could potentially improve patient outcome when combined with a treatment zzso to zzso oxygen delivery, but this has only been shown zzso 7) is likely to have similar benefits in critical care settings zzso and 8) has an unknown zzso 

The use of blood zzso monitoring has a place in zzso in critically ill patients, but it is unknown whether the routine use of zzso as a resuscitation end point improves zzso This warrants zzso controlled studies on the efficacy of zzso zzso
