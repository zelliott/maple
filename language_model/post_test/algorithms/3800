In functional magnetic resonance imaging, zzso time courses after zzso or zzso zzso zzso are complex valued as a result of phase imperfections due to magnetic field zzso Nearly all zzso studies derive functional zzso based on magnitude zzso time courses zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Hyde, zzso zzso zzso strategies for zzso data sets in functional zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso and Cox, zzso zzso zzso Hyde, zzso zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso 33 zzso zzso Here, we propose to directly model the entire complex or zzso data rather than just the zzso zzso A zzso multiple zzso model is used to model zzso of the complex zzso and a likelihood ratio test is derived to determine zzso in each zzso We investigate the performance of the model on a real zzso then compare the zzso and complex models under varying zzso ratios in a simulation study with varying zzso contrast zzso
