zzso zzso thickness in zzso zzso is one of the key parameters in zzso This paper presents a fast algorithm, suitable for zzso ultrasound devices, for measurement of zzso using zzso zzso zzso long axis zzso The zzso is based on a zzso model of the zzso and the zzso zzso The model shape is estimated using an extended Kalman zzso A feasibility study using 32 zzso recordings is zzso The recordings originate from a database consisting of subjects from a normal healthy zzso Five patients with suspected zzso were included in the zzso zzso zzso zzso were made by two zzso A paired zzso revealed a zzso mean difference, compared to the zzso reference, of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlation zzso was zzso zzso The results are comparable to the zzso between the two zzso which was found to be zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that the method has potential as a tool for rapid assessment of zzso
