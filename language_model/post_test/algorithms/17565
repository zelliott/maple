The use of classical molecular dynamics simulations, performed in explicit water, for the refinement of structural models of proteins generated zzso zzso or based on zzso has been zzso The study involved a test set of 15 proteins that were previously used by Baker and zzso to assess the efficiency of the zzso method for zzso zzso protein structure zzso For each zzso four models generated using the zzso procedure were simulated for periods of between 5 and 400 zzso in explicit zzso under identical zzso In addition, the zzso determined structure and the zzso derived structure in which the side chains of all zzso had been deleted and then zzso using the zzso program were simulated and used as zzso A significant improvement in the zzso of the model structures from the zzso determined structures was observed in several zzso In addition, it was found that in certain cases in which the experimental structure deviated rapidly from the initial structure in the simulations, indicating internal strain, the structures were more stable after zzso the zzso zzso Overall, the results indicate that molecular dynamics simulations on a tens to hundreds of zzso time scale are useful for the refinement of zzso or zzso zzso models of small to medium-size zzso
