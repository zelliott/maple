In recent years, joint zzso coding for multimedia communications has gained increased zzso However, very limited work has been conducted to address the problem of joint zzso coding for zzso zzso In this paper, we propose a data hiding scheme that improves the error resilience of zzso video by zzso embedding the shape and motion information into the texture zzso Within a zzso theoretical zzso the source coding, channel coding, data zzso and decoder error zzso are jointly zzso based on knowledge of the transmission channel zzso Our goal is to achieve the best video quality as expressed by the minimum total expected zzso The zzso problem is solved using zzso relaxation and dynamic zzso The performance of the proposed scheme is tested using simulations of a zzso wireless channel, and the zzso is implemented based on the zzso zzso zzso Experimental results indicate that the proposed hybrid zzso coding scheme significantly zzso methods without data hiding or unequal error zzso
