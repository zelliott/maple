zzso of long-range zzso interactions still represents a bottleneck in the molecular dynamics zzso simulations of biological zzso Despite the advent of sophisticated fast zzso such as the fast zzso method zzso accurate simulations still demand a great amount of zzso time due to the zzso zzso inherently involved in these zzso Unless higher order zzso expansions, which are extremely expensive to zzso are zzso a large amount of the execution time is still spent in directly calculating zzso interactions within the nearby region of each zzso To reduce this execution time for pair zzso we developed a zzso unit zzso called zzso II, that zzso zzso zzso interactions using a specially designed zzso Four custom zzso and a zzso for memory manipulation zzso zzso are mounted on the zzso zzso The zzso processors are responsible for calculation of the pair zzso The particle zzso plays a central role in realizing efficient cooperation with the zzso The results of a series of zzso MD simulations of a zzso system zzso zzso indicated that a more stringent setting of accuracy in zzso computation, compared with those previously reported, was required for accurate simulations over long time zzso Such a level of accuracy was efficiently achieved using the cooperative calculations of the zzso and zzso zzso On an Alpha zzso PC, the zzso zzso at a moderate but tolerable level of accuracy was accelerated by a factor of zzso using three zzso At a high level of zzso the cooperative calculation achieved a zzso acceleration over the corresponding conventional zzso zzso In the cooperative calculations of the zzso and zzso II, it was possible to achieve more accurate zzso at a comparable execution time by incorporating larger nearby zzso
