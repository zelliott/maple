We investigate the sensitivity of a zzso model with states and transition probabilities obtained from zzso a molecular dynamics zzso We have examined a 500 zzso molecular dynamics trajectory of the zzso zzso in explicit zzso The sensitivity is zzso by varying the boundaries of the clusters and investigating the resulting variation in transition probabilities and the average transition time between zzso In this way, we represent the effect of zzso using different zzso zzso It is found that in terms of the investigated zzso the zzso dynamics described by the zzso model is sensitive to the zzso in particular, the average transition times are found to vary up to zzso Moreover, inclusion of zzso sparsely populated clusters can lead to serious errors of up to zzso In the investigation, the time step used in the transition zzso is determined by the minimum time scale on which the system behaves approximately zzso This time step is found to be about 100 zzso It is concluded that the description of zzso dynamics with transition zzso should be performed with care, and that using standard zzso zzso to obtain states and transition probabilities may not always produce reliable zzso
