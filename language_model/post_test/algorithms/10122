Using the zzso zzso model of zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso model of zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is extended to three populations of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The new model zzso total and zzso zzso zzso as a function of the total zzso zzso A main characteristic of the model is that all the parameters that describe it have biological or optical zzso The zzso model performs better than the zzso model at retrieving total zzso zzso zzso for the contributions of zzso and zzso rather than the combination of both as in the zzso model, improved significantly the retrieval of zzso zzso at low zzso zzso zzso specific zzso of zzso derived using the model compares well with previously published zzso However, the model presented in this paper provides the specific zzso of three size classes and is zzso to a zzso of zzso zzso zzso obtained from remotely sensed zzso using our model compares well with in zzso zzso zzso
