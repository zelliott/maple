Three important areas of data analysis for global gene expression analysis are class discovery, class zzso and finding zzso genes zzso The clinical application of zzso data will require marker genes whose expression patterns are sufficiently well understood to allow accurate predictions on disease zzso zzso zzso used methods of analysis include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and machine learning zzso We describe an approach called the maximum difference subset zzso zzso that combines zzso zzso classical statistics, and elements of machine learning and provides a coherent zzso By zzso prediction zzso the zzso zzso learns the critical threshold of statistical significance (the alpha or zzso eliminating the zzso of setting a threshold of statistical significance and minimizing the effect of the zzso zzso To reduce the false positive rate and to increase external zzso of the zzso gene set, a zzso step is zzso This step identifies and removes genes in the initial zzso with low combined zzso zzso The overall zzso provides a prediction that is less dependent on an arbitrary study design zzso inclusion or zzso and should thus have high external zzso We demonstrate that this approach, unlike other published methods, identifies zzso capable of predicting the outcome of zzso chemotherapy in cases of acute zzso zzso By incorporating two zzso significance and zzso zzso approach learns the significance level relevant for a given data zzso The zzso approach can be used with any test and zzso operator zzso
