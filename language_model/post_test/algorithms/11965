This paper presents a computer vision framework for detecting and tracking zzso images of linear structures in differential interference contrast zzso zzso The tracker can resolve image zzso of zzso of a zzso despite the weak and zzso contrast in zzso as well as the variable blur in such image data caused by vertical zzso zzso In our high zzso zzso high zzso microscope zzso this resolution zzso to 5 zzso in object zzso In video zzso similar resolution has been reported zzso only for zzso zzso targets such as zzso zzso The tracker was developed for measuring zzso of clamped zzso with a freely moving second zzso By zzso the zzso fluctuations of such zzso it was possible to derive their zzso The paper describes a filtering scheme for the detection and zzso of zzso zzso line images which represent zzso of zzso For tracking the movements of the extracted lines we adopted the sum of squared zzso differences zzso from computer zzso The analysis of the fluctuation zzso demonstrates the high sensitivity of this tracking technique in zzso zzso and zzso zzso We derived that the theoretical limit in tracking zzso of such zzso line images is zzso zzso four times below the zzso verified zzso This indicates that the proposed tracker is still zzso Nevertheless, the tracking precision was sufficient to reveal subtle zzso in the distribution of zzso zzso from free zzso They were induced by pivotal points and multiple positions of zzso Also, the results suggest that there were defects in the zzso structure which caused very small but significant zzso in the zzso zzso
