Our objective was to determine the relationship between single zzso zzso zzso in the zzso resistance 1 zzso gene and the zzso zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of 151 kidney and heart transplant recipients undergoing maintenance therapy was described by use of zzso zzso modeling zzso according to a zzso zzso model with zzso zzso and zzso All patients were zzso for the zzso and zzso , zzso and zzso , and zzso zzso zzso 

For a typical zzso white patient, the following parameters were zzso zzso rate constant, zzso h zzso zzso time lag, zzso hour; oral volume of distribution of the central and peripheral zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso oral clearance zzso zzso zzso and oral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso zzso was significantly correlated with weight and zzso zzso was zzso higher zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso in white patients than in black and Asian zzso In carriers of a zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso higher compared with zzso zzso and this effect was independent of ethnicity or zzso zzso of these zzso into the zzso model did not markedly reduce zzso zzso of zzso None of the other zzso studied significantly influenced any of the zzso zzso 

Patients carrying a zzso zzso zzso have a significantly higher oral zzso clearance compared with patients zzso for zzso zzso However, this genetic effect on zzso disposition was small, and zzso of transplant recipients for zzso is thus unlikely to assist in planning initial zzso zzso
