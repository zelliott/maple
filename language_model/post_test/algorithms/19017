We studied the improvement of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso cancer in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by analyzing the acquired counts with a statistical zzso 

Thirty-nine zzso zzso from 32 cases with zzso cancer were included in this zzso zzso zzso was defined as the site where counts were higher than the average plus 3 standard zzso zzso on each zzso image of zzso zzso After the initial zzso regions were selected, these high zzso areas were automatically excluded from consideration zzso This method was repeated and new zzso regions were zzso This method was repeated up to five zzso After that, the zzso zzso regions were compared with zzso zzso zzso images, and the high zzso areas that were superimposed on the normal structures, such as zzso vessels, and zzso were excluded from the zzso The remaining zzso regions were diagnosed as zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso was zzso We then compared these statistical results with the results obtained on the basis of visual assessments by zzso 

Our proposed method showed the best results when the procedures were repeated three times in the light of zzso After being repeated three times, this method detected zzso zzso zzso zzso in the first zzso group, zzso zzso in the zzso zzso groups and zzso zzso in the total zzso whereas the zzso diagnosed zzso zzso of zzso first zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the total zzso A statistically significant difference was observed between the result of iteration number 3 and that by zzso as for the zzso zzso and the total zzso 

This study suggests that our proposed statistical method could improve the zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso Our method will help zzso to detect small zzso zzso such as zzso zzso
