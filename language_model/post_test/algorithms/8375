A zzso model was developed for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the major zzso zzso and zzso zzso in rats and zzso This model zzso target tissue zzso and dynamic response zzso zzso zzso describing zzso zzso and disposition of zzso zzso and zzso and the associated zzso zzso zzso zzso in blood and zzso following acute and chronic oral and zzso zzso To facilitate model development, single zzso zzso studies were conducted in rats zzso zzso and humans zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were determined, as well as the extent of blood zzso and brain zzso only) zzso zzso In blood, the concentration of zzso followed the order zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in humans zzso was not zzso zzso were compared against experimental data and previously published studies in rats and zzso The model was zzso to zzso compare zzso and dynamic response between rats and humans over a range of zzso zzso The time course of zzso and zzso in both species was linear over the dose range zzso and the model reasonably simulated the zzso zzso of plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso and brain zzso only) zzso Model simulations suggest that rats exhibit greater metabolism of zzso to zzso than humans do, and that the depletion of zzso zzso is associated with a zzso zzso increase in zzso blood and brain zzso This zzso zzso model zzso estimates target tissue zzso and zzso zzso and is a strong framework for further zzso zzso model development and for refining a biologically based risk assessment for exposure to zzso under a variety of zzso
