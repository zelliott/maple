zzso zzso ultrasound imaging zzso could zzso the zzso zzso zzso but the high pressure threshold required to incite zzso behavior in an ultrasound contrast agent will compromise zzso trait that has hampered the clinical use of zzso The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of using zzso zzso to improve the sensitivity and zzso resolution of zzso 

The zzso response of zzso a commercial zzso ultrasound contrast agent zzso to zzso zzso fractional zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso fractional zzso zzso was zzso first using computer simulations and then zzso zzso windowed zzso zzso with pulse zzso ranging from zzso to 3 zzso were used in all zzso All experimental studies were performed with a pair of zzso (20 zzso zzso both with diameter of zzso zzso and focal length of 50 zzso The size distribution of the zzso was measured with a zzso Cell zzso 

The simulation predicted a pressure threshold that was an order of magnitude higher than that determined zzso However, all other predictions were consistent with the experimental zzso It was predicted that: zzso exciting the agent with zzso would produce stronger zzso response relative to those produced by zzso zzso increasing the fractional bandwidth of zzso zzso would increase the sensitivity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso would increase zzso zzso The experimental results revealed that zzso ratios obtained with zzso were zzso zzso higher than those produced with zzso of similar zzso The zzso resolution achieved with zzso fractional bandwidth zzso was approximately twice that achieved with zzso fractional bandwidth zzso 

The zzso method is a suitable zzso strategy for zzso zzso zzso At the 20 zzso transmission frequency and zzso fractional zzso zzso zzso appears to represent the ideal zzso between zzso strength and zzso zzso
