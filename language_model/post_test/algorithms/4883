zzso zzso pressure zzso is a major indicator of the effectiveness of zzso resuscitation in human and animal research studies, however, methods for calculating zzso differ among research zzso Here we compare the 6 published methods for calculating zzso using the same data set of zzso zzso and right zzso zzso blood zzso zzso was zzso using each of the 6 calculation methods in an zzso pig model, zzso with zzso with zzso pressure zzso zzso and right zzso pressures were recorded continuously during zzso induced zzso zzso and standard zzso zzso zzso calculated from the same raw data set by the 6 calculation methods ranged from zzso zzso retrograde blood zzso to 26 zzso zzso zzso zzso of 15 zzso 11 zzso The zzso achieved by standard closed chest zzso is typically reported as zzso zzso Within a single study the zzso values may be zzso however, the zzso values for different studies may not be a reliable indicator of the efficacy of a given zzso zzso zzso derived true mean coronary zzso pressure is arguably the gold standard method for representing coronary zzso zzso
