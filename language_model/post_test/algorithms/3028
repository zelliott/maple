To assess the changes in the nuclear zzso pattern zzso with progressive sun damage in skin zzso ranging from zzso zzso skin to zzso cell zzso zzso 

zzso were taken from 140 cases with zzso but zzso normal skin, from 20 cases visually assessed as zzso zzso zzso or early zzso from 30 cases of zzso and from 21 cases of zzso A total of zzso zzso were recorded from these zzso zzso digital imagery was recorded, and features descriptive of the nuclear zzso pattern were zzso Both supervised learning and zzso learning zzso were employed to derive progression zzso 

With increased sun exposure, the proportion of zzso exhibiting changes in the nuclear zzso pattern rises zzso Using zzso no significant differences could be substantiated between zzso collected from early AK sites and AK zzso Cases of SCC fell into 2 distinct zzso A larger group zzso zzso of zzso had characteristics similar to zzso A smaller group zzso zzso of zzso represented much more progressed zzso 

zzso assessment can provide a zzso measure of progression for sun damage and of the zzso from normal in both AK and SCC zzso
