Future zzso zzso enforce a fast hazard and risk assessment of thousands of existing zzso If conducted by means of present data requirements, this assessment will use a huge number of test animals and will be neither cost nor time zzso The purpose of the current research was to develop methods to increase the zzso of in zzso data for zzso and zzso regarding acute zzso For this purpose, a large existing database containing in zzso and in zzso data was zzso For more than 300 compounds in the database, relations between in zzso zzso and rat or mouse intravenous and oral in zzso zzso values were re-evaluated and the possibilities for definition of mechanism based chemical zzso were zzso A high in zzso zzso correlation was found for chemicals classified as zzso This can be explained by a shared unspecific zzso of these compounds which will act as the zzso mode of action for both zzso irritation and acute zzso For this zzso which covered almost zzso of all compounds in the database, the zzso values after intravenous dosing could be predicted with high zzso A somewhat lower accuracy was found for the prediction of oral zzso values based on in zzso zzso zzso Based on this successful zzso a zzso and zzso scheme was developed, that includes a hazard based definition of the zzso domain zzso and a prediction of the zzso of compounds for their acute zzso and oral zzso The scheme was tested by an external zzso
