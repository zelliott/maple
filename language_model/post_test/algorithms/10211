The efficacy of high-intensity focused ultrasound zzso for the treatment of a range of different zzso including those of the liver, prostate and breast, has been zzso As a zzso focused therapy, zzso offers considerable advantages over techniques such as chemotherapy and surgical zzso in terms of reduced risk of harmful side zzso Despite this, there are a number of significant challenges which currently hinder its widespread clinical zzso One of these challenges is the need to transmit sufficient energy through the rib cage to induce tissue necrosis in the required volume whilst minimizing the formation of side zzso zzso zzso zzso are currently showing great promise in overcoming the limitations of zzso zzso Nevertheless, successful treatment of a patient with liver zzso requires a thorough understanding of the way in which the zzso pressure field from a zzso array is scattered by the rib zzso In order to address this, a boundary element approach based on a generalized minimal residual zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was used in conjunction with phase zzso techniques to focus the field of a zzso random zzso array behind human ribs at locations requiring zzso and zzso zzso zzso were carried out on a zzso mesh of zzso pressure patches generated using CT scan anatomical data for adult ribs 9-12 on the right zzso The methodology was validated on zzso and zzso zzso Field calculations were also carried out for idealized ribs, consisting of zzso of zzso zzso demonstrating effects of splitting at the zzso This method has the advantage of fully accounting for the effect of scattering and zzso in zzso under continuous wave zzso
