According to the European zzso for quality assured breast cancer screening and diagnosis, noise analysis is one of the zzso that needs to be performed as part of quality control procedures on digital zzso zzso However, the method recommended in the European zzso does not discriminate sufficiently between systems with and without additional noise besides quantum zzso This paper attempts to give an alternative and relatively simple method for noise analysis which can divide noise into electronic noise, structured noise and quantum zzso zzso noise needs to be the dominant noise source in clinical images for optimal performance of a digital zzso system, and therefore the amount of electronic and structured noise should be zzso For several digital zzso systems, the noise was separated into components based on the measured zzso value, standard zzso zzso of the image and the detector entrance zzso The results showed that differences between systems zzso Our findings confirm that the proposed method is able to discriminate systems based on their noise performance and is able to detect possible quality zzso zzso we suggest to replace the current method for noise analysis as described in the European zzso by the alternative method described in this zzso
