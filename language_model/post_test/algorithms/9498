The zzso pump pulse used in double electron electron resonance zzso zzso produces dynamic phase shifts that are explained here by simple zzso and zzso descriptions of the full range of signal behaviors observed during zzso zzso zzso large phase shifts in the zzso changes in the position and shape of the detected zzso and changes in the signal zzso The dynamic phase shifts depend on the zzso zzso and offset frequency of the pump zzso zzso zzso as well as pairs or clusters of zzso zzso have the same dynamic phase shift that is independent of pump pulse delay in a typical zzso A method of zzso both the pump pulse offset frequency and the pump pulse field strength is zzso A zzso model is presented that explains the dynamic phase shifts in terms of zzso zzso that is either spin locked or zzso about the effective pump field during the pump zzso zzso of the dynamic phase shifts are discussed as they relate to setting up, zzso and interpreting the results of zzso zzso
