Men with zzso disease who also have zzso dysfunction represent a challenge to the zzso Historically, penile zzso surgery has been the management strategy of choice for this zzso This study was undertaken to define the outcomes of a penile zzso surgery zzso in men with zzso disease and zzso zzso dysfunction zzso 

Patients presenting with combined zzso disease and zzso dysfunction were treated with zzso therapy zzso All patients underwent dynamic infusion zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso were advised to undergo penile prosthetic zzso zzso to zzso therapy were considered candidates for either zzso or plaque incision and zzso The International Index of zzso zzso zzso questionnaire was used to compare zzso function and satisfaction profiles serially zzso and zzso between the patients in the three zzso 

zzso patients constituted the study zzso Eighty-one percent of the patients responded to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso function domain scores were statistically higher for implant patients and lower for plaque incision and zzso patients compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso satisfaction domain scores were higher for zzso and implant patients and lower for plaque incision and zzso patients compared to zzso zzso 

The surgical zzso used in this study leads to excellent zzso zzso function and satisfaction scores for zzso and implant zzso however, plaque incision and zzso patients had poor functional and satisfaction zzso These data support the concept that not all men with combined zzso and zzso disease require penile prosthetic surgery, and zzso plaque incision and zzso surgery is a poor option for men with combined zzso
