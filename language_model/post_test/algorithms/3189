The aim was to investigate the effects of echo time zzso on diffusion zzso of brain white zzso Seven zzso monkeys (all zzso age, 4-6 years; weight, zzso zzso underwent diffusion zzso imaging zzso with a series of zzso in zzso T and zzso T MR zzso The mean zzso zzso fractional zzso zzso primary zzso and zzso zzso zzso were measured in a region of interest at the bilateral internal zzso zzso correlation showed that the zzso and zzso increased and zzso decreased with TE both at zzso T and zzso T except for the zzso zzso measurement analysis of zzso zzso also showed significantly higher zzso and lower MD and zzso at zzso T than those at zzso T zzso but no statistical differences were found in zzso between these two field strengths zzso These findings implied that TE and field strength might influence diffusion zzso in brain white zzso
