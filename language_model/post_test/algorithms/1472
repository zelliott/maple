A completely automated zzso is presented which is capable of identifying both the zzso and zzso fields on digitized chest zzso zzso The zzso is tested on a sample of 802 chest images against lung fields drawn by a human zzso The average zzso are found to be zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso regions, zzso To put them into perspective, the results are compared to several other simple zzso zzso These include a comparison of two sets of lung fields drawn by the human observer at different times which yielded zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso regions, zzso
