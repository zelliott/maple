A method is proposed to calculate the weight zzso of a zzso array for ultrasound imaging to obtain a zzso zzso beam pattern based on the zzso response zzso An zzso problem is established, and the zzso cone zzso zzso is used to solve the problem to obtain the weight zzso The zzso acoustic zzso field of the zzso array is then calculated using the Field II program by applying the obtained weight zzso to the zzso The simulation results with a zzso 26 zzso linear phased array show that the proposed method can be used to control the zzso of the zzso zzso beam pattern of the zzso array and achieve a zzso zzso The zzso sound pressure distribution of the zzso array using the proposed method focuses much better than that using the standard delay and sum zzso zzso zzso The sound energy is more concentrated using the proposed zzso
