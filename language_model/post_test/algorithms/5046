Our purpose was to study the utility of zzso zzso in zzso benign from zzso breast zzso by assessing the best b zzso 

zzso women zzso age, zzso zzso with 52 focal mass breast zzso underwent zzso imaging with different b zzso The apparent diffusion zzso zzso value of each zzso was calculated from the zzso maps done using five b values zzso zzso 500, zzso and 1,000 zzso and using b values of 0 zzso with each other b value separately zzso and 250 zzso 0 and 500 zzso 0 and 750 zzso 0 and 1,000 zzso The mean zzso values were correlated with imaging findings and zzso zzso The zzso zzso value, sensitivity, and specificity of zzso imaging to differentiate benign and zzso zzso were calculated in all b value zzso A p value of zzso zzso was considered statistically zzso 

The mean zzso value was significantly lower for zzso zzso compared to benign zzso zzso zzso zzso in all b value zzso No statistical difference was seen between the zzso obtained from different b value combinations zzso zzso zzso in the differentiation between benign and zzso zzso The zzso calculated from b 0 and 750 zzso was slightly better than the other b value combinations, showing a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso 

zzso imaging is a potential resource as a zzso of zzso in the differentiation between benign and zzso zzso Such imaging can be performed without a significant increase in examination time, especially because it can be done with lower b zzso
