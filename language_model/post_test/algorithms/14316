zzso data embedding using zzso distance requires the construction of a connected neighborhood graph so that the zzso distance between every pair of data points can be zzso This paper proposes an approach for constructing zzso neighborhood zzso The approach works by applying a greedy zzso to add each edge, in a zzso order of edge zzso to a neighborhood graph if end zzso of the edge are not yet zzso on the zzso The zzso between zzso is tested using a network flow technique by assigning every zzso a unit flow zzso This approach is zzso to a wide range of zzso zzso show that it gives better zzso of zzso distances than other approaches, especially when the data are zzso or zzso zzso
