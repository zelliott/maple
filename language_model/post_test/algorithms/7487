zzso registration of ultrasound images to statistical shape models is a challenging problem in zzso spine injection procedures due to the typical imaging artifacts inherent to zzso In this paper we propose a robust and accurate registration method that matches local phase bone features extracted from ultrasound images to a statistical shape zzso The local phase information for enhancing the bone surfaces is obtained using a zzso energy zzso zzso which combines advantages of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso resulting in an improved simultaneous zzso of phase and orientation zzso A novel statistical shape model was built by separating the pose statistics from the shape zzso This model is then registered to the local phase bone surfaces using an zzso expectation zzso registration zzso zzso on 96 in zzso clinical scans obtained from eight patients resulted in a root mean square registration error of 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso which is below the clinically acceptable threshold of zzso zzso The improvement achieved in registration accuracy using the new features was also significant zzso zzso zzso compared to state of the art local phase image processing zzso
