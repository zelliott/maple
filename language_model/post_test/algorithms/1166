We present a zzso method that can simulate an essential step in the zzso presentation in higher zzso namely the step involving the zzso degradation of zzso into fragments which have the potential to bind to zzso Class I zzso zzso zzso prediction zzso published so far were trained on data from in zzso zzso experiments with zzso zzso As a result, they did not take into account the characteristics of the structurally modified zzso called zzso in cells zzso by zzso under zzso zzso Our zzso has been trained not only on in zzso data, but also on zzso Class I zzso data, which reflect a combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso This feature, together with the use of neural networks, a zzso zzso technique, make the prediction of zzso Class I zzso boundaries more zzso zzso of the zzso sites and zzso of the zzso sites are correctly zzso Moreover, we show that the neural networks trained on the zzso zzso data learns a specificity that differs from that of the networks trained on zzso Class I zzso zzso the specificity of the zzso is different than the zzso zzso The tools developed in this study in combination with a predictor of zzso and TAP binding capacity should give a more complete prediction of the generation and presentation of peptides on zzso Class I zzso Here we demonstrate that such an approach produces an accurate prediction of the zzso the zzso in zzso zzso The method is available at zzso
