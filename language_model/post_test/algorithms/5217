Noise filtering techniques that maintain image contrast while decreasing image noise have the potential to zzso the quality of zzso zzso zzso images acquired at reduced radiation zzso In this paper, a hybrid diffusion filter with continuous switch zzso is introduced, which exploits the benefits of three-dimensional zzso diffusion zzso and zzso diffusion zzso Noise is zzso while edges, zzso structures, and small zzso structures are zzso From ten high dose zzso CT scans, acquired at clinical doses, ultra low dose ( 15 zzso ) scans were simulated and used to evaluate and compare zzso to other diffusion zzso such as zzso zzso diffusion and zzso zzso results show that the zzso filter zzso the other filters in restoring the high dose CT scan from the corresponding simulated low dose zzso A qualitative evaluation was performed on filtered real low dose CT zzso zzso An expert observer scored artifacts as well as fine structures and was asked to choose one of three scans zzso filtered zzso one zzso for three different settings zzso zzso and zzso Overall, the zzso filtered scan was chosen most zzso
