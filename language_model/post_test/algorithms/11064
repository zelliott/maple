While the majority of studies have focused on the association between sex hormones and zzso emerging evidence supports the role of other hormone signals in increasing zzso zzso However, due to the lack of an integrated view on zzso interactions of hormone signaling pathways associated with zzso molecular mechanisms through which hormones contribute to the increased risk of zzso has remained unclear and capacity of translating hormone signals to potential therapeutic and diagnostic applications in relation to zzso has been zzso 

Using an zzso zzso and zzso approach, a global hormone interaction network in the context of zzso was constructed, which was further filtered down to a model of zzso hormone signaling zzso This model was evaluated for its biological and clinical relevance through zzso recovery test, evidence-based analysis, and zzso zzso zzso validation of the model was performed using the proposed novel mechanism discovery approach based on zzso zzso zzso 

Our results reveal the existence of a well-connected hormone interaction network underlying zzso Seven hormone signaling pathways zzso at the core of the hormone interaction network, which are shown to be mechanistically linked to the risk of zzso zzso these zzso zzso signaling zzso takes the major part in the model and insulin signaling zzso is analyzed for its association to learning and memory zzso zzso of the model through serendipitous zzso effects suggests that hormone signaling pathways substantially contribute to the zzso of zzso 

The integrated network model of hormone interactions underlying zzso may serve as an initial zzso platform for identifying potential therapeutic targets and candidate zzso for zzso disorders such as Alzheimer's zzso
