zzso zzso has a low diagnostic yield before a zzso operation, and magnetic resonance imaging and zzso zzso are reliable alternatives to invasive zzso A new diagnostic zzso to avoid cardiac zzso in zzso subjects before a zzso operation is zzso 

The proposed zzso would identify zzso subjects on the basis of risk factors on medical history, zzso and zzso zzso The efficacy of this zzso in screening for subjects deemed to be zzso after zzso was evaluated zzso in 151 zzso For this analysis, results of conventional zzso zzso to be equivalent to zzso zzso were zzso 

According to the algorithm, 95 zzso of 151 subjects had no risk factors zzso zzso whereas 56 zzso of 151 had 1 risk factor or more zzso zzso Nine zzso of 151 subjects were found to be zzso after zzso and all 9 were correctly classified as high risk by the zzso In the 135 of 151 subjects who underwent a zzso operation, the zzso predicted an adverse zzso outcome with a sensitivity of 51% and specificity of zzso However, this prediction was not improved by including elevated pulmonary artery pressure or zzso filling pressure as additional risk zzso 

The proposed zzso effectively screened for subjects who were deemed zzso for a zzso zzso In addition, omitting zzso invasive zzso assessment did not impair prediction of adverse zzso zzso Prospective evaluation of such a zzso diagnostic strategy before the zzso operation is zzso
