zzso structure, in terms of positioning of zzso and zzso regions in the DNA, has been found to have an immense impact on various cell functions and zzso ranging from zzso regulation to growth and zzso In spite of numerous experimental and zzso approaches being developed in the past few years to determine the intrinsic relationship between zzso structure zzso zzso and DNA sequence features, there is yet no universally accurate approach to predict zzso positioning from the underlying DNA sequence zzso We here propose an alternative approach to predicting zzso positioning from zzso making use of characteristic sequence differences, and inherent zzso in overlapping sequence zzso Our zzso positioning prediction algorithm, based on the idea of generalized zzso hidden zzso models zzso was used to predict zzso state based on the DNA sequence in zzso zzso III, and compared with two other existing zzso The zzso method performed favorably among the three models in terms of specificity and sensitivity, and provided estimates that were largely consistent with predictions from the method of zzso and Liu zzso However, all the methods still give higher than desirable zzso rates, indicating that zzso features may provide only limited information towards understanding positioning of zzso The method is implemented in the zzso statistical software zzso and is freely available from the zzso zzso
