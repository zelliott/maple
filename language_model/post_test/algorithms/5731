To compare the sensitivity and specificity of bedside diagnostic stroke scales in patients with suspected zzso 

A zzso zzso study of patients with suspected acute stroke in an emergency department in a UK zzso zzso zzso The results of an assessment with the zzso of Stroke in the Emergency Room zzso scale, the Face zzso Speech Test zzso scale and the diagnosis of zzso or probable stroke by an emergency zzso zzso standard A consensus diagnosis of stroke or transient zzso attack zzso made after discussion by an expert panel zzso included stroke physicians, zzso and zzso who had access to the clinical findings, imaging and subsequent clinical course, but were blinded to the results of the assessments by zzso zzso 

In zzso patients with complete data, the expert panel assigned a diagnosis of acute stroke or zzso in 246 and a diagnosis of mimic in zzso The zzso had a sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso 78 to zzso and specificity of zzso zzso zzso 34 to zzso and the zzso had a sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso 76 to zzso and a specificity of zzso zzso zzso 30 to zzso There was no zzso difference between the scales in sensitivity zzso zzso zzso or specificity zzso zzso zzso 

The simpler zzso scale could replace the more complex zzso for the initial assessment of patients with suspected acute stroke in the emergency zzso
