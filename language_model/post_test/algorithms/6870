zzso mechanisms of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso were investigated using zzso zzso and zzso zzso A quantitative method was developed that established a direct link between the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso values ranged from 47 zzso zzso for zzso to zzso for zzso and showed that the extent of zzso compounds zzso zzso was strongly dependent on the number and position of the zzso zzso as well as other zzso and zzso zzso The amount of zzso zzso to zzso was strongly influenced by the nature of the zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso significantly influenced the positions and relative zzso of the zzso modes of the zzso zzso The strongest zzso were observed for zzso with lower zzso of zzso zzso zzso and included a red shift of the zzso band, a zzso blue shift of the zzso zzso These changes were accompanied by a zzso increase in the relative intensity of the zzso band relative to the intensity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso quantum mechanics calculations were used to zzso frequency shifts in terms of zzso interactions with zzso zzso zzso indicate that the zzso of zzso to zzso surfaces is controlled largely by the zzso characteristics of the zzso zzso which regulates both zzso zzso and swelling of the zzso
