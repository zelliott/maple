zzso short-term memory is an intrinsic property which can make the action potential duration produce a transient response after a sudden change in heart zzso The change of vulnerability was investigated by using computer simulation method during the transient period which was created by abruptly zzso the cycle length from zzso to zzso The study was performed on a zzso fiber consisting of zzso zzso and zzso canine zzso An zzso parallel zzso was used to accelerate the zzso The study shows that the vulnerable window zzso relied on both pacing times and zzso At the cycle length of zzso compared with the situation of zzso zzso there was a large zzso zzso of zzso zzso at the 30th zzso For most of the sites along the zzso VW consistently demonstrated widely at the beginning of the transient zzso Generally, with sustained zzso VW tended to become zzso The results suggested that during a zzso transient response, the probability of an occurrence of zzso wave increased immediately after an abrupt change in pacing rate because of the relatively large zzso and VW within this zzso zzso avoidance of a sudden heart rate variation was indicated to be helpful for the suppression of zzso zzso
