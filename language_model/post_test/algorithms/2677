zzso computerized zzso has gained great interest because of its ability to characterize the chemical composition of a material rather than simply providing relative zzso images as in conventional zzso The purpose of this paper is to introduce a novel zzso zzso processing algorithm, with an emphasis on detection and characterization of zzso constant objects embedded in an unknown cluttered zzso Physical properties of the objects, particularly the Compton scattering and zzso zzso zzso are assumed to be known with some level of zzso Our approach is based on a zzso representation of the characteristic function of the object and encompasses a number of zzso techniques for addressing both the prior information we have concerning the physical properties of the object and the fundamental zzso limitations associated with our ability to jointly recover the Compton scattering and zzso zzso properties of the zzso In the absence of an object with appropriate physical properties, our approach returns a zzso characteristic function and, thus, can be viewed as simultaneously solving the detection and characterization zzso Unlike the vast majority of methods that define the zzso function zzso zzso as a dense set of zzso values, we define our level set zzso via zzso basis functions and employ a zzso zzso for cost zzso zzso results show that the zzso successfully detects objects of interest, finds their shape and location, and gives an adequate reconstruction of the zzso
