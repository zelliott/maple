The camera lens zzso is an important component in a zzso optical imaging system and has a crucial influence on the images registered on the zzso zzso However, this influence has not been taken into account in the existing zzso zzso transport zzso To model the zzso transport process more accurately, a generalized zzso zzso transport model is zzso It combines zzso source theory with analysis of the influence of the camera lens zzso to simulate zzso transport process in free zzso In addition, the zzso zzso is also adopted to establish the energy relationship between the virtual detector and the zzso zzso The accuracy and feasibility of the proposed model is validated with a zzso zzso zzso transport model and physical phantom zzso A comparison study with our previous hybrid zzso zzso based model demonstrates the improvement performance and potential of the proposed model for simulating zzso transport process in free zzso
