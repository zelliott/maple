zzso antibiotics resistance in human pathogens represents a pressing public health issue worldwide for which novel zzso therapies based on zzso peptides zzso may offer one possible zzso In the current study, we zzso publicly available data on zzso to construct hidden zzso models zzso that enable recognition of individual classes of zzso peptides (such as zzso zzso zzso zzso with up to zzso accuracy and can be used for discovering novel zzso zzso 

zzso models for both mature peptides and zzso were zzso A total of 146 models for mature peptides and 40 for zzso have been developed for individual zzso zzso These were created by zzso and analyzing zzso sequences available in the public sources and by zzso zzso scanning of the zzso database for previously unknown zzso zzso As a result, an additional 229 additional zzso have been identified from zzso and all but 34 could be associated with known zzso activities according to the zzso The final set of zzso mature peptides and zzso zzso have been organized into the zzso zzso zzso 

The developed zzso tools and zzso sequences can be zzso through the zzso resource at zzso
