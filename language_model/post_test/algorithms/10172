Given human population growth and accelerated global trade, the rate of emergence of exotic plant pathogens is bound to zzso zzso the processes that lead to the emergence of new pathogens can help manage emerging zzso Novel tools for analyzing population genetic variation can be used to zzso the evolutionary history of populations or species, allowing for the unprecedented reconstruction of the demographic history of zzso Specifically, recent advances in the application of zzso maximum likelihood zzso and zzso methods to population genetic data combined with increasing availability of affordable sequencing and parallel computing have created the opportunity to apply these methods to a broad range of questions regarding the evolution of emerging zzso These approaches are particularly powerful when used to test multiple competing zzso We provide several examples illustrating how zzso analysis provides critical insights into understanding migration pathways as well as processes of zzso zzso and zzso
