A method to retrieve the radius and the relative zzso index of zzso homogeneous zzso particles by zzso scattering is zzso It is based on the formation of zzso zzso of the scattered intensity, which are zzso with respect to the linear homogeneous transformations of an zzso signal and approximation of the retrieved zzso dependence on the zzso by a zzso neural zzso The neural network was trained by zzso of the mean squared relative error in the range of particle zzso from zzso zzso up to zzso zzso and relative zzso index from zzso up to zzso In comparison with training on a minimum of the mean squared error, this method enables one to increase the accuracy of the radius retrieval in the range of zzso from zzso to 2 zzso and zzso index in the range from zzso to zzso The values of intensity of light scattered in the zzso of angles 10 zzso degrees are used as input zzso If the measurement error is zzso the mean errors of the radius and relative zzso index are zzso and zzso zzso The results obtained by the proposed method and by the trial and error method with published experimental data zzso with a scanning flow zzso are zzso The zzso difference in the retrieval results of radius and the relative zzso index of particles obtained by both methods is under zzso
