For zzso cancer therapies, alternatives to traditional phase II zzso are zzso Von zzso zzso proposed an zzso zzso survival zzso ratio, the growth zzso index zzso Current practice in zzso of the zzso success rate is conservative and omits a measure of zzso We investigated zzso and zzso methods to estimate the zzso success rate, including an approach using zzso for paired survival outcomes zzso and zzso zzso zzso were applied to a phase II zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso From simulation studies, it was determined that a zzso zzso had the most favorable statistical zzso Its point estimate bias was consistently within zzso its bias and precision were robust over a range of effect and zzso zzso Using a proof of concept criterion of zzso a simulation investigation found that a zzso of zzso for sample sizes between 20 and 30 patients, had type I error of zzso and a power to detect Von zzso zzso effect of zzso When the amount of zzso was zzso the zzso zzso had a minimum of zzso greater power over the simple percentage zzso for the zzso success zzso Future investigations reporting the zzso should consider adopting the zzso zzso
