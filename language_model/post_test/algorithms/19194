The work zzso represents a novel approach for the modeling of zzso zzso zzso transport from the artery zzso into the zzso wall, taking into account the effects of local wall zzso stress zzso on the zzso cell layer and its pathways of volume and zzso zzso We have simulated LDL transport in an zzso representation of a zzso coronary artery, where the zzso is represented by a zzso model that takes into account the contributions of the zzso pathway, normal zzso and leaky junctions also employing the local zzso to yield the overall volume and zzso zzso The fraction of leaky junctions is calculated as a function of the local zzso based on published experimental data and is used in conjunction with the pore theory to determine the transport properties of this zzso We have found elevated levels of zzso flux at low zzso stress regions because of the presence of a larger number of leaky junctions compared with high zzso stress zzso zzso we were able to observe high LDL zzso in the zzso wall in these low zzso stress regions despite increased zzso zzso indicating that the increase in zzso zzso is not sufficient for the zzso removal of zzso
