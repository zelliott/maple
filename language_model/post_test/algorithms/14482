Independent component analysis zzso is a statistical technique that estimates a set of sources mixed by an unknown mixing zzso using only a set of zzso For this purpose, the only assumption is that the sources are statistically zzso In many applications, some information about the nature of the unknown signals is zzso In this paper we show a method for incorporating prior information about the mixing zzso to increase the levels of detection of responses to visual zzso zzso our method matches the performance of known zzso zzso for high zzso and can greatly improve the performance for low levels of zzso or low levels of zzso ratio zzso For the problem of signal zzso we have achieved detection for signals as small as zzso zzso zzso zzso in hybrid zzso data zzso In experiments using a functional zzso of the zzso measured changes in zzso in response to visual stimulus are in the order of zzso of the total zzso intensity value, which makes the functional signal difficult to detect by standard zzso The results of the analysis show that using zzso signal levels of zzso can be zzso The approach also zzso the standard zzso zzso which can be thought of as a special case of zzso when the confidence zzso or a tolerance value is zzso For in zzso animal experiments, we show that signal detection agreement over a range of confidence values parameters can be used to establish zzso changes in response to the visual zzso
