zzso of zzso measures have been zzso in visual attention zzso The linear parameters like power spectrum are the most commonly used features in the existing zzso In this paper, however, zzso parameters including approximate zzso sample zzso and zzso zzso were zzso All subjects were instructed to perform tasks with three different attention levels zzso attention, no attention and zzso in two zzso zzso features were extracted from the zzso zzso Then, statistical analyses and zzso with support zzso machine zzso were zzso A comparison between the zzso results based on the linear feature zzso and the sample zzso was performed for further zzso The results suggest that sample zzso stands out in the zzso parameters with the zzso of zzso and zzso in recognition of three levels of attention for the two experiments zzso And the further comparison shows that the sample zzso performs even better than the zzso power zzso It is suggested that zzso zzso parameters may be indispensable for a robust attention recognition zzso
