A clinically practical zzso has been developed for the treatment of liver cancer by the administration of zzso zzso zzso via the zzso zzso This zzso is based on the zzso zzso paradigm for zzso zzso A small zzso activity of zzso zzso is administered to the patient before the actual therapeutic zzso At approximately 3 hours after administration, the activities in the normal liver, liver tumors, zzso and total body are measured by gamma camera imaging using the zzso method, with zzso corrections for zzso zzso a zzso transmission zzso and scatter zzso the zzso zzso At the same time, peripheral blood samples are zzso and the activity zzso in whole blood are zzso The blood activity zzso are then converted to red zzso activity zzso and then total red zzso activity using zzso data from Standard Man zzso zzso Next, the zzso activities in the normal liver, liver tumors, zzso red zzso and total body are calculated using the measured activities in the respective source regions and conservatively assuming elimination of activity only by physical zzso in zzso The absorbed doses to the zzso normal zzso liver, zzso and red zzso are then calculated using the Medical Internal zzso zzso Committee zzso adjusting the pertinent S factors for differences in total body and organ masses between the patient and the zzso model and including the dose contribution from the liver zzso Finally, based on maximum tolerated absorbed doses of 3,000, zzso and 150 zzso zzso to liver, zzso and red zzso the respective absorbed doses per unit administered activity are used to calculate the therapy zzso Although not required for treatment planning, tumor absorbed dose may also be zzso This zzso has been automated using an Excel zzso Redmond, zzso zzso
