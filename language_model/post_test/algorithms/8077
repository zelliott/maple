A process map is a zzso showing the sequential steps and decisions used to accomplish a procedure from start to zzso zzso maps are a standard tool in continuous improvement zzso They have not been used routinely in clinical trials although they are well suited to display trial zzso 

We present the use of process maps as a tool to zzso and to monitor the correctness of trial work zzso We show that process maps can be used to assure that trial processes are conducted according to the zzso 

We describe how a process map is zzso We then derive process maps from two zzso the zzso and trial procedures as currently zzso We compare these maps to each other, using the zzso maps as the gold standard, to check that work is done according to the written zzso 

Eight process maps were produced from each zzso zzso differences were found between the zzso maps and the zzso zzso zzso included the addition of extra steps, order zzso step mistakes, and zzso 

These process maps focused only on clinic procedures, so interactions with other trial components were not zzso The maps were made after the trial started, which may have biased their content and zzso 

zzso maps are a simple tool to check if clinical trial processes are operating as designed and offer an effective means to identify and correct such zzso Further research should focus on using process maps in the design phase of trials, analyzing the cost to benefit ratio for process zzso and linking the analysis of the process map to monitor queries to zzso the improvement gained from using this zzso
