With the increasingly digital nature of biomedical data and as the complexity of analyses in medical research increases, the need for accurate information capture, zzso and accessibility has become crucial to medical researchers in the zzso of their research zzso zzso or zzso technologies, often based on so-called Service zzso zzso zzso are increasingly being seen as viable solutions for managing distributed data and zzso in the zzso zzso For zzso zzso especially those zzso on complex image analysis, zzso of processes and zzso is essential but up to now this has not been captured in a manner that zzso collaborative zzso 

Few examples exist, of deployed medical systems based on zzso that provide the zzso of research data needed to facilitate complex analyses and none have been evaluated in zzso Over the past decade, we have been working with zzso zzso and neuroscientists in three generations of projects to provide the data management and provenance services now required for 21st century medical zzso This paper outlines the finding of a requirements study and a resulting system architecture for the production of services to support zzso studies of zzso for Alzheimer's zzso 

The paper proposes a software infrastructure and services that provide the foundation for such zzso It introduces the use of the zzso software to provide provenance management as one of a number of services delivered on a zzso deployed to manage zzso projects that have been studying zzso for Alzheimer's zzso 

In the zzso and zzso projects a Provenance Service has been delivered that captures and reconstructs the zzso information needed to facilitate researchers in conducting zzso zzso The software enables neuroscientists to track the evolution of zzso and zzso It also tracks the outcomes of various analyses and provides provenance zzso throughout the zzso of their zzso As the Provenance Service has been designed to be generic it can be applied across the medical domain as a reusable tool for supporting medical researchers thus providing communities of researchers for the first time with the necessary tools to conduct widely distributed collaborative zzso of medical zzso
