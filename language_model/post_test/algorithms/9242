What we believe to be a novel zzso diffuse optical zzso scheme is developed to reconstruct images of both zzso and scattering zzso of finger joint zzso Compared with our previous reconstruction method, the improved zzso zzso employs both modified Newton methods and an enhanced initial value zzso scheme to recover the optical properties of highly zzso zzso The developed approach is tested using zzso zzso and in zzso measurement zzso The recovered results suggest that the improved approach is able to provide zzso better images than our previous zzso for optical zzso zzso
