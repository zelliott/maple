The aim of this study was to develop a zzso diagnosis zzso system in assessing the zzso zzso and texture features of zzso zzso 

The retrospective study involved 114 pathology proven cases including 73 benign and 41 zzso zzso zzso The tumor regions were delineated by an experienced zzso who was unknown to the zzso zzso Then, we applied 10 zzso features and 6 zzso zzso zzso texture features to analyze the tumor zzso To zzso the tumors as benign or zzso we used two methods, a linear zzso analysis with zzso feature selection and a zzso neural network with the zzso zzso as zzso The zzso performances are evaluated by the area zzso under the receiver operating zzso Furthermore, four zzso provided zzso grades for all tumors in the comparison of the zzso zzso 

In this analysis, the zzso system based on the combination of zzso and texture feature sets can give the optimal zzso result by zzso with an accuracy of zzso a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso a positive zzso value zzso of zzso negative zzso value zzso of zzso and zzso value of zzso and by the zzso perception with an accuracy of zzso a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso a positive zzso value of zzso negative zzso value of zzso and zzso value of zzso The zzso values of the four zzso were ranged between zzso and zzso and the optimal zzso results were shown the highest zzso values than the four zzso zzso 

This study has shown that performing the zzso system with both zzso and texture features on zzso can successfully distinguish between benign and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, it can also provide a second opinion for the tumor diagnosis and avert unnecessary zzso
