We perform theoretical studies of stretching of 20 proteins with knots within a zzso zzso The zzso ends are found to jump to well defined sequential locations that are associated with sharp turns, whereas in zzso they diffuse around and eventually slide zzso The waiting times of the jumps are increasingly zzso as the temperature is zzso zzso typically do not return to their native locations when a protein is released after zzso
