zzso analysis of heart rate zzso zzso is an accepted method for assessment of cardiac zzso function and its relationship to numerous disorders and zzso Various zzso methods for zzso zzso have been developed and extensive literature on their respective properties is zzso The zzso zzso time series can be seen as a series of zzso spaced zzso To zzso the power zzso of this series using the discrete zzso transform zzso we need to zzso the series for obtaining zzso spaced zzso The selection of sampling period plays a critical role in obtaining the power zzso in terms of zzso efficiency and zzso In this paper, we shall zzso the zzso zzso time series from selected subjects for different sampling zzso to compare the error introduced in selected zzso measures of zzso at a constant frequency resolution for a specific duration of zzso zzso zzso It should be pointed out that, although many other error causes are possible in the zzso measures, our attention will be confined only to the performance comparison due to the different sampling zzso While the choice of zzso zzso sampling frequency zzso is arbitrary, the sampling rate of zzso zzso series must be selected with due consideration to mean and minimum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was proposed for a majority of zzso This is an appropriate sampling rate for the study of zzso regulation, since it enables us to zzso reliable spectral estimates between zzso and 1 zzso which represents the frequency band within which the zzso nervous system has significant zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso intervals are evenly spaced in time and are synchronized with the samples of the other zzso signals, enabling zzso estimates with these zzso
