In this paper, we apply some effective methods, including the zzso margin zzso describing function and zzso plane, to predict the limit cycles of dynamic fuzzy control systems with adjustable zzso Both zzso and zzso fuzzy control systems are zzso In general, fuzzy control systems are zzso By use of the classical method of describing functions, the dynamic fuzzy controller may be zzso zzso According to the stability equations and zzso plane methods, the stability of the equivalent zzso system with adjustable parameters is then zzso In addition, a simple approach is also proposed to determine the gain margin and phase margin which limit cycles can occur for zzso Two examples of zzso fuzzy control systems with and without zzso are presented to demonstrate the design zzso Finally, this approach is also extended to a zzso fuzzy control zzso
