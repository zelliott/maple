zzso accurately determines the zzso mass and charge state of parent zzso from high-resolution tandem mass zzso data, offering significant improvement for zzso and zzso instruments over the commercially delivered zzso Fisher zzso zzso zzso zzso parent zzso mass tolerance values can be determined using accurate mass information, thus improving zzso identifications for zzso measurement accuracy zzso For zzso data from zzso and zzso instruments, zzso incorporates a zzso charge detection zzso that identifies the most likely charge of a parent species through peak characteristics of its fragmentation zzso
