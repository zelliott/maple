zzso membrane proteins based on their functions is an important task in zzso zzso In this work, we have analyzed the characteristic features of zzso acid zzso in membrane proteins that perform major functions, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and primary active zzso 

We observed that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are dominant in zzso whereas the composition of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Val is high in zzso zzso zzso The composition of all the zzso acids in primary active zzso lies in between other two classes of zzso We have zzso different machine learning zzso such as, zzso rule, zzso function, zzso network, Support zzso machine, zzso tree zzso for discriminating these classes of zzso We observed that most of the zzso have zzso them with similar zzso The neural network method zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and active zzso with the zzso cross validation accuracy of zzso in a data set of zzso membrane zzso The application of zzso acid occurrence improved the overall accuracy to zzso In addition, we have zzso zzso from other zzso and zzso membrane proteins with the accuracy of zzso using zzso neighbor zzso The zzso of zzso and all other proteins zzso and zzso showed the accuracy of zzso 

The performance of discrimination with zzso acid occurrence is better than that with zzso acid zzso We suggest that this method could be effectively used to discriminate zzso from all other zzso and membrane zzso and zzso them into zzso zzso and active zzso
