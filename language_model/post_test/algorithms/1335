We propose the boundary shift integral zzso as a measure of cerebral volume changes derived from registered repeat three-dimensional zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso determines the total volume through which the boundaries of a given cerebral structure have moved and, zzso the volume change, directly from zzso zzso We found brain and zzso zzso correlated tightly zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso with simulated volumes of zzso zzso to 21 control scan pairs and 11 scan pairs from Alzheimer's disease zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso yielded mean brain volume loss of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the control group was tightly bunched zzso zzso zzso zzso and there was wide group zzso the group means differing by zzso control group standard zzso zzso A measure based on the same zzso used by the zzso yielded similar group means, but wide spread in the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso and group zzso the group means differing by zzso control group zzso The zzso yielded mean zzso volume losses of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Good linear correlation zzso zzso zzso was obtained between the zzso zzso and the difference in their segmented zzso We conclude the zzso is an accurate and robust measure of regional and global cerebral volume zzso
