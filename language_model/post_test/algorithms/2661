zzso is the representation of digital pictures using a given set of available color zzso which are also known as tones or zzso zzso It can be viewed as the zzso of zzso where only two such zzso levels are zzso Its main application is for printing and, similar to zzso can be applied to both colored and zzso zzso In this paper, we present a method to produce zzso based on the zzso error diffusion zzso Key characteristics of this technique are: 1) the use of an image zzso 2) the zzso order of the zzso being determined through zzso intensity zzso on the image zzso and 3) zzso error zzso Special care has been given to the problem of zzso which is one of the inherent limitations in error diffusion when applied to zzso zzso is evident in areas of the image with values close to one of the available zzso zzso our approach is to apply a zzso step to alleviate part of the zzso Our results are evaluated both in terms of visual appearance and using a set of standard zzso with the latter demonstrating the zzso characteristics and very low zzso of the proposed zzso
