This paper addresses the problem of zzso zzso point set zzso The shape context zzso feature zzso is used because of its strong zzso nature, whereas edges in the zzso constructed by point sets are used to determine the zzso of zzso Similar to lengths or directions, oriented zzso constructed this way can be regarded as attributes of zzso By matching edges between two point sets, rotation zzso is zzso Two novel ways of constructing zzso on a model point set are proposed, aiming at making the zzso of zzso as robust to disturbances as zzso The structures of these zzso facilitate the use of dynamic programming zzso for zzso The strong zzso nature of zzso the special structure of the model zzso and the global zzso of zzso make our methods robust to various types of zzso particularly zzso The extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data validated the zzso of the proposed methods to various types of zzso They can robustly detect the desired shapes in complex and highly cluttered zzso
