We study the zzso approach to zzso zzso which calls for finding a set of zzso of minimum zzso that explains an input set of zzso We prove that the problem is zzso even in very restricted zzso On the positive side, we identify islands of zzso for the problem, by focusing on instances with specific structure of zzso sharing among the input zzso We exploit the structure of those instance to give zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso We also show that the general zzso zzso problem is fixed zzso zzso
