An algorithm, which includes contact interactions within a joint, has been developed to estimate the dominant loading patterns in zzso based on the density distribution of zzso The zzso is applied to the zzso zzso of a zzso gorilla and zzso bear and is compared to the results obtained in a companion paper that uses a zzso zzso version of the zzso load zzso zzso zzso from the contact zzso are consistent with those from the linear zzso While the contact zzso is substantially more complex than the linear method, it has some added zzso First, since contact between the two interacting surfaces is incorporated into the load zzso method, the pressure zzso selected by the method are more likely indicative of those found in zzso Thus, the pressure zzso predicted by the zzso are more consistent with the in zzso loads that were responsible for producing the given distribution of bone zzso Additionally, the relative positions of the interacting bones are known for each pressure distribution selected by the zzso This should allow the pressure zzso to be related to specific types of zzso The ultimate goal is to develop a technique that can predict dominant joint loading patterns and relate these loading patterns to specific types of locomotion and/or zzso
