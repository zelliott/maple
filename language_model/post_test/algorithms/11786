We describe the development, zzso and use of a highly redundant zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso probe sets representing zzso known genes expressed in muscle and zzso zzso clusters from a zzso zzso muscle zzso sequencing project zzso zzso zzso This set included zzso novel zzso clusters showing no match to previously characterized proteins in any zzso Each probe set was designed to contain zzso 25 zzso zzso zzso paired perfect match and mismatch probe pairs per zzso with each probe evaluated for zzso zzso zzso and similarity to other zzso The zzso zzso were zzso by zzso and zzso chemistry on each zzso 

zzso of human muscle zzso to this zzso zzso zzso showed a correlation of zzso between the number of zzso zzso in each cluster and zzso zzso Out of zzso novel zzso clusters not showing any similarity to previously characterized zzso we focused on 250 zzso clusters that were represented by robust probe sets on the zzso fulfilling all stringent zzso 102 zzso were found to be consistently zzso by analysis of zzso to human muscle zzso of which 40 zzso zzso could be zzso anchored to potential zzso units in the human zzso zzso 19 zzso of the 40 zzso were zzso zzso as zzso by one or more than three gene identification zzso 

Our analysis found 40 zzso zzso zzso novel zzso clusters to be expressed in human zzso As most of these zzso were low copy clusters zzso and zzso in the original 28,000 zzso project, the identification of these as significantly expressed is a robust validation of the transcript units that permits subsequent focus on the novel proteins zzso by these zzso
