Use of improved methods of genetic evaluation and intense selection lead to higher rates of genetic change but also lead to higher rates of zzso A number of methods have been proposed to attain high rates of genetic response with moderate or low zzso zzso restrict the number of close relatives selected, use false high zzso in the genetic zzso use zzso zzso adjust estimated breeding values for the relationship with those already selected, avoid zzso of related individuals, and increase the number of parents zzso These various methods were compared here using zzso simulation of an zzso genetic zzso The results were studied zzso plotting response against zzso so allowing comparison of the methods at each of a range of zzso zzso None of the methods was best over all zzso At high rates of zzso and with a fixed number of zzso several of the methods gave large decreases in zzso for small losses in zzso However, these were matched by simply increasing the number of zzso zzso There is an optimum zzso zzso attained by several methods, and this front seems hard to zzso zzso of the front would be useful in designing selection zzso
