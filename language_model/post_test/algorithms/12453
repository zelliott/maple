The ability to zzso and zzso block zzso in peripheral nerves would have several clinical zzso As an initial step in this direction, we investigated the possibility of zzso generating and zzso blocking activity in zzso peripheral nerve fibers in zzso zzso action zzso at each end of individual zzso zzso nerves were recorded in response to currents induced at the zzso of the nerve with an zzso placed magnetic zzso Current in the zzso was then reversed and the recordings zzso In all cases, the area under the compound action potential on the virtual zzso side of the magnetic stimulus was reduced zzso of zzso zzso zzso in comparison to the area on the virtual zzso zzso This indicates that peripheral nerve activity can be zzso induced by magnetic zzso Extension of this effect to the point of generating zzso action zzso in zzso may prove clinically useful in a number of zzso such as reducing zzso secondary to zzso and generating zzso induced zzso in zzso Further investigations of this effect seem zzso
