zzso X-ray zzso most popular method for determining protein zzso a zzso process requiring a great deal of manual zzso effort to interpret low-quality protein zzso zzso this process is critical in creating a zzso zzso determination zzso Previously, our group developed zzso a zzso framework for producing zzso models from zzso maps produced via X-ray zzso zzso uses a zzso Random Field to model the three-dimensional zzso location of each zzso atom in a zzso zzso the best structure in this model is intractable, so zzso uses approximate zzso methods to estimate the optimal zzso While previous results have shown zzso to be the state-of-the-art method on this task, its approximate zzso zzso remains zzso expensive and susceptible to zzso In this work, we develop zzso zzso in zzso zzso a framework for leveraging zzso independent runs of approximate zzso to produce estimates of protein zzso Our results show statistically significant improvements in the accuracy of zzso resulting in more complete and accurate protein zzso In addition, zzso provides a general framework for advanced approximate zzso methods in complex problem zzso
