Many different zzso zzso techniques are used zzso One approach is to first determine the zzso with a common zzso method and then calculate the branch lengths of the zzso If the resulting tree is not optimal exchanging tree branches can make some local changes in the tree zzso The whole process can be zzso until a satisfactory result has been zzso The efficiency of this method fully depends on the initially generated zzso Although local changes are made, the optimal tree will never be found if the initial tree is poorly zzso In this article, genetic zzso are applied such that the optimal tree can be found even with a bad initial tree zzso This tree generating method is tested by comparing its results with the results of the zzso program in the zzso software zzso Two simulated data sets and a real data set are zzso
