A new method for zzso the zzso parameters of zzso zzso and zzso for use in zzso modeling of zzso zzso has been zzso The method is an alternative to the traditional zzso zzso required to fit a zzso zzso model to retention zzso zzso a zzso zzso technique is used to estimate the parameters from a series of zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso With this method, the time required to obtain estimates of zzso parameters a series of zzso is significantly zzso This new method allows for precise predictions of retention time with the average error being only zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso were also in agreement with experimental zzso having an average relative error of zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso
