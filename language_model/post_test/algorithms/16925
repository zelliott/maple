The detection of change in magnitude of directional zzso between two zzso time series is a common subject of interest in the biomedical domain, including studies involving the respiratory zzso zzso Although transfer zzso is a useful tool in this zzso no study to date has investigated how different transfer zzso zzso methods perform in typical biomedical applications featuring small sample size and presence of zzso 

With respect to detection of increased zzso strength, we compared three transfer zzso zzso techniques using both simulated time series and respiratory recordings from zzso The following zzso methods were zzso zzso with ranking, kernel density zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso extended to three zzso In the simulated experiment, sample size was varied from 50 to zzso while zzso strength was zzso In order to introduce zzso the zzso zzso distribution was zzso In the lamb experiment, the objective was to detect increased zzso zzso to zzso and CO2 induced by a drug, zzso Specifically, the separate influence of zzso zzso and zzso on minute ventilation zzso before and after administration of zzso was zzso 

In the zzso zzso detected increased zzso strength at the lowest zzso among the three zzso In the lamb experiment, zzso zzso resulted in the statistically strongest increase in transfer zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso was the only method that could detect an increase in transfer zzso for zzso zzso zzso in agreement with experimental zzso 

Transfer zzso is capable of detecting directional zzso changes in zzso biomedical time series analysis featuring a small number of observations and presence of zzso The results of this study suggest that zzso even with ranking, is too zzso and although there is no clear winner between zzso and zzso zzso the reader should note that zzso requires more zzso time and extensive zzso selection than zzso zzso We hope this study provides a zzso for selection of an appropriate transfer zzso zzso zzso
