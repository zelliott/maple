Single zzso zzso zzso are the most abundant type of genetic variation in zzso zzso and have recently become the marker of choice in a wide variety of ecological and evolutionary zzso The advent of next-generation sequencing zzso technologies has made it possible to efficiently zzso a large number of zzso in the zzso organisms with no or limited zzso zzso Most zzso zzso methods require a reference zzso to perform accurate zzso zzso Little effort, however, has yet been devoted to developing or improving zzso for accurate zzso calling in the absence of a reference zzso 

Here we describe an improved maximum likelihood zzso zzso called zzso which can achieve high zzso accuracy for zzso calling in the zzso organisms without a reference zzso The zzso zzso incorporates the mixed zzso model to detect composite read clusters and can efficiently prevent incorrect zzso calls resulting from repetitive zzso zzso Through analysis of simulation and real sequencing zzso we demonstrate that in comparison with zzso or a threshold approach, zzso can remarkably improve the accuracy of de zzso zzso zzso and is especially powerful for the zzso zzso in zzso zzso with high repeat zzso 

The zzso zzso can efficiently prevent incorrect zzso calls resulting from repetitive zzso regions, and thus zzso the original zzso zzso by achieving much higher zzso zzso Our zzso is therefore very useful for accurate de zzso zzso zzso in the zzso organisms without a reference zzso
