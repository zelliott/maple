zzso Here we study the zzso in zzso records of action zzso Our work is motivated, in part, by the need to construct effective zzso to zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso We used zzso zzso pairs zzso to record from primary zzso zzso of awake, behaving zzso Our data consist of continuous records of zzso activity and segmented records of zzso zzso zzso and principal component techniques are used to analyze mean zzso zzso the zzso between different instances of a zzso zzso and the underlying background zzso zzso The spectrum of the zzso between different instances of a zzso zzso is not white, and falls off above 1 zzso with a frequency dependence of roughly zzso This spectrum is different from that of the mean spike zzso which falls off roughly as zzso but is essentially identical with the spectrum of background zzso The spatial zzso of the zzso on the zzso scale also falls off at high zzso zzso The zzso between different instances of a zzso zzso is dominated by a relatively small number of principal zzso As a consequence, there is a large zzso in the cluster of the spike zzso zzso The background noise cannot be represented as a stationary zzso random zzso In particular, we observed that the spectrum changes significantly between successive zzso zzso Furthermore, the total power in the background activity exhibits larger fluctuations than is consistent with a stationary zzso random zzso zzso Roughly half of the zzso spike zzso exhibit systematic changes as a function of the zzso zzso Although this results in a zzso distribution in the space of zzso the distribution can be modeled by a zzso function of the zzso zzso zzso We use a set of 44 mean zzso zzso to define the space of differences between spike zzso This zzso together with that of the background activity, is used to construct a filter that zzso the detection of differences between zzso zzso Further, an information zzso measure is defined that characterizes the zzso
