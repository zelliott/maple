We reveal unexpected origins of age induced departure from zzso zzso zzso in healthy human heart zzso zzso to the widely established view, we provide evidence that age induced zzso imbalance in the zzso control is not due to the emergent functional dominance of the sympathetic nervous system zzso but due to emerging (age zzso relative dynamic dominance of the zzso nervous system zzso In particular, we demonstrate that the age induced zzso of healthy heart rate dynamics zzso resemble those in so-called primary zzso failure with zzso zzso dysfunction and in other neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease even without known zzso zzso Based upon this, we propose a novel picture of zzso zzso characterized by an zzso of the zzso function to cope zzso with various environmental zzso
