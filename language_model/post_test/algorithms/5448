Database searching is the most frequently used approach for automated zzso assignment and protein zzso of tandem mass zzso The results, however, depend on the sequences in target databases and on search zzso Recently by using an alternative zzso database, we identified more proteins than with the zzso proteins in zzso zzso In this study, we aimed at finding a greater number of eligible zzso zzso based on newly available transcript sequences and the latest zzso zzso The improved database was then used to compare four search zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

The updated alternative zzso database predicted zzso putative protein zzso zzso more than the previous zzso There was transcript evidence for 50% of the updated genes compared to the previous zzso zzso Database searches were conducted using the same set of spectral data, search zzso and protein database but with different zzso The false discovery rates of the zzso matches were estimated zzso zzso The numbers of the total identified proteins varied from zzso to zzso between zzso Whereas zzso zzso of zzso assignments were zzso the comparison showed that 51% zzso of the zzso proteins and zzso zzso of the putative zzso zzso were zzso by all zzso 12 plausible zzso were discovered by focusing on the consensus peptides which were detected by at least three different zzso The analysis found different zzso zzso in two putative zzso of zzso zzso 

We were able to detect dozens of new peptides using the improved alternative zzso database with the recently updated zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Unlike the identifications of the peptides and the zzso zzso large variations existed between the putative zzso zzso identified by different zzso 12 candidates of putative zzso were reported based on the consensus zzso zzso This suggests that applications of multiple search engines effectively reduced the possible false positive results and validated the protein identifications from tandem mass zzso using an alternative zzso zzso
