It has long been known that small regions of proteins tend to fold independently and are then stabilized by interactions between these distinct zzso or zzso Such units, also known as autonomous folding units zzso zzso play a key role in protein zzso A knowledge of such early folding units has diverse applications in protein engineering as well as in developing an understanding of the protein folding zzso Such zzso can also be used as model systems in order to study the structural organization of zzso 

In an earlier work, we had zzso a global network zzso zzso to identify zzso in zzso We had shown that these zzso correlate well with zzso In this work, we have developed a zzso zzso to identify early folding units or zzso in networks using the zzso described zzso The zzso has three zzso zzso It is able to display information on the zzso of a database of zzso proteins used in the original work, zzso It can take as input an uploaded zzso file, identify the zzso using the zzso zzso and zzso the results back to the user and zzso It can take as input an uploaded zzso file and a results file zzso from functionality zzso and display the results using the embedded zzso The results include the module decomposition of the zzso plots of cartoon representations of the protein colored by module identity and connectivity as well as zzso plots of the zzso and relative accessible surface area zzso zzso 

We believe that the zzso server, will be a useful tool for scientists interested in the phenomena of protein folding as well as in protein zzso Our tool not only provides a knowledge of the zzso through a natural graph zzso approach but is also able to identify zzso that are critical during zzso It is our intention to use this tool to study the zzso zzso of protein folding by analyzing the zzso changes in proteins over the zzso zzso
