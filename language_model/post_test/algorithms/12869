In this letter, a novel zzso neural network based on the zzso method is proposed for solving linear programming zzso zzso convergence of the proposed neural network is proved by using the zzso zzso Compared with the existing neural networks for linear programming, the proposed neural network is globally zzso to exact optimal solutions in finite time, which is remarkable and rare in the literature of neural networks for zzso Some zzso examples are given to show the effectiveness and excellent performance of the new zzso neural zzso
