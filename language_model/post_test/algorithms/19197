Separate multivariable risk zzso are commonly used to assess risk of specific zzso cardiovascular disease zzso events, zzso coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, and heart zzso The present report presents a single multivariable risk function that predicts risk of developing all zzso and of its zzso 

We used Cox zzso zzso to evaluate the risk of developing a first zzso event in zzso zzso study participants zzso age, 49 years; zzso zzso who attended a routine examination between 30 and 74 years of age and were free of zzso zzso multivariable risk functions zzso zzso zzso were derived that incorporated age, total and zzso zzso cholesterol, zzso blood pressure, treatment for hypertension, smoking, and diabetes zzso We assessed the performance of the general zzso zzso for predicting individual zzso events zzso heart disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, or heart zzso Over 12 years of zzso zzso participants zzso zzso developed a first zzso zzso All traditional risk factors evaluated predicted zzso risk zzso zzso The general zzso zzso demonstrated good discrimination zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso adjustments to the general zzso risk zzso allowed zzso of the risks of each zzso zzso Two simple risk scores are zzso 1 based on all traditional risk factors and the other based on zzso zzso 

A zzso multivariable risk factor zzso can be zzso used to assess general zzso risk and risk of individual zzso events zzso zzso and peripheral zzso disease and heart zzso The estimated absolute zzso event rates can be used to zzso risk and to guide preventive zzso
