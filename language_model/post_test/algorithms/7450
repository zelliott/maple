This paper proposes a zzso method for detecting zzso zzso cell zzso which is essential for zzso monitoring of cell zzso Our method targets zzso cells, which float or are suspended freely in the culture zzso contrast to adherent cells, which are attached to a zzso zzso The method first detects cell regions and tracks them over time, resulting in the construction of cell zzso For each of the zzso visual properties of the cell are then examined to know whether and when the zzso shows a transition from a live cell to a dead cell, in order to determine the occurrence and timing of a cell death zzso For the zzso a zzso learning framework is adopted to zzso zzso data in addition to labeled zzso Our method achieved promising performance in the experiments with zzso stem cell zzso zzso which are currently in clinical use for rescuing zzso function during bone zzso zzso
