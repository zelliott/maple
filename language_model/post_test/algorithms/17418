zzso was induced in the barrel zzso of adolescent rats by zzso every second zzso on the zzso zzso zzso This produced a zzso pattern of barrels in the zzso where each barrel receiving its principal input from a spared zzso was surrounded by barrels for which the principal zzso had been deprived and conversely, each barrel receiving its principal input from a deprived zzso was surrounded by barrels for which the principal zzso had been zzso After 7 days' zzso responses to the zzso zzso were depressed in layers zzso zzso of control zzso and IV zzso Depression was far greater than that seen with zzso zzso zzso suggesting that activity in the spared zzso zzso the depression of the deprived zzso Depression was not due to zzso changes as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso responses to deprived zzso were zzso The short zzso responses in layer IV zzso zzso were unaffected by zzso but the number of cells responding at intermediate zzso zzso zzso was markedly reduced (to zzso of zzso zzso of the spared zzso response was substantial in the near side of the zzso barrel zzso increase in layers zzso zzso in layer zzso but had not spread to the far side after 7 days' zzso zzso multiple zzso may increase the rate of zzso since 7 days is insufficient time for zzso in single zzso spared zzso zzso was not due to zzso changes as zzso zzso responses to the spared zzso were zzso However, in the spared barrel the response zzso decreased by 1-2 zzso Only the cells responding at short zzso exhibited zzso responses zzso zzso suggesting that some zzso plasticity is still possible at zzso These results show that zzso pattern deprivation is capable of inducing substantial plasticity over a wide area of barrel zzso All the major forms of plasticity seen with other zzso deprivation patterns were present, although no other single deprivation pattern studied so far causes the complete repertoire seen with zzso zzso
