The zzso zzso zzso contribute to the zzso of cognitive zzso However, the relationship between cognitive effects of zzso antagonism and zzso transmission is not described in healthy zzso We therefore tested effects of acute zzso (5 zzso over 3 zzso on continuous performance task zzso performance and zzso zzso PET zzso Nine physically and mentally healthy male men performed two zzso scans including zzso plasma zzso Over 3 days before the second zzso all subjects were treated with 5 zzso zzso zzso Using our novel zzso analysis, we calculated the intrinsic rate of the cerebral zzso zzso zzso the turnover of zzso formed in brain zzso and the storage for zzso and its brain zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso and zzso was performed before every PET zzso We found that zzso zzso in those normal subjects with relatively high baseline K showed a more pronounced sensitivity to zzso treatment, zzso in reduced storage capacity and elevated turnover of zzso whereas subjects with lower K showed the opposite pattern of zzso Furthermore, low baseline K predicted improvements in the zzso task after haloperidol, whereas participants with higher baseline K showed a decline in cognitive zzso We conclude that the initial increase of zzso turnover after acute zzso challenge is associated with an zzso in individuals with initially more zzso responsive zzso systems, but zzso cognitive performance in those with lower normal zzso zzso at zzso We zzso that these effects may be driven by zzso zzso transmission during zzso zzso
