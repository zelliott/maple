The cellular reaction to wear debris may result in the failure of an artificial zzso fixation to the zzso The influence of debris zzso on cell activity has received little zzso This study seeks to establish whether different zzso culture environments may invoke zzso cellular responses to debris zzso Consideration of the zzso potential of a low density zzso particle group and an ex zzso zzso molecular weight zzso particle group revealed that the nature of the protein zzso is related to the concentration of the proteins in zzso Furthermore, the composition of the zzso layer was shown to vary with the zzso of proteins in zzso In standard cell culture conditions zzso potential approached zero, indicating the high probability of particle zzso Cell challenge studies with zzso zzso showed that zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso increased cell zzso while bovine zzso showed little change over control zzso No changes in behavior of zzso cells were observed in similar zzso
