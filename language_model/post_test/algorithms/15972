The spectral sensitivities of middle- zzso and long- zzso zzso cones have been measured in zzso of known zzso zzso sensitivities in nine zzso and zzso sensitivities in 20 zzso We have used these zzso cone spectral sensitivities, along with new luminous efficiency zzso and existing spectral sensitivity and color matching data from normal zzso to derive estimates of the human zzso and zzso spectral sensitivities for 2 and 10 degrees zzso central targets, and an estimate of the zzso zzso function zzso for 2 degrees zzso targets, which we refer to as zzso These new estimates are consistent with zzso and zzso spectral sensitivities and color zzso
