Large zzso of zzso acquired DNA that contain functionally related genes with limited zzso distribution are often referred to as zzso islands zzso and structural definitions of these islands, based on common features, have been zzso Although a large number of mobile elements fall well within the zzso definition, there are several concerns about the structural consensus for zzso The current zzso definition was put forward 10 zzso ago when only 12 complete bacterial zzso were available, a large number of zzso zzso from that definition, and in zzso predictions assuming a zzso zzso structural model bias the sampling of the zzso structural space toward zzso zzso In this study, the structural features of zzso regions are sampled by a zzso bottom-up search, and these are exploited in a machine learning approach with the aim of explicitly zzso and modeling the contribution of each feature to the zzso zzso Performing a zzso comparative analysis between 37 strains of three different zzso and 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso regions were sampled and used to train structural zzso zzso The data show that, overall, zzso from the three different zzso fall into zzso zzso structural zzso However, decreasing the zzso resolution, by studying zzso structures across different zzso zzso provides models that zzso on a fairly similar zzso structure, further suggesting that zzso can be seen as a zzso of mobile zzso with core and variable structural features, rather than a zzso zzso
