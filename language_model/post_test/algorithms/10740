zzso is an underlying zzso to control drug zzso For highly zzso drugs, the high correlation between their zzso and fraction absorbed in humans is zzso In the present study, to predict the zzso of poorly zzso drugs in humans, a new experimental method of the zzso study was proposed and subjected to zzso zzso using the in zzso chamber method modified to contain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in both compartments of the chamber zzso the effect of zzso on membrane integrity was zzso zzso the correlation between the apparent zzso zzso zzso obtained through zzso or zzso and zzso absorbed in humans were investigated using 7 poorly zzso zzso zzso integrity of the rat zzso zzso was maintained after using zzso as with that after using the conventional in zzso chamber zzso zzso of two zzso markers obtained through zzso was not different from that obtained through the conventional chamber zzso In the zzso study of the zzso zzso zzso from both zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso sides obtained through zzso was not significantly different from that obtained through the conventional chamber zzso The correlation between zzso obtained through zzso and zzso which was expressed by the equation of zzso zzso zzso was more favorable than the correlation between zzso obtained through zzso and zzso which was expressed by the equation of zzso zzso zzso These results showed that zzso was a useful method for predicting the zzso of poorly zzso zzso
