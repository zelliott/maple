The identification of zzso genes involved in virus entry and replication is important for understanding viral zzso Our goal is to develop a zzso screening system using cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso A central issue is efficient, zzso and automated zzso analysis of massive image zzso We have developed an image analysis approach that comprises zzso a novel, zzso zzso scheme for cell zzso zzso which does not require subsequent zzso steps for separation of clustered zzso zzso zzso of the virus signal in the neighborhood of cell zzso zzso zzso of regions with zzso cells by combining zzso circle fitting and grid fitting, zzso cell zzso as infected or zzso and zzso image quality control zzso identification of zzso zzso We compared the results of our nucleus zzso approach with a previously developed scheme of zzso zzso with subsequent separation of nuclear zzso Our approach, which does not require a zzso step for the separation of nuclear zzso correctly segmented zzso of the zzso whereas the previous scheme achieved zzso Using our zzso for the detection of zzso images, we obtained a high discrimination power of zzso Our overall approach has been applied to more than 55,000 images of cells infected by either zzso C or dengue zzso zzso infection rates were correctly detected in positive zzso controls, as well as for zzso zzso for example, cellular genes involved in viral zzso Our image analysis approach allows for the automatic and accurate determination of changes in viral infection based on zzso zzso zzso cell array imaging zzso
