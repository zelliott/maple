zzso receptive field phenomena in zzso are commonly attributed to long-range lateral connections and/or zzso zzso We address 2 such zzso surround suppression and receptive field expansion at low zzso We present rigorous zzso support for the hypothesis that the phenomena largely result from local short-range zzso zzso zzso cortical connections and lateral zzso nucleus zzso The neural mechanisms of surround suppression in our simulations operate via zzso enhancement of zzso zzso reduction of zzso or zzso action of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso are substantially more prevalent than zzso We observe, on average, a growth in the spatial zzso extent of zzso and zzso synaptic zzso for zzso zzso However, we find this is neither sufficient nor necessary to explain receptive field expansion at low contrast, which usually involves additional changes in the relative gain of these zzso
