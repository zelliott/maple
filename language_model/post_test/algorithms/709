It has long been argued that zzso that find correlated zzso in multiple sequence alignments can be used to find structurally or functionally important zzso in zzso We examined the properties of four different methods for detecting these correlated zzso On both simple, artificial alignments and real alignments from the zzso database, we found a surprising lack of agreement between the four correlated zzso zzso We argue that these differences are caused in part by differing sensitivities to background zzso zzso zzso zzso can be envisioned as zzso of background conservation with each zzso searching for correlated zzso that occur at a different background conservation zzso
