The biological relevance of principal component analysis zzso learning zzso is addressed zzso zzso describing a plausible biological mechanism which accounts for the changes in synaptic efficacy implicit in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso neural zzso 1, 61 zzso and zzso establishing a potential role for zzso mechanisms in the development of functional zzso zzso learning zzso comprise an zzso zzso term and a zzso term which interact to find the principal patterns of correlations in the zzso shared by a group of zzso We propose that the zzso component of this zzso could be regulated by retrograde signals that are zzso from the terminal zzso of zzso zzso to their cell zzso This proposal is based on reported studies of structural plasticity in the nervous zzso By using simulations we demonstrate that zzso mechanisms can eliminate zzso connections whose signals are unrelated to the prevalent pattern of zzso zzso This elimination may be instrumental in refining zzso zzso connections that zzso functional zzso
