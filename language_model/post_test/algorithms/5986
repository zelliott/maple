We discuss an important property called the zzso zzso property on empirical sequences in reinforcement zzso This states that the typical set of empirical sequences has probability nearly one, that all elements in the typical set are nearly zzso and that the number of elements in the typical set is an exponential function of the sum of conditional zzso if the number of time steps is sufficiently zzso The sum is referred to as zzso zzso Using the property we zzso the fact that the return zzso depends on two factors, the zzso complexity and a quantity depending on the parameters of zzso Here, the return zzso means that the best sequences in terms of expected return have probability zzso We also examine the sensitivity of zzso complexity, which is a qualitative guide in tuning the parameters of zzso strategy, and show a sufficient condition for return zzso in zzso
