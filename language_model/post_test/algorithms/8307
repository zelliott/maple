The zzso zzso zzso was devised to identify protein sequences which, when coiled as alpha or zzso zzso had one zzso zzso strip and otherwise zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso also ranked such sequences according to an index, the mean zzso of zzso acids in the zzso zzso This zzso well predicted T zzso fragments of zzso zzso A zzso of this zzso (the structural zzso zzso zzso was tested for the prediction of zzso in zzso defined zzso For the zzso eight zzso acid zzso 2 cycles plus one zzso acid in an alpha zzso with zzso zzso zzso greater than zzso were selected with overlapping segments zzso These selections were terminated according to simple zzso zzso which took into account the roles of zzso zzso or Pro and zzso zzso in the stability of zzso In analyses of 35 zzso defined proteins with known alpha and zzso zzso the predictions with the zzso overlapped zzso overlap zzso zzso greater than or equal to zzso with zzso of known zzso touched zzso overlap zzso zzso greater than zzso greater than zzso or overlapped with zzso of known zzso or were neighboring zzso within 6 zzso or touched or overlapped with zzso of known zzso At each level of judging the quality of zzso the zzso was usually less sensitive zzso zzso number of known zzso and more efficient zzso zzso number of zzso than the zzso and zzso zzso It was simpler in design and zzso The chemical mechanisms underlying these zzso appear to apply both to protein folding and to selection of T zzso zzso zzso
