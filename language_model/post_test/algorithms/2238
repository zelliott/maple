We describe a method to obtain results for immune status monitoring that uses a zzso panel, comprised of zzso control and 2 specific zzso tests zzso and zzso in conjunction with a flow zzso that directly measures absolute zzso zzso software is used for zzso gating of zzso zzso to determine zzso and zzso subset zzso The zzso function of this software is shown to yield equivalent results to manual analysis by an expert user, and to be effective when as few as 25 target cells are zzso The software is also shown to perform automatic quality control checks of the sample preparation, zzso and automated zzso We demonstrate that the sum of T zzso B zzso and natural killer zzso zzso + zzso cells, as a determination of all zzso zzso well with zzso measured using a light scatter zzso Moreover, T + B + zzso zzso count is shown to be less zzso than zzso count from light scatter zzso and to minimize errors that arise from zzso variation in sample zzso Our data suggest that the new approach that we describe could offer an alternative to the traditional zzso methods for measuring absolute counts of zzso zzso for immune status zzso As such this method could zzso through objective automated analysis, testing cost and complexity, without sacrificing the quality of zzso
