To estimate the prenatal screening performance of an integrated serum test for detecting zzso 18, which combines zzso of zzso and zzso markers with maternal age to assign zzso zzso 

Published and new observations of maternal serum marker levels in zzso 18 and unaffected zzso are used to derive population zzso These parameters are then combined in a zzso zzso model to assign zzso risks for zzso zzso 

The best combination of serum markers includes zzso plasma zzso in the first zzso and zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso in the second zzso At a zzso risk zzso of 1 : 100, these 4 zzso in combination with maternal age, detect zzso of zzso 18 zzso at a zzso rate of zzso The odds of a zzso 18 pregnancy among zzso women are 1 : zzso Without the zzso marker, detection is reduced to zzso at about the same zzso zzso 

The zzso described here is highly efficient for detecting zzso 18 and should be considered by programs that offer zzso screening for Down zzso
