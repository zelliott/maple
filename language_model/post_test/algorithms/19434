zzso outer membrane proteins zzso from other folding types of zzso and membrane proteins is an important task both for identifying outer membrane proteins from zzso sequences and for the successful prediction of their secondary and zzso zzso In this work, we have analyzed the influence of zzso energetic and zzso properties of zzso acid zzso for discriminating outer membrane proteins using different machine learning zzso such as, zzso rules, zzso functions, zzso networks, Support zzso machines, zzso trees, zzso We observed that most of the properties have zzso the zzso with similar zzso The neural network method with the property, free energy change could discriminate the zzso from other folding types of zzso and membrane proteins at the zzso zzso accuracy of zzso in a zzso of zzso zzso which is better than that obtained with zzso acid zzso The accuracy of discriminating zzso proteins is zzso and that of zzso zzso zzso proteins is zzso Further, the neural network method is tested with zzso proteins belonging to 30 major folding types and it could successfully exclude zzso of the considered zzso zzso zzso These accuracy levels are comparable to or better than other methods in the zzso We suggest that this method could be effectively used to discriminate zzso and for detecting zzso in zzso zzso
