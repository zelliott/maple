zzso zzso zzso zzso has become the method of choice for characterizing complex zzso These analyses often involve quantitative comparison of components in multiple zzso To achieve automated sample comparison, the components of interest must be detected and identified, and their retention times aligned and peak areas zzso This article describes a simple zzso zzso retention time alignment algorithm, based on the zzso approach, for alignment of zzso features detected in zzso zzso In this zzso algorithm, zzso features in the sample run are first aligned with features in the reference run by applying a single constant shift of retention zzso The sample zzso is then divided into two shorter zzso which are aligned to the reference zzso the same zzso Each shorter zzso is further divided into even shorter zzso This process continues until each zzso is sufficiently narrow so that zzso features within it have a similar retention time zzso In six zzso zzso alignment examples containing a total of zzso confirmed true corresponding feature pairs with retention time shifts up to five peak zzso the zzso successfully aligned these features with an error rate of zzso The alignment zzso is demonstrated to be fast, zzso fully zzso and superior to other zzso After alignment and zzso of detected zzso features, their zzso can be tabulated for direct comparison between zzso
