zzso models which represent the invasion of network-based systems by infectious agents can give important insights into many real-world situations, including the prevention and control of infectious diseases and computer zzso Here we consider zzso zzso zzso dynamics on finite strongly connected networks, zzso to several sexually transmitted diseases and computer zzso In this context, a theoretical definition of endemic prevalence is easily obtained via the zzso distribution zzso By representing the model as a zzso process and zzso the property of zzso we also provide a theoretical definition of invasion zzso We then show that, for zzso networks, the probability of invasion from any given individual is equal to the zzso endemic zzso following successful invasion, at the individual (we also provide a relationship for the directed zzso The total zzso endemic prevalence in the population is thus equal to the average invasion probability zzso all zzso zzso for such systems, the regions or individuals already supporting a high level of infection are likely to be the source of a successful invasion by another infectious zzso This could be used to inform targeted interventions when there is a threat from an emerging infectious zzso
