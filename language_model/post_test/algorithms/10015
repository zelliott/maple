We test the ability of zzso theory to describe zzso the revival of quantum wave zzso long time zzso the one zzso zzso zzso (a Kerr type zzso Two zzso theories are zzso zzso zzso and Van zzso zzso We show that both approaches describe with impressive accuracy the zzso function and wave function up to times longer than the revival zzso Moreover, in the Van zzso approach, we can show zzso that the range of agreement extends to arbitrary long zzso
