The knowledge of protein functions as well as structures is critical for drug discovery and zzso The zzso system developed at Stanford is an effective tool for characterizing and zzso local environments in zzso zzso zzso zzso of a fixed dimension to represent the zzso properties around a zzso zzso sites and zzso are identified by zzso such zzso using the zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we improve the zzso framework in several ways so that it can be more flexible, robust and zzso The new tool can handle zzso of a zzso dimension and can suppress noise zzso with little loss of important signals, by employing zzso zzso Furthermore, our approach zzso the support zzso machine for a more accurate zzso According to the results of our thorough experiments, the proposed new approach outperformed the original tool by zzso and zzso with respect to true and false positive rates, zzso
