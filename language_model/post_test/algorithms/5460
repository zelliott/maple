zzso loading modes zzso moment, zzso zzso are usually applied in the in zzso studies to simulate zzso lateral zzso and zzso rotation of the zzso The load zzso for zzso rotation vary strongly in the zzso zzso the results of current zzso zzso zzso zzso are hardly comparable and may involve unrealistic zzso Thus, the question zzso in zzso zzso loading mode is the most zzso remains zzso A validated finite element model of the zzso spine was employed in two sensitivity studies to estimate the ranges of results due to published load assumptions and to determine the input parameters zzso zzso zzso which mostly affect the spinal load and zzso during zzso zzso In a subsequent zzso study, the in zzso zzso loading mode was determined, which delivers results that fit best with available in zzso zzso The calculated results varied widely for loads used in the literature with potential high zzso from in zzso measured zzso The zzso pressure is mainly affected by the magnitude of the zzso force, while the zzso moment influences mainly the zzso zzso and facet joint zzso The best agreement with results measured in zzso were found for a zzso follower force of zzso and a pure moment of zzso applied to the zzso vertebra zzso The results reveal that in many studies the assumed loads do not realistically simulate zzso zzso The in zzso zzso simplified loads cannot perfectly mimic the in zzso zzso However, the zzso values lead to the best agreement with in zzso measured zzso Their zzso application would lead to a better zzso of different zzso
