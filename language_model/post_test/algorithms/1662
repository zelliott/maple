The zzso web server zzso a novel, zzso protein structural domain assignment procedure based on zzso zzso of the query protein which are also found within structures of a zzso protein zzso These common zzso zzso are transformed into a zzso zzso that offers a global view of the protein domain zzso Three different zzso are employed to define structural domain boundaries from this zzso zzso For each zzso a list of structural neighbors and their alignments are zzso zzso by displaying the protein structural domain organization, can be a useful tool for defining protein common zzso and for zzso the evolutionary relationship between different zzso
