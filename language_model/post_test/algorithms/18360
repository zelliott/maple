To evaluate the screening performance of the zzso zzso visual field test to detect eyes with visual field zzso zzso as measured by zzso threshold testing in a zzso zzso 

zzso zzso 

All 88 subjects who agreed to participate in the pilot phase of the zzso Eye Study were zzso Participants underwent a zzso visual field test followed by a zzso threshold zzso zzso test zzso field zzso One zzso was randomly selected and included in the zzso zzso and specificity rates of the zzso to detect eyes with zzso by the 30 to 2 zzso test were zzso 

When eyes with borderline results in the 30 to 2 zzso test were classified as having a zzso sensitivity rates of the zzso to detect eyes with zzso by the 30 to 2 zzso were zzso zzso and zzso whereas specificity rates were zzso zzso and zzso depending on the zzso used for the zzso 

The zzso test showed high sensitivity and low zzso results at the zzso least one point zzso zzso level criterion to detect eyes with visual field zzso by zzso threshold testing in a zzso zzso This criterion should be used when screening in a zzso study zzso By contrast, the zzso would not be the appropriate screening test in a primary care setting with limited zzso
