Nowadays, brain signals are employed in various scientific and practical fields such as Medical Science, zzso Science, zzso and Brain Computer zzso zzso the need for robust signal analysis methods with adequate accuracy and zzso is zzso The brain signal analysis is faced with complex challenges including small sample size, high zzso and noisy zzso Moreover, because of the zzso of brain signals and the impacts of mental states on brain function, the brain signals are associated with an inherent zzso In this paper, an evidence-based combining zzso method is proposed for brain signal zzso This method exploits the power of combining zzso for solving complex problems and the ability of evidence theory to model as well as to reduce the existing zzso The proposed method models the uncertainty in the labels of training samples in each feature space by assigning soft and crisp labels to zzso Then, some zzso are employed to approximate the belief function corresponding to each feature zzso By combining the evidence raised from each zzso through the evidence theory, more confident decisions about testing samples can be zzso The obtained results by the proposed method compared to some other evidence-based and fixed rule combining methods on artificial and real zzso exhibit the ability of the proposed method in dealing with complex and uncertain zzso zzso
