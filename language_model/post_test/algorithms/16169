The quality of protein structures determined by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso is contingent on the number and quality of zzso resonance assignments, distance and angular zzso Two key features of protein zzso data have posed challenges for the routine and automated structure determination of small to medium sized zzso zzso spectral resolution - especially of crowded nuclear zzso effect zzso zzso zzso and zzso the reliance on a continuous network of weak zzso zzso as part of most common assignment zzso In order to facilitate zzso structure determination, we developed a zzso strategy that zzso zzso sampling zzso and zzso decomposition zzso for optimal data collection and processing of selected, high resolution zzso zzso experiments, combined it with an zzso protocol for sequential and side chain resonance assignments, and streamlined this procedure to execute structure and refinement calculations in zzso and zzso zzso Two zzso user zzso zzso were developed to facilitate efficient analysis and compilation of the data and to guide automated structure zzso This integrated method was implemented and refined on over 30 high quality structures of proteins ranging from zzso to zzso in zzso
