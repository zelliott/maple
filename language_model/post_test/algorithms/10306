Several formulas have been developed to guide resuscitation in severely burned patients during the initial 48 zzso after zzso These approaches require manual zzso of fluid that may result in human error during this process and lead to zzso zzso The goal of this study was to analyze the efficacy of a computerized zzso decision support system for burn resuscitation compared to historical zzso 

zzso infusion rates and urinary output from 39 severely burned patients with zzso total body surface area burns were recorded upon admission zzso zzso A zzso model based on these data was developed and incorporated into a computerized zzso zzso and computer decision support zzso The computer decision support system was used to zzso 32 subsequent patients with severe burns zzso decision support system zzso and compared with the Model zzso 

zzso intensive care unit of a metropolitan Level 1 zzso zzso 

Acute burn patients with zzso total body surface area requiring active fluid resuscitation during the initial 24 to 48 hours after zzso 

We found no significant difference between the Model and computer decision support system groups in age, total body surface area, or injury zzso Total zzso volume during the first 48 zzso post burn, total zzso intensive care unit volume, and initial 24-hr zzso intensive care unit volume were all lower in the computer decision support system zzso zzso volume per zzso body weight zzso and per percentage burn zzso body surface zzso were also lower for the computer decision support system zzso The number of patients who met hourly urinary output goals was higher in the computer decision support system zzso 

Implementation of a computer decision support system for burn resuscitation in the intensive care unit resulted in improved fluid management of severely burned zzso All measures of zzso fluid volume were reduced while patients were maintained within urinary output targets a higher percentage of the zzso The addition of computer decision support system technology improved patient zzso
