zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso techniques provide color zzso that allows simultaneous analysis of zzso and structural abnormalities of whole human zzso zzso are stained zzso in zzso By analyzing the intensity combinations of each zzso all zzso zzso in an image are zzso Often, the intensity zzso between different images are found to be considerably different and the difference becomes the source of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso accuracy is the most important task to ensure the success of the zzso zzso In this paper, we introduce a new feature zzso method for zzso images that reduces the difference in the feature zzso among different images using the expectation zzso zzso zzso We also introduce a new zzso zzso zzso method for zzso zzso The performance of the zzso is as accurate as the zzso zzso whose accuracy also significantly improved after the zzso zzso We would expect that any zzso will likely produce an improved zzso accuracy following the zzso zzso Since the developed zzso method does not require training data, it is highly convenient when ground truth does not zzso A significant improvement was achieved on the zzso zzso accuracy after the new feature zzso Indeed, the overall zzso zzso accuracy improved by zzso after zzso zzso
