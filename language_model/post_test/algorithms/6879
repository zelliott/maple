Aquatic and zzso zzso acids are environmentally important because they affect the zzso and transport of metal zzso Prior studies demonstrated that zzso binds to the oxygen containing functional groups of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso is further investigated in this study using zzso zzso relaxation zzso for solutions of the zzso River zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso relaxation times are measured over a range of zzso zzso The results clearly indicate two types of zzso binding sites for the zzso A series of model zzso was also examined to gain further understanding of the two types of binding motifs present in the zzso zzso The results for a model compound containing several zzso zzso in near proximity zzso very closely to the results obtained for the strong binding sites of the zzso zzso
