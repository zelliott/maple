The aim of this study was to determine how much a zzso zzso cutting error would affect the zzso gap difference zzso gap minus extension zzso in total knee zzso zzso We evaluated 15 knees using a zzso zzso Bone cutting errors of zzso zzso and zzso of extension were simulated in three zzso zzso A zzso zzso cutting error of zzso of extension or zzso caused a change in the difference between the zzso and extension gaps of approximately two zzso in all three zzso zzso Surgeons should recognize that zzso zzso cutting errors have a significant effect on the zzso gap difference in zzso and pay particular attention to the alignment of the zzso cutting zzso
