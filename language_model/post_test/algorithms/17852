A new zzso zzso density functional approach for calculations of zzso shielding zzso has been developed and zzso It is founded on the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Initially, zzso equations are solved with the use of a restricted zzso balanced basis set for the small zzso The zzso coupled zzso zzso method is then based on the use of restricted zzso balanced basis sets for the small zzso Benchmark zzso calculations have been carried out for the zzso and zzso nuclear shielding zzso of the zzso series zzso where zzso effects are known to be very zzso The restricted zzso balanced basis set allows us to avoid additional approximations and/or strong basis set dependence which arises in some related zzso The method provides an attractive alternative to existing approximate zzso methods with transformed zzso for zzso calculations of chemical shifts and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso In particular, no zzso effects arise in property zzso
