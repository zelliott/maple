A conventional zzso zzso does not fully zzso the spatial information in the zzso In this paper, we present a fuzzy zzso zzso zzso that incorporates spatial information into the membership function for zzso The spatial function is the zzso of the membership function in the neighborhood of each zzso under zzso The advantages of the new method are the zzso zzso it yields regions more homogeneous than those of other methods, zzso it reduces the zzso zzso zzso it removes noisy spots, and zzso it is less sensitive to noise than other zzso This technique is a powerful method for noisy image zzso and works for both single and zzso data with spatial zzso
