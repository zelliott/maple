We demonstrate two-dimensional zzso analysis between zzso resolved and temporally resolved zzso to investigate the zzso dynamics of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The dynamic changes of the lifetime components are disclosed across the zzso spectrum with an external zzso Two different zzso lifetime schemes of the zzso complex are zzso From pH zzso to zzso the transition of protein zzso from the native state to the folding zzso a short lifetime component is found to correlate with a zzso zzso whose population diminishes with decreasing zzso The lifetime components reflect the zzso populations of the nascent and the zzso zzso From pH zzso to zzso the transition from the folding intermediate to the zzso state, the short lifetime is responsible for a zzso zzso and the fraction of this component increases when the solution becomes more zzso In this pH range, the zzso components reflect the zzso populations of zzso The relative zzso dynamics across the zzso spectrum are revealed without collecting zzso at each zzso More importantly, these conclusions are reached without the necessity of statistical fitting of the zzso data with an a zzso zzso zzso
