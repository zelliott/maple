In the literature, it was reported that the chaotic artificial neural network model with zzso zzso functions possesses a large memory capacity as well as a remarkable ability of retrieving the stored patterns, better than the conventional chaotic model with only zzso zzso functions such as zzso zzso This paper, from the viewpoint of the zzso limit, zzso the mechanism inducing the superiority of the model with periodic zzso functions that includes zzso zzso zzso by virtue of the zzso limit technique, this paper shows that any zzso neural network model with periodic zzso functions and properly selected parameters has much more abundant chaotic dynamics that truly determine the zzso memory capacity and zzso zzso To some extent, this paper zzso and zzso demonstrates that an appropriate choice of the zzso functions and control scheme can lead to a large memory capacity and better zzso ability of the artificial neural network zzso
