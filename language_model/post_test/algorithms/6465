We present an analysis for zzso optical zzso zzso that zzso the unrestricted use of fiber and fiber-optic components throughout an zzso and yields sample zzso zzso and relative zzso axis zzso We use a novel Jones zzso approach that compares the polarization states of light reflected from the sample surface with those reflected from within a biological sample for pairs of depth zzso The incident polarization zzso between two states that are perpendicular in a zzso sphere representation to ensure proper detection of tissue zzso regardless of optical fiber zzso The method was validated by comparing the calculated zzso of a polarizing sheet, chicken tendon, and muscle with that obtained by independent zzso The relative importance of zzso versus zzso to angular displacement of zzso zzso on a zzso sphere was zzso
