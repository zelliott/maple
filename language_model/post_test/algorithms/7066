This paper deals with methods of reducing the total time required to acquire the projection data for a set of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso during the acquisition of a set of zzso the patient is held stationary during data collection and translated to the next zzso location during an zzso zzso We demonstrate using computer simulations and scans of volunteers on a modified scanner how acceptable image quality is achieved if the patient translation time is overlapped with data zzso If the concurrent patient translation is ignored, structured artifacts significantly degrade resulting zzso We present a number of weighting schemes for use with the conventional zzso zzso to reduce the structured artifacts through the use of projection zzso using the data from individual and multiple zzso We compare the methods with respect to structured artifacts, noise, resolution and to patient zzso Review of preliminary results by a panel of zzso indicates that the residual image degradation is tolerable for selected applications when it is critical to acquire more slices in a patient breathing cycle than is possible with conventional zzso
