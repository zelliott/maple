This paper presents two cognitive models that simulate the production of referring expressions in the zzso zzso zzso zzso One general model is based on Dale and zzso zzso algorithm, and the other is a simple template model that has a higher correlation with the data but is specifically geared toward the properties of the zzso zzso The property of the zzso task environment that is modeled here is that the color feature is unreliable for identifying zzso while other features are zzso The low zzso cost of the incremental zzso for generating referring expressions makes it an interesting starting point for a cognitive zzso However, its explanatory power is zzso because it generates uniquely distinguishing referring expressions and because it considers features for inclusion in the referring expression in a fixed zzso The first model extends the original incremental zzso by an ability to adapt to feedback of whether a referring expression was used zzso but it seems to zzso the frequency with which distinguishing expressions are made and zzso the frequency of zzso referring zzso The second model produces features for referring expressions purely based on its current estimate of a zzso zzso Both models predict the observed human behavior of decreasing use of color terms and increasing use of useful feature zzso
