An efficient zzso method was suggested to separate biologically active peptides by zzso In this work, the zzso mobile phase of water and zzso was used with the buffer of zzso acid zzso The zzso profiles were calculated by the plate theory based on the linear and zzso equations of retention factor, zzso zzso and F was the zzso of zzso We modified the plate theory to calculate zzso profile in both zzso and zzso zzso From the final calculated results, the first mobile phase composition was water in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso then after zzso zzso the second composition of mobile phase was zzso changed to zzso and finally after 8 zzso it was kept at the zzso zzso In the experimental conditions, the agreement between the experimental data and the calculated values was relatively zzso
