Type IV zzso zzso are proteins produced by zzso bacteria to manipulate host cell gene expression and zzso divert the cell machinery for their own profit and circumvent the immune zzso zzso have been characterized for some bacteria but many remain to be zzso To help biologists identify putative zzso from the complete zzso of zzso and zzso we developed a zzso command line zzso tool called zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso system zzso The tool predicts and ranks zzso candidates by using a combination of 13 sequence zzso including zzso to known zzso zzso to zzso zzso presence of zzso zzso signals or zzso signals, zzso zzso software is zzso and specific motif searches are run independently before ultimate combination of the zzso to generate a score and sort the strongest zzso zzso The user keeps the possibility to adjust various searching parameters such as the weight of each zzso the selection threshold or the input zzso The zzso also provides a zzso and local gene density analysis, which strengthen the selection of zzso zzso zzso is a unique predicting tool for zzso finding its utility upstream from experimental zzso
