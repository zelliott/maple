zzso zzso simulations of zzso experiments are often required for the development of new techniques and for the extraction of structural and dynamic information from the zzso zzso of solid-state magic angle spinning zzso experiments can be particularly demanding both zzso and in terms of the programming required to carry them out, even if special simulation software is zzso We recently developed a number of approaches that dramatically improve the efficiency and allow a high degree of automation of these zzso In the present paper, we describe zzso a highly zzso computer program that zzso the new zzso The zzso used in the program will be described zzso Although particularly efficient for the simulation of experiments with complex pulse sequences and zzso systems in zzso zzso is a versatile and easy to use tool for the simulation and zzso of virtually any zzso zzso The performance of zzso was compared with that of another recently developed zzso simulation package, zzso zzso on a series of examples, zzso was consistently found to be orders of magnitude zzso At the time of publication, the program is available zzso for zzso zzso
