A comparative analysis of zzso and zzso finite element zzso modeling of spinal motion zzso 

To develop zzso zzso models of spinal motion segments using zzso methods applied to a zzso zzso zzso To compare strain and displacement patterns in zzso and morphed models for both healthy and zzso involved zzso 

zzso zzso models may be limited in their ability to fully represent zzso zzso and material property zzso Generation of multiple zzso zzso models has been limited because of zzso zzso zzso methods have been successfully used to generate multiple zzso zzso models of zzso rat zzso 

zzso models of a healthy and a zzso zzso spinal motion segment were analyzed with and without zzso material zzso zzso and morphed models were compared using a zzso morphing zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso model and including zzso material properties both had a strong impact on zzso and patterns of zzso strain and zzso 

Small but important geometric differences can be represented through morphing of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso developed provides a rapid method for generating zzso zzso models of spinal motion zzso
