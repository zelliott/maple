This study sought to determine whether zzso prospective zzso zzso delayed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can accurately delineate the extent of zzso zzso zzso compared with retrospective zzso zzso 

For defining the location and extent of zzso zzso compares well with delayed enhanced cardiac magnetic zzso However, the addition of a delayed scan requires additional radiation exposure to zzso zzso protocols using prospective zzso gating can substantially reduce effective radiation dose exposure, but these protocols have not yet been applied to zzso zzso 

Ten zzso models of acute zzso were zzso 10 days after zzso using prospective and retrospective zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso after a zzso contrast zzso The zzso images were analyzed using a zzso zzso zzso density zzso threshold zzso zzso size, zzso zzso ratios, zzso zzso ratios, and image quality metrics were compared between the 2 zzso zzso 

zzso volume zzso obtained by both methods were strongly correlated (R zzso zzso p zzso zzso and in good agreement zzso difference: zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared with retrospective zzso zzso estimated radiation zzso were markedly reduced with prospective zzso gating zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The zzso and zzso of zzso zzso were somewhat lower for prospective gated images zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso However, all examinations using prospective gating protocol achieved sufficient diagnostic image quality for the assessment of zzso 

Prospective zzso zzso accurately zzso zzso size compared with retrospective zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso and zzso were significantly higher for the retrospective gated zzso prospective zzso zzso provides high-resolution imaging of zzso while substantially lowering the radiation zzso
