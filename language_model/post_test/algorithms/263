The zzso of the recently discovered zzso zzso zzso has been characterized using three profiling and comparative zzso zzso The zzso has been grown on two different zzso enabling variations in protein expression to be zzso The results obtained using the experimental approaches have been compared with respect to number of proteins identified, confidence in zzso sequence coverage and agreement of regulated zzso The sample preparation, instrumental time and sample loading requirements of the differing experiments are compared and zzso A preliminary screen of the protein regulation results for biological significance has also been zzso
