Although the main reason for adding a random element at every step of zzso procedure is to reduce predictability of the upcoming treatment assignments in zzso zzso trials, there is another reason for its use, zzso to zzso zzso Adding the random element at every allocation step allows one to avoid a fully deterministic sequence of treatment assignments for sequences of zzso for which at every allocation step one of the treatments leads to a better balance in zzso than all other zzso An example of such a sequence is provided in this zzso
