The multistate perfect zzso problem is a classic problem in zzso zzso When no perfect zzso exists, it is of interest to find a set of characters to remove in order to obtain a perfect zzso in the remaining zzso This is known as the character removal zzso We show how to use zzso zzso and zzso to solve the character removal problem for an arbitrary number of states, which was previously zzso We outline a zzso technique that speeds up the zzso of the minimal zzso of a zzso zzso zzso are used in our solution to the missing data character removal problem and to zzso solution of the perfect zzso problem with missing zzso
