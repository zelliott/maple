In this paper we study an evolutionary machine learning approach to data mining and knowledge discovery based on the induction of zzso zzso A method for automatic rules induction called zzso using evolutionary induction of decision trees and automatic programming is zzso The proposed zzso is applied to a cardiovascular zzso consisting of different groups of attributes which should possibly reveal the presence of some specific cardiovascular problems in young zzso A case study is presented that shows the use of zzso for the zzso of patients and for discovering possible new medical knowledge from the zzso The defined knowledge discovery loop comprises a medical zzso assessment of induced rules to drive the evolution of rule sets towards more appropriate zzso The final result is the discovery of a possible new medical knowledge in the field of pediatric zzso
