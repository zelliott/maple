In this paper, a zzso correction for identifying zzso sources by means of phased microphone array zzso is presented and implemented zzso and zzso Conventional zzso techniques, which are developed for zzso sources, can lead to significant errors when applied to reconstruct zzso zzso A previous correction technique to microphone signals is extended to account for both source location and source power for two-dimensional microphone zzso The new zzso zzso is developed by zzso the basic source definition used for zzso This technique improves the previous signal correction method and yields a zzso zzso to sources which are suspected to be zzso in zzso zzso simulations are performed, which validate the capability of this zzso to recover ideal zzso zzso The zzso correction is applied to the identification of realistic zzso zzso and shows an improvement of array performance on zzso zzso source zzso
