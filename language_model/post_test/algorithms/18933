The zzso cassette (ABC) zzso protein zzso B1 line zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in the zzso barrier limiting a broad spectrum of zzso from entering the central nervous zzso In the present study, the transport activity of zzso for zzso zzso zzso and the major zzso of zzso zzso alcohol zzso zzso alcohol zzso and zzso zzso zzso was studied using an zzso zzso in expressed human zzso zzso by measuring zzso of zzso zzso in expressed human zzso zzso zzso was included as a positive zzso The zzso equation was used for characterizing the kinetic zzso zzso and zzso showed high affinity for zzso The zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were comparable with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its three zzso showed very weak affinity for zzso with zzso values lower than zzso zzso zzso zzso The results of the present study indicate that zzso and zzso have high affinity for zzso whereas zzso and its three major zzso zzso zzso and HB have very weak affinity for zzso These findings may help to explain observed zzso interactions among zzso
