The objective of this investigation was to test the ability of a zzso artificial neural network zzso to differentiate patients who have pelvic organ zzso zzso from those who retain good pelvic organ zzso 

Following institutional review board approval, patients with POP zzso zzso zzso and controls with good pelvic organ support zzso zzso zzso were identified from the zzso research zzso Historical and clinical information was extracted from the zzso Data analysis included the training of a zzso zzso variable selection, and external validation of the model with an independent data zzso 

Twenty variables were zzso The zzso ANN model used a median of 3 zzso zzso to zzso zzso variables and achieved an area under the receiver operator curve of zzso zzso independent validation zzso zzso percent sensitivity and zzso specificity were obtained in the external validation by ANN zzso 

zzso ANN modeling is zzso to the identification and prediction of zzso
