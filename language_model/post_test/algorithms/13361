We propose a novel method for zzso external marker zzso in CT scans for infrared zzso patient zzso in zzso Efforts were focused on the zzso of uncertainties in marker zzso in the CT zzso as a function of zzso zzso We implemented a 3-D approach to zzso zzso based on surface extraction and marker recognition according to geometrical prior zzso The zzso parameters were zzso on a clinical CT zzso coming from 35 zzso and zzso zzso the zzso accuracy was zzso at variable image resolution versus laser tracker zzso The zzso of conventional zzso optical tracking systems for zzso external surrogates in daily patient zzso procedures was also investigated in 121 zzso therapy treatment zzso Our study shows that the implemented zzso features surrogates zzso with uncertainties lower than zzso zzso and with a true positive rate of zzso being this latter mainly influenced by zzso zzso in the CT zzso The reported clinical validation in zzso therapy confirmed the zzso accuracy and the expected zzso zzso zzso prior knowledge allows judging the reliability of the extracted zzso zzso ensuring the highest accuracy in patient zzso
