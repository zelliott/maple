A technique that involves minimal operator intervention was developed and implemented for identification and zzso of black holes on zzso magnetic resonance images zzso zzso in multiple sclerosis zzso Black holes were segmented on zzso images based on zzso zzso zzso False zzso of black holes was minimized by masking the segmented images with images obtained from the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso images were automatically identified and eliminated from being included in the black hole zzso zzso connectivity was used for the zzso of black zzso The performance of this zzso was zzso evaluated on 14 zzso zzso
