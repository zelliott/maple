zzso zzso models are commonly employed to describe the structure and dynamics of large molecular zzso In those models, the dynamics is often described by zzso equations of motion with zzso zzso This paper presents a rigorous zzso method for the dynamics of linear zzso In this method, as usual, the zzso space of the original zzso system is divided into master and slave degrees of zzso Under the assumption that the characteristic zzso of the masters are slower than those of the slaves, the method results in zzso equations of motion governed by an effective potential of mean zzso In addition, zzso introduces zzso zzso among the masters as well as zzso zzso zzso Application of our method to the zzso part of the relaxation zzso of proteins shows that such dynamic zzso is essential for zzso their relaxation rates and zzso
