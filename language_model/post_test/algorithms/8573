zzso zzso studied within the framework of phase zzso has recently raised interest as one of the interactions in the zzso zzso In this work, we present a quantitative approach to the analysis of this zzso zzso Our primary aim is to determine whether synchronization between zzso and zzso rate is a real phenomenon or a random zzso First, we developed an algorithm, which detects epochs of synchronization automatically and zzso The zzso was applied to recordings of zzso and zzso obtained from 13 normal subjects and 13 heart transplant zzso zzso data sets were constructed from the original recordings, specifically lacking the zzso between zzso and zzso The statistical properties of synchronization in the two data sets and in their surrogates were zzso zzso was observed in all groups: in normal subjects, in the heart transplant patients and in the zzso Interestingly, synchronization was less abundant in normal subjects than in the transplant patients, indicating that the unique zzso condition of the latter promote zzso zzso The duration of synchronization epochs was significantly shorter in the surrogate data of both data sets, suggesting that at least some of the synchronization epochs are zzso In view of those results, zzso zzso although not a major feature of zzso interaction, seems to be a real phenomenon rather than an zzso
