zzso analysis has become a standard tool in the design and evaluation of zzso zzso zzso It allows for an analysis that incorporates all possible zzso costs, and operating points, which is important in many real problems, where conditions are often zzso zzso this to the zzso case is attractive, zzso the benefits of zzso analysis to a multitude of new zzso Even though zzso analysis does extend theoretically to the zzso case, the exponential zzso complexity as a function of the number of classes is zzso In this paper we show that the zzso zzso can often be simplified considerably because some zzso dimensions are independent of each zzso We present an zzso that analyses interactions between various zzso dimensions, identifying independent classes, and groups of interacting classes, allowing the zzso to be zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso can be interrogated in a similar fashion to the ideal case, allowing for approaches such as zzso and zzso zzso as well as the volume under the zzso An extensive bouquet of examples and experiments demonstrates the potential of this zzso
