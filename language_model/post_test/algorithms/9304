zzso exert a variety of zzso effects on the structure and function of the nervous zzso In particular, 17 zzso was found to affect zzso zzso in adult animals but its action on zzso currents during development has not been zzso In the present study, we investigated the effect of 17 zzso on zzso zzso developing in zzso In this model, zzso zzso showed acceleration with age along with increased zzso zzso zzso similarly as in zzso zzso treatment with 17 zzso increased zzso zzso in zzso cultured for zzso and zzso and prolonged the zzso zzso phase only in the zzso zzso The time needed for the onset of 17 zzso effect on zzso zzso was approximately 48 zzso In the period of zzso treatment with 17 zzso strongly reduced the zzso zzso activated by low zzso zzso The effects of 17 zzso on zzso and zzso zzso were not correlated with any change in expression of considered zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso and delta zzso were at the detection zzso In conclusion, we provide evidence that 17 zzso zzso affects the zzso and zzso components of zzso currents in zzso developing in zzso
