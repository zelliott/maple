This paper focuses on the creation of a zzso zzso decision making system for traumatic injury using machine learning zzso zzso experts must make several difficult decisions based on a large number of patient zzso usually in a short period of zzso The aim is to compare the existing machine learning methods available for medical zzso and develop reliable, zzso zzso decision-making systems that provide recommendations for the course of treatment for new patients, based on previously seen cases in trauma zzso zzso of traumatic brain injury zzso patients are used to train and test the decision making zzso The work is also zzso to patients with traumatic pelvic zzso 

zzso rules are created by processing patterns discovered in the zzso using machine learning zzso More specifically, zzso and zzso are used, as they provide grammatical expressions of knowledge extracted by applying logical operations to the available zzso The resulting rule sets are tested against other machine learning methods, including zzso and zzso The rule creation zzso is applied to multiple zzso both with and without prior filtering to discover significant zzso This filtering is performed via zzso zzso prior to the rule discovery zzso 

For survival prediction using all zzso zzso outperformed the other machine learning zzso When using only significant zzso neural networks performed zzso A reliable zzso was generated using combined zzso The average zzso rule performance was zzso when using all zzso and approximately zzso when using significant variables zzso The average performance of the combined zzso and zzso system using significant variables was zzso in predicting the exact outcome (home or zzso and zzso in predicting the zzso length of stay for zzso zzso zzso 

This study creates an efficient zzso zzso system that can be employed in decision making in zzso zzso The zzso apply methods that combine zzso and zzso with zzso zzso to improve rule performance and zzso For final outcome prediction for zzso cases, the resulting zzso outperform systems that zzso all available zzso
