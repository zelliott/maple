zzso zzso proteins lack stable structure under zzso conditions, yet carry out many crucial biological functions, especially functions associated with regulation, recognition, signaling and zzso Recently, human genetic diseases and related genes were organized into a zzso graph zzso zzso zzso ME, zzso D, Childs B, zzso M, et zzso zzso The human disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso U S A zzso zzso This zzso network revealed several significant features such as the common genetic origin of many zzso 

We analyzed the abundance of intrinsic disorder in these zzso network proteins by means of several prediction zzso and we analyzed the functional zzso of these proteins based on prior studies relating disorder to zzso Our analyses revealed that zzso zzso disorder is common in proteins associated with many human genetic diseases; zzso Different disease classes vary in the zzso contents of their associated zzso zzso zzso recognition features, which are relatively short loosely structured protein regions within mostly zzso sequences and which gain structure upon binding to partners, are common in the zzso and their abundance zzso with the intrinsic disorder zzso zzso Some disease classes have a significant fraction of genes affected by alternative zzso and the alternatively spliced regions in the corresponding proteins are predicted to be highly zzso and zzso zzso were found among the various zzso zzso properties and intrinsic zzso 

These observations provide the basis for the construction of the zzso zzso
