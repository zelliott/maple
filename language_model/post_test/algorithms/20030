In this paper, the weighted average prediction zzso is introduced into the existing consensus protocol for simultaneously improving the zzso to communication delay and the convergence speed of achieving the zzso The zzso analysis and algebra graph theory are employed to derive the necessary and sufficient condition guaranteeing the zzso delayed zzso systems applying the zzso consensus protocol to achieve the stationary zzso It is proved that introducing the zzso with the proper length into the existing consensus protocol can improve the zzso against communication zzso Also, we prove that for two kinds of zzso delayed zzso zzso 1) the zzso with communication delay approaching zero and 2) the ones with communication delay approaching the maximum zzso introducing the zzso with the proper length into the existing consensus protocol can accelerate the convergence speed of achieving the stationary zzso
