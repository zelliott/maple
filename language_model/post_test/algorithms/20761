The zzso zzso coli maneuvers itself to regions with high zzso zzso by performing two stereotypical zzso zzso in which it moves in zzso lines, and zzso in which it does not advance but changes direction zzso The duration of each move is zzso and depends upon the zzso concentration experienced in the recent zzso We relate this zzso behavior to the zzso density of a zzso population, and we derive the latter as a function of zzso zzso In contrast to earlier treatments, here we account for the effects of zzso correlations and variable tumbling zzso A range of behaviors is obtained that depends subtly upon several aspects of the system -- memory, zzso and tumbling zzso in zzso
