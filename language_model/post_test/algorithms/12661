The objective of this study is to zzso investigate whether using the newly developed zzso would improve zzso accuracy for discriminating zzso masses from benign ones on zzso zzso zzso Five zzso blinded to the zzso results and clinical history independently interpreted 226 cases according to the zzso lexicon of the fourth edition of the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System and assigned a final assessment category to indicate the probability of zzso For each case, each zzso provided three diagnoses: first with the original images, subsequently with the assistant of the resulting images processed by the proposed zzso zzso which are called as processed images, and another using the processed images zzso zzso zzso rating data were analyzed with the receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso For reading only with the processed images, areas under the zzso curve zzso of each reader zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were better than that with the original images zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso difference of the average zzso between the twice reading was significant zzso Compared with the results single used processed images, zzso of utilizing the combined images were increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but the difference is not statistically significant zzso The proposed zzso method has potential to be a good aid to zzso in distinguishing zzso breast solid masses from benign zzso
