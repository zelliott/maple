One of the inherent weaknesses of the zzso signal processing is noises and zzso To overcome it, some methods for prediction of zzso recently reported in the literature are based on the evaluation of chaotic behavior of zzso zzso zzso zzso These methods reduced noises, but they were hazardous to zzso In this study, we propose using zzso spectrum to filter noise and detect zzso on scalp zzso signals zzso We determined that the zzso spectrum can be considered as the most expected method to evaluate chaotic behavior of scalp zzso recordings and to be robust within zzso zzso results are compared to the independent component analysis zzso and largest zzso zzso The results of detecting zzso are compared to diagnosis from medical doctors in case of typical general zzso
