All methods proposed to date for mapping landmark zzso on a zzso tree start from an alignment generated by methods that make no use of zzso information, usually by zzso all zzso against a consensus zzso In order to properly interpret differences between landmark zzso along the tree as changes in shape, the metric chosen to define the ancestral assignments should also form the basis to zzso the zzso Thus, we present here a method that zzso both steps, map and zzso into a single procedure that (for the given zzso produces a multiple alignment and ancestral assignments such that the sum of the zzso distances between the corresponding landmarks along tree zzso is zzso This approach is an extension of the method proposed by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the use of landmark data in a zzso zzso zzso zzso for mapping landmark data with zzso as zzso zzso In the context of zzso this method allows maximizing the degree to which similarity in landmark positions can be accounted for by common zzso In the context of zzso this approach guarantees zzso zzso that all the transformations zzso on the tree represent changes in zzso The performance of the method was evaluated on different data sets, indicating that the method produces marked improvements in tree score (up to zzso compared with generalized zzso up to zzso compared with ordinary zzso These empirical results stress the importance of incorporating the zzso information into the alignment zzso
