Human observers readily recognize emotions expressed in body zzso Their zzso judgments are based on simple movement features, such as overall speed, but also on more intricate posture and dynamic zzso The systematic analysis of such features is complicated due to the difficulty of considering the large number of potentially relevant zzso and dynamic zzso To identify zzso features we zzso the neutral and emotionally expressive zzso happiness, sadness, zzso zzso of 25 zzso Body posture was characterized by average zzso angles, and a zzso zzso of the zzso structure of joint zzso was obtained by approximation with a zzso mixture zzso zzso sparse regression, we extracted critical zzso posture and movement features, which typically depended only on a small number of zzso The features we extracted from the motor behavior closely resembled features that were critical for the perception of emotion from zzso determined by a statistical analysis of zzso and rating judgments of 21 observers presented with avatars animated with the recorded zzso The zzso relevance of these features was further supported by another experiment showing that artificial zzso containing only the critical features induced high-level after-effects matching those induced by adaptation with natural emotional zzso
