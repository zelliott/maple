We consider the problem of zzso of imaginary motor tasks from zzso zzso data for zzso zzso zzso and propose a new approach based on hidden conditional random fields zzso zzso are zzso zzso models that are attractive for this problem because they zzso exploit the zzso structure of zzso zzso include zzso variables that can be used to model different brain states in the zzso and zzso involve learned statistical models matched to the zzso task, avoiding some of the limitations of zzso zzso Our approach involves spatial filtering of the zzso signals and zzso of power zzso based on zzso modeling of zzso segments of the zzso zzso Given this zzso zzso we select certain frequency bands that are known to be associated with execution of motor zzso These selected features constitute the data that are fed to the zzso parameters of which are learned from training zzso zzso zzso on the zzso are used for the zzso of motor zzso We zzso compare this approach to the best performing methods in zzso competition IV as well as a number of more recent methods and observe that our proposed method yields better zzso zzso
