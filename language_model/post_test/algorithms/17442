A simple model for zzso interactions in zzso based on a distance and position dependent screening of the zzso potential, is zzso It is applied in conjunction with a zzso Carlo zzso to calculate zzso values of zzso groups in zzso The purpose is to furnish a simple, fast, and sufficiently accurate model to be incorporated into molecular dynamic zzso This will allow for dynamic zzso calculations and for zzso between changes in structure and zzso state during the zzso The best method of calculating zzso states available today is based on solving the zzso zzso equation on a finite difference zzso However, this model zzso far too much computer time to be a practical zzso Tests are reported for fixed structures on zzso zzso zzso and zzso The studies include comparisons with zzso calculations with zzso zzso 4 and 20 inside the zzso a model with uniform zzso constant 80 and zzso zzso zzso The accuracy is comparable to that of zzso calculations with zzso constant 20, and it is considerably better than that with zzso zzso zzso The time to calculate the zzso at one pH value is at least 100 times less than that of a zzso zzso zzso zzso
