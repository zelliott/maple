A hybrid zzso attack scheme that combines the hill climbing zzso and the simulated zzso zzso is proposed to speed up the search procedure and to obtain a more accurate solution to the original key in the zzso plane encryption zzso And a unit cycle is adopted to analyze the value space of the random zzso The experimental result shows that our scheme can obtain more accurate solution to the key that can achieve better decryption result both for the selected encrypted image and another unseen zzso zzso The searching time is significantly reduced while without any exceptional case in searching zzso For an image of zzso zzso our zzso costs a comparatively short computing time, about 1 minute, can retrieve the zzso key with the zzso root mean squared error zzso therefore, our scheme makes the zzso attack on the zzso plane image encryption more practical, stable, and zzso
