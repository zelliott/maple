Complex zzso dynamics in a recent mathematical model of zzso testosterone regulation are zzso In agreement with biological evidence, the zzso zzso zzso of testosterone is modeled by frequency and zzso modulated zzso It is shown that, in addition to already known periodic motions with one and two zzso in the least period of a zzso system solution, cycles of higher zzso and chaos are present in the model in zzso The broad range of exhibited dynamic behaviors makes the model highly promising in zzso signal processing of hormone zzso
