To test whether image processing methods are suitable for detecting differences in the image quality of digital zzso units and whether the methods are more sensitive than visual test methods like the evaluation of zzso test zzso 

Test images according to zzso zzso were acquired with zzso and DR systems and analyzed zzso Only parameters were used that are obligatory for calculating the detective quantum efficiency zzso the noise power spectrum zzso the spatial resolution zzso zzso transfer zzso and the averaged zzso dose zzso The derived value, the zzso index, is linked to the noise equivalent zzso zzso zzso zzso test images were acquired and evaluated at one zzso and one DR zzso 

The accuracy of the evaluated values is in the range below of 2 zzso The accuracy requirements are fulfilled to establish values for detecting changes in image quality related to changes in dose no greater than one exposure zzso If a visual evaluation of test images is used, a significant difference in image quality can only be detected when the dose is zzso 

A method is proposed for establishing zzso zzso for values used in constancy and acceptance tests independently of the type of zzso unit zzso and DR zzso A method which zzso from visual tests for establishing the performance of digital zzso units could be used in acceptance zzso
