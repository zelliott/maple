There is currently no universally accepted approach to weaning patients from mechanical zzso but there is clearly a feeling within the medical community that it may be possible to formulate the weaning process zzso in some zzso zzso logic seems suited this task because of the way it so naturally represents the zzso human notions employed in much of medical zzso The purpose of the present study was to develop a fuzzy logic zzso for controlling pressure support ventilation in patients in the intensive care unit, utilizing zzso of heart rate, tidal volume, breathing frequency, and zzso oxygen zzso In this report we describe the fuzzy logic algorithm, and demonstrate its use zzso in 13 patients with severe chronic zzso pulmonary disease, by comparing the decisions made by the zzso with what actually zzso The fuzzy logic recommendations agreed with the status quo to within 2 zzso zzso an average of zzso of the time, and to within 4 zzso zzso an average of zzso of the time (although in most of these instances no medical decisions were taken as to whether or not to change the level of zzso zzso We also compared the predictions of our zzso with those cases in which changes in pressure support level were actually made by an attending physician, and found that the physicians tended to reduce the support level somewhat more aggressively than the zzso zzso We conclude that our fuzzy zzso has the potential to control the level of pressure support ventilation from ongoing zzso of a patient's vital zzso
