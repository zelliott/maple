We demonstrate that individual zzso zzso angles in zzso zzso organic zzso can be estimated by selective zzso of zzso zzso zzso under zzso spinning at zzso zzso By adapting a straightforward one-dimensional experiment described earlier zzso zzso zzso Eden, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 145 zzso zzso a zzso filtered spectrum selective for zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso is obtained with zzso zzso The evolution of zzso zzso zzso under the influence of the zzso fields of bonded zzso is monitored to provide a value of the zzso zzso angle that is consistent with the crystal zzso In addition, zzso zzso selective for zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso is achieved with zzso efficiency for a zzso distance of zzso yielding a reliable estimate of the zzso and zzso projection angle defining the relative zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso This procedure will be useful, in zzso cases, for structural analysis of fully zzso small molecules such as zzso zzso that are not readily zzso with labels placed selectively at structurally diagnostic zzso
