In this paper, a novel zzso sparse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed for facial expression zzso The zzso zzso is derived from the original zzso zzso by exploiting both sparse and zzso zzso The latter may contain the class information of the zzso zzso zzso can be conducted as an zzso or a supervised dimension reduction zzso A sparse representation of the facial images is obtained by minimizing the zzso of the basis zzso Furthermore, according to the graph embedding theory, the neighborhood of the samples is preserved by retaining the graph structure in the mapped zzso The zzso decomposition zzso the zzso facial expression images into a zzso zzso with sparse zzso To guarantee zzso we use the projected zzso method to calculate the zzso solution of zzso zzso are conducted on the zzso database and the zzso database with zzso and partially zzso facial zzso The results show that the zzso zzso provides better facial representations and achieves higher recognition rates than zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso is also more robust to partial zzso than other tested zzso
