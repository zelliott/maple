The purpose of this study was to determine the zzso of and factors associated with loss of extension zzso 4 weeks after anterior cruciate ligament zzso reconstruction using the new zzso zzso zzso zzso Form criteria for loss of zzso 

A retrospective review of patients who had undergone zzso zzso reconstruction between 1995 and 2000 was zzso An zzso single tunnel technique with zzso or zzso was used in all zzso A standardized physical therapy program was prescribed to all zzso zzso with revision zzso zzso zzso ligament surgery, zzso zzso or any zzso cartilage surgery were zzso zzso was defined as greater than a 5 degrees zzso difference in passive knee extension 4 weeks after surgery, the need for repeat zzso to restore extension, or use of a zzso cast to restore zzso 

zzso of 229 zzso patients developed zzso 4 weeks after zzso zzso zzso was not associated with age, sex, presence of nerve block, zzso zzso procedures, specific graft type, or zzso time zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly associated with zzso extension, time from injury to surgery, and use of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients underwent an zzso procedure to recover loss of zzso Following zzso 4 zzso patients had passive motion deficits between 6 degrees and 10 degrees , with none greater than 10 degrees zzso 

zzso range of motion and time to surgery are intimately related to a patient's zzso zzso While zzso of patients that lacked full extension by 4 weeks eventually required zzso zzso to achieve satisfactory extension, our treatment zzso led to an overall zzso of zzso greater than 5 degrees at final follow-up of zzso 

Level III, zzso retrospective, comparative zzso
