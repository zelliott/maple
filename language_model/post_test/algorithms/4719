zzso zzso of architecture provides a way to quickly zzso existing or novel buildings and zzso Such applications require both fast rendering and an effortless input regimen for creating and changing architecture using high-level editing operations that automatically fill in the necessary zzso zzso modeling and synthesis is a powerful paradigm that yields high data amplification and can be coupled with zzso techniques to quickly generate plausible details of a scene without much or any user zzso Previously, forward generating procedural methods have been proposed where a procedure is explicitly created to generate particular zzso In this paper, we present our work in inverse procedural modeling of buildings and describe how to use an extracted repertoire of building zzso to facilitate the zzso and quick modification of architectural structures and zzso We demonstrate an interactive application where the user draws simple building blocks and, using our system, can automatically complete the building zzso the style zzso other buildings using zzso texture mapping or zzso rendering zzso Our system supports an arbitrary number of building zzso created from user subdivided building models and captured zzso Using only zzso zzso and paste metaphors, the entire building styles can be altered and transferred from one building to another in a few operations, enhancing the ability to modify an existing architectural structure or to zzso a novel building in the style of the zzso
