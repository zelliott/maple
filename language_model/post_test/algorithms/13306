This paper investigates the zzso threshold of zzso in computer-generated zzso zzso zzso tests were conducted to find out how much the zzso frequency components below and above the fundamental must be attenuated for them to be zzso The tested tones comprised the fundamental zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso presented at zzso zzso and zzso sampling zzso The results indicate that above the fundamental the zzso components must be attenuated 0, 19, 26, 27, 32, and 41 zzso for the corresponding fundamental zzso and below the fundamental the zzso of 0, 3, 6, 11, 12, and 11 zzso respectively, is zzso The results imply that the zzso phenomenon affects the perception of zzso and that the masking effect is more prominent above the fundamental than below zzso The zzso zzso ratio is proposed as a suitable quality measure for zzso signals containing zzso It was shown that the zzso impulse train, the differentiated zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso step function synthesis zzso are zzso zzso up to 1, 2, and 4 zzso zzso General design rules for zzso zzso zzso are derived based on the results and on knowledge of zzso of zzso
