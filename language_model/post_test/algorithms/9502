The origin of spin zzso image artifacts in the presence of zzso and zzso magnetic field imperfections is shown theoretically using the Bloch equations and zzso at low zzso zzso Delta zzso intermediate zzso approximately Delta zzso and high zzso zzso Delta zzso spin zzso field zzso At low spin zzso fields, the zzso is shown to zzso about an effective field in the rotating frame causing signature zzso artifacts in the zzso At high spin lock fields, the effect of the resonance offset zzso zzso is zzso but imperfections in the flip angle cause zzso about the zzso zzso A new pulse sequence is presented that consists of an integrated spin echo and spin lock experiment followed by zzso storage along the zzso It is shown that this sequence almost entirely eliminates zzso artifacts from both types of field zzso at all spin zzso field zzso The sequence was used to obtain artifact free images of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso fields, zzso spins in fat and in zzso human brain images at 3 zzso The new pulse sequence can be used to probe very low frequency zzso zzso dynamic and zzso interactions in zzso without zzso zzso and zzso field zzso
