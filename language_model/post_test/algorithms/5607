zzso in sensory systems convey information about physical stimuli in their spike zzso In zzso single zzso respond precisely and reliably to the repeated injection of the same fluctuating zzso producing regions of elevated firing rate, termed zzso Analysis of these spike trains reveals that multiple distinct spike patterns can be identified as zzso correlations between spike times zzso zzso Thomas, & zzso 2004 zzso Finding events in data with realistic zzso statistics is challenging because events belonging to different spike patterns may zzso We propose a method for finding zzso events that uses contextual information to zzso which pattern a trial belongs zzso The procedure can be applied to spike trains of the same zzso across multiple trials to detect and separate responses obtained during different brain zzso The procedure can also be applied to spike trains from multiple simultaneously recorded zzso in order to identify zzso of zzso activity or to distinguish between zzso and zzso zzso The procedure was tested using artificial data as well as recordings in zzso in response to fluctuating current zzso
