After the publication of zzso we were alerted to an error in our zzso The error was an one-off zzso in the extraction of position information for our set of true zzso Our data set should have used randomly selected zzso zzso zzso as true zzso but the data generation phase resulted in a set of zzso that were each one zzso downstream of known, zzso zzso The consequences of this error are reflected in changes to our results, although the general conclusions presented in our original publication remain largely zzso
