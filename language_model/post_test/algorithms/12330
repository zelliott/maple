We approach the zzso solution to the diffusion equation for the case of absorbing inclusions embedded in a zzso scattering medium by using general properties of the zzso transfer equation and the solution of the zzso equation of the second kind given by the Neumann zzso The terms of the Neumann series are used to obtain the expression of the moments of the generalized zzso zzso function derived in transport zzso The moments are calculated independently by using zzso Carlo simulations for validation of the zzso While the mixed moments are correctly derived from the theory by using the solution of the diffusion equation in the geometry of interest, in order to obtain the self moments we should zzso the problem in transport theory and use a suitable solution of the zzso transfer equation for the calculation of the multiple zzso of the corresponding Neumann zzso Since the rigorous theory leads to zzso formulas, in order to simplify and speed up the calculation of the self moments, we propose a zzso method based on the calculation of only a single integral and some zzso zzso We also propose simple zzso rules for the calculation of the mixed moments for speeding up the zzso of zzso due to multiple zzso The theory can be developed in the zzso domain, the time domain, and the frequency zzso In a companion paper zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we discuss the conditions of zzso of the theory in practical cases found in diffuse optical imaging of biological zzso
