Within the scope of this study, a computer code named zzso has been developed to calculate the detonation properties of zzso based zzso explosives using the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the detonation properties is performed in chemical equilibrium and zzso zzso Unlike other codes in the literature which use zzso descent zzso method, zzso uses a zzso zzso code based on zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso the equilibrium composition of the detonation zzso This zzso code provides a higher level of zzso of the solutions and global optimum determination zzso The zzso zzso equation of state zzso is applied to the zzso gaseous detonation products at high zzso zzso uses zzso zzso zzso and zzso set of zzso in the zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso is applied for the zzso solid carbon in the detonation zzso The calculated detonation properties for several zzso explosives by zzso have been compared with those zzso by zzso and zzso zzso codes as well as the experimental data in terms of detonation zzso and detonation zzso zzso agreement is obtained from these zzso
