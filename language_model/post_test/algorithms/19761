In higher plants, a diverse array of zzso and zzso processes is regulated by the plant hormone zzso Recent publications have proposed that besides the zzso zzso Response zzso zzso that bind zzso Response zzso zzso also members of the zzso and zzso factor zzso families participate in zzso control of zzso genes via zzso Response zzso zzso or zzso Response zzso zzso zzso 

zzso a novel zzso algorithm, we demonstrate on a zzso scale that singular motifs or composite zzso of zzso zzso zzso but also of zzso related elements are significantly enriched in promoters of zzso zzso Despite zzso zzso differences in the zzso structure in terms of the zzso content, this enrichment is generally zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso model zzso Moreover, an enrichment of defined composite zzso has been observed in selected zzso gene zzso zzso a zzso zzso which encompasses a zzso zzso Related zzso zzso and an zzso zzso has been found to be highly zzso Making use of transient reporter studies in zzso these findings were zzso confirmed, demonstrating that zzso functionally interact with zzso in regulating zzso zzso 

Using zzso zzso zzso evolutionary zzso motifs have been defined which potentially function as zzso zzso elements to establish zzso expression zzso Based on these findings, experimental approaches can be designed to broaden our understanding of zzso zzso gene zzso
