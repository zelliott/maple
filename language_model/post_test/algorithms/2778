G zzso receptors zzso are zzso zzso which zzso signals from zzso zzso to zzso G zzso Automatic zzso of zzso can provide important information for the development of novel drugs in pharmaceutical zzso In this paper, we propose an evolutionary approach, zzso which combines individual zzso for predicting zzso zzso is a web predictor that can efficiently predict zzso at five zzso The first level determines whether a protein sequence is a zzso or a zzso If the predicted sequence is a zzso then it is further classified into family, zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this work, our aim is to analyze the zzso power of different feature extraction and zzso strategies in case of zzso prediction and then to use an evolutionary ensemble approach for enhanced prediction zzso Features are extracted using zzso acid zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso composition of protein zzso Different zzso approaches, such as zzso neighbor zzso support zzso machine zzso zzso neural networks zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been used to zzso zzso The proposed zzso zzso ensemble zzso exploits the prediction results of zzso zzso zzso and zzso at each zzso The zzso ensemble yields an accuracy of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at the five levels, on the first zzso We further perform predictions on a zzso consisting of 8,000 zzso at the family, zzso and zzso level, and on two other zzso of 365 and 167 zzso at the second and fourth levels, zzso In comparison with the existing methods, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed zzso in zzso zzso zzso It is accessible at zzso
