This paper presents extensions which improve the performance of the zzso zzso active zzso model presented earlier in zzso zzso zzso Vision zzso zzso 1 (2001) zzso for medical image zzso In contrast to that previous work, the zzso framework that we present in this paper allows multiple shapes to be segmented simultaneously in a seamless zzso To achieve this, multiple signed distance functions are employed as the implicit representations of the multiple shape classes within the zzso A zzso model for this new representation is derived by applying principal component analysis to the collection of these multiple signed distance zzso By zzso a zzso model in this manner, we obtain a zzso between the multiple shapes within the image and hence effectively capture the zzso among the different zzso The parameters of the zzso model are then calculated to minimize a single mutual zzso cost criterion for image zzso The use of a single cost criterion further enhances the zzso between the multiple shapes as the deformation of any given shape zzso at all times, upon every other shape, regardless of their zzso We found that this resulting zzso is able to effectively zzso the zzso among the different shapes to aid in the zzso zzso It is able to capture a wide range of shape zzso despite being a zzso zzso And finally, the zzso is robust to large amounts of additive zzso We demonstrate the utility of this zzso framework by applying it to a medical zzso the zzso of the prostate zzso the zzso and the internal zzso muscles for zzso prostate zzso
