In order to develop a better approach to accessory zzso zzso the authors analyzed 18 separate zzso characteristics in 93 consecutive zzso All patients had successful zzso zzso zzso of a single accessory zzso causing zzso zzso zzso duration to zzso 100 zzso with 56 pathways zzso on the right side of the heart and 37 zzso on the left zzso Eight individual locations were specified at the time of zzso five right sided and three left zzso Initially, a simple statistical approach was used, with group mean statistical comparison for both zzso frontal axis and zzso horizontal transition lead being compared between adjacent locations by zzso zzso zzso between individual values was assessed by calculating the percentage of total zzso numbers in each of the two adjacent locations being compared that lay within an arc of 2 zzso in the direction of the location being zzso The statistical significance of all 18 variables was tested using zzso analysis and zzso analysis of zzso for continuous variables and the zzso test for zzso zzso Post hoc tests performed were zzso test for the analysis of zzso and zzso test for the zzso zzso All zzso characteristics were then zzso in a zzso linear zzso analysis using zzso statistical zzso A zzso zzso was made to assess the accuracy of zzso The statistical level for a characteristic to enter the model was set at P zzso zzso and the statistical level for a characteristic to be removed from the model was set at P zzso zzso Six linear zzso analyses were zzso zzso right side versus left side, zzso right free wall versus right zzso zzso right anterior free wall versus right zzso free wall, zzso right anterior zzso zzso right zzso versus right zzso zzso zzso left anterior zzso versus left zzso zzso and zzso left zzso versus left zzso free zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
