zzso biology is to engineer artificial biological systems to investigate natural biological phenomena and for a variety of zzso However, the development of synthetic gene networks is still difficult and most newly created gene networks are zzso due to uncertain initial conditions and disturbances of zzso environments on the host zzso At present, how to design a robust synthetic gene network to work properly under these uncertain factors is the most important topic of synthetic zzso 

A robust regulation design is proposed for a zzso synthetic gene network to achieve the prescribed steady states under these uncertain factors from the zzso regulation zzso This zzso regulation design problem can be transformed to an equivalent zzso game zzso Since it is not easy to solve the robust regulation design problem of synthetic gene networks by zzso zzso game method directly, the zzso zzso fuzzy model is proposed to approximate the zzso synthetic gene network via the linear zzso inequality zzso technique through the zzso Control zzso in zzso Finally, an in zzso example is given to illustrate the design procedure and to confirm the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed robust gene design zzso
