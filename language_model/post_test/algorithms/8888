zzso of gene interaction networks from expression data usually focuses on either supervised or zzso edge prediction from a single data zzso However, in many real world applications, multiple data sources, such as zzso and zzso (in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso are available to offer zzso information about the same set of zzso We propose zzso to estimate a gene interaction network that is consistent with such multiple data sources, which are expected to reflect the same underlying relationships between the zzso zzso casts the network zzso problem as zzso the structure of a sparse zzso zzso zzso We use the zzso zzso zzso to model the distribution of the different data sources, with the different zzso sharing the same precision zzso inverse zzso zzso and we present an efficient zzso to estimate such a model in the zzso zzso zzso are reported on synthetic data, where zzso zzso baseline zzso significantly, even in the presence of noisy data zzso zzso are also run on two real-world zzso two zzso zzso zzso and three zzso embryonic gene expression zzso where zzso predicts a higher number of known gene interactions than existing zzso
