X-ray scatter zzso in zzso medium is a challenge in improving the quality of diagnostic projection images and zzso image zzso For Compton zzso the statistical behavior of the first order scatter can be accurately described by using the zzso expression for Compton scattering cross section provided that the exact information of the medium including the geometry and the zzso which in fact is unknown, is zzso The authors present an approach to approximately separate the unknowns from the zzso formula and express the unknown part by the primary zzso intensity at the zzso The approximation is fitted to the exact solution of the zzso formulas by introducing one zzso whose value is shown to be not sensitive to the linear zzso zzso and thickness of the zzso The performance of the approach is evaluated by comparing the result with those from the zzso formula and zzso Carlo zzso The approximation is close to the exact solution and the zzso Carlo simulation result for parallel and cone beam imaging systems with various field sizes, air gaps, and zzso and zzso of primary photons and for zzso zzso with various zzso of zzso and zzso For a wide range of zzso energy including those often used in zzso and zzso cone beam zzso zzso the first order scatter zzso at the detector is mainly from Compton zzso Thus, the approximate relation between the first order scatter and primary zzso at the detector is useful for scatter zzso in physical phantom zzso
