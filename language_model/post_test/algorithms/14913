We study zzso the dynamics of a network of sparsely connected zzso zzso zzso in a regime where individual zzso emit spikes zzso and at a low zzso In the limit when the number of zzso zzso zzso the network exhibits a sharp transition between a stationary and an zzso global activity regime where zzso are zzso zzso The activity becomes zzso when the zzso feedback is strong zzso The period of the global zzso is found to be mainly controlled by synaptic times but depends also on the characteristics of the external zzso In large but finite networks, the analysis shows that global zzso of finite zzso time generically exist both above and below the critical zzso zzso Their characteristics are determined as functions of systems parameters in these two different zzso The results are found to be in good agreement with zzso zzso
