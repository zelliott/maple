zzso zzso zzso zzso has the potential for skin tissue characterization due to its high zzso and zzso resolution and its acceptable depth zzso In practice, zzso cannot reach the theoretical resolutions due to imperfections of some of the components zzso One way to improve the quality of the images is to estimate the point spread function zzso of the zzso system and zzso it from the output zzso In this paper, we investigate the use of solid zzso to estimate the zzso of the imaging zzso We then zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to improve the quality of the zzso The performance of the proposed zzso is demonstrated on zzso images acquired from a variety of samples, such as zzso zzso fingertip skin and zzso zzso and zzso zzso
