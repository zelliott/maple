We describe an zzso zzso model of the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso during a zzso frequency comparison task zzso et zzso zzso 41, zzso zzso of zzso for each decision in a biased competition zzso network receive a bias input that depends on the firing rates of zzso zzso that code for the two zzso zzso The firing rate of the zzso in whichever zzso wins, reflects the sign of the difference in the zzso zzso being compared but not the absolute zzso However, the transition from the initial spontaneous firing state to one of the two possible zzso states depends zzso on the difference of the zzso zzso scaled by the base zzso This is due to finite size noise effects related to the zzso activity in the network, and the divisive feedback zzso implemented through zzso zzso Thus the zzso basis for a zzso effect, Weber's Law, can be related to statistical fluctuations and divisive zzso in an zzso decision-making zzso
