zzso regulation of genes in zzso is achieved by the interactions of multiple zzso factors with zzso of zzso factor binding sites zzso on DNA and with each zzso Identification of these zzso is an essential step in our understanding of gene regulatory networks, but zzso prediction of zzso with either consensus or commonly used zzso models such as zzso zzso zzso zzso results in an unacceptably high number of hits consisting of a few true functional binding sites and numerous false zzso binding zzso This is due to the inability of the models to incorporate higher order properties of sequences including sequences surrounding zzso and influencing the positioning of zzso and/or the interactions that might occur between zzso zzso 

zzso improvement can be expected through the development of a new framework for the modeling and prediction of zzso that considers explicitly these higher order sequence zzso It would be particularly interesting to include in the new modeling framework the information present in the zzso positioning sequences zzso surrounding zzso as it can be hypothesized that zzso use this information to zzso the formation of stable zzso over zzso sites, while functional sites have a more open zzso zzso In this report we evaluate the usefulness of the latter feature by comparing the zzso occupancy probabilities around zzso verified human zzso with the zzso occupancy probabilities around false positive zzso and in random zzso 

We present evidence that zzso occupancy is remarkably lower around true functional human zzso as compared to zzso human zzso which supports the use of this feature to improve current zzso prediction approaches in higher zzso
