zzso below knee zzso zzso are associated with a high risk of zzso as compared to zzso zzso We assumed that before the bypass zzso in the early zzso period, measurable zzso changes, and/or the presence of high intensity transient signals zzso would zzso 



institutional reference center, hospitalized zzso 

satisfactory zzso recording was obtained in 51 among 61 consecutive patients (32 zzso 19 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suffering lower zzso zzso disease, that underwent zzso zzso prosthetic zzso or sequential zzso below knee zzso We performed a spectral and profile analysis of a single zzso 2 hour zzso recording at the ankle level and analyzed zzso derived zzso and clinical risk factors in the evaluation of the risk of bypass zzso within 7 days following zzso 

zzso zzso at day 7 was observed in 41 of the 51 operated zzso The presence of zzso was found in approximately zzso of the patients and provided no information on the risk of zzso No clinical variable was significantly associated with an increased risk of zzso Whatever the duration of recording, the presence of a zzso forward flow and wide zzso zzso changes were poor indicators of bypass zzso zzso On 512 beat recordings, a mean zzso zzso below zzso zzso and a standard zzso of the resistance index zzso were associated with a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso times increases in the risk of bypass zzso respectively, compared with subjects that do not fulfill each zzso 

zzso of transient zzso zzso events may be observed before the bypass zzso zzso zzso zzso recording should be preferred to short term zzso to allow for the detection of these transient events and may provide potential zzso for future zzso
