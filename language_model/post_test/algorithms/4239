Philips Healthcare released a novel metal artifact reduction zzso for large orthopedic implants zzso Little information was available about its CT number zzso Since CT numbers are used for tissue zzso corrections in external beam zzso treatment planning, we performed a phantom study to assess the CT number accuracy of zzso Two situations were zzso a patient with a unilateral metallic hip zzso and a patient with bilateral metallic hip zzso We compared the CT numbers in the zzso reconstructions of the simulations to those in the zzso reconstruction and to those in a zzso baseline zzso In both simulations, the CT number accuracy of the zzso reconstruction was better than the CT number accuracy of the zzso zzso zzso In the zzso reconstruction of the unilateral zzso all CT numbers were accurate within zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso In the zzso reconstruction of the bilateral zzso CT numbers were found that differed more than zzso 5 zzso from the zzso baseline zzso However, none of these differences were clinically zzso
