Treatment of elevated blood pressure is frequently necessary after cardiac surgery to minimize zzso bleeding and to zzso zzso changes associated with zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the zzso and zzso of a zzso calcium channel zzso zzso in the treatment of hypertension in zzso cardiac surgical zzso 

zzso cardiac surgical patients were zzso to receive zzso or one of six doses of zzso zzso parameters were recorded and blood samples were drawn for determination of zzso plasma zzso during infusion and after zzso of zzso The zzso relation was analyzed using zzso regression, and zzso models were applied to the data using population zzso 

There were significant decreases in mean zzso blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance at doses greater than or equal to zzso zzso zzso zzso There were no changes in heart rate, central zzso pressure, pulmonary artery zzso pressure, or cardiac index with increasing doses of zzso The zzso zzso value for a zzso or greater decrease in mean zzso pressure was zzso zzso and for a zzso or greater decrease in mean zzso pressure was zzso zzso The zzso of zzso were best described with a zzso model with a volume of distribution of zzso zzso and clearance of zzso zzso The early phase of drug disposition had a zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso is less than 2 zzso for up to 12 h of zzso 

zzso is a calcium channel zzso with a very short duration of action that effectively decreases systemic vascular resistance and mean zzso pressure without changing heart rate, cardiac index, or cardiac filling zzso
