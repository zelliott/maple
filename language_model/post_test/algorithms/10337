We wanted to evaluate the image quality and diagnostic value of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coronary zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso 

The coronary arteries of 22 zzso patients seen on zzso were classified into 15 segments and the imaging quality zzso good, moderate and zzso and significant zzso zzso zzso were evaluated by two zzso who were blinded to the conventional coronary zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value zzso and negative zzso value zzso for detecting important coronary artery zzso were zzso zzso test was used to determine any significant difference between zzso and zzso and Cohen's Kappa statistics were calculated for the zzso and zzso zzso 

The mean heart rate was 89 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A range from 250 zzso to 300 zzso within the zzso zzso was the optimal reconstruction zzso for the patients with zzso The respective overall sensitivity, zzso zzso and zzso values were zzso zzso zzso and zzso for reader 1 and zzso zzso zzso and zzso for reader zzso No significant difference between zzso and zzso was found for detecting a significant zzso zzso 1, p zzso zzso reader 2, p zzso zzso Cohen's Kappa statistics demonstrated good zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso coronary zzso provides good image quality in patients with zzso zzso without the need for controlling the heart zzso zzso can be used for ruling out significant zzso in patients with zzso zzso with its high zzso for detecting in important zzso
