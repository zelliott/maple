This paper considers zzso of a survival function when there exists a change point and the survival time of interest is defined as elapsed time between two related zzso Furthermore, there exists zzso on observations on the zzso of both events and zzso on observations on the occurrence of the second event and thus the survival time of zzso To obtain the maximum likelihood zzso of a survival function, an zzso zzso is developed when the survival function is completely unknown before the change point and known up to a zzso of unknown parameters after the change zzso The idea is a zzso of that discussed in zzso and zzso zzso and an example are used to evaluate and illustrate the zzso
