zzso and spin echo zzso and SE, zzso weighted magnetic resonance images report on zzso activity via changes in zzso zzso content and cerebral blood volume induced by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in these functional zzso However, how the different blood vessels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso contribute to the functional zzso zzso signals at each field strength, and consequently, how zzso specific these zzso signals are remain a source of zzso In this study, we zzso an zzso model of the zzso signals up to zzso zzso exploiting the increasing body of published information on relevant zzso zzso Through simulations, zzso and zzso functional signal contributions were determined as a function of field strength, echo time zzso and zzso sequence zzso The model predicted previously reported effects, such as feasibility of zzso of zzso but not the zzso approach to yield larger zzso compared to zzso zzso In addition, however, zzso effects were found to peak with increasing magnetic fields even in the zzso approach, and further increases in magnetic fields imparted no additional benefits besides beyond the inherent zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, for SE, using a TE larger than the tissue zzso enhances zzso signal zzso though compromising zzso for spatial zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso signals do not fully disappear even at high field strength as zzso and zzso contributions zzso The model, and the zzso considerations presented here can also be applied in contrast agent experiments and to other models, such as zzso zzso approach and vessel size zzso
