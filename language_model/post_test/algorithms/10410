We used zzso zzso zzso to zzso reduced volume in the whole brains of pediatric patients with multiple zzso relative to healthy zzso As a marker of local volume difference, we used the zzso zzso of the deformation field that maps each subject to a standard zzso To properly assess abnormal differences in volume in this age group, it is necessary to account for the normal, age-related differences in brain zzso This was accomplished by computing zzso zzso zzso zzso values at each zzso to represent the local volume difference (in standard zzso between an individual subject and an zzso and zzso healthy normal zzso Compared with healthy controls, pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis exhibited significantly reduced volumes within the zzso and the zzso of the corpus zzso and significant expansions in the zzso While zzso zzso volume was correlated with reduced zzso volume, no correlation was found between zzso zzso volume and reduced zzso zzso zzso volumes of the zzso zzso including that of the zzso tracts and zzso zzso correlated with disease zzso Our results suggest that focal inflammatory zzso may play an important role in tract zzso including zzso zzso
