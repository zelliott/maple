zzso tissue deformation during zzso minimally invasive surgery zzso is an important step towards motion compensation and zzso This article presents a practical strategy for dense zzso depth recovery and zzso motion tracking for zzso zzso 

The method combines image zzso with constrained disparity registration for reliable depth zzso The accuracy and practical value of the technique are validated using a tissue phantom with known zzso geometry and motion characteristics and in zzso zzso 

zzso from the phantom model correctly follow the motion trend indicated from the ground truth provided by CT zzso and zzso analysis shows the intrinsic accuracy that can be achieved with the proposed zzso zzso applied to in zzso zzso zzso data are also zzso indicating the practical value of the proposed zzso 

The proposed method presents a practical strategy for dense depth recovery of surface structure in zzso zzso that incorporates stereo zzso zzso on phantom and in zzso data indicate the quality of the method and also highlight the importance of further considering the effects of zzso zzso
