zzso pulse propagation equations zzso zzso zzso E 70, zzso zzso have provided a theoretical underpinning for zzso investigations into dynamics of zzso zzso laser zzso and have been successfully zzso for almost a zzso Unfortunately, they are restricted to applications in bulk media or, with additional zzso to simple zzso zzso in which only a few guided modes can approximate the zzso zzso The purpose of this work is to zzso the directional pulse propagation equations to structures characterized by strong zzso index differences and material zzso We also outline a zzso solution framework that draws on the combination of the zzso zzso method with zzso zzso zzso
