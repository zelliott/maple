The zzso capabilities of many environmentally and medically important microbes can be zzso explored using systems biology approaches to zzso zzso Yet, as we learn more about the complex zzso and zzso interactions in microbial communities, it is important to understand whether and how zzso approaches can be extended to the zzso zzso Here we zzso recent work that addresses these challenges at multiple zzso starting from zzso natural and synthetic ecology models, up to zzso zzso Among the many fascinating open challenges in this field is whether the integration of high zzso sequencing methods and mathematical models will help us capture emerging principles of zzso zzso organization and zzso
