zzso properties of vascular beds are of great interest in a variety of clinical and laboratory zzso However, there presently exists no zzso accurate, technically simple method for generating blood zzso maps of complex zzso zzso 

Here, we present a novel zzso that addresses the problem of acquiring quantitative maps by applying zzso zzso to video zzso zzso signals at every spatial coordinate are compared with signals at neighboring points, generating a series of correlation maps from which speed and direction are zzso zzso definition of vessel zzso is not required, and sequential data are analyzed automatically, without user zzso 

zzso zzso were validated against the zzso method and against in zzso zzso flow with known zzso The zzso was tested in three different biological models in order to demonstrate its zzso 

The zzso maps presented here demonstrate an accurate, quantitative method of analyzing dynamic vascular zzso
