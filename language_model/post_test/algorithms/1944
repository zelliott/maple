zzso MR imaging provides a unique tool to probe the zzso of nervous tissue and to explore the wiring zzso of the neural connections zzso Generally, a forward model is established to map the zzso fiber architecture onto the zzso diffusion signals, which is reformulated in this article by adopting a zzso zzso However, the inverse problem, zzso the zzso zzso of the fiber orientation density from noisy MR zzso is zzso We propose a zzso representation of the zzso distribution of the nerve fibers in terms of a zzso process zzso Given a zzso approximation of the impulse response of a fiber segment, the specified problem is solved by zzso statistics under a zzso noise model, using an zzso zzso jump zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso The density zzso framework is demonstrated by various experiments with a diffusion MR zzso featuring high angular resolution, uncovering the fiber orientation field in the cerebral white matter of the living human zzso
