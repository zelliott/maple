The zzso zzso zzso theory zzso zzso is developed and presented as an efficient and reliable scheme for the zzso treatment of van der zzso zzso complexes, including full geometry zzso and frequency calculations with zzso energy derivatives in a routine zzso For this purpose, the zzso zzso exchange functional and the zzso progressive correlation functional of zzso and co-workers are combined with the zzso zzso long-range correlation zzso The time-consuming zzso incorporation of the ALL term in the zzso zzso needed for the calculation of forces and force zzso is avoided by an a zzso evaluation of the ALL term and its zzso based on an effective zzso of the coordinate space into global and zzso zzso zzso is substantially faster than zzso would zzso zzso is used to explore the potential energy surface zzso of the zzso zzso The results for the binding energies and zzso distances agree well with zzso calculations at the complete zzso zzso We identify 16 stationary points on the zzso which zzso the usefulness of zzso energy zzso for the investigation of the zzso Furthermore, the inclusion of zzso calculated zero point energies reveals that zzso zzso connect the eight most stable zzso zzso forms and make it difficult to identify a dominating complex zzso The zzso T structure and the zzso sandwich form have the same zzso value of zzso zzso which agrees perfectly with the experimental value of zzso zzso
