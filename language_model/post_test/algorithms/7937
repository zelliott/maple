A new model for seawater scattering was developed, in which Gibbs function was used exclusively to derive the zzso parameters that are associated with density zzso Because Gibbs function was determined zzso from highly accurate zzso of a group of zzso variables and is valid for zzso up to 120 g zzso zzso Research I, 55, zzso zzso we expect the model is also valid over the extended range of zzso The model agrees with the zzso by zzso zzso zzso 20, zzso zzso with an average difference of zzso for S zzso 0 and zzso for S zzso zzso The scattering by seawater as predicted increases with zzso in a zzso fashion, and linear zzso of scattering based on zzso zzso would overestimate by up to zzso The zzso of zzso model zzso Express, 17, zzso zzso which is valid for zzso up to 40 g zzso however, agrees with the prediction within zzso zzso over the entire range of zzso Even though there are no zzso available for zzso the results suggested that the uncertainty is limited in using the newly developed model in zzso the scattering by seawater of high zzso
