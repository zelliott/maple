We aimed to clarify the zzso abnormalities of patients with acute kidney injury zzso requiring zzso dialysis zzso in pediatric cardiac care zzso 

A retrospective zzso study was conducted in a pediatric cardiac care unit in a zzso care university zzso The subjects were 40 patients with zzso requiring zzso between 2003 and 2005, and controls matched by type of surgery and body zzso zzso zzso including blood gas data and zzso were zzso The zzso zzso including strong zzso difference apparent zzso strong zzso difference effective zzso and strong zzso gap zzso were zzso 

Blood gas analyses showed that the zzso group was more zzso with a lower mean zzso and a lower mean base zzso typical features of zzso zzso The strong zzso analyses revealed that the zzso group had lower mean sodium and zzso zzso Based on the zzso methodology, zzso was smaller in the zzso group than in the control group, but zzso was similar in the two zzso zzso characteristic curve analyses showed that serum zzso was the only zzso factor associated with zzso zzso even after adjustment for zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso requiring zzso in a pediatric cardiac care unit had significant zzso zzso compared to controls matched by the type of surgery and body zzso zzso and zzso were characteristics of these zzso The calculated zzso was smaller in the zzso than in the control zzso Only the serum zzso had a significant zzso zzso
