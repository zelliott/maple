zzso carbon isotope composition zzso was measured on zzso in mature fruits from zzso zzso Sugar zzso and summer predawn leaf water potential were significantly zzso The survey of different vineyards during four growing seasons showed that sugar zzso in must at harvest varied from zzso per thousand to zzso per thousand when conditions during berry maturation varied from dry to zzso This range allows a very sensitive detection of zzso water status under natural zzso However, local differences due to soil capacity to supply water to zzso are zzso whatever the annual water zzso Leaf nitrogen content variations of zzso zzso did not change zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso between 31 zzso varieties for zzso was zzso Must sugar zzso can be used to characterize vineyards for their soil structural capacity to provide water to zzso It was concluded that isotope carbon composition in zzso measured on zzso at harvest can be applied to compare the capacities of vineyard zzso and canopy management to induce mild water stress in order to produce premium zzso
