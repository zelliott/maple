zzso zzso zzso were recorded zzso from zzso mice using a zzso procedure in which a brief test flash at time zero was followed at time zzso by a bright probe flash of fixed strength, and in which the probe response zzso was determined at time zzso zzso zzso + 6 zzso zzso responses obtained in a series of zzso trials were zzso to derive zzso a family of zzso that zzso represents the massed response of the rod zzso to the test zzso A central aim was to obtain a mathematical description of the zzso derived response zzso as a function of zzso the test flash zzso zzso With fixed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1200 zzso zzso was described by the zzso exponential function zzso - zzso where zzso is a zzso sensitivity zzso For zzso zzso 86 zzso a time near the peak of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso s zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso data were zzso in relation to the equation below, a zzso form of the above exponential function in which zzso is replaced by the product zzso and where zzso is independent of the test flash zzso The function zzso was zzso as the product of a zzso factor zzso an zzso term 1 - zzso - zzso and a zzso term zzso zzso zzso 1 - zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso - zzso where zzso is a brief zzso zzso is an exponential time constant, and alpha characterizes the acceleration of the zzso zzso For zzso up to approximately zzso zzso zzso s zzso the overall time course of zzso was well described by the above equation with gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 132 zzso and alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An approximate zzso of alpha improved the fit of the above equation to zzso zzso and zzso data obtained at zzso about zzso zzso zzso zzso and sensitivity properties of zzso suggest that it zzso the in zzso massed zzso response of the rods to a test zzso and imply that zzso in the above equation is the approximate kinetic description of a unit, zzso single zzso zzso
