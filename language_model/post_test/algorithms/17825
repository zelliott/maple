zzso analogous with zzso is the analysis of the protein complement present in a cell, organ, or zzso at any given zzso While the zzso provides information about the theoretical status of the cellular zzso the zzso describes the actual content, which ultimately determines the zzso The broad application of zzso technologies in basic science and clinical medicine has the potential to accelerate our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying disease and may facilitate the discovery of new drug targets and diagnostic disease zzso zzso is a rapidly developing and changing scientific discipline, and the last 5 zzso have seen major advances in the underlying techniques as well as expansion into new zzso Core technologies for the separation of proteins and/or peptides are one- and two-dimensional gel zzso and one- and two-dimensional liquid zzso and these are coupled almost exclusively with mass zzso zzso studies have shown that the most effective analysis of even simple biological samples requires zzso and/or enrichment before protein identification by mass zzso zzso of the appropriate technology or combination of technologies to match the biological questions is essential for maximum coverage of the selected zzso and to ensure both the full interpretation and the downstream utility of the zzso In this review, we describe the current technologies for zzso zzso and separation of biological samples, based on our lab zzso for zzso discovery and zzso
