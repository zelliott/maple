The aim of our study was to assess diagnostic value of magnetic resonance zzso zzso in patients with suspected common zzso duct zzso stones focusing on the capability of this zzso method to replace invasive diagnostic procedures in these patients and to limit the use of zzso retrograde zzso zzso to the patients who need simultaneous therapeutic zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images were obtained in 310 patients recruited into this prospective zzso There were 136 male and 174 female patients aged zzso years zzso zzso standard zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients were subsequently classified into different risk groups zzso moderate, zzso according to zzso abnormalities or zzso features on abdominal zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was the reference method of zzso zzso 

zzso stones were diagnosed in 115 zzso zzso 86 of 175 patients in the high-risk group, 24 of 83 patients in the zzso group, and 5 of 50 patients in the low-risk zzso In dependent risk groups, the mean zzso caliber was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The difference was significant between all three groups zzso zzso zzso The median size of zzso stones was 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso achieved accuracy and positive and negative zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso has a potential to substitute diagnostic zzso in all patients with suspected zzso due to its high zzso reducing invasive direct zzso to patients who require therapeutic zzso
