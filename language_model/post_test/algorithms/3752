A simple zzso optical method for zzso the depth and concentration of fluorescent inclusions in zzso media is zzso We demonstrate direct depth zzso of a localized fluorescent object from the zzso position of the zzso zzso function zzso The depth zzso permits recovery of the zzso zzso both of which are essential quantities for optical molecular imaging zzso Since the maximum is independent of the zzso zzso zzso laser power, detector gain, and other zzso factors, this method ensures a robust and efficient zzso
