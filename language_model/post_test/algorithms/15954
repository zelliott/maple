zzso alignment programs such as zzso and zzso are used routinely in zzso zzso or zzso zzso methods to detect remote zzso for the purposes of fold assignment and comparative zzso Yet, the sequence alignment quality of these methods at low sequence identity is not zzso We have used the zzso structure alignment program zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to derive sequence alignments for all zzso and zzso related proteins in the zzso domain zzso zzso zzso structures and their sequences based on distances within each zzso rather than on zzso zzso We compared zzso zzso zzso and zzso alignments with the zzso structural zzso We found that global alignments with zzso were very poor at low sequence identity zzso as judged by the zzso zzso We used zzso to search the zzso sequence database zzso with every sequence in zzso using up to four zzso The resulting zzso was used to search a database of zzso zzso zzso is only slightly better than zzso in alignment accuracy on a zzso basis, but zzso zzso alignments are much longer than zzso and so align correctly a larger fraction of the total number of aligned zzso in the structure zzso Any two zzso sequences in the same zzso that shared a hit or hits in the zzso zzso searches were identified as linked by the shared intermediate zzso We examined the quality of the longest zzso zzso alignment via an intermediate zzso and found that zzso produced longer alignments than zzso searches alone, of nearly comparable zzso zzso At zzso sequence identity, zzso correctly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso according to the structure zzso We also compared zzso structure alignments with zzso structure alignments generated by the zzso zzso In contrast to the sequence methods, zzso and structure alignments from the zzso database zzso align zzso of zzso pairs at the zzso level of sequence identity, indicating that there is substantial room for improvement in these sequence alignment zzso zzso produced alignments for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence pairs (nearly all zzso sequence zzso zzso matched zzso and the zzso zzso method aligned 38% with zzso zzso The results indicate that intermediate sequences may be useful not only in fold assignment but also in achieving more complete sequence alignments for comparative zzso
