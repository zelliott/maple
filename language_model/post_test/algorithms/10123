The secondary structure of zzso molecules is intimately related to their function and often more zzso than the zzso zzso the important task of searching databases for zzso requires to match zzso zzso Unfortunately, current tools for this task have, in the best case, a running time that is only linear in the size of sequence zzso Furthermore, established index data structures for fast sequence matching, like zzso trees or zzso cannot benefit from the zzso constraints introduced by the secondary structure of zzso 

We present a novel method and readily zzso software for time efficient matching of zzso zzso patterns in sequence zzso Our approach is based on affix zzso a recently introduced index data structure, zzso from the target zzso zzso zzso support zzso pattern search, which is required for efficiently handling the structural constraints of the zzso zzso patterns like zzso can be matched inside out, such that the loop region is matched first and then the pairing bases on the boundaries are matched zzso This allows to exploit base pairing information for search space reduction and leads to an expected running time that is zzso in the size of the sequence zzso The incorporation of a new zzso approach in the search of zzso zzso patterns enables the description of molecules folding into complex secondary structures with multiple ordered zzso The zzso approach removes zzso matches from the set of intermediate results, in particular of patterns with little zzso In benchmark experiments on the zzso database, our method runs up to two orders of magnitude faster than previous zzso 

The presented zzso zzso expected running time makes it well suited for zzso zzso pattern matching in large sequence zzso zzso molecules containing several zzso zzso can be described by multiple zzso patterns and their matches are efficiently handled by a novel zzso zzso Beyond our zzso contributions, we provide with zzso a complete and robust zzso software solution for zzso search of zzso zzso zzso The zzso software is available at zzso
