zzso the diagonal entries of a zzso that is not directly accessible but only available as a linear operator in the form of a computer routine, is a common necessity in many zzso applications, especially in image reconstruction and statistical zzso Here, methods of statistical zzso are used to improve the accuracy or the zzso costs of zzso probing methods to estimate zzso zzso In particular, the generalized Wiener filter methodology, as developed within information field theory, is shown to significantly improve estimates based on only a few sampling zzso in cases in which some form of continuity of the solution can be zzso The strength, length scale, and precise functional form of the exploited zzso function of the zzso diagonal is determined from the zzso zzso The developed zzso is successfully applied to mock and real world zzso These performance tests show that, in situations where a zzso diagonal has to be calculated from only a small number of zzso expensive zzso a zzso by a factor of 2 to 10 is possible with the proposed zzso
