A hybrid magnetic bearing system was designed for a rotary zzso blood pump being developed to provide long-term circulatory support for heart failure zzso This design consists of two compact bearings to suspend the zzso in five zzso with single axis active zzso Permanent magnets are used to provide passive zzso support and electromagnets to maintain zzso stability of the zzso zzso of the passive zzso and active thrust magnetic bearing system were evaluated by the electromagnetic finite element zzso A zzso controller with force balance zzso was implemented for closed loop control of the magnetic thrust zzso The control position is continuously adjusted based on the electrical energy in the bearing zzso and thus passive magnetic forces carry zzso thrust loads to minimize the bearing zzso Performance of the magnetic bearing system with associated control zzso was evaluated at different operating zzso The bearing current was significantly reduced with the force balance control method and the power consumption was below zzso W under various thrust zzso The bearing parameters predicted by the analysis were validated by the experimental zzso
