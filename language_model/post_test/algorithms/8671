We have developed and tested several detectors of local zzso in zzso cardiac zzso the detectors are based on the frequency content of the zzso For this study, zzso regions with no local electrical activity were created with zzso in canine zzso so that the characteristics of zzso reflecting local zzso could be compared with those with only distant electrical zzso For each zzso representations of the original signal were created using the output of zzso zzso for each zzso the value of the maximum zzso was taken as a measurement of the frequency content of the zzso in that frequency zzso The content of each frequency band and the first zzso of the signal were tested as zzso between local and distant electrical zzso zzso of frequency bands were also tested using a zzso zzso zzso certain combinations provided better detection than any of the individual zzso or the first zzso The inclusion of zzso between 500 and 1000 zzso improved the detection performance, suggesting that sampling rates of 1000 samples per second or less may not be adequate for optimal zzso A detector based on zzso analysis of different frequency components of a signal may be more effective than zzso filtering in discriminating between local and distant electrical activity in the heart, especially when those components have very different zzso
