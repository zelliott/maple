zzso can be derived by sequential zzso of the exponential loss zzso It zzso the learning process by zzso zzso examples according to zzso zzso However, weights are often too sharply zzso so that zzso suffers from the zzso and zzso zzso a new boosting method that is a slight modification of zzso The loss function is defined by a mixture of the exponential loss and zzso error loss zzso As a result, the proposed method incorporates the effect of zzso into zzso The statistical significance of our method is discussed, and simulations are presented for zzso
