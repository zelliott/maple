Information processing and exchange between brain zzso are made through spike series sent by individual zzso in highly irregular zzso zzso zzso in cell zzso proposed as a network language for internal neural zzso still has little experimental zzso We use a novel technique to extract zzso local field zzso zzso in the zzso to explore the ongoing zzso structure of a single zzso zzso the zzso zzso pathway, and its contribution to the spontaneous output of zzso units in zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso are composed of a regular succession of zzso zzso packages initiated by spontaneous clustered firing of zzso zzso cells to which individual units contribute zzso A fraction of these packages readily induce firing of zzso zzso cells and zzso the so-called zzso zzso revealing the zzso origin in the output code of single zzso zzso The output of zzso of zzso zzso zzso contains up to zzso of such zzso Our results suggest a zzso internal operation of the zzso region based on sequential zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso whose activity partly gets in the output code at the next zzso We conclude that zzso output may directly reflect the activity of specific ensembles of zzso zzso Thus, the fine zzso structure of zzso zzso as an accurate zzso of the activity of a zzso population, is useful in searching for hidden zzso code in irregular spikes series of individual zzso and zzso
