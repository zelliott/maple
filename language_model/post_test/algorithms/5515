While zzso neural networks have been widely accepted as effective tools for solving zzso problems, the issue of finding the best network architecture remains zzso particularly so in real-world problem zzso We address this issue in the context of credit card zzso where it is important to not only find a neural network with good zzso performance but also one that zzso a clear explanation of how it produces its zzso We show that minimal neural networks with as few as one hidden unit provide good zzso zzso while having the added advantage of making it easier to generate concise and comprehensible zzso rules for the zzso To further reduce model size, a novel approach is suggested in which network connections from the input units to this hidden unit are removed by a very straightaway pruning zzso In terms of zzso zzso both the minimized neural networks and the rule sets generated from them are shown to compare favorably with other neural network based zzso The rules generated from the minimized neural networks are concise and thus easier to validate in a real-life zzso
