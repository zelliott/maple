The zzso response of bovine zzso was characterized using in zzso inflation zzso experiments combined with zzso deformation mapping via digital image zzso A complex fixture zzso to the zzso zzso was developed to hold the attached zzso rigid while allowing deformation only in the zzso A statistical set of experiments was performed for a pressure range of zzso zzso zzso zzso representing nominal bovine zzso pressure zzso to acute glaucoma zzso A broader pressure range of zzso zzso zzso zzso was also examined to characterize the zzso finite deformation behavior of the zzso zzso showed that for pressures near and above zzso the majority of the deformation was localized in the zzso and peripheral regions, which left the central cornea largely zzso This observation was consistent with the known preferred zzso alignment of collagen zzso outside of the central zzso In general, the inflation experiments observed zzso behavior in the form of zzso zzso in the zzso response of the zzso of the zzso creep in the zzso deformation at a constant inflation pressure, and relaxation in the pressure response at a constant inflation zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso pressure range produced small zzso zzso and a nearly linear zzso response, which suggests that for zzso pressure zzso the cornea can be zzso as a linear zzso or linear zzso zzso
