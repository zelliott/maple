We consider the design of zzso and zzso zzso trials in which the probability of response is a zzso function of the zzso zzso of the parameters of the zzso at the time of planning the trial is represented by a zzso prior zzso zzso are presented for determining a design that approximately zzso a measure of the accuracy of zzso averaged over the prior zzso Changes in design due to uncertainty of zzso values are described as well as the changes in sample size required to produce a specified zzso In zzso trials, the initial stage is planned as if it were the only zzso For succeeding zzso the initial zzso prior distribution is updated using outcomes at the previous zzso At each such stage, the design zzso a chosen criterion averaged over the updated prior zzso The effectiveness of this methodology is evaluated by comparing the operating characteristics of zzso designs with those of zzso zzso
