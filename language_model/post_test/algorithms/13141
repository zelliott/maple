zzso zzso plate zzso cells are known to perform zzso motion zzso It is assumed that the shape of these zzso and in particular the shape of the zzso of VS cells, is responsible for this type of zzso We employed an inverse approach to investigate the zzso relationship underlying zzso motion integration in VS zzso In the inverse approach detailed, model zzso are zzso to perform a zzso zzso here, zzso motion zzso We embedded the model zzso to be zzso in a biologically plausible model of fly motion detection to provide realistic zzso and subsequently zzso model zzso with and without active zzso zzso zzso zzso along their zzso to perform this zzso We found that both passive and active zzso model zzso perform well as zzso motion zzso In addition, all zzso zzso share the same blueprint as real VS zzso In addition, we also found a recurring blueprint for the distribution of zzso and zzso in the active zzso Moreover, we demonstrate how this zzso and distribution of zzso contribute to zzso motion zzso As such, by using the inverse approach we can predict the still unknown distribution of zzso and zzso and their role in motion integration in VS zzso
