zzso the patterns and processes of diversification of life in the planet is a key challenge of zzso The Tree of Life represents such diversification processes through the evolutionary relationships among the different zzso and can be extended down to zzso zzso Here we examine the zzso properties of a large set of zzso and zzso zzso and show that the branching patterns follow zzso rules zzso across the different levels in the Tree of Life, all significantly departing from those expected from the standard zzso zzso The finding of zzso universal patterns of zzso differentiation suggests that similar evolutionary forces drive diversification across the broad range of zzso from zzso to zzso zzso shaping the diversity of life on the zzso
