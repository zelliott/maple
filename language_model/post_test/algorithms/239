A feasibility study of literature mining is conducted on drug zzso zzso zzso data with a sequential mining zzso zzso an entity template library is built to retrieve zzso relevant zzso Then a set of tagging and extraction rules are applied to retrieve zzso data from the article zzso To estimate the zzso zzso zzso mean and zzso zzso a linear mixed zzso model and an zzso zzso are developed to describe the probability zzso of zzso zzso Finally, a zzso procedure is developed to ascertain zzso mining zzso Using this approach to mine zzso zzso zzso data, an zzso precision rate and zzso recall rate are zzso with an zzso It greatly zzso a conventional data mining approach zzso zzso zzso which has an zzso of zzso Further investigate on 7 more drugs reveals comparable performances of our sequential mining zzso
