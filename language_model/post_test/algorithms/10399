This paper presents two novel neural networks based on zzso in the context of zzso and sequence zzso The zzso neural network employs modal learning that is a combination of two zzso fuzzy AND learning zzso and Learning zzso zzso zzso We present the zzso zzso map zzso and the zzso zzso neural network zzso The zzso uses the standard zzso architecture, where a layer of input zzso connects to the zzso map layer and the weight update consists of either snap zzso of input and zzso or drift zzso as in zzso The zzso uses a simple zzso network zzso architecture, with the hidden layer values copied back to the input zzso A form of reinforcement learning is deployed in which the mode is swapped between the snap and drift when performance zzso and in which adaptation is zzso zzso the probability of a zzso being adapted is reduced as performance zzso The zzso are evaluated on several well known data sets, and it is found that these exhibit effective learning that is faster than alternative neural network zzso
