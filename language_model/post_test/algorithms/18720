zzso and chemical conversion processes that convert in energy the sewage zzso pasty waste and other zzso waste are increasingly common, for economic and ecological zzso zzso bed combustion is currently one of the most promising methods of energy conversion, since it burns biomass very zzso and produces only very small quantities of zzso and nitrogen zzso The hazards associated with biomass combustion processes are fire, explosion and poisoning from the combustion gases zzso zzso The risk analysis presented in this paper uses the zzso methodology, applied to a zzso pilot scheme zzso a zzso column, a conventional zzso two natural gas zzso and a continuous supply of zzso The methodology uses a generic approach, with an initial zzso stage where hazard sources are identified, scenarios for zzso events are recognized and ranked using a grid of zzso and safety barriers zzso A microscopic stage then analyzes in detail the major risks identified during the first zzso This analysis may use various different tools, such as zzso zzso zzso our analysis is based on zzso Using zzso we were able to identify five zzso the reactor zzso bed and zzso the fuel and biomass supply lines, the operator and the zzso When we drew up scenarios based on these zzso we found that malfunction of the gas supply zzso was a common trigger in many zzso Our subsequent microscopic analysis, therefore, focused on the zzso looking at the ways they failed, and at the effects and zzso of those failures zzso We were, thus, able to identify a number of critical factors such as the incoming gas lines and the ignition zzso
