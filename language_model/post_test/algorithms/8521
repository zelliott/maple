The zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso zzso channel bears two zzso zzso zzso and zzso that control its zzso zzso Exactly how these zzso control gating is zzso To address this issue, we examined channels with a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso using the patch clamp zzso zzso zzso have an zzso dependence zzso approximate 60 zzso and opening rate at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso similar to wild type zzso approximate 97 zzso approximately zzso zzso However, zzso closing rate at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is faster than that of wild type zzso zzso zzso suggesting involvement of zzso in zzso zzso zzso of closing in wild type by zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso is markedly diminished in zzso zzso due to reduction in zzso apparent zzso and acceleration of its apparent zzso zzso zzso and approximately zzso zzso Since the delay of closing by zzso is thought to occur via zzso zzso effect on the zzso zzso zzso was zzso In sharp contrast to zzso zzso single zzso exhibit reduced opening zzso zzso zzso and closing zzso zzso zzso rates at zzso zzso suggesting a role for zzso in both opening and zzso At zzso zzso zzso double zzso close approximately zzso faster zzso zzso zzso than zzso but open with a similar rate zzso zzso zzso indicating an effect of zzso on zzso zzso In zzso our results reveal that both of zzso functionally zzso zzso participate in zzso zzso which provides important constraints for zzso gating zzso
