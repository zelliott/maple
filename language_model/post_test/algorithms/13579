During zzso a zzso organization has been previously demonstrated with the head as a stabilized platform and gaze anticipating the horizontal direction of the zzso However, the quantitative assessment of the anticipatory sequence from gaze to trajectory and body segments has not been zzso The present paper provides a detailed investigation into the spatial and zzso anticipatory relationships among the direction of gaze and body segments during zzso Participants had to walk along several mentally simulated complex zzso without any visual cues indicating the trajectory to zzso The trajectory shapes were presented to the participants on a sheet of zzso Our study includes an analysis of the relationships between horizontal gaze anticipatory behavior direction and the upcoming changes in the zzso Our findings confirm the zzso 1) The zzso ordered organization of gaze and body segment zzso during complex zzso and free zzso zzso direction anticipates the head orientation, and head orientation anticipates zzso of the other body zzso 2) The influence of the zzso of the trajectory and constraints of the tasks on the zzso and spatial relationships between gaze and the body segments: Increased zzso resulted in increased time and spatial zzso 3) A different sequence of gaze movements at inflection points where gaze plans a much later segment of the zzso
