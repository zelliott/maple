An otherwise dark magnetic zzso resonance in a zzso zzso can be excited zzso with a zzso profile once the zzso environment for this zzso is broken with respect to the polarized zzso direction of incident zzso When this zzso induced narrow resonance zzso with a broad zzso resonance at an identical frequency regime, the zzso analogue of zzso transparency zzso window can be zzso We demonstrate that this zzso condition can be introduced zzso as well as zzso either zzso or zzso which indicates the zzso zzso between different resonant modes is not responsible for the dark mode zzso Thus, this result should contribute to the physical understanding on zzso zzso zzso for zzso phenomenon in zzso zzso
