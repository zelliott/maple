The zzso zzso for Atmospheric zzso zzso instrument has been developed as a result of the collaboration between zzso zzso and Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and the Environment zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso - 950 zzso and it is installed at the Observatory of the zzso in zzso since April zzso A brief description of the instrument is given, highlighting the technological innovations with respect to the previous version of similar zzso The need for such zzso automatically taken on a routine basis in zzso European regions, specifically in zzso has encouraged the development and installation of the equipment and constitutes a major driving force for the present zzso The main features and some improvements introduced in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso The results obtained applying zzso methodology to the zzso zzso zzso of diffused spectral sky radiation are presented in terms of zzso and seasonal variations of nitrogen dioxide zzso and ozone zzso zzso confirms the typical seasonal cycle reaching the maximum of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules zzso for the sunset values zzso during the summer season, and the minimum of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules zzso for the sunrise values zzso in zzso zzso presents the maximum total column of zzso zzso 5) zzso Unit zzso in the spring season and the minimum of zzso zzso 3) zzso during the fall zzso The huge daily variations of the zzso total column during the spring season are analyzed and zzso The zzso results obtained for zzso and zzso column contents are compared with data from zzso equipment zzso - Global zzso Monitoring zzso zzso - zzso Imaging zzso zzso for Atmospheric zzso zzso - Total zzso Monitoring zzso and it is shown that the two data sets are in good zzso The correlation zzso for the comparison of the zzso data for zzso is of zzso
