The objective of this report is to provide a practical and improved method for zzso zzso resonance energy transfer distance measurement error due to unknown angles in the zzso orientation factor based on zzso zzso zzso We improve on the method of Dale et zzso (1979), which has minor mistakes and is frequently interpreted in overly optimistic ways in the zzso To facilitate proper zzso intensity zzso we also evaluated instrument parameters that could impact the zzso The apparent zzso intensity of zzso samples depends on the sample zzso zzso zzso zzso and optical zzso We separate parameters of the sample, and those of the zzso zzso zzso source and detector in the equations describing results of zzso and polarized zzso intensity zzso This approach greatly zzso calculations compared with the more universal method of zzso zzso We provide a full zzso method for calculating the zzso resonance energy transfer distance error and present a graph describing distance error in the simplest zzso
