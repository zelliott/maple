The difficulty of reasoning tasks depends on their zzso complexity, which increases with the number of relations that must be considered simultaneously to make an zzso and on the number of irrelevant items that must be zzso The authors examined the ability of younger and older adults to integrate multiple relations and inhibit irrelevant zzso Young adults performed well at all but the highest level of zzso complexity, whereas older adults performed poorly even at a medium level of zzso complexity, especially when irrelevant information was zzso zzso based on a zzso model of zzso reasoning, Learning and zzso with zzso and zzso zzso suggest that the observed decline in reasoning performance may be explained by a decline in attention and zzso functions in older zzso
