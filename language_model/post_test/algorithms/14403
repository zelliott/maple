The zzso Tree zzso zzso zzso zzso Model zzso 2007) allows to organize large molecular data sets by arranging sets of molecules into a unique tree hierarchy based on their zzso with scaffolds forming leaf zzso of such zzso The hierarchy is created by zzso removal of rings from more complex scaffolds using chemically meaningful set of rules, until a single, root ring is zzso The zzso is zzso data set independent, and scales zzso with the number of compounds included in the data zzso In this review we zzso the basic principles of the zzso Tree methodology and review its applications, which appeared in recent medicinal chemistry literature, including the use of zzso Trees for zzso of large chemical data sets, compound zzso and the identification of novel zzso zzso zzso to several computer programs, including also free tools available on the Internet, allowing to perform zzso and zzso of molecules based on their scaffolds are also zzso
