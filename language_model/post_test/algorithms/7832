In this paper, we present an inverse zzso method to determining human shoulder joint motion zzso relationship based on experimental data in the zzso This work focuses on transferring zzso zzso equations into a relationship based on the zzso zzso zzso We use zzso inverse zzso to achieve the zzso For a specific posture, we can choose points on zzso zzso and zzso and represent the zzso positions based on zzso angles or zzso zzso For both zzso and zzso systems, the zzso have the same Cartesian zzso zzso these equations related to zzso positions yields zzso joint angles for that zzso The new joint motion zzso relationship is obtained by zzso and zzso fitting of the zzso joint angles for all different zzso
