One of the most common combinations for the organic phase of dental zzso materials is zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, this zzso has some zzso such as volume shrinkage during cure and lack of complete zzso zzso If the properties of this system are to be improved, an attempt must be made to understand the underlying zzso of the zzso This work examines the effects of light intensity, temperature, and composition on the zzso behavior of zzso zzso Using differential scanning zzso we monitored the rates of zzso for various experimental zzso The zzso zzso behaved similarly to other zzso systems and exhibited zzso zzso It was found that the maximum rate of zzso was significantly affected by the intensity of the light, and the temperature of the zzso affected the conversion at which the maximum rate zzso When the composition of the mixture was zzso it was discovered that the zzso of the system played a significant role in the zzso rate and the onset of zzso zzso zzso which contained from 50 zzso to 75 zzso zzso displayed the highest maximum zzso This feature suggests that zzso is an excellent zzso since it increases the mobility of the reacting zzso however, the high zzso is due to the presence of zzso zzso based on compositional zzso we conclude that the zzso portion of the mixture largely controls the zzso mechanisms and zzso
