Although it is known that three-dimensional structure is well zzso during the evolutionary development of zzso there have been few studies that consider other parameters apart from divergence of the zzso zzso In this study, we align the structures of 90 pairs of zzso proteins having sequence identities ranging from 5 to zzso Their structures are compared as a function of sequence identity, including not only consideration of C alpha coordinates but also accessibility, zzso numbers, secondary structure, and zzso zzso We discuss how these properties change as the sequences become less zzso This will be of practical use in zzso zzso especially for modeling very zzso related or analogous zzso We also consider how the average size and number of insertions and deletions vary as sequences zzso This study presents further quantitative evidence that structure is remarkably well zzso in detail, as well as at the zzso level, even when the sequences do not show similarity that is significant zzso
