We develop a zzso zzso analysis method for broadband zzso zzso 650 to 1000 zzso zzso zzso Application of this method to zzso of zzso breast tissue reveals specific cancer zzso In this method, zzso variations in molecular composition are removed by using the normal tissue as an internal zzso The effects of concentration differences of the four major tissue zzso zzso zzso water, and bulk zzso between the tumor and normal tissue are accounted for to reveal small spectral components unique to zzso From a pilot study of 15 cancer patients, we find these spectral components to be characterized by specific zzso zzso zzso Based on the spectral regions of zzso at about zzso zzso and zzso zzso we identify these zzso with changes in state or addition of zzso and/or zzso To zzso spectral variation in the zzso bands, we construct the specific tumor component zzso zzso The zzso index identifies regions of the breast with zzso
