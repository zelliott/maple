A method that combines the means of zzso Kalman filter zzso with the technique of zzso zzso zzso is introduced for zzso unknown parameters of zzso when only a heavily zzso time series of active potential is zzso Compared with other zzso methods, this approach uses the state variables estimated by zzso instead of the measured data to drive the auxiliary zzso The zzso approach supplies a systematic and zzso procedure for zzso parameters from time series; however, it is only robust against weak noise of zzso so the zzso is employed to estimate state variables which are used by the zzso method to estimate all unknown parameters of zzso zzso It is found out that the zzso accuracy of this combined method is much higher than only using zzso or zzso method when the data of measurement were heavily noise zzso
