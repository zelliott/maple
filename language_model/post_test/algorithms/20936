zzso the growth in numbers and spatial spread of a population over time, is a fundamental process in zzso zzso and businesses zzso vast sums to prevent and control zzso of zzso and zzso and to promote zzso of endangered species and biological control zzso Many mathematical models of biological zzso use zzso zzso equations to describe the growth and zzso processes and to predict the speed of invasion zzso Linear models have received less attention, perhaps because they are difficult to simulate for large zzso In this paper, we use the zzso method, alias the method of zzso zzso to derive zzso approximations for the solutions of linear zzso zzso We work through five examples, for zzso zzso and uniform zzso kernels in one dimension and for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso kernels in two zzso Our approximations are extremely close to the exact solutions, even for intermediate zzso We also employ an empirical zzso approximation to predict zzso using zzso zzso We use our approximations to examine the effects of censored zzso data on estimates of invasion speed and population zzso
