zzso zzso of a pulmonary zzso is an important and active area of research in medical image zzso Although many zzso have been reported in literature for this problem, those that are zzso to various density types have not been available until zzso In this paper, we propose a new zzso that is zzso to solid, zzso and zzso types and zzso zzso and zzso zzso First, the zzso separates lung zzso and zzso denser anatomical structures with coupled competition and diffusion zzso The technique tends to derive a zzso more homogeneous foreground map than an zzso zzso based zzso Second, it locates the core of a zzso in a manner that is zzso to zzso types using a transformation applied on the zzso distance transform of the zzso Third, it zzso the zzso from attached structures by a region growing on the zzso distance map followed by a procedure to delineate the surface of the zzso based on the patterns of the region growing and distance zzso Finally, convex zzso of the zzso surface intersected with the foreground constitutes the final zzso The performance of the technique is evaluated with two Lung Imaging Database zzso zzso data sets with 23 and 82 zzso each, and another data set with 820 zzso with manual diameter zzso The experiments show that the zzso is highly reliable in zzso zzso of various types in a zzso efficient zzso
