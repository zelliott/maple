zzso zzso zzso have entered the environment in North America as zzso technical zzso Most methods used for the determination of total zzso levels in environmental samples visually match patterns of sample zzso to those in zzso zzso Concern over the accuracy of zzso zzso on zzso modified samples coupled with zzso in zzso techniques have led to zzso zzso zzso In this study, the zzso data from 27 tissue samples determined by an zzso method and a full zzso method were compared in terms of total zzso concentration to assess the reliability of this zzso technique for total zzso zzso Our data show a strong correlation between the sum of zzso and the total zzso obtained from the full zzso zzso We also developed a model using the compositional data from three zzso zzso zzso and zzso to determine the amount of compositional zzso from original zzso patterns in environmental zzso Full zzso data, from a variety of tissue types and zzso levels, examined using this method showed that compositional modification from original zzso patterns increases with zzso level, with the greatest modification observed in seal and killer whale zzso This result agrees both with expectation and with what has been found in other zzso Such techniques, which connect zzso zzso data to zzso contamination, may prove useful to investigations into environmental and zzso fate and transfer zzso
