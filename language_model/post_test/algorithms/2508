Our main objective was to assess whether a home-based program supervised by home helpers zzso during their normal working hours can prevent excessive zzso zzso maximum walking time and distance) and preserve functional status in elderly people at risk for frailty or disability and using domestic zzso 

A zzso open label, zzso trial with two groups called zzso and zzso 

In the homes of study zzso 

The participants were all over 78 years old, lived independently at home, and received the visits of zzso at least once a zzso 

The intervention combined a self-administered exercise program, with 10 g zzso supplementation under the supervision of zzso 

Main outcome measures included physical activity (the zzso zzso functional tests, nutritional and autonomy scores, and compliance zzso or more was considered zzso zzso methods were used for comparisons between the two zzso A linear zzso model was fitted to assess the effect of the intervention on the relative variation of zzso adjusted for unbalanced baseline zzso 

One hundred and two persons zzso zzso control zzso with a median age of 85 years were zzso Their median zzso of Daily Living and zzso zzso of Daily Living zzso scores were 6 and 7 zzso zzso zzso were good zzso for both zzso The maximum walking time remained stable while decreasing by zzso in the control group zzso and fewer participants had a worsened zzso score in the prevention group zzso The baseline zzso zzso was significantly associated with good compliance to the prevention program zzso In good zzso maximum walking distance and maximum walking time increased by zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso 

This study confirms the feasibility of a prevention program supervised by zzso and some benefit from the intervention and identifies zzso for better zzso It will help in the design of prevention trials for elderly people at risk for zzso
