zzso the zzso interaction between zzso is very important for better understanding the functional connectivity in zzso zzso We propose a method called zzso zzso transfer zzso zzso to evaluate the zzso zzso interaction between spike trains, which zzso the fraction of zzso information in a zzso that has presented in another zzso The performance of this method is evaluated with the spike trains generated by an zzso zzso zzso zzso show that the zzso method can effectively estimate the zzso interaction between two zzso without influence of data zzso Considering both the precision of time delay estimated and the zzso of information flow estimated against zzso firing rate, the zzso method is superior to other information zzso method including zzso transfer zzso symbolic transfer zzso and zzso conditional mutual zzso To test the performance of zzso on analyzing simulated zzso realistic zzso an zzso cortical network that based on the zzso model is zzso It is found that the zzso method is able to characterize mutual interactions and identify zzso causality in a network of three zzso zzso We conclude that the proposed method can obtain more reliable comparison of interactions between different pairs of zzso and is a promising tool to uncover more details on the neural zzso
