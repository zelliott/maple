To assess the utility of advanced tests performed before surgery on patients who needed emergent abdominal operations, and to assess the outcomes of these patients relative to their zzso 

Patients with a potential abdominal catastrophe may have various presentations, contributing to the difficulty of the decision about whether an operation is zzso Advanced tests can be valuable, but the use of these zzso should be appropriate to the clinical status of the patient so that treatment is not zzso The role of these tools in the evaluation of the patient who may need an emergent abdominal operation is less well zzso 

Data were reviewed on adult patients undergoing emergent abdominal zzso zzso criteria included patients who had an emergent abdominal operation, defined as one performed for presumed gastrointestinal zzso zzso or zzso within 6 hours of admission or surgical zzso Advanced tests were those that were time-consuming or invasive or required scheduling with other departments so that the zzso ratio of these tests could be zzso A useful test was one that provided information that contributed to a change in the patient's zzso 

During a zzso period, 300 consecutive adult patients zzso zzso 66 zzso 53 zzso and 23 zzso underwent emergent zzso zzso Overall, the death rate was zzso Advanced zzso tests were performed in 135 zzso of the 300 patients, and 40 of these patients had delayed zzso zzso zzso of bleeding sites was accomplished in zzso of patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and zzso of patients with lower gastrointestinal zzso 

Most patients in need of emergent abdominal operations should not undergo advanced zzso The primary role of advanced tests in these patients is in the zzso of a bleeding zzso With the exception of patients who present with zzso advanced tests frequently cause a delay in zzso
