This paper addresses the problem of detecting and zzso zzso changes in evoked zzso zzso zzso have been widely used to zzso neurological system zzso zzso and zzso changes in zzso may indicate impending neurological zzso Traditional time averaging and correlation methods for zzso zzso zzso are inefficient under low zzso ratio zzso and/or strong periodic interference zzso This paper proposes an zzso phase spectral time delay zzso method to detect and estimate the zzso zzso changes when both the zzso and the zzso ratio zzso are zzso A theoretical analysis and computer simulation demonstrate that the proposed method can track the zzso zzso changes effectively and accurately when both the zzso and the zzso are as low as -5 zzso The method is also suitable for real time detection and zzso of the zzso zzso
