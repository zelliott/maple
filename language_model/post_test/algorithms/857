To test the feasibility of the zzso zzso zzso method for zzso zzso measurement of absolute left zzso zzso volume and to validate the method by comparison with zzso zzso 

Prospective clinical feasibility and validation study in a cardiac zzso laboratory in a university zzso 

Ten patients scheduled for zzso studies ( zzso zzso zzso coronary zzso ( zzso and zzso and zzso cardiac zzso ( zzso were enrolled in the feasibility zzso Twenty patients scheduled for diagnostic zzso and zzso cardiac zzso were included in the validation zzso The latter were studied at baseline and during right zzso pacing 30 zzso above zzso 

In the feasibility study satisfactory zzso volume signals were obtained by zzso in eight of ten zzso In the validation study zzso factors zzso and zzso for zzso were obtained by zzso and zzso saline zzso to yield absolute zzso zzso zzso indicate a good linear correlation with zzso volume ( zzso with an intercept of zzso zzso not significantly different from 0 and slope of zzso Mean zzso factors alpha and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso method provides zzso and continuous zzso volume signals in patients in a relatively zzso zzso zzso yields absolute zzso volumes with a good linear correlation in comparison to zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to be a promising methodology for monitoring absolute zzso volume in the zzso
