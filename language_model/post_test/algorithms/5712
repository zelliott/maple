Clinical diagnosis of heart disease might be substantially supported by automated zzso of the zzso surface in three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso Because of the poor zzso contrast between blood and zzso tissue in some regions and the inherent zzso noise, automated analysis of these images is zzso A zzso knowledge on the shape of the heart cannot always be relied on, zzso in children with zzso heart disease, zzso should be based on the echo features zzso The objective of this study was to investigate the merit of using zzso zzso of zzso zzso data for automated zzso of 3-D zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values were determined locally from the zzso using an zzso 3-D zzso zzso values as well as a combination of zzso values and zzso zzso zzso zzso were used as an zzso external force in a zzso model approach to segment the zzso surface and were tested against manually segmented zzso zzso on 3-D full volume images zzso zzso of 10 healthy children demonstrate that zzso values derived from the zzso signal yield a useful zzso to distinguish between blood and zzso in regions with low zzso contrast and incorporation of zzso improves the zzso results zzso Further investigation of the zzso over the whole cardiac cycle is required to exploit the full benefit of it for automated zzso
