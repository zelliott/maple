zzso tiles, used in body zzso systems, are currently inspected visually zzso using an X-ray technique that is both time consuming and very zzso The aim of this research is to develop a methodology to zzso locate and zzso various manufacturing defects in zzso zzso Silicon Carbide zzso ceramic tiles, using an zzso sensing zzso zzso such as free zzso zzso silicon zzso material and conventional zzso are often difficult to detect using conventional zzso An alternative inspection system was developed to detect defects in ceramic components using an zzso zzso Network zzso based signal processing zzso The inspection methodology proposed focuses on zzso of signals, zzso zzso decomposition, feature extraction and zzso of the signals for zzso zzso This research contributes to developing an zzso inspection system that would be far more cost effective than present methods and, moreover, assist manufacturers in checking the location of high density areas, defects and enable real time quality control, including the zzso of zzso zzso
