The prediction of protein function from structure is becoming of growing importance in the age of structural zzso We have focused on the problem of identifying sites of potential zzso zzso inhibitor interactions on the surface of proteins of known zzso Given that there is no sequence conservation within zzso zzso from different inhibitor families we first compare representative zzso to all fragments of equal length among proteins of known structure by calculating zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso below a certain threshold zzso are removed if zzso have zzso zzso appreciably lower than those observed in the search zzso These remaining hits are further filtered to remove those occurring largely within secondary structure zzso zzso functional significance is restricted further by considering only zzso protein zzso Also a test is performed to see if the loop can dock into the binding site of the zzso zzso zzso without unacceptable zzso zzso By comparing different zzso loop structures to the protein structure database we show that the method was able to detect previously known zzso In addition, we discuss potentially new zzso loop structures found in zzso zzso zzso viral zzso zzso and other zzso We discuss the possible functional significance of several of the examples zzso
