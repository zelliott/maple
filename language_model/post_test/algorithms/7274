zzso imaging data from the Human zzso Project zzso provides a great opportunity to map the whole brain white matter connectivity to unprecedented resolution in zzso In this paper we develop a novel method for accurately reconstruct fiber orientation distribution from cutting-edge diffusion data by solving the zzso zzso problem as a constrained convex zzso zzso With a set of zzso selected constraints, our method allows the use of high order zzso zzso to reliably resolve crossing fibers with small separation zzso In our experiments, we demonstrate on simulated data that our zzso zzso a popular zzso zzso method in resolving fiber zzso We also successfully applied our method to the zzso and diffusion spectrum imaging zzso data from zzso to demonstrate its ability in using state-of-the-art diffusion data to study complicated fiber zzso
