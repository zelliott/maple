In the European Union zzso Project on zzso zzso the history and physical examination items were to be used for the zzso working diagnosis zzso and zzso others, for the development of the real life data electronic diagnostic zzso zzso Trial delivers diagnosis probabilities based on zzso zzso zzso completed by Trial Algorithm zzso We wanted to compare the diagnostic zzso zzso and Trial probabilities as a percentage of the final diagnosis zzso in a patient zzso in 3 Dutch zzso 

The inclusion criteria for both zzso and Trial were age zzso or zzso 16 and zzso zzso or zzso 20 zzso zzso data gathering took place at the bedside on a zzso with (among other zzso 79 questions on history and physical examination as well as the diagnosis levels for the zzso (1 alternative zzso and zzso (17 disease categories, zzso Trial was developed on the data of zzso zzso patients and its zzso zzso has the same zzso It zzso the probability of each diagnosis of the 17 zzso as a percentage, as each significant finding is encountered zzso zzso zzso It can simultaneously calculate the resemblance of the patient's signs and symptoms to each disease zzso zzso zzso zzso and to any subset of a zzso Any probability is further tested for zzso using zzso a subset of zzso delivering zzso zzso and zzso The Trial test patients came from 3 zzso a zzso Dutch Patients Random Sample zzso zzso zzso zzso internal zzso and 2 independent zzso prospective P zzso zzso zzso and retrospective R zzso zzso zzso zzso 416 zzso 

The zzso of zzso and Trial showed no differences between the databases, and the results are therefore pooled zzso zzso zzso With testing on the highest probability found, the zzso accuracy was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The true zzso were mentioned (at any zzso in the zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso of the zzso Testing only patients whose zzso was zzso or whose data were without zzso did not improve zzso Testing on probability zzso zzso improved zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso 

The zzso Working Diagnosis accuracy was approximately zzso and did not greatly improve after zzso The Trial zzso and zzso zzso were only slightly less than the zzso For well-trained physicians, Trial strengthens the zzso judgment, and for those less trained (or those to be zzso it delivers a zzso diagnostic disease probability at nearly consultant zzso
