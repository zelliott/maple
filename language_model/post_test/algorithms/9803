Power analysis is critical in research zzso This study discusses a zzso approach utilizing the likelihood ratio test to estimate the power of growth curve zzso The power zzso is implemented through a set of zzso zzso The application of the zzso zzso is demonstrated through several examples, including missing data and zzso growth trajectory zzso The results of the examples indicate that the power of growth curve analysis increases with the increase of sample sizes, effect sizes, and numbers of measurement zzso In addition, missing data can reduce zzso The zzso zzso can be modified to accommodate more complex power analysis for both linear and zzso growth curve zzso
