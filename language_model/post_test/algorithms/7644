Transit time broadening is a major limitation in zzso wave zzso zzso especially when the angle between the flow direction and the ultrasound beam is zzso The associated loss in frequency resolution may give severe zzso of blood zzso and finer details in the spectral display are zzso By using plane wave transmissions and parallel receive zzso multiple zzso zzso signals can be acquired simultaneously in a zzso zzso This enables tracking of the moving blood zzso over a longer spatial distance to limit transit time zzso In this work, the new method was tested using in zzso ultrasound recordings from a flow zzso and in zzso recordings from a human carotid zzso The resulting zzso tracking zzso zzso showed significantly reduced spectral broadening compared with zzso zzso generated by Welch's zzso The reduction in spectral broadening was zzso when the zzso was zzso zzso and the zzso angle was zzso A signal model was derived and the expected zzso power zzso were zzso showing good agreement with experimental zzso zzso spectral resolution was shown for zzso angles between zzso and zzso
