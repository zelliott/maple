When an acoustic pulse interacts with an zzso attenuating zzso the zzso signals exhibit random fluctuations which are correlated with the physical properties of the zzso This paper proposes a robust model for characterizing the statistical nature of these zzso zzso This model takes into account zzso zzso zzso varying media statistics, arbitrary beam zzso and arbitrary pulse zzso Based on this model, statistical zzso schemes are proposed for zzso both the zzso zzso and zzso number density of the zzso Using appropriate simplifying zzso it is shown that this model is consistent with zzso zzso zzso currently used for zzso tissue zzso A statistical approach for zzso the number density of zzso is described and its theoretical performance is zzso The zzso for zzso the zzso number density incorporates zzso of both the statistical moments of the zzso signals and the point spread function of the acoustic zzso The number density zzso has been applied to simulated zzso zzso obtained from zzso zzso with known number zzso and in zzso zzso zzso There is an excellent agreement between zzso zzso and experimental zzso The application of this technique to zzso tissue characterization is also zzso
