A novel image fusion zzso based on zzso empirical mode decomposition zzso applied to zzso color microscopic images is proposed in this zzso The fusion scheme is implemented in zzso color model, aiming at achieving a balanced result between local feature enhancement and global zzso zzso In the proposed algorithm, image decomposition is performed on zzso component by zzso which can perform fully two-dimensional decomposition zzso without using a zzso zzso Upon fusion of each zzso zzso the local significance principle fusion rule is zzso When fusing the zzso zzso the principal component analysis method is zzso Thanks to the superior quality of zzso in zzso salient features, the proposed zzso can gain better fusion results not only in aspect of zzso information extraction but also in performance of blur zzso Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed zzso zzso the popular fusion zzso based on zzso zzso The usage of different color models for realization of the proposed zzso is also discussed, and zzso color model is proved to be more zzso
