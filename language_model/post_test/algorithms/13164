A zzso homogeneous irreversible reaction of the kind zzso is simulated in a plane channel as a base example of zzso transport processes taking place at the zzso within porous and/or fractured zzso The zzso study explores the way zzso processes embedded in zzso quantities such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso numbers zzso to zzso zzso describing effective system zzso The zzso evolution of the zzso zzso is obtained through a zzso zzso method which has been specifically tailored to the considered zzso Key results include a complete documentation of the process evolution for a wide range of zzso and zzso in terms of the global reaction rate, zzso distribution of zzso and local mixing features leading to characterization of effective reaction and zzso zzso governing a zzso zzso model of the zzso The zzso of previously presented theoretical analyses concerning zzso of zzso zzso zzso is zzso The work zzso the dependence of the effective zzso and zzso parameters on the zzso mixing and zzso species zzso Our results identify the role played by Da and zzso on the occurrence of incomplete mixing of zzso which affects the features of the zzso transport zzso
