We present a zzso zzso optical zzso zzso zzso system that is capable of acquiring two-dimensional images of living tissue in a single zzso By using line zzso of the sample in combination with a two-dimensional imaging zzso zzso depth scans are performed simultaneously on a zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate an easy and flexible real-time zzso technique for zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging that is compatible with both two-dimensional as well as zzso zzso By implementing a zzso imbalance between reference and sample arms of the zzso we eliminate the zzso signal through zzso zzso compensation, effectively increasing the useful depth range by a factor of zzso The system allows us to record zzso zzso zzso zzso images at 5 zzso depth resolution in zzso zzso Data zzso requires only 4 zzso We demonstrate the capability of our system by imaging the anterior chamber of a mouse eye in zzso as well as human skin in zzso
