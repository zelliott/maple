The development of new diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease zzso requires new in zzso markers reflecting early pathological changes in the brain of zzso zzso resonance zzso zzso has been shown to provide useful information about the zzso changes occurring in zzso brain in zzso The development of numerous transgenic mouse models of zzso has facilitated the evaluation of early zzso allowing researchers to perform zzso studies starting before the onset of the zzso In addition, the recent development of zzso animal scanners enables the measurement of brain zzso that cannot be reliably zzso at lower magnetic zzso In this report, we studied a new transgenic mouse model of zzso the zzso model, by in zzso zzso and zzso MR zzso This model, which is characterized by an zzso and a robust zzso pathology, developed changes in the zzso profile, which are typical in the human disease, zzso an increase in zzso and a decrease in zzso zzso as early as in the 40th week of zzso In addition, a significant decrease in the zzso concentration was observed in transgenic mice at this age compared to zzso The zzso rate constant of the zzso zzso reaction as well as relative zzso of zzso zzso were not changed significantly in the 36 and zzso old transgenic zzso Overall, these results suggest that zzso activity in the 5 zzso zzso mice is not substantially affected but that the model is relevant for studying early zzso of zzso
