zzso of the skull base require accuracy to safely navigate the critical zzso This is particularly the case for zzso zzso skull base surgery zzso where the surgeons work within zzso of zzso structures at the skull zzso Today's navigation systems provide approximately 2 zzso zzso zzso is limited by the indirect relationship of the navigation system, the image and the zzso We propose a method to directly track the position of the zzso using video data acquired from the zzso zzso Our method first tracks image feature points in the video and reconstructs the image feature points to produce zzso points, and then registers the reconstructed point cloud to a surface segmented from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After the initial zzso the system tracks image features and maintains the zzso correspondence of image features and zzso zzso These data are then used to update the current camera zzso We present a method for validation of our system, which achieves zzso zzso zzso zzso target registration error zzso zzso
