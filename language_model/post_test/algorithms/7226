The aim of this chapter is a zzso guide on how to zzso gene networks from gene expression zzso The definition of a gene network is given in zzso 1, where the different types of networks are zzso The chapter then guides the readers through a zzso process in order to build a compendium of gene expression profiles from a public zzso Gene expression profiles are then zzso and a statistical relationship between zzso called mutual information zzso is zzso Gene pairs with insignificant zzso scores are then discarded by applying one of the described pruning zzso The retained relationships are then used to build up a zzso zzso zzso used as input for a zzso zzso to divide the network into zzso (or zzso The gene network can then be used as a hypothesis generator for discovering gene function and analyzing gene zzso Some case studies are zzso and an online zzso called zzso is zzso
