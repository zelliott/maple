zzso analysis of dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging zzso data requires the accurate determination of the zzso input function zzso A novel method for obtaining the zzso is presented here and zzso parameters derived from individual and zzso zzso are then zzso A Philips zzso T zzso MR scanner was used to obtain 20 zzso data sets from ten breast cancer patients prior to and after one cycle of zzso Using a zzso method to estimate the zzso from the zzso artery, we obtain the zzso for each patient, zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso The extended standard model is used to estimate the zzso parameters using the two types of zzso The mean zzso correlation zzso zzso for the zzso segmented manually and by the proposed zzso tracking approach is zzso indicating accurate and automatic tracking of an zzso in zzso data of the breast is zzso Regarding the kinetic zzso the CCC values for zzso zzso and zzso as estimated by zzso and zzso are zzso zzso and zzso respectively, based on the region of interest zzso The average CCC values for the zzso analysis are zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso This work indicates that zzso and zzso show good agreement between zzso and zzso while there is a weak agreement on zzso
