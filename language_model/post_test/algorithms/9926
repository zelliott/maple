zzso time is universally required for learning and structuring motor and cognitive actions, but how the brain keeps track of time is still not zzso We searched for time representations in zzso zzso circuits by recording from thousands of zzso in the prefrontal zzso and zzso of zzso monkeys performing a routine zzso zzso We found that a subset of zzso exhibited zzso zzso zzso similar to that required by models of zzso zzso They responded with spike activity zzso that were distributed at different time delays after single task zzso Moreover, the zzso evolution of the population activity allowed robust decoding of task time by zzso zzso We suggest that time information can emerge as a byproduct of event coding in zzso zzso circuits and can serve as a critical infrastructure for behavioral learning and zzso
