Traditional deterministic approaches for simulation of chemically reacting systems fail to capture the randomness inherent in such systems at scales common in zzso zzso zzso In this zzso we briefly review the state of the art in discrete zzso and zzso zzso for simulation of zzso systems and we present the zzso software zzso
