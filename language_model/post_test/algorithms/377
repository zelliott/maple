In this study, we compared four expert graders with zzso semantic analysis zzso to assess short zzso of an expository zzso As is well known, there are technical difficulties for zzso to establish a good semantic representation when analyzing short zzso In order to improve the reliability of zzso relative to human graders, we analyzed three new zzso by two holistic methods used in previous research zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso The three new zzso were zzso the semantic common network algorithm, an adaptation of an zzso proposed by zzso zzso zzso 2002) with respect to zzso as a dynamic model of semantic representation; zzso a zzso reduction measure of the zzso semantic space, selecting those dimensions that best contribute to improving the zzso assessment of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & McNamara, zzso and zzso the zzso distance measure, used by zzso et zzso zzso which incorporates at the same time zzso length and the zzso zzso A total of 192 Spanish zzso students and 6 experts took part in this zzso They read an expository text and produced a short zzso zzso showed significantly higher reliability of zzso as a computerized assessment tool for expository text when it used a zzso zzso rather than a standard zzso zzso The semantic common network zzso also showed promising zzso
