In zzso research and clinical practice, zzso age is a crucial variable for measuring zzso zzso zzso weight for zzso zzso and for zzso the risk of mortality and zzso yet reported zzso age values are affected by random and systematic errors due to the absence of a gold standard zzso Previous investigators have used birth weight (which is measured with greater zzso and precision than is zzso zzso to correct such zzso but existing methods are inadequate due to unreasonable assumptions about the zzso of birth weight and zzso zzso We propose a new method for identifying and correcting implausible observations using the zzso zzso zzso Using zzso data from zzso birth zzso we compare the resulting zzso ages, birth weight zzso at each zzso age, and zzso zzso infant mortality based on the new method with those on the same population produced by previous published correction zzso The new method gives the best birth weight zzso for zzso age and the most realistic zzso mortality rates, while each of the other methods has at least one significant zzso
