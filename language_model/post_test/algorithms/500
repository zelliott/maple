Although zzso zzso zzso have made zzso association studies zzso zzso only a small proportion of zzso in the human zzso are actually surveyed in such zzso In addition, various zzso zzso zzso different sets of zzso which leads to challenges in comparing results and merging data for zzso zzso zzso of zzso markers allows us to address these issues in a direct zzso 

zzso Caucasian American liver donors were zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso from which we also derived zzso from the zzso zzso On these data, we compared two zzso zzso zzso and zzso We zzso zzso million zzso zzso zzso and conducted zzso on approximately 40,000 liver zzso expression traits zzso zzso In addition, 200 Caucasian American and 200 African American subjects were zzso using the zzso 500 K array plus a custom zzso K zzso zzso We then zzso the zzso zzso and zzso the accuracy by randomly masking observed zzso 

zzso and zzso perform similarly with respect to zzso zzso The zzso results in excellent zzso performance, and it zzso zzso or zzso zzso For Caucasian Americans, zzso of the zzso zzso were zzso at zzso zzso As expected, zzso of poorly zzso zzso zzso zzso in weak zzso with typed zzso was not as zzso It was more challenging to zzso zzso in the African American population, given zzso shorter zzso blocks and zzso zzso with Caucasian populations in this zzso To address issue zzso we pooled zzso zzso and zzso data as an zzso reference set, which greatly improved overall zzso The approximate 40,000 zzso scored in these populations provide a path to determine zzso how the power to detect associations is affected by the zzso zzso That is, at a fixed false discovery rate, the number of zzso discoveries detected by various methods can be interpreted as their relative statistical power in the zzso In this study, we find that zzso offer modest additional power (by zzso on top of either zzso or zzso much less than the power gain from zzso to zzso zzso 

Current zzso can accurately zzso zzso for zzso zzso which enables researchers to pool data between studies conducted using different zzso zzso While zzso itself results in a small error rate zzso zzso zzso zzso is surprisingly zzso We found that dense marker sets zzso zzso outperform zzso ones zzso zzso in terms of zzso yield and zzso We also noticed it was harder to zzso zzso for African American samples, partially due to population zzso although using a pooled reference boosts zzso Interestingly, zzso carried out using zzso zzso only slightly increased power on top of zzso zzso The reason is likely due to adding more markers via zzso only results in modest gain in genetic coverage, but worsens the multiple testing zzso Furthermore, zzso mapping using dense zzso set derived from zzso achieves great resolution, and locate associate peak closer to zzso zzso than conventional zzso
