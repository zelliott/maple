zzso of brain zzso through the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso data is seriously zzso by the high level f noise in the zzso To mitigate the effects of noise, we propose incorporating anatomical connectivity into brain zzso detection as motivated by how the functional integration of distinct brain areas is facilitated via neural fiber zzso In this work, we formulate zzso detection as a zzso zzso zzso problem with fiber networks estimated from diffusion zzso zzso data serving as a zzso Our approach is reinforced with a zzso scheme for refining the connectivity prior to reflect the fact that not all fibers are necessarily deployed during a given cognitive task as well as to account for false fiber tracts arising from limitations of zzso zzso zzso on real clinical data collected from 7 schizophrenia patients and 13 matched healthy controls, we show that incorporating anatomical connectivity significantly increases sensitivity in detecting task zzso in controls compared to existing zzso zzso Further, we illustrate how our model enables the detection of significant group zzso differences between controls and patients that are missed with standard zzso
