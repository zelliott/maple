This study describes an effective method for zzso line spread function zzso and point spread function zzso measured in zzso zzso zzso The CT image of an assumed object function is known to be zzso using zzso or zzso based on a model for the spatial resolution in a linear imaging zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso would be confirmed by comparing the zzso images with the images obtained by scanning zzso corresponding to the object zzso zzso between zzso and measured images will depend on the accuracy of the zzso and zzso used in the zzso First, we measured zzso in our zzso and derived the two-dimensional zzso in the scan plane from the zzso Second, we scanned the phantom including uniform zzso objects parallel to the long axis of a patient's body zzso zzso Measured images of such a phantom were characterized according to the spatial resolution in the scan plane, and did not depend on the spatial resolution in the zzso zzso Third, images were calculated by zzso zzso the true object as a function of space with the zzso As a result of comparing zzso images with measured ones, good agreement was found and was demonstrated by image zzso As a criterion for evaluating zzso the overall differences of images, we defined the zzso standard zzso zzso in the differences between zzso and measured zzso These zzso zzso were less than zzso zzso from zzso to zzso for three types of image reconstruction kernels and for various diameters of zzso objects, indicating the high accuracy of zzso and zzso that resulted in successful zzso Further, we also obtained another zzso utilizing an inappropriate manner, and calculated the images as zzso This time, the zzso images did not agree with the measured zzso The zzso zzso were zzso or more zzso from zzso to zzso indicating the inaccuracy of the zzso and zzso We could verify zzso and zzso for three types of reconstruction zzso and demonstrated differences between zzso transfer functions zzso derived from validated zzso and inaccurate zzso Our technique requires a simple phantom that is suitable for clinical zzso and does not require a particular phantom containing some metals or specific fine structures, as required in methods previously used for zzso of spatial zzso zzso the scanned image of the phantom will be reliable and of good quality, and this is used directly as a confident reference image for the zzso When one zzso zzso zzso or zzso values, zzso using our method is zzso Further, when another method for the measurement of zzso and zzso is developed, it could be validated using our technique, as illustrated in the method proposed by Boone zzso zzso 28, zzso zzso and used in this zzso
