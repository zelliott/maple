This paper presents a novel zzso zzso reconstruction zzso for zzso vision data from zzso artificial zzso zzso zzso zzso capture visual information zzso and zzso it into zzso of zzso zzso pulse signals carrying information on, zzso zzso contrast events in the zzso The precise time of the occurrence of these visual features are implicitly zzso in the spike zzso Due to the high zzso resolution of the zzso visual information zzso the output of these sensors is zzso suited for dynamic zzso zzso The presented technique takes full benefit of the zzso operation, zzso events are processed individually at the moment they zzso This strategy allows us to preserve the original dynamics of the scene, hence allowing for more robust zzso zzso As opposed to existing techniques, this zzso is based on geometric and time constraints alone, making it particularly simple to implement and largely zzso
