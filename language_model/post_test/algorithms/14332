The origin of zzso enhanced zzso zzso of light in random media when the spatial zzso length of zzso is much smaller than the transport mean free path has been poorly zzso We report that in zzso scattering discrete random media zzso zzso originates from zzso paths of double zzso Low spatial zzso zzso zzso the zzso waves outside its finite zzso area, which zzso the minimal number of scattering events in zzso from zzso zzso Moreover, we show the first experimental evidence that the minimal number of scattering events in zzso is double zzso which has been hypothesized since the first observation of zzso
