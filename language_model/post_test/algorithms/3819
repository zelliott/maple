zzso systems to deliver medical treatment in humans are zzso systems and require particular care in both the testing and the evaluation phase, which are zzso costly, and zzso by ethical zzso The objective of the present work is to develop a methodology to test zzso controllers of an artificial zzso in a simulated zzso zzso 

A virtual environment zzso a model of the zzso metabolism and models of the insulin pump and the zzso sensor is employed to simulate individual zzso excursions in subjects with type 1 zzso The performance of the control zzso within the virtual environment is evaluated by considering treatment and operational zzso 

The developed methodology includes two zzso testing in relation to specific life style conditions, zzso zzso zzso and life style zzso zzso and testing in relation to various operating conditions, zzso expected operating conditions, adverse operating conditions, and system zzso We define safety and efficacy criteria and describe the measures to be taken prior to clinical zzso The use of the methodology is exemplified by tuning and evaluating a model zzso zzso controller being developed for a zzso artificial zzso focused on zzso zzso 

Our methodology to test zzso controllers in a virtual environment is instrumental in anticipating the results of real clinical tests for different zzso conditions and for different operating zzso The thorough testing in the virtual environment reduces costs and speeds up the development zzso
