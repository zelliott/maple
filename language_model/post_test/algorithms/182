Internal strain resulting from tissue deformation can be estimated by correlation processing of zzso patterns within complex zzso radio zzso ultrasound images acquired during zzso At large zzso the magnitude of the correlation zzso peak can be significantly lower than unity, so that random zzso correlations will exceed the true zzso This effect is called zzso zzso and causes significant errors in displacement and deformation zzso Here we investigate the zzso algorithm, a dynamic programming zzso to overcome zzso artifacts by finding the most likely sequence of hidden states in a sequence of observed zzso It is well suited to motion zzso in zzso studies because adjacent tissue elements remain adjacent following zzso zzso tissue elements along an zzso beam in one image lie along a 3-D continuous curve in the next image zzso The observed event in this case is the correlation zzso of a zzso at a certain zzso zzso data were generated before and after deformation with an average strain of zzso zzso were performed for a zzso medium and for a medium with a stiffer zzso zzso show that zzso processing of zzso zzso can significantly reduce zzso zzso
