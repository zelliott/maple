We studied the zzso zzso transition of zzso zzso zzso over a pressure range of approximately 1-3 zzso at 25 degrees C by zzso zzso scattering and molecular dynamics zzso We find that applying pressure leads to a twofold increase in the radius of zzso derived from the zzso zzso scattering zzso and zzso the pair distance distribution function, zzso and shows a transition from a zzso to a zzso distribution as the protein zzso The results indicate that the zzso structure of zzso is retained across the zzso transition although this structure is less compact and zzso relative to the native zzso zzso unfolding is initiated in the molecular dynamics simulations by inserting water molecules into the protein interior and applying zzso The zzso calculated from these simulations likewise zzso and shows a similar zzso transition with increasing zzso The simulations also reveal that the zzso zzso for the zzso state arises as the protein expands and forms two zzso that effectively diffuse apart during initial stages of zzso zzso contact maps derived from the simulations show that water insertions into the protein interior and the application of pressure together destabilize zzso contacts between these two zzso The findings support a mechanism for the zzso unfolding of zzso in which water penetration into the zzso core plays a central zzso
