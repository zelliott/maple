Limited knowledge exists about the interaction between dental zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

This study evaluated dental guidance in lateral zzso movement and its relationship to jaw motion in unilateral zzso 

zzso zzso movement paths (in lateral guiding movements and in the final part of a zzso chewing zzso were collected with automated infrared motion analysis in 22 subjects with complete, permanent zzso On 2 traces selected from the recorded movements, the angular values projected in all planes of space obtained from 2 lines zzso to a point at a distance of zzso zzso from maximum zzso were used to calculate a canine and a zzso dental guidance ratio zzso zzso statistics were zzso for the zzso in the 3 spatial zzso 

Assuming zzso movements of any given subject are restricted or guided by dental zzso a value below zzso of the zzso was zzso This was true for the frontal plane only, with mean values of approximately zzso zzso movements, zzso and zzso and approximately zzso zzso movements for both zzso and zzso In the horizontal and zzso planes, mean values between zzso and zzso were zzso 

Within the limitations of this study, zzso movement was within the physical borders dictated by dental anatomy in the frontal plane zzso
