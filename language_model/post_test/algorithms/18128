We have previously developed a method for zzso of the first heart sound zzso using zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this study, an additional enhancement step based on zzso and zzso ensemble averaging zzso is zzso The main objective of the improved method was to zzso zzso with very high zzso accuracy in zzso real zzso The performance of zzso detection and zzso with and without zzso enhancement, was evaluated on simulated as well as experimental zzso The simulation study showed that zzso enhancement reduced the zzso error considerably and that zzso could be accurately localized at much lower zzso zzso The experimental data were taken from ten healthy subjects at rest and during invoked zzso and zzso For this material, the number of correct zzso zzso increased from zzso to zzso when using zzso zzso zzso performance was also demonstrated when zzso enhancement was used for continuous tracking of blood pressure changes and for zzso monitoring via the zzso zzso zzso These are two typical applications where accurate zzso of zzso is essential for the zzso
