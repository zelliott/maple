zzso diabetes and obesity are independent risk factors for neural tube zzso although it is unclear whether the effects are zzso by common zzso zzso In this zzso we report a zzso survey of zzso zzso in zzso stage zzso from mouse zzso with different zzso conditions: maternal diabetes, and maternal consumption of a high fat content zzso We find that maternal diabetes, and zzso exposure to high-fat diet, are associated with increases and decreases of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso changes of zzso zzso marks are significantly enriched near genes known to cause neural tube defects in mouse zzso These data suggest that zzso changes in response to diet and zzso condition may contribute to increased risk for neural tube defects in diabetic and obese zzso zzso the responses to high-fat diet and maternal diabetes were zzso suggesting that zzso embryonic development under these conditions is zzso by different molecular zzso This conclusion is supported by zzso analyses that reveal a trend for maternal diabetes to delay embryonic development in the zzso strain, while high-fat diet appears to be associated with accelerated zzso Taken together, our results link changes in zzso zzso to zzso conditions during pregnancy, and zzso distinct zzso mechanisms in zzso to neural tube defects under conditions of maternal diabetes and zzso
