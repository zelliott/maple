zzso coupled zzso show zzso or zzso zzso depending on the chemical and zzso nature of the zzso zzso theory helps predict the phase differences between two zzso zzso when the zzso is zzso In the presence of noise, however, deterministic theory faces difficulty when the coexistence of multiple stable zzso solutions zzso We analyze the solution structure of two coupled zzso zzso for zzso values between a zzso zzso zzso point and a zzso zzso point of the periodic branch that zzso from the zzso point, where a rich variety of zzso solutions including zzso localized zzso zzso We construct these solutions via a zzso analysis and explore the general zzso scenario using the zzso zzso We show for both zzso and zzso zzso that noise causes important changes in the phase and zzso dynamics of such coupled zzso zzso when multiple zzso solutions zzso zzso zzso occur when distinct zzso solutions are randomly zzso The phase difference between the coupled zzso in the localized solution, zzso with zzso or zzso solutions, is clearly represented in the zzso phase zzso
