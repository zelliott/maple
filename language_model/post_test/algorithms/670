The zzso index zzso is commonly used to predict leg injury based on zzso taken by an zzso test device zzso The zzso consists of an interaction formula that combines zzso loading and zzso plus a supplemental zzso force zzso Current zzso lower limbs lack geometric zzso with regard to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Due to differences in zzso zzso the zzso moments induced by zzso loading are different in humans and zzso zzso zzso loading in the human is also reduced by zzso through the zzso which is not zzso in current zzso In this study, zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso through CT imaging and zzso testing, and equations are presented to correct zzso zzso to reflect the loading that would be experienced by a human zzso
