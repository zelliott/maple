Cell zzso are vitally important to the life of a zzso Although the basic structure of biological membrane is provided by the zzso zzso membrane proteins perform most of the specific zzso zzso proteins are zzso classified into five different zzso Identification of their types is currently an important topic in zzso and zzso In this paper, based on the concept of representing protein samples in terms of their zzso acid zzso the fuzzy zzso neighbors zzso zzso has been introduced to predict membrane protein types, and high success rates were zzso It is anticipated that, the current approach, which is based on a branch of fuzzy mathematics and represents a new strategy, may play an important complementary role to the existing methods in this zzso The novel approach may also have notable impact on prediction of the other zzso such as protein structural class, protein zzso zzso and zzso family class, among many zzso
