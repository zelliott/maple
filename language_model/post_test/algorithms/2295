The purpose of this paper is to investigate the utility of implant quality measures on single zzso zzso treatment zzso Four dwell weight zzso zzso were applied to four regular geometric zzso single plane, double plane, zzso and zzso The dwell weight zzso schemes included equal zzso two commercial zzso schemes zzso and zzso and a variation of the zzso distribution zzso The implant quality measures were investigated as a function of zzso reference air zzso zzso to eliminate bias resulting from a prescription zzso A particular dose per zzso refers to a dose surface that is a function only of the relative dwell weight distribution and is therefore well suited to investigate dwell weight zzso zzso The implant quality measures included the zzso ratio zzso developed by zzso and a coverage index to assess the zzso coverage relative to the implanted zzso These were termed direct quantities due to their clear clinical zzso Additional measures include the ratio of the implant zzso zzso zzso to that of a point source exhibiting the same zzso zzso and the ratio of the zzso zzso to the equally weighted zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso and depths of the zzso zzso were used to characterize these indirect implant quality zzso To evaluate the effectiveness of both the direct and indirect measures, they were correlated with the zzso for an zzso surface that covered the implant zzso The efficiency of the dwell weight distribution was examined by noting the zzso surface zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
