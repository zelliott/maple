To evaluate whether zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging can depict zzso status after zzso surgery and whether changes at zzso MR imaging after zzso surgery zzso with clinical outcome in zzso zzso 

An institutional review board approved this retrospective study; informed consent was zzso zzso and zzso zzso MR imaging data in 67 children with zzso disease zzso age, zzso years; range, zzso zzso were zzso Regional time to peak zzso and regional cerebral blood volume zzso were calculated by adjusting cerebral time to peak zzso and cerebral blood volume zzso values by using zzso reference zzso For quantitative regional analysis, zzso values were divided into five categories zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and percentages of zzso in zzso meeting these time conditions were zzso Changes in the values after zzso were zzso zzso clinical outcomes were zzso as zzso 1 indicated zzso 2, good; 3, fair; and 4, zzso zzso and zzso zzso parameters were compared by using a paired zzso zzso relationships between zzso parameters and clinical outcomes were investigated by using one-way analysis of zzso with a significance level of zzso 

zzso zzso and percentage of zzso of zzso decreased significantly after zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were significantly different for the clinical outcome zzso Change in zzso and change in percentage of zzso of zzso zzso seconds to zzso zzso were significantly different for the clinical outcome zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso maps can depict zzso status after zzso surgery in zzso zzso Furthermore, changes in zzso zzso maps after zzso surgery zzso with clinical outcome in patients with zzso zzso
