In recent years, imaging based, zzso zzso and zzso zzso plant zzso platforms have become popular tools for plant biology, underpinning the field of plant zzso Such platforms acquire and record large amounts of raw data that must be accurately and robustly zzso zzso and zzso requiring the development of sophisticated image understanding and zzso zzso The raw data can be processed in different ways, and the past few years have seen the emergence of two main zzso zzso image processing and zzso mesh processing zzso zzso image zzso methods (usually zzso dominate the current literature due to comparative zzso However, zzso mesh analysis provides the tremendous potential to accurately estimate specific zzso features zzso and monitor them zzso 

In this paper, we present a novel zzso mesh based technique developed for zzso zzso plant zzso and perform initial tests for the analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on plant zzso previously reconstructed from zzso images, the methodology involves several zzso including zzso mesh zzso zzso parameters zzso and plant zzso tracking over zzso The initial study focuses on presenting and zzso the accuracy of the methodology on zzso such as cotton but we believe the approach will be more broadly zzso This study involved applying our technique to a set of six zzso zzso zzso plants studied over four zzso Manual zzso performed for each plant at every zzso were used to assess the accuracy of our pipeline and zzso the error on the zzso parameters zzso 

By directly comparing our automated mesh based quantitative data with manual zzso of individual stem zzso leaf zzso and leaf zzso we obtained the mean absolute errors of zzso zzso zzso and correlation zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso matching of leaves was accurate in zzso of the cases and the average execution time required to zzso a plant over four zzso was zzso zzso The mesh processing based methodology is thus considered suitable for quantitative zzso monitoring of plant zzso zzso
