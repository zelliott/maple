The experimental setup was designed to study the effect of natural charging of droplets during zzso (called spray zzso or spray zzso in a wet zzso The influence of zzso material, liquid feed rate, and liquid composition on the specific charge zzso per unit volume of zzso formed in zzso was zzso It was found that the zzso material has no measurable effect on this specific zzso zzso the liquid feed rate increases the specific charge zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso concentration increases the zzso that decreases the formed specific zzso The same correlation between the specific charge and zzso was also observed with real scrubbing zzso It is proposed that the specific charge depends only on the value of liquid zzso not on liquid zzso The zzso of the tested scrubbing liquids was high enough to suppress the formation of a high specific charge during zzso
