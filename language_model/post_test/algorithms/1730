In the present study we evaluated the performance of a flow zzso zzso as a new zzso approach to detect zzso to zzso zzso and specific zzso zzso to diagnose acute zzso The results showed that using zzso zzso all serum samples from patients with acute zzso demonstrated zzso whereas zzso of patients with chronic infection and zzso of zzso individuals presented negative zzso Thus, only zzso of patients with chronic zzso showed residual zzso in contrast with other zzso used to diagnosis acute zzso On the order hand, zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso is unlikely to discriminate acute from chronic zzso We have also evaluated the performance of zzso zzso as a tool to exclude chronic zzso in patients with positive zzso Our data showed an excellent performance of zzso zzso employing the zzso of zzso for zzso Index zzso with sensitivity and specificity of zzso All serum samples from patients presenting acute zzso showed low zzso index zzso whereas all chronic patients showed high zzso index zzso The outstanding performance indexes of this novel flow zzso zzso support its use as a zzso alternative zzso approach to diagnose human acute zzso
