We develop a novel method of asserting the similarity between two biological sequences without the need for zzso The proposed method uses free energy of zzso interactions as a simple measure of zzso It is used to perform a search for similarities of a query sequence against three complex zzso The sensitivity and selectivity are zzso and evaluated and the performance of the proposed distance measure is zzso Real data analysis shows that is a very efficient, sensitive and zzso zzso in comparing large zzso of DNA zzso
