In recent years, there has been considerable interest in the effects of auditory and visual distractions on pedestrian zzso A fundamental zzso characteristic of zzso is the zzso fluctuation of the stride zzso In this paper, we investigate the zzso of stride zzso time series when people are exposed to different forms of auditory and visual zzso An increase in zzso behavior may be suggestive of divided attention and more frequent central zzso of zzso both of which may have ramifications on pedestrian vigilance and responsiveness to environmental zzso One group of zzso zzso (6 zzso young adult participants completed a music protocol zzso walking with and without zzso A second group of zzso (7 zzso did a television protocol zzso walking while watching TV with and without zzso Three walking trials, each zzso in zzso were performed at each zzso comfortable walking speed, with force sensitive zzso under the heel of each zzso Using the reverse arrangements test, the vast majority of time series were zzso with a zzso mean as the principal source of zzso Furthermore, the television trial with sound had the greatest number of zzso followed by zzso walking while listening to zzso We discuss the possibility that these conditions measurably affect gait dynamics through a subconscious synchronization to external rhythms or a zzso distraction followed by a period of increased conscious correction of gait zzso Our findings suggest that the regulation of stride timing is particularly susceptible to constant, zzso auditory zzso but that normal pacing can be restored quickly upon stimulus zzso These kinds of sensory distractions should thus be carefully considered in studies of pedestrian zzso
