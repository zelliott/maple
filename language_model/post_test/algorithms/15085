zzso invasive surgery generates new user zzso which create visual and zzso distortion when compared to traditional zzso In order to regain the tactile and zzso information that is lost, a computerized force feedback zzso surgical zzso zzso was developed with computer control and a zzso user zzso The system uses standard unmodified zzso shafts and zzso The zzso can control grasping forces either by surgeon zzso control, or under software zzso The zzso performance was evaluated using an automated zzso function zzso series of zzso in which the zzso measures mechanical properties of the zzso zzso The material parameters obtained from zzso showed the ability of the zzso to discriminate between different types of normal soft zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso liver, zzso and zzso and different kinds of artificial soft tissue replication materials zzso for simulation zzso In addition, zzso tests of ranking zzso of silicone materials using the zzso zzso mode showed significant improvement in the performance compared to the standard zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso performance was closer to the performance of the human hand than the standard zzso zzso The zzso as a tool incorporating the force feedback zzso technology may provide the basis for application in zzso clinical zzso surgery, surgical training, and zzso
