The study of stability is essential for designing or controlling genetic regulatory networks, which can be described by zzso differential equations with time zzso Much attention has been paid to the study of zzso stability of genetic regulatory networks and as a result, many sufficient conditions have been derived for zzso zzso Although it might be more interesting in practice, zzso stability of genetic regulatory networks has been studied zzso Based on the linear zzso inequality zzso approach, in this study we will present some zzso stability conditions for genetic regulatory zzso Then we extend these results to genetic regulatory networks with zzso zzso To illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results, gene zzso networks are analyzed zzso
