A novel method is presented for the prediction of protein architecture from sequence using neural zzso The method involves the zzso of protein sequence data by zzso zzso it and then applying a zzso zzso The zzso and transformed data are then used to train a neural network to recognize a number of different protein zzso The method proved significantly better than comparable alternative strategies such as percentage zzso frequency, but is still limited by the size of the data set and the input demands of a neural zzso Its main potential is as a complement to existing fold recognition techniques, with its ability to identify global zzso within protein structures its greatest zzso
