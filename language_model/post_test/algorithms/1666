We investigate the dynamics of systems of many coupled phase zzso with zzso zzso We suppose that the zzso occur in M zzso Each zzso is connected to other zzso in its group with zzso zzso such that the zzso promotes synchronization within the zzso The zzso between zzso in different groups is zzso zzso their zzso zzso zzso To address this problem, we reduce the governing equations to a zzso form via the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso 18, zzso zzso We first consider the zzso case where all group parameters are the same, and the attractive and repulsive zzso are also the same for each of the M zzso We find a zzso L of zzso stable zzso and we show that all other zzso are zzso For zzso L has dimension zzso and for zzso it has dimension zzso To address the general zzso case, we then introduce small zzso from symmetry in the group and zzso zzso Doing a zzso zzso analysis, we obtain slow time evolution equations for the motion of the M groups on the zzso zzso We use these equations to study the dynamics of the groups and compare the results with zzso zzso
