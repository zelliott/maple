We provide a general purpose zzso testing strategy for zzso disease zzso with zzso when phase may be ambiguous and parental zzso data may be zzso These tests for linkage and association can be used in candidate gene studies with tightly linked zzso Our proposed weighted conditional approach extends the method described in zzso and zzso to multiple zzso It is attractive because it provides zzso tests for zzso studies that are efficient and robust to population zzso zzso distribution zzso and zzso based on zzso It can handle missing parental zzso and/or missing phase in both offspring and zzso It yields either zzso zzso tests or zzso zzso zzso This extension has been implemented in the freely available software zzso zzso We used the zzso zzso program to test for associations between asthma zzso and single zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Whereas no single zzso showed significant association with asthma diagnosis or zzso responsiveness zzso zzso a zzso global test found a highly significant association with asthma diagnosis zzso value zzso and the measure of zzso responsiveness zzso value zzso
