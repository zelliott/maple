The zzso of zzso zzso is crucial in determining appropriate treatment for zzso vascular zzso The aim of this study was to develop a method to evaluate the flow characteristics of zzso vascular zzso using zzso zzso red blood cells zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso including 20 zzso zzso and 59 zzso zzso in 57 patients were zzso Following the intravenous injection of zzso dynamic imaging was performed for 30 zzso with the zzso in the field of view zzso flow zzso A zzso curve was generated for the zzso and the zzso was zzso as a zzso or zzso zzso by visual inspection of the zzso In zzso zzso mean vascular transit time zzso was calculated by curve fitting based on a zzso zzso zzso zzso in 19 patients were examined twice, and zzso was zzso In 23 zzso zzso in 16 patients, zzso zzso was zzso injected into the zzso space of the zzso and dynamic data of zzso duration were acquired zzso puncture zzso zzso was estimated from the zzso curve and compared with zzso estimated by zzso flow zzso zzso flow study classified all 20 zzso zzso as zzso zzso and all 59 zzso zzso as zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso estimated by zzso flow study ranged from zzso to zzso zzso In the zzso study, complete zzso in zzso and high correlation in zzso were shown between the first and second zzso zzso estimated by zzso flow study was significantly correlated with that estimated by direct puncture zzso In zzso zzso flow study provides a quantitative indicator of zzso zzso in zzso zzso in addition to accurate distinction between zzso and zzso zzso The results of this study suggest the feasibility of detailed evaluation of flow characteristics in zzso vascular zzso using zzso
