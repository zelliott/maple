The effects of peripheral zzso and zzso zzso on the electronic structure and properties of iron zzso zzso have been investigated using a zzso zzso zzso by zzso fluorinated groups alters the ground state of zzso and gives rise to large changes in the zzso zzso and electron zzso For the zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso the zzso coordination of two zzso zzso leads to an zzso ground state, while the zzso zzso make the system zzso The electronic zzso of a zzso iron zzso is determined mainly by the zzso zzso strength but can also be affected by peripheral zzso zzso zzso also exert an effect on zzso zzso and electron affinity and can, as observed zzso even change the site of zzso
