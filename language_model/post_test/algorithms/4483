Control of the microscopic characteristics of zzso systems is critical in a wealth of application areas, ranging from food to zzso To assist in zzso these zzso we present a method for zzso the positions of zzso zzso in digital zzso zzso The zzso intensity profiles of zzso which depend on the distances of the particles from the focal plane of the light microscope and have no closed functional form, are zzso using a local zzso kernel zzso We also allow for the case where zzso values are censored at an upper limit of zzso Standard errors of zzso estimates are obtained using a sandwich zzso which takes into account spatial zzso in the zzso The approach is validated by a simulation zzso
