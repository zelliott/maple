Model simulation using data obtained from total hip zzso zzso 

University medical zzso 

91 patients who participated in zzso undergoing single, primary, total hip replacement surgeries from January to December zzso 

A zzso zzso baseline 14 zzso zzso patient zzso blood volume 5,000 zzso who donated two units by either zzso or zzso was assumed for model zzso The zzso as a function of zzso blood loss increments after zzso of two zzso units, was calculated for each technique and compared to a control zzso to predict the effectiveness of zzso and zzso in zzso red cell zzso Data from hip zzso over a 12-month period were used to determine the parameters for the zzso zzso were subjected to zzso analysis and tested for zzso of slopes, with p zzso zzso accepted to indicate a statistical zzso 

The difference in zzso between zzso and zzso was not statistically different over a wide range of blood zzso When compared to control, there was no difference in zzso zzso in the estimated blood loss zzso range of less than 1,000 zzso zzso and zzso provide some benefit when zzso is greater than 1,500 zzso in zzso zzso zzso As blood loss increases, the benefit of zzso collection becomes more clinically zzso 

zzso exemplifies a zzso form of zzso in current clinical practice and offers little advantage over zzso as a blood conservation technique for zzso zzso When surgical blood loss is predictably mild to moderate zzso 250 to 1,000 zzso neither blood conservation technique is zzso
