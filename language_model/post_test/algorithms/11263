zzso treatment planning is routinely used in zzso zzso For these therapeutic applications, it is of critical importance to have a precise model of the structures in zzso zzso imaging techniques and advances in software engineering have moved three-dimensional zzso computer models from the research and development area into routine clinical zzso The importance of high-resolution source imaging is well understood by zzso The influence of image processing is poorly understood in the surgical community and we zzso that this may be a source of significant zzso We evaluated the zzso for creating a virtual model using zzso zzso data, and the impact that image processing decisions have on final virtual model zzso We chose to create a model of the dental surface since it is one of the most complex structures in the zzso Individual image processing steps are explained and the zzso of their influence on model quality are demonstrated and zzso This study demonstrates that inappropriate image processing can introduce errors of similar magnitude as the use of inadequate source zzso Finally, the study shows that errors caused by inappropriate image processing amplify the zzso of zzso source imagery and eliminate the benefits of high-resolution source zzso
