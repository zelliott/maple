zzso sequencing is currently a major transforming technology in zzso In this paper, we study a population zzso problem motivated by the newly available short reads data from zzso zzso In this problem, we are given short reads collected from individuals in a zzso The objective is to zzso zzso with the given zzso We first formulate the zzso problem of zzso zzso with short zzso Based on a simple zzso model on short reads, we present a new approach of zzso zzso directly from given reads zzso without first calling zzso Our method is finding the most likely zzso whose local zzso history can be approximately modeled as a perfect zzso We show that the optimal zzso under this objective can be found for many data using zzso linear programming for modest sized data when there is no zzso We then develop a related zzso method which can work with larger data, and also allows zzso zzso shows that the performance of our method is competitive against alternative zzso
