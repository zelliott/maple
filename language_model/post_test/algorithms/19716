zzso interactions zzso prediction is an important issue in zzso Recently many zzso methods have been proposed to determine zzso However, there is no golden standard zzso for these methods zzso Furthermore, there exists different quality among training examples and the quality is always ignored by the current zzso In the condition of low-quality examples, the system should tolerate the data zzso zzso weighting strategy is used in this paper to build a robust system and solve the problem of data zzso Training examples are investigated and a new example zzso strategy is zzso Training example weighting method based on confidence is zzso Different weight setting strategies are discussed and the corresponding results are given in the zzso A new model zzso example weighting strategy, zzso zzso weight model, is zzso Experimental results on zzso zzso demonstrate that the new model zzso the original zzso model in the zzso score measure by over zzso Furthermore, the example weighting strategy is applied to another zzso zzso prediction method, maximum likelihood zzso zzso method, and the modified zzso method zzso better performance than the original zzso zzso At same time, our examples weighting strategy can be applied to any other training example based zzso prediction zzso
