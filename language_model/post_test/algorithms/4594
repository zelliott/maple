The zzso peak profile of the zzso involved in a chemical reaction of the type A + B zzso AB is considered using method of the apparent zzso zzso The apparent zzso derived are zzso even under assumption of Henry zzso of individual zzso zzso of apparent zzso zzso results in peak zzso The resulted zzso peak profile depends on several factors such as the equilibrium constant zzso and Henry zzso of the zzso zzso peak profiles of zzso involved in the chemical reaction are presented as illustration of influence of various zzso
