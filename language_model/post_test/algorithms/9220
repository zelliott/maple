This paper describes a metric that can be used to characterize the resolution of arbitrary broadband coherent imaging zzso The metric is particularly suited to medical ultrasound because it characterizes scanner performance using the contrast obtained by imaging zzso zzso of various sizes that are embedded in a zzso background, accounting for the effect of electronic zzso We present the theoretical derivation of the metric and provide simulation examples that demonstrate its zzso We use the metric to compare a low-cost, zzso zzso system under development in our laboratory to conventional ultrasound zzso We also present the results of simulations that were designed to evaluate and zzso various parameters in our system, including the zzso and zzso zzso We investigate the impact of electronic noise on our system and zzso the tradeoffs associated with zzso in the analog to digital zzso zzso indicate that an zzso receive zzso combined with zzso precision and a zzso ratio zzso of 0 zzso per channel would result in adequate image zzso
