The aim of the study was the zzso of metabolically caused zzso changes of zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso We examined 12 patients with liver zzso before and after zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso shunt zzso by means of quantitative digital zzso zzso One month after zzso zzso all patients showed an increase in the power of the zzso frequency band as well as a decrease in the power of the alpha frequency zzso To reduce the error zzso we formed the zzso of the relative power of the zzso and alpha frequency zzso zzso zzso values over zzso indicate a general change of the zzso with a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso The results we have to hand indicate a correlation between the zzso concentration and the zzso zzso 1 and 3 months after zzso No significant correlation was revealed with regard to the zzso score or the liver function parameters zzso zzso and zzso zzso Neither the zzso zzso concentration nor the performance in the zzso test showed significance in relation to the zzso zzso Substances with a high zzso bond and potential zzso zzso the case of lower zzso zzso absorbed with increased frequency in the zzso and may be responsible for the observed zzso zzso
