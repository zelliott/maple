To devise a zzso indicator of image quality for zzso zzso cardiac zzso zzso zzso and its relation to zzso zzso 

A zzso cardiac assist device was used to simulate cardiac wall motion by mechanically zzso the device dynamics to a piece of zzso zzso Wire motion induced by different device rates was captured with an zzso zzso zzso CT scanner operating with various scanning zzso Image artifacts were visually assessed and compared with the image point spread function zzso using the full zzso at half maximum zzso area as a zzso estimate of spatial zzso 

At rest, the zzso area was determined as zzso zzso At a device rate of 60 zzso the zzso area ranged from zzso zzso to zzso zzso depending on the time of image zzso Mean zzso of the zzso area zzso was determined as zzso whereas visual estimates of motion artifact were highly variable between different readers zzso zzso zzso zzso determined image quality correlated closely with the zzso area metric zzso rank zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At a device rate of 100 zzso the minimum zzso area was zzso zzso using a single-sector algorithm, zzso zzso using a zzso algorithm, and zzso zzso using a zzso zzso 

Use of a zzso cardiac assist device could serve as an in zzso test bed for cardiac CT imaging zzso Area zzso of the zzso zzso well with visually determined image quality of a dynamic zzso but provides better zzso than visual zzso
