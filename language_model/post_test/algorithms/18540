Small zzso zzso genes in zzso coli have been in focus recently, as 44 out of 55 zzso confirmed zzso genes have been precisely located in the zzso The object of this study is to analyze zzso the conservation of these zzso genes and compare it with the conservation of zzso zzso zzso regions and zzso zzso 

The results show that within an evolutionary distance of zzso both zzso genes and zzso genes display a similar tendency in their degrees of conservation at the zzso zzso In addition, the conservation of zzso genes is much stronger than zzso regions, but much weaker than zzso zzso Based on the conservation of studied zzso zzso we also give clues to estimate the total number of zzso genes in zzso 

zzso information is available at zzso
