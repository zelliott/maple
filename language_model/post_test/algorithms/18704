zzso flaw detection has been studied many times in the zzso zzso based on zzso after a previous matched filter use to be the best solution, but results obtained with this method are only satisfactory when scattering and zzso are not zzso In this paper, we propose an alternative solution to zzso detection zzso We deal with the usage of different flaw detection methods comparing them with the proposed zzso The experiment tries to zzso whether a given zzso signal contains a flaw echo or zzso Starting with a set of 24,000 patterns with 750 samples each one, two zzso are defined for the zzso The first one, the training set, is used to obtain the detection parameters of the different methods, and the second one is used to test the performance of zzso The proposed method is based on zzso basis functions networks, one of the most powerful neural network zzso This signal processing technique tries to find the optimal decision zzso Comparing this method with zzso based ones, an improvement over zzso is zzso depending on the probability of false zzso So our new method is a good alternative to flaw detection zzso
