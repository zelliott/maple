The zzso III zzso method is popular for assessing children's bone age, but it is time-consuming in clinical zzso to simplify this, a zzso zzso zzso was zzso 

A total of zzso zzso zzso of subjects aged zzso years, including zzso training and 264 testing zzso were evaluated by a senior zzso Next, zzso was used to choose the appropriate candidate of zzso zzso and short bones and to zzso the bones into three groups by data zzso Group 1 was composed of the maturity pattern of the radius and the middle zzso of the third and fifth digits and three weights were obtained by data mining, yielding a result similar to that of zzso zzso new zzso assessment tables were constructed for boys and girls by linear zzso and fuzzy zzso In addition, the zzso plot was zzso to compare accuracy between the zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso 

The relative accuracy between the zzso and the zzso was zzso in boys and zzso in girls, with an error of 1 year, while that between the assessment results of the zzso and zzso was about zzso with an error of 1 zzso However, even if the three weights were not zzso zzso zzso yielded a marginal result with an accuracy of zzso in boys and zzso in zzso 

zzso can efficiently simplify the complexity of the zzso method, while maintaining almost the same zzso The relative accuracy between the assessment results of zzso and zzso can also be zzso
