zzso zzso regions of interest can provide valuable information for training medical image zzso and zzso zzso However the process of obtaining zzso is tedious and zzso especially for high-resolution zzso zzso In this paper we present a novel learning framework to reduce the requirement of manual zzso while achieving competitive zzso zzso The approach is evaluated on a zzso with 59 zzso optical projection zzso images of zzso zzso The results show that the proposed method can robustly zzso patterns from partially zzso images with low zzso zzso
