The respiratory gas exchange and ventilation during an incremental cycle exercise test were zzso in a group of 19 healthy, moderately fit zzso Different computer zzso were used to estimate the zzso values zzso zzso the rate of zzso increase just exceeds the rate of zzso increase zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso point of zzso and zzso ventilation zzso increases disproportionately in relation to zzso zzso point of zzso equivalent zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were zzso using a new approach employing zzso zzso and the value of zzso was determined following zzso zzso of raw zzso The zzso of the zzso was evaluated with a 5-6 week zzso between the zzso The correlations between tests were zzso at zzso zzso at zzso and zzso at zzso The mean differences between the repeated tests were not statistically zzso The zzso of zzso in absolute values expressed as zzso zzso of the differences between the tests, had values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso The mean value of zzso for each measurement point expressed as a percentage of zzso zzso was zzso at zzso zzso at zzso and zzso at zzso The most common sequence of the measured values was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but the sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also zzso It is concluded that the gas exchange responses to developing zzso metabolism during progressive exercise can be characterized by a series of zzso However, the considerable variation in absolute values in the two testing occasions requires further zzso
