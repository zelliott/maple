A zzso analysis of particle behavior during zzso optical particle separation was zzso A new zzso number, zzso was defined as the ratio of the optical force to the viscous drag force, and the effects of varying S on particle motion were zzso For large zzso the particles undergo zzso zzso and release as they pass through the laser zzso The retention distance is much longer for large S than for small zzso In addition, the effects on particle behavior of varying the wavelength of the laser zzso the particle size, and the index of refraction of the particles were zzso Furthermore, an zzso expression of the retention distance for large S was zzso
