Sales forecasting plays a very prominent role in business zzso Numerous investigations addressing this problem have generally employed statistical methods, such as zzso or zzso and moving average zzso However, sales forecasting is very complicated zzso to influence by internal and external zzso Recently, artificial neural networks zzso have also been applied in sales forecasting since their promising performances in the areas of control and pattern zzso However, further improvement is still necessary since unique circumstances, zzso promotion, cause a sudden change in the sales zzso Thus, this study zzso a proposed fuzzy neural network zzso which is able to eliminate the zzso zzso for the sake of learning fuzzy zzso rules obtained from the marketing experts with respect to zzso The result from zzso is further integrated with the time series data through an zzso Both the simulated and real-world problem results show that zzso with weight elimination can have lower training error compared with the regular zzso Besides, real-world problem results also indicate that the proposed zzso system zzso the conventional statistical method and single ANN in zzso
