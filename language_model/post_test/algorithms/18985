A translation of Systems Biology zzso Language zzso into a process algebra is proposed in order to allow the formal zzso the simulation and the formal analysis of biological zzso zzso a language with a quantitative zzso extension, is chosen for the zzso The proposed translation focuses on the main components of zzso models, as species and zzso Furthermore, it zzso the compositional property, zzso the translation of the whole model is obtained by zzso the translation of the zzso An automatic translator tool of zzso models into zzso has been implemented as zzso Finally, the translation of a simple model is zzso
