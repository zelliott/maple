zzso and structure of the cardiac wall can be assessed zzso by imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance zzso zzso the zzso that zzso the observed deformation and structure is critical for clinical zzso However, much about the genesis of deformation and structure is zzso In the present zzso model study, we zzso that zzso locally adapt their orientation to achieve minimal zzso fiber zzso strain during the cardiac zzso This hypothesis was tested in a zzso finite element model of left zzso zzso mechanics by zzso of tissue zzso and subsequent adaptation of initial zzso zzso towards those in the zzso zzso As a consequence of adaptation, local tissue peak stress, strain during ejection and stroke work density were all found to increase by at least zzso as well as to become 50% more homogeneous throughout the zzso Global zzso work zzso zzso pressure, stroke volume and stroke work) increased significantly as well zzso The zzso zzso zzso were found to be similar to those in zzso To the best of our knowledge the presented model is the first that is able to simultaneously predict a realistic zzso structure as well as to account for the zzso observed zzso in local zzso
