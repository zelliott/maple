A zzso based system was developed to acquire and zzso images of biological specimens for the purpose of zzso zzso and zzso The system uses a video camera to capture images of biological samples either directly or through a zzso The signal from the camera is digitized by an imaging board for subsequent processing through a zzso From the processed image, simple features such as the cell enclosed area and the cell optical density were extracted for the purpose of cell identification or zzso Two examples: zzso the zzso of DNA in blood cells and zzso the identification of zzso cells are given to illustrate the use of the zzso The method is versatile and can easily be modified to adapt to other biological zzso
