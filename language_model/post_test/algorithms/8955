zzso influential zzso in very large-scale directed networks is a big challenge relevant to disparate applications, such as accelerating information zzso controlling rumors and diseases, designing search engines, and understanding zzso organization of social and biological zzso Known methods range from zzso zzso such as degree, closeness and zzso to zzso zzso like zzso and zzso Some of these methods already take into account the influences of a zzso neighbors but do not directly make use of the interactions among it's zzso Local zzso is known to have negative impacts on the information zzso We further show zzso that it also plays a negative role in generating local zzso Inspired by these facts, we propose a local ranking zzso named zzso which takes into account not only the number of neighbors and the neighbors' zzso but also the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso spreading model with constant zzso experimental results on two directed networks, a social network extracted from zzso and a large-scale zzso communication network, demonstrate that the zzso zzso some benchmark zzso such as zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso can also be applied to zzso networks where the superiority of zzso is significant compared with degree zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso only making use of local information, is much more efficient than global zzso It takes only 191 seconds for a network with about zzso see zzso zzso more than 15 times faster than zzso
