The prediction method for the plasma zzso profile of zzso zzso a potent stimulant of zzso release present in beer after oral zzso in rats was examined using the previously developed zzso zzso Model, with the addition of a process of zzso zzso zzso zzso red was used as a zzso marker for zzso of the zzso transit rate constant for eight segments in the zzso zzso The first order zzso rate constant for each segment was estimated by means of a conventional in zzso closed loop zzso The results of in zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso is well absorbed in the small zzso especially in the zzso and zzso Using the zzso Model, it was demonstrated that more than zzso of orally zzso zzso is absorbed in the small zzso and that the substantial zzso site for zzso in zzso is the lower zzso and the zzso However, the observed zzso was only zzso The in zzso metabolism study clarified that zzso is zzso in the liver, but not in the zzso zzso With the zzso intrinsic clearance value zzso zzso calculated from the rate of metabolism in zzso the zzso availability was estimated to be zzso on the basis of a well stirred model, which was validated by two other methods to calculate the zzso availability of zzso The plasma zzso curve and zzso of zzso after oral zzso were well predicted by the zzso Model with the zzso zzso metabolism zzso
