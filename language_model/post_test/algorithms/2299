This study was designed to test the hypothesis that the detection of zzso zzso due to deep zzso zzso zzso can be enhanced by computer zzso 

Immediate zzso and zzso delay images from 25 patient studies obtained with zzso zzso zzso were paired into 125 image sets zzso including A, P knees, A, P calves and A zzso After zzso aligning the image pairs, the zzso activity obtained from the immediate image was removed from the delayed image to produce a zzso zzso zzso zzso data zzso and computer processed images zzso were presented to novice readers as part of a receiver operator characteristic zzso comparison zzso The image interpreters were asked to provide independent diagnostic assessment at 250 limb sites using both zzso Image intensity and color scale zzso were freely zzso Three readers were presented with images adjusted with optimal image contrast as judged by an observer with knowledge of the correct zzso 

The area under the zzso curve zzso a measure of the zzso zzso for these readers was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Four readers whose images were not zzso showed zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Average diagnostic decision time for all readers, per limb site, was zzso zzso zzso zzso m zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso reader accuracy is improved with computer processed images when image intensity and contrast factors are zzso Computer processing can provide zzso images that minimize zzso blood background activity and allow greater interpreter decision zzso
