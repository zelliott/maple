zzso between zzso vessels represent important links in the vascular network, but the complexity of three-dimensional zzso organization has been difficult to zzso This study describes the development of a custom software package called zzso zzso zzso Network Analysis of zzso that automatically extracts vessel dimensions and the distribution of zzso connections from high-resolution zzso zzso scans of zzso zzso zzso zzso although the method could be applied to other zzso Manual and automated analyses of vessel networks yielded similar results, with the automated method generating orders of magnitude more data in a fraction of the zzso In zzso zzso zzso all vessels and all zzso connections among 115 vessels were located, and the connections were analyzed for their zzso distribution, orientation, and predicted shared wall zzso zzso connections were more frequent in lateral than in zzso zzso The zzso network, in combination with commercial software, was used to zzso vessel networks in zzso The zzso volume renderings of vessel networks were freely rotated for observation from any angle, and the zzso virtual serial sections were capable of being viewed in any plane, revealing aspects of vessel organization not possible with traditional serial zzso
