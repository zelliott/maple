This paper outlines a simple, fast, and accurate method for automatically locating the zzso on digitized zzso that have been segmented to reveal the zzso zzso If the average zzso of the intensity is zzso in the direction normal to the interface and directed inside the breast, it is found that there is a sudden and distinct change in this zzso close to the zzso A zzso in profile is located between two successive zzso of this zzso otherwise, it is near the global zzso Specifically, the zzso is located midway between a successive maximum and minimum of the zzso of the average intensity zzso these being local turning points for a zzso in profile and global zzso The method has been tested on 24 images, including both zzso and zzso views, from two digital mammogram zzso For 23 of the images zzso the zzso error was less than 1 zzso at image resolutions of 400 zzso and zzso zzso per zzso Because of its zzso and because it is based both on the observed behavior of zzso tissue zzso and on zzso this method has the potential to become a generic method for locating the zzso on zzso
