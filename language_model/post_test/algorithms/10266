In this study, dose rate distribution around a zzso zzso zzso source, from a zzso zzso zzso remote zzso system used in zzso zzso has been determined using experimental and zzso Carlo simulation zzso zzso Carlo simulations were performed using zzso code, for a single zzso source in water medium and zzso and zzso were performed in zzso phantom material using zzso zzso zzso Absolute dose rate distribution and the zzso zzso such as dose rate constant, zzso dose functions, and zzso functions, were obtained for a single zzso zzso In order to investigate the effect of the zzso and surrounding zzso on zzso parameters of the source, the simulations were repeated for six different arrangements with a single active source and five zzso zzso inside central metallic tubing of a zzso zzso zzso In commercial treatment planning systems zzso the zzso effects of the zzso and inactive zzso on total dose are zzso The results indicate that this effect could lead to zzso of the calculated zzso by up to zzso along the zzso axis of the zzso especially beyond the zzso zzso According to the results obtained in this study, in a real situation in treatment of patients using zzso zzso zzso and using several active zzso there will be a large zzso between the result of zzso and zzso Carlo zzso
