One important purpose of conducting gene expression experiments is to understand the correlation of gene expression profiles to disease zzso Based on the notion of emerging patterns and an zzso zzso method, we discover groups of genes that are correlated to disease states in a significant zzso In each group, every member gene constrained by a specific expression zzso unanimously occurs only in one type of cells with a zzso large frequency, but never unanimously happens in the other types of zzso According to our studies on the colon tumor zzso such gene groups (also called zzso can reach a frequency of zzso providing good insight into the correlation of gene expression profiles to disease zzso The patterns can be used to correctly predict whether a new cell is normal or zzso
