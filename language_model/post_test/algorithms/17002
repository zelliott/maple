The process of collecting ground reaction force data by mounting a zzso beneath a treadmill belt has the advantage that numerous walking trials can be analyzed without the problem of subjects zzso their zzso However, a potential problem is that the measured forces represent a zzso of bilateral force profiles during the double support phase of zzso To address this issue, an zzso is described for zzso superimposed ground reaction force data into individual left and right zzso It is based on an examination of the zzso zzso of the measured center of pressure zzso Whenever the measured zzso exceeds a certain zzso it is assumed that the person is being supported by a single zzso and the measured zzso data reflect the forces under that zzso zzso when the measured zzso indicates that both feet are on the zzso it is assumed that the location of the individual zzso under each foot is given by zzso and zzso These quantities reflect the greatest excursion of the measured zzso towards the left and right sides of the zzso zzso With this zzso individual zzso profiles can be calculated by means of solving two simultaneous zzso describing the equilibrium of forces in the vertical direction, and one describing the equilibrium of moments about an zzso axis of the zzso The zzso describing this procedure is simple enough to be implemented on a spreadsheet and yields estimates for average force, zzso peak force and stance time that are typically within zzso of the true zzso
