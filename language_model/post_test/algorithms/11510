This paper presents a novel zzso for data zzso of single lead zzso zzso zzso The method is based on zzso modeling of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso high frequency reconstruction is achieved by separately modeling the low and the high frequency regions of the transformed zzso zzso Pulse Code zzso is applied on the model parameters to obtain a further increase in the zzso zzso ratios up to 1:40 were achieved without significant zzso
