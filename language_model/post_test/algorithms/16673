The zzso state of the zzso and two muscle zzso layers has been zzso but their zzso response has not, because muscle dissection may not leave zzso specimens intact for zzso zzso The zzso behavior of the zzso zzso esophagus was investigated in this study, through light microscopic examination and zzso tension, with two-dimensional strain measurement in pairs of zzso oriented zzso The two-dimensional zzso zzso function described suitably the zzso tissue response, zzso faithful simulations to our zzso zzso in the zzso content and zzso were identified as a function of layer, topography, and orientation, zzso the zzso differences zzso In view of the failure and zzso material zzso the zzso was stronger and stiffer than muscle, zzso it with a higher collagen zzso A notable topographical distribution was apparent, with data for the abdominal region differentiated from that for the cervical region, zzso to the existence of inner muscle with a zzso arrangement and of outer muscle with a zzso arrangement in the former region, and of both muscle layers with zzso arrangement in the latter region, with zzso esophagus being a transition zzso zzso from the zzso was stronger and stiffer zzso relating with a preferential collagen reinforcement along that zzso but more zzso in the zzso zzso
