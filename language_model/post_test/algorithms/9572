zzso reaction zzso of a series of aromatic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was compared to propose a unifying reaction zzso zzso studies were conducted in zzso solutions containing zzso in the pH range zzso with zzso and zzso The zzso zzso profiles were compared to previously reported profiles for the reactions of zzso and zzso or zzso zzso of zzso basic aromatic zzso involved the addition of the zzso zzso to the zzso sugar leading to zzso formation followed by specific acid zzso zzso All of the zzso profiles displayed characteristic downward bend at pH 4-5 due to a change from zzso addition to zzso In the zzso profile for zzso a second downward bend was observed in the pH region zzso This feature was absent for the other zzso and was attributed to differences in zzso of the two zzso states of the alpha zzso acid in zzso This stabilization was not possible for the other zzso zzso
