zzso motion intentions in zzso zzso zzso is a demanding task as the recorded zzso signal is not only noisy and has limited spatial resolution but it is also zzso zzso The zzso in the signal may come from many different sources, for instance, zzso zzso muscular activity or changes of task involvement, and often deteriorate zzso zzso This is mainly because features extracted by standard methods like common spatial patterns zzso are not zzso to variations of the signal properties, thus should also change over zzso Although many extensions of zzso were proposed to, for example, reduce the sensitivity to noise or incorporate information from other subjects, none of them tackles the zzso problem zzso In this paper, we propose a method which zzso zzso towards stationary zzso zzso and show that this increases zzso zzso especially for subjects who are hardly able to control a zzso We compare our method with the state-of-the-art approaches on different zzso show competitive results and zzso the reasons for the zzso
