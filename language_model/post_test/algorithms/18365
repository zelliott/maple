The analysis of previously evolved rhythmic zzso random zzso networks zzso 59 (2001) zzso reveals common zzso characteristics indicating that rhythm originates from a circular functional zzso The rhythm generating core of the network has the form of a closed ring which operates as a zzso zzso by supporting a travelling wave of state change; the size of the ring zzso well with the period of zzso The remaining zzso in the network are either stationary or follow the activity of the ring without feeding back into it so as to form a coherent zzso zzso are typically formed early on in the evolutionary search zzso zzso long chains of zzso are zzso before they close upon themselves to zzso Analysis of zzso networks with zzso zzso zzso zzso reveals no such common zzso zzso These results have been obtained using statistical analysis and a specifically developed bottom-up pruning zzso This zzso works from local interactions to global zzso by eliminating redundant zzso The suitability of the zzso has been confirmed by both zzso and single zzso zzso The ring zzso solution for the generation of rhythm implies that it will be harder to evolve rhythmic networks for big sizes and small periods and for bigger number of connections per zzso These trends are confirmed zzso Finally, the identified mechanisms are zzso to zzso rhythmic networks of different periods showing that a low number of connections zzso for a large variety of zzso Random zzso update forces the evolved solutions to be highly robust maintaining their performance in the presence of intrinsic zzso The biological implications of such robust designs for molecular clocks are zzso
