We investigate the evolutionary dynamics of an idealized model for the robust zzso of two-dimensional structures called zzso The model includes rules that zzso interactions between sets of square tiles that drive the zzso zzso The relationship between the zzso rule set and its resulting zzso structure can be viewed as a zzso map and incorporated into a genetic zzso The rule sets evolve under selection for specified target zzso The corresponding complex fitness landscape generates rich evolutionary dynamics as a function of parameters such as the population size, search space size, zzso rate, and method of zzso Furthermore, these systems are simple enough that in some cases the associated model zzso space can be completely zzso shedding light on how the evolutionary dynamics depends on the detailed structure of the fitness zzso Finally, we apply the model to study the emergence of the preference for zzso over zzso symmetry observed for zzso protein zzso
