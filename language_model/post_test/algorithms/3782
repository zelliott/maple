We studied the age distribution of duplicate genes in each of four zzso zzso human, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The four zzso differ greatly from each other, contrary to the previous proposal of a universal L-shaped distribution in all zzso zzso zzso Indeed, only the distribution in humans is zzso The distribution in zzso is consistent with the hypothesis of an ancient zzso zzso with no recent burst of zzso events, while the distribution in zzso zzso is nearly zzso We also applied a zzso method to the human distribution to show that the rate of loss of duplicate genes decreases over time, contrary to the proposal of an exponential zzso One possible explanation of the decreasing rate of loss of duplicate genes over time could be rapid functional divergence between duplicate zzso providing an advantage for the retention of both zzso
