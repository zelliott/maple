zzso often reveals the existence of zzso distinct cellular zzso However, additional characterization of observed zzso can be limited by the number of zzso markers that can be simultaneously zzso Here we present a zzso approach for zzso profiling cellular zzso by freeing one or more imaging channels to monitor additional zzso In our approach, we trained zzso to zzso zzso accurately based on an enhanced collection of zzso features extracted from only a subset of the original zzso Then we constructed zzso profiles zzso from replicate experiments, in which cells were labeled with different but overlapping marker zzso We applied our approach to identify molecular differences among zzso and to identify functional groupings of zzso in populations of zzso mouse zzso polarizing human zzso cells and dividing human cancer zzso
