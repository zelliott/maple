The growing clinical use of MR zzso requires the development of new quantitative standards for measuring tissue zzso Here, we examine a soft tissue mimicking phantom material zzso over a wide frequency range zzso zzso to zzso zzso The recorded data are fit to a cohort of zzso models of varying complexity zzso and fractional zzso This was accomplished using multiple sample sizes by employing geometric focusing of the zzso wave front to compensate for the changes in wavelength and zzso over this broad range of zzso The simple zzso geometry and zzso wave front of this experiment allows us to calculate the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso The data were fit to several common models of linear zzso including those with fractional zzso operators, and we identified the best possible matches over both a limited frequency band zzso used in clinical zzso and over the entire frequency span zzso In addition to demonstrating the superior capability of the fractional order zzso models, this study highlights the advantages of measuring the zzso zzso zzso over as wide a range of zzso as zzso
