zzso analysis is a widespread procedure in zzso to assess the possible presence of zzso zzso The procedure is lengthy and zzso so that an automatic analysis would greatly help the zzso routine zzso Still, automatic zzso and full zzso of zzso are open zzso We propose an automatic procedure to obtain the separated zzso which are then ready for a subsequent zzso zzso The zzso is carried out by means of a zzso zzso zzso which proved to be successful even in presence of zzso or zzso regions in the zzso Then, the tree of choices to resolve touching and overlapping zzso is zzso zzso choosing the best combination of cuts and zzso based on geometric evidence and image zzso We show the effectiveness of the proposed method on routine data acquired with different zzso setup at different zzso from 162 images of 117 cells totaling zzso zzso zzso of the zzso were correctly zzso solving zzso of the zzso and zzso of the zzso In order to provide the scientific community with a public zzso the data used in this paper are available for public zzso
