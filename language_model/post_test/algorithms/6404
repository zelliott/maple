Associated movements zzso are a classical diagnostic tool to assess differences between normal children and children with some motor zzso This paper presents a methodology to produce zzso and zzso zzso for zzso of normal children, for various tasks of a test zzso Data available consist of separate ratings of duration and extent of zzso which are zzso quantities with few zzso Other problems are severe zzso and zzso zzso (as well as some zzso leaving little information for analysis at older zzso To get a better scale, we combined the two zzso ratings into one meaningful and zzso quantity referred to as intensity of zzso In order to solve problems due to zzso zzso and zzso we assumed zzso , zzso and zzso values, zzso We considered a censored zzso problem and zzso a truncated normal distribution for the zzso values (after an appropriate transformation of the zzso Using zzso and zzso poor man's data zzso algorithm, together with the technique of linear mixed effects zzso useful zzso could be zzso In contrast to the cumulative probabilities approach for zzso data, our methodology allows the calculation of individual zzso and zzso values, which puts us in a position to investigate numerous scientific zzso
