This study assessed the process of gastrointestinal drug zzso in zzso using zzso 

zzso was used as a model probe and was orally administered to rats as a zzso PET scans were obtained of the whole body and abdominal region under conscious and zzso zzso Blood samples were routinely taken from the zzso vein during zzso The rate of gastric zzso and zzso zzso of zzso was estimated from the time profiles of zzso in the stomach and small zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso was used in an zzso zzso experiment to compare the zzso zzso of zzso with that of zzso 

In conscious rats, gastrointestinal zzso of zzso was zzso by the process of zzso membrane zzso because the zzso of zzso through the zzso membrane was low compared with that of zzso In zzso rats, the gastric zzso rate of zzso decreased dramatically whereas the zzso zzso rate constant was not significantly different from that in conscious zzso As a result, the zzso step of gastrointestinal zzso of zzso was shifted to the gastric zzso process by zzso 

PET technology is a powerful tool for in zzso analysis of the gastrointestinal zzso of orally administered zzso
