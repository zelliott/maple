zzso are zzso zzso that regulate gene expression including differentiation and development by either zzso translation or inducing target zzso The aim of this study is to determine the zzso expression signature during human pancreatic development and to identify potential zzso gene targets calculating correlations between the signature zzso and their corresponding zzso targets, predicted by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso signature of human fetal pancreatic samples zzso weeks of zzso age zzso was obtained by zzso high zzso screening with zzso Low zzso zzso This method led to identification of 212 zzso The zzso were classified in 3 groups: Group number I contains 4 zzso with the increasing zzso II, 35 zzso with decreasing profile and III with 173 zzso which remain zzso We calculated zzso correlations between the expression profile of zzso and target zzso predicted by zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso zzso expression zzso Group I correlated with the decreasing expression of 142 target zzso and Group II with the increasing expression of 876 target zzso Most zzso correlate with multiple targets, just as zzso are targeted by multiple zzso Among the identified targets are the genes and zzso factors known to play an essential role in pancreatic zzso 

We have determined specific groups of zzso in human fetal zzso that change the degree of their expression throughout the zzso A negative zzso analysis suggests an intertwined network of zzso and zzso collaborating with each zzso This study provides information leading to potential zzso level of zzso control regulating gene expression through zzso targeting multiple zzso and, conversely, target zzso regulated in parallel by other zzso as zzso This study may further the understanding of gene expression regulation in the human developing zzso
