In this work, a powerful zzso spectral zzso technique, zzso zzso moving average modeling zzso has been applied to contrast transfer function zzso detection in electron zzso zzso techniques such as auto zzso zzso and zzso models allow a more exact determination of the zzso than traditional methods based only on the zzso transform of the complete image or parts of it and performing some average zzso zzso Previous works revealed that zzso models can be used to improve zzso zzso and the detection of its zzso zzso models reduce the model order and the computing time, and more interestingly, achieve increased zzso zzso models are generated from electron zzso zzso images, and then a zzso search zzso is used to fit all the parameters of a theoretical zzso model in the zzso model previously zzso Furthermore, this adjustment is truly zzso allowing zzso images to be properly zzso Finally, an individual zzso can be assigned to every point of the zzso by means of an zzso at the functional level, provided that a zzso has been estimated in each one of a set of local zzso The user need only know a few a zzso parameters of the experimental conditions of his zzso for turning this technique into an automatic and very powerful tool for zzso determination, prior to zzso correction in zzso The programs developed for the above tasks have been integrated into the zzso zzso Image zzso Package zzso software package, and are fully accessible at zzso
