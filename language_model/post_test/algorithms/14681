In recent years, interest in zzso zzso has zzso Even though zzso and zzso relations determine together the optimal drug dose, age-related changes in zzso have proven of utmost importance for zzso drug dosing in zzso 

zzso in zzso studies result in data sets with specific characteristics requiring advanced analysis and validation approaches which are discussed in conjunction with directions for future zzso 

Advances have been made in the development of descriptive zzso zzso models for specific drugs and age zzso and in the identification of analysis and diagnostic tools for zzso model building and zzso while sharing of data between academia and/or industry has proven crucial for limiting additional burden in zzso Even though progress is being made, currently none of the zzso approaches has proven of universal value for extrapolations to other age ranges and/or other zzso 

The focus of future research should be on the development of zzso and validated zzso models for specific elimination routes that have zzso and zzso potential, making them of use in designing zzso to derive zzso doses and zzso dosing guidelines in zzso
