A new technique of design and reconstruction of a color zzso is zzso The design is based on an zzso zzso zzso zzso It allows to zzso three different images for a reconstruction at various distances measured from the zzso zzso The distances are calculated in order to obtain a fine color compound image when the zzso is illuminated by three laser beams of zzso zzso A single light phase zzso is used instead of zzso The reconstructed red, green and blue component images remain in an exact match in size and zzso The zzso color image is reconstructed at a zzso distance and its color pattern can be easily controlled by the choice of the three input component zzso
