The purpose of this study was to investigate the zzso origin of primary central nervous system zzso zzso with respect to stage of zzso differentiation and to identify zzso markers in a cohort of patients with zzso treated with zzso high-dose zzso zzso 

This study included 33 patients with zzso treated with high-dose zzso zzso at the Massachusetts General Hospital for whom archival tumor tissue was zzso All 33 patients tested negative for zzso The zzso were zzso zzso according to the zzso system, as modified in the WHO zzso zzso for the following zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso and multiplex zzso for zzso were also zzso 

There were 17 women and 16 men zzso with a median age of 60 zzso All tumors were diffuse large zzso zzso Of the 23 cases that could be zzso 22 were zzso and 1 was zzso Twenty-six of 33 tumors were zzso 6 of 32 tumors were zzso 27 of 29 tumors were zzso 31 of 32 tumors were zzso 11 of 31 tumors were zzso 4 of 33 tumors were zzso and 0 of 32 tumors were zzso There were 18 of 32 zzso complete responses and 8 of 32 zzso partial responses to methotrexate, whereas 6 of 33 zzso progressed during zzso Ten patients died of zzso zzso of zzso was significantly associated with longer overall survival zzso zzso zzso median survival, 101 versus zzso months, with approximately zzso lower confidence limits of zzso and zzso months, zzso 

In this group of 33 patients with zzso expression of zzso was significantly associated with longer overall zzso zzso warrants further investigation as a potentially important zzso marker in this zzso
