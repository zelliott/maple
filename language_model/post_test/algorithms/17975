Our goal is to study the human brain anatomical zzso For this, the anatomical connection probabilities zzso between 90 cortical and zzso brain gray matter areas are estimated from zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso zzso The zzso between any two areas gives the probability that those areas are connected at least by a single nervous zzso Then, the brain is modeled as a zzso weighted graph with continuous arc weights given by the zzso zzso Based on this approach, complex networks properties such as zzso zzso efficiency, degree distribution, vulnerability, zzso zzso and motifs composition are zzso The analysis was carried out for 20 right-handed healthy subjects zzso age: zzso zzso zzso According to the results, all networks have zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, human brain anatomical networks present bigger local efficiency and smaller global efficiency than the corresponding random zzso In a vulnerability and zzso zzso analysis, the most indispensable and critical anatomical areas were zzso zzso zzso zzso superior zzso and superior zzso Interestingly, some areas have a negative vulnerability zzso superior zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which suggest that even at the cost of losing in global anatomical efficiency, these structures were maintained through the evolutionary processes due to their important zzso Finally, symmetrical characteristic building blocks zzso of size 3 and 4 were zzso obtaining that motifs of size 4 are the expanded version of motif of size zzso These results are in agreement with previous anatomical studies in the cat and zzso cerebral zzso
