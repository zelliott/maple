zzso second moment of zzso interactions zzso and correlation time zzso dynamics zzso were measured by zzso zzso in combination with inverse zzso transform for a series of zzso and filled zzso samples as functions of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso chain interactions which dramatically restrict the mobility of bound rubber modify the dynamics of mobile zzso These changes depend on the zzso content and can be evaluated from zzso of zzso A zzso filter was applied to eliminate the contribution of bound zzso In the first approach the zzso zzso were fitted with a theoretical relationship to obtain the average values of the zzso residual second moment zzso and correlation time zzso For the mobile zzso segments the zzso distribution of correlation function was compared to the exponential correlation function and found inadequate in the long-time zzso In the second approach a zzso distribution for the correlation time was zzso Furthermore, using an averaged value of the correlation time, the zzso of the residual second moment were determined using an inverse zzso transform for the entire series of measured zzso The zzso zzso sample shows a zzso distribution of residual second moments, which can be associated to the mobile zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the second one associated to the dangling chains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By restraining the mobility of bound zzso the zzso zzso induce diversity in the zzso dynamics like the apparition of a distinct mobile component and changes in the distribution of mobile and zzso zzso zzso
