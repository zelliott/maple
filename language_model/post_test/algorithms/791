The search for DNA regions with low complexity is one of the pivotal tasks of modern structural analysis of complete zzso The low complexity may be zzso by strong inequality in zzso content zzso zzso by tandem or dispersed repeats or by zzso structures, as well as by a combination of all these zzso Several zzso measures of zzso complexity, including zzso and linguistic ones, together with complexity zzso using a modified zzso algorithm, have been implemented in a software tool called zzso zzso The software enables a user to search for zzso regions in long zzso zzso complete bacterial zzso or zzso zzso In addition, it estimates the complexity of groups of aligned zzso
