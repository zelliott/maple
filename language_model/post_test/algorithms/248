Single point imaging methods such as zzso are often the technique of choice for imaging zzso zzso in zzso Single point imaging sequences based on zzso in their conventional form are ill-suited for in zzso applications since the acquisition time is long and the zzso is zzso A new sequence design is presented employing variable repetition times and variable flip angles in order to improve the characteristics of zzso for in zzso zzso The achievable acquisition time savings as well as zzso reductions and/or zzso increases afforded by this approach were investigated using a resolution phantom as well as zzso zzso Imaging results in zzso indicate that acquisition times may be reduced by up to zzso and the zzso may be reduced by zzso without an appreciable loss of image zzso
