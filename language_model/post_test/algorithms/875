In a previous paper we introduced a novel zzso approach zzso to the problem of identifying peptides via tandem mass zzso for which early zzso showed promising zzso We recently further improved this performance to a remarkable level zzso false positive rate at zzso true positive zzso and characterized key properties of zzso like zzso and training set zzso We present these results in a synthetic and coherent way along with detailed performance zzso a new scoring component making use of zzso zzso zzso zzso and new developments like automatic zzso zzso Finally, we discuss the impact of zzso on the automation of zzso zzso
