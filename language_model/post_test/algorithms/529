The zzso is a zzso method for evaluating varying degrees of zzso zzso as they relate to learning abilities and zzso It consists of the identification of simple stimuli which are masked within a complex zzso according to their exact size, dimension, direction, spatial orientation, and shape within a limited span of zzso This test has been successfully applied in clinical settings for the assessment of cognitive abilities and disorders in young and elderly zzso This investigation aimed to examine the neural zzso of zzso visual zzso processes as measured by the zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso was recorded during the administration of a zzso version of the zzso in twelve young healthy zzso Multiple linear zzso analysis was applied to estimate the overall brain zzso during task zzso In addition, the zzso response area was correlated with task difficulty, in order to explore the spatial distribution of brain regions modulated by increasing task zzso zzso indicate that a widely distributed bilateral network of brain regions, including the zzso and zzso zzso cortex, zzso zzso frontal and supplementary eye field, zzso prefrontal cortex, and supplementary motor area, was significantly activated during test zzso Moreover, increasing difficulty significantly enhanced the neural response of zzso and zzso zzso regions, frontal eye field, and superior zzso zzso zzso as well as the right zzso prefrontal zzso zzso neural activity in the left zzso zzso inferior frontal zzso and bilateral zzso zzso zzso was zzso correlated with task zzso zzso also indicate that performance in the zzso requires an optimal integration between the enhancement of activity in specific zzso cortical areas and suppression of interfering noise from unrelated brain zzso
