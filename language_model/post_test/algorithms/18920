zzso zzso during the evolution of protein families give rise to zzso positions that contain important structural and functional zzso However, a high background composed of random noise and zzso components interferes with the identification of zzso zzso 

We have developed a zzso simple and general method based on information theory that accurately estimates the level of background mutual information for each pair of positions in a given protein zzso zzso of this background results in a zzso zzso that correctly identifies substantially more zzso positions in protein families than any existing zzso A significant fraction of these positions zzso strongly with one or only a few zzso The vast majority of such position pairs are in contact in representative zzso The identification of strongly zzso position pairs can be used to impose significant structural limitations and should be an important additional constraint for zzso zzso protein zzso 

zzso and program files can be found in the zzso zzso
