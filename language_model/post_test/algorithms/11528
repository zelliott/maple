The theory underlying a new method for the identification of zzso systems is zzso The method uses singular value decomposition to obtain zzso estimates of zzso impulse response functions from an ensemble of zzso zzso No a zzso assumptions regarding the system structure or form of the zzso are required and there are few restrictions on the input zzso zzso studies, using a model of zzso joint zzso show that the method can track rapid changes in system dynamics accurately and is robust in the presence of output zzso An application of the method is demonstrated by using it to track dynamic ankle zzso during a zzso zzso zzso zzso During the transient phase of the contraction, zzso ankle zzso gain decreased in a manner which could not be described with the zzso model of joint dynamics often used under stationary zzso
