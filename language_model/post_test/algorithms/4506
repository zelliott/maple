The zzso protein zzso is crucial to outer hair cell zzso zzso and contributes to the sensitivity and frequency selectivity of zzso zzso The molecular mechanisms of zzso remain zzso but zzso is zzso to function as both a zzso sensor and a molecular zzso zzso the role of zzso requires characterizing its organization and behavior in the plasma zzso Fluorescence recovery after zzso zzso provides a powerful means to zzso study molecular zzso However, zzso are inherently fragile ex zzso and dynamic studies of zzso require model systems, such as human embryonic kidney zzso cells, expressing zzso labeled zzso zzso this system, we provide the first zzso quantitative measurement of zzso lateral zzso The results show remarkably different diffusion behavior for zzso fluorescent protein zzso as compared to a control zzso human zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso experiments reveal immobile zzso approaching zzso low effective diffusion zzso and recovery times slower than those of zzso Secondary zzso of a region reveals distinctly different diffusion zzso which we propose reflect the transient confinement of zzso in the zzso zzso Although zzso zzso interactions between zzso and the membrane and/or zzso may be important for the unique properties of zzso in zzso zzso
