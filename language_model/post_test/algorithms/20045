This paper investigates the global bounded consensus problem of networked zzso systems consisting of zzso zzso zzso dynamics with the communication zzso zzso We derive globally bounded controlled consensus conditions for both zzso and zzso conditions based on the zzso functional zzso The proposed consensus criteria ensure that all agents eventually move along the desired trajectory in the sense of zzso Meanwhile, the bounded consensus criteria can be viewed as an extension of the case of identical agent dynamics to the case of zzso agent zzso We finally demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results by means of a zzso zzso
