Much research has been dedicated to large-scale protein interaction networks including the analysis of zzso zzso network zzso and the relation of zzso to zzso interaction zzso zzso locally significant proteins that mediate the function of zzso is still an open zzso 

We use a layered zzso zzso for interaction networks, which groups proteins by the similarity of their direct zzso We identify locally significant zzso called zzso which link different zzso We apply the zzso to a zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso are organized in zzso where clusters are zzso by and act as zzso for other zzso We compare the clusters and zzso to known zzso complexes and find agreement with precision of zzso and recall of zzso We analyzed the functions, processes and locations of zzso and zzso We found that zzso of zzso to a cluster are enriched with a set of diverse processes and locations, often related to zzso of zzso Additionally, zzso of clusters are enriched with one or more zzso The important role of zzso is further zzso by a comparatively higher degree of conservation across zzso We illustrate the above findings with an example of membrane protein zzso from the zzso to the inner nuclear zzso
