We propose and describe a new class of optical modes consisting of zzso of three zzso modes which can be supported by a zzso zzso zzso modulated by two zzso zzso These zzso bear a close, but not zzso formal zzso to the zzso quantum states involved in zzso and its attendant slow light propagation zzso Of particular interest is the zzso which we call the dark mode in which, in zzso with the dark state of zzso one of the three zzso zzso modes is not zzso This mode has unique zzso characteristics that translate into a slow light propagation which possesses high zzso product and can form the basis for a new generation of optical zzso and zzso
