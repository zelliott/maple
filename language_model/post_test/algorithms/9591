A great need exists for prediction of zzso response for the generation of zzso toward protein zzso Earlier studies have suggested that prediction methods based on zzso propensity scale, in which the degree of exposure of the zzso acid in an zzso zzso is zzso has limited zzso Here, we show a comparative analysis based on zzso zzso zzso generated in a standardized manner against human zzso protein zzso The zzso response zzso was measured and compared to theoretical predictions based on a large number zzso of published propensity zzso The results show that some of the scales have zzso power, although the overall zzso correlation zzso is relatively low zzso even for the best performing zzso acid zzso Based on the current data set, a new propensity scale was calculated with a zzso correlation zzso of zzso The values correlated in some extent to earlier zzso including large penalty for zzso and zzso zzso and high positive contribution from zzso zzso but with relatively low positive contribution from basic zzso The fraction of zzso generating low zzso responses was reduced from zzso to around zzso if zzso with a high propensity score zzso were selected as compared to zzso with lower scores zzso The study demonstrates that a propensity scale might be useful for prediction of zzso response generated by zzso of zzso protein zzso The data set presented here can be used for further studies to design new prediction tools for the generation of zzso to specific protein zzso
