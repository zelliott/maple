zzso scenery depth is a fundamental task in computer vision, with many applications in manufacturing, zzso or zzso relying on accurate scenery zzso zzso cameras can provide depth information in real-time and overcome zzso of traditional stereo zzso However, they provide limited spatial resolution and sophisticated zzso zzso are sought zzso In this paper, we present a sensor fusion approach to zzso super resolution, based on the combination of depth and texture zzso Unlike other texture guided approaches, we interpret the depth zzso process as a weighted energy zzso zzso Three different weights are introduced, employing different available sensor zzso The individual weights address object boundaries in depth, depth sensor noise, and zzso zzso zzso in consecutive order, they form three weighting strategies for zzso super zzso zzso evaluations show advantages in depth accuracy and for depth image based rendering compared with state-of-the-art depth zzso zzso view synthesis evaluation shows a significant increase in viewer preference by a factor of four in zzso viewing zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first extensive zzso test performed on zzso depth zzso zzso and zzso results proof the suitability of our approach to zzso super resolution approach for depth scenery zzso
