zzso methods of phase determination have played an important role in determining zzso zzso from difference zzso of zzso crystal pairs or zzso containing zzso scattering zzso The minimal zzso zzso procedure is one of the most successful direct methods for zzso zzso zzso The computer program zzso which zzso the zzso procedure and is part of the protein zzso package zzso has recently been zzso for rapid and automated zzso zzso Specifically, zzso has been upgraded with zzso a newly developed statistical minimal function for higher success rates, zzso an optimal zzso grid size for dramatic zzso improvement, zzso a dynamic figure of merit for automatic zzso detection and zzso a strategy of zzso of anomalous differences with zzso zzso differences for virtually guaranteed zzso zzso
