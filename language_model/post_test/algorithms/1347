Variation in soft tissue composition is a potential cause of error in dual X-ray zzso zzso zzso of bone mineral density zzso We investigated the effect of patients' change of weight on zzso scans in 152 women enrolled in a zzso trial of cyclical zzso zzso zzso of the spine, hip, and total body were performed at zzso 1 and 2 years on a zzso zzso The study was completed by 135 subjects zzso on zzso 71 on zzso zzso were expressed as the percentage change in zzso zzso zzso neck, total zzso or bone mineral content zzso body only) at 2 zzso Total body scans were analyzed using the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Analysis was performed using zzso zzso with percentage change in zzso or zzso as the dependent zzso and treatment group and percentage change in weight as the independent zzso Weight change varied between zzso and zzso All zzso variables showed a statistically significant treatment zzso Standard total body zzso and zzso and enhanced total body zzso all showed a significant dependence on weight change zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso No effect of weight change was seen on spine, zzso neck, or enhanced total body zzso In order to investigate the effects of weight on long-term precision, patients were allocated to two groups according to baseline body mass index zzso zzso 25 and zzso 25 zzso zzso For zzso neck zzso the root mean square zzso residual percentage change was statistically significantly larger in the high zzso group zzso zzso zzso but all other bone density variables showed no significant zzso With patients allocated to two groups according to their absolute percentage change in weight zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso residual percentage changes in the bone density variables were statistically significantly larger in the large weight change group for zzso neck zzso zzso zzso zzso and for standard and enhanced total body zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso With the exception of the standard total body algorithm, weight change in a zzso study of zzso women was not found to cause systematic errors in the results of zzso studies but may adversely affect zzso
