One way to enhance the performance of zzso zzso for DNA de zzso sequencing is the use of probing patterns with gaps of zzso zzso zzso such gaps could be realized by the inclusion into zzso zzso zzso of wild-card compounds, referred to as universal bases (which bind zzso to natural zzso The suggested alternative is to deploy in the gap positions zzso zzso zzso uniform zzso of the four natural zzso with ensuing deterioration of the zzso zzso In this paper, we show that such signal loss is a minor zzso compared with the fact that zzso bases cannot be treated as zzso Indeed, the substantial spread of zzso energies at any zzso feature is such that on overwhelming number of zzso bind more strongly than legal zzso We observed, however, that much zzso energy spreads are exhibited by pairs of bases in the same strength class zzso and zzso We call zzso a gap position realized with bases in the same energy class and show that well-known sequence reconstruction zzso can be modified to achieve substantial improvements in sequencing zzso For example, with a zzso zzso and an acceptable weakening of the zzso zzso one may achieve lengths of about 4,000 bases zzso with zzso 250 of the standard uniform zzso Our approach also incorporates the use of a spectrum expressed in terms of observed feature melting temperatures zzso zzso rather than zzso decisions made directly at the zzso level zzso zzso While universal bases represent the ultimate goal of sequencing by zzso zzso natural bases are the most effective known zzso
