Recent work has examined the zzso of models of zzso neural activity in which some linear filtering process is followed by a zzso zzso zzso zzso We analyze the zzso of one such model for which this zzso step is implemented by a known zzso zzso the assumption that this function is known speeds the zzso process zzso We investigate the shape of the likelihood function for this type of model, give a simple condition on the zzso ensuring that no zzso local zzso exist in the zzso in turn, to efficient zzso for the zzso of the maximum likelihood zzso discuss the implications for the form of the allowed zzso Finally, we note some interesting connections between the zzso zzso and the classical zzso average zzso discuss some useful extensions of the basic model structure, and provide two novel applications to zzso zzso
