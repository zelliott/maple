There is an increasing zzso of solved zzso structures in more than one zzso and increasing evidence that large-scale zzso change is critical for zzso zzso In this article, we present our zzso of a dynamic importance sampling zzso zzso that is directed toward improving our understanding of important intermediate states between zzso defined starting and ending zzso This zzso traditional molecular dynamics methods where most of the sampling time is spent in the stable free energy zzso defined by these initial and final zzso As such, the zzso creates a candidate set of transitions that provide insights for the much slower and probably most important, functionally relevant degrees of zzso The method is implemented in the program zzso and is tested on six systems of growing size and zzso These systems, the folding of zzso A and of zzso G, the zzso changes in the calcium sensor zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are also compared against other approaches that have been suggested in the zzso The results suggest good sampling on a diverse set of zzso for all six systems with an ability to control the bias and thus to sample zzso of zzso for the analysis of intermediate zzso
