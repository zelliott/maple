We demonstrate substantial performance improvements in 256 zzso transmission in terms of both data rate and distance that we realized by using a digital zzso zzso zzso 160 zzso zzso and 64 zzso zzso transmissions were successfully achieved with a zzso 256 zzso zzso in which the symbol rate and transmission distance were greatly increased by zzso for the interplay between zzso and zzso which is responsible for the transmission impairment especially for a higher symbol rate and longer zzso
