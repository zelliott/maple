zzso are an intrinsic property of genetic networks due to the small number of interacting zzso We study the role of zzso reactions in controlling these fluctuations in a simple genetic circuit with negative zzso We compare two different zzso In the zzso zzso the proteins to be regulated form zzso in solution that afterward bind to an operator site and inhibit zzso In the zzso zzso zzso bind to the operator site and then recruit another zzso to form a zzso directly on the zzso We find that while both pathways implement the same negative feedback zzso the protein number fluctuations in the zzso zzso are drastically reduced compared to the zzso zzso This difference in the ability to reduce fluctuations may be of importance in the design of genetic zzso
