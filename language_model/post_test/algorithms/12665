zzso zzso suppress gene expression by zzso translation, promoting zzso zzso or zzso Each zzso may regulate hundreds of genes to control the cell's response to zzso and other environmental zzso The best way to understand the function of a zzso is to identify the genes that it zzso Target gene identification is challenging because zzso bind to their target zzso by partial zzso over a short zzso suppression of an individual target gene is often small, and the rules of targeting are not completely zzso Here we review zzso and experimental approaches to the identification of zzso zzso The examination of changes in gene expression that occur when zzso expression is altered and zzso isolation of zzso transcripts complement target prediction zzso zzso analysis of zzso pathways and zzso in zzso zzso formed from experimental candidate zzso gene target lists can focus attention on biologically significant target zzso
