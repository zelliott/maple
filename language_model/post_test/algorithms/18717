A variety of models have been proposed to fit nutritional zzso response zzso The models are typically zzso therefore, fitting the models usually requires sophisticated statistical software and training to use zzso An alternative tool for fitting nutritional response models was developed by using widely available and zzso Microsoft Excel zzso The zzso implemented as an Excel zzso zzso allows simultaneous fitting and side-by-side comparisons of several popular zzso This study compared the results produced by the tool we developed and zzso zzso of zzso The models compared were the broken line zzso linear and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and exponential zzso The zzso zzso provided results nearly identical to those of zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso successfully fit several models that failed to zzso in zzso zzso Two data sets were used as examples to compare fits by the different zzso The results suggest that no particular zzso model is necessarily best for all nutritional response zzso
