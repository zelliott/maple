The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso reflects the duration of zzso zzso and zzso A drug-induced zzso of zzso zzso and thereby zzso zzso is recognized to be a marker for an enhanced risk for zzso zzso The assessment of a drug's effect on the zzso zzso has therefore become routine within pharmaceutical research and zzso However, the heart rate has a major influence on the zzso zzso the zzso zzso shortens as heart rate increases such that one needs to account for such heart zzso changes when evaluating possible drug-induced effects on the zzso zzso The relationship between the zzso zzso and heart rate can be modeled zzso and using this function a so-called zzso zzso zzso zzso can be generated to assess drug-induced effects independent from heart zzso zzso In the past few years, a large number of mathematical relationship have been described that supposedly best describe the heart zzso zzso In this paper we describe a novel approach for selecting the optimal mathematical function for this purpose for a given zzso 

zzso zzso dogs zzso males and zzso were zzso with zzso zzso zzso for measurement of zzso pressure zzso left zzso pressure zzso the lead II zzso and body zzso zzso were recorded continuously without drug treatment and include a range of zzso due to spontaneous, zzso changes over the zzso of data zzso Various mathematical models zzso were then used to evaluate the zzso relationship and these were compared statistically to zzso select the model best fitting the data set of each individual zzso 

In this study a dynamic analysis zzso was developed to find the optimal zzso of the zzso relationship for a given individual animal under control zzso The use of this optimal relationship provides the best possible approach for detecting drug-induced effects on the zzso zzso for compounds that also affect the heart zzso 

Several zzso methods to zzso the correction functions and statistical procedures to perform significance tests were discussed and implemented in a zzso relationship analysis system, named zzso Given a sample data set, zzso searches the best correction zzso from the integrated 11 zzso relationship modeling zzso
