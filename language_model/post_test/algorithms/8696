To examine the effect of imprecise zzso of patient risk zzso of zzso on an otherwise highly accurate quality assurance screening technique, data on clinical outcomes were generated for a simulated hospital system consisting of 108 facilities treating approximately zzso patients a zzso In these simulations, marked differences in facility size, zzso distribution, and quality of care were combined with random variations in zzso zzso data for all 108 facilities were used to create zzso that combined zzso discrete patient risk zzso into either ten or three groups with zzso overlapping ranges of zzso risks of zzso clinical zzso When derived zzso were applied to independently generated zzso data, the ability to identify hospital systems with and without quality of care problems was maintained with ten, but not with three, risk zzso However, even three moderately zzso risk groups were sufficient to preserve a high degree of sensitivity and specificity in screening for potential quality of care problems within individual zzso Thus, zzso quality assurance screening can be highly accurate in actual health care situations in which only imprecise zzso of zzso risk can be zzso
