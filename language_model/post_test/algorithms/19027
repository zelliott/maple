A zzso framework for a zzso approach to speech recognition is presented for obtaining multiple landmark sequences in continuous zzso The landmark detection module uses as input acoustic parameters zzso that capture the acoustic zzso of some of the zzso phonetic zzso The landmarks include stop zzso vowel zzso zzso zzso and dips, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso consonant zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the manner phonetic zzso zzso and zzso used for zzso detection of these zzso The zzso framework exploits two properties of the acoustic cues of phonetic zzso zzso of acoustic cues of a phonetic feature for a zzso decision on that feature and zzso zzso of the acoustic cues of a phonetic feature with respect to other phonetic zzso zzso landmark sequences are constrained using manner class zzso models for isolated word recognition with known zzso The performance of the system is compared with zzso the same zzso system but with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a hidden zzso model zzso based system using zzso and zzso a zzso based system using zzso
