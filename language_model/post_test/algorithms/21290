Rapid zzso pacing and zzso shocks are both effective in terminating sustained zzso zzso zzso only in selected zzso We zzso examined efficacy and safety of an zzso for VT termination combining rapid zzso pacing with low and moderate energy zzso shocks in patients with sustained zzso zzso VT episodes in 23 patients, mean age 64 zzso 12 years, were treated with the zzso zzso of rapid zzso pacing and zzso shocks were delivered with a zzso zzso zzso positioned in the right zzso zzso VT episodes with cycle lengths greater than zzso zzso zzso zzso were treated with sequential therapy with rapid zzso pacing zzso zzso and zzso of VT cycle zzso low energy zzso shocks zzso to zzso zzso and moderate energy zzso to 10 zzso zzso zzso Rapid VT episodes with cycle lengths less than zzso zzso zzso zzso were treated with moderate energy zzso shocks zzso zzso of 48 zzso VT episodes in group A and 6 of 15 zzso VT episodes in group B were successfully terminated by this zzso There was no difference in clinical or zzso characteristics between zzso and zzso in either group A or group B to the zzso VT acceleration was observed in zzso of episodes in group A and in zzso of episodes in group zzso We conclude that an zzso combining rapid zzso pacing with low and moderate energy zzso shocks is effective for VT termination in episodes with a cycle length greater than zzso zzso and can reduce the need for zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
