In this paper we show how the techniques of image zzso can increase the ability of image sensors as, for example, zzso zzso to detect faint stars or faint zzso objects zzso satellites and space zzso In the case of faint stars, we show that this benefit is equivalent to double the quantum efficiency of the used image sensor or to increase the effective telescope zzso by more than zzso without decreasing the zzso precision or introducing artificial zzso In the case of zzso objects, the zzso technique can double the zzso ratio of the image, which helps to discover and control dangerous objects as space debris or lost zzso The benefits obtained using zzso detectors can be zzso to any kind of image zzso
