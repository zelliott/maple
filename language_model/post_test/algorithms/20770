The purpose of our study was to show the difference of Joint Photographic Experts Group zzso 2000 zzso artifacts in the lung between zzso and zzso CT zzso 

Thirty-five zzso (1 zzso and 35 corresponding zzso (5 zzso images were compressed to zzso and irreversible zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In each compressed image, zzso outside the lung were replaced with those from the original zzso By comparing the compressed and original images, three zzso independently rated the zzso artifacts using grades of 0 zzso the two images were zzso 1 zzso differences were barely zzso 2 zzso differences were zzso or 3 zzso differences were zzso At each zzso level, thin and thick sections were compared for peak zzso ratio zzso using paired zzso tests and for the readers' responses using zzso signed rank tests and exact tests for paired zzso 

Thin sections had smaller zzso zzso zzso zzso Thin sections had higher grades of artifacts than thick zzso showing significant differences at zzso levels of zzso zzso score, zzso vs zzso zzso vs zzso zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso for the three zzso and zzso zzso vs zzso zzso vs zzso zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso The percentages of distinguishable pairs zzso zzso were greater for thin sections than for thick zzso showing a statistically significant difference at zzso for two readers zzso vs zzso and zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso 

The lung shows more zzso artifacts on thin sections than on thick zzso Section thickness should be taken into consideration when adjusting the zzso level for lung CT zzso
