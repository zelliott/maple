zzso dimension analysis zzso is modern mathematical method widely used to describing of complex and chaotic shapes when classic methods zzso The main aim of this study was evaluating the influence of zzso therapy zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso on the number and zzso of blood vessels inside tumor and on increase of effectiveness of combined therapy in contrast to zzso and zzso used zzso Animals were divided into four groups: control, treated using only zzso treated using only zzso and treated using combined therapy, zzso and zzso zzso showed that time of animal survival and depth of necrosis inside tumor were significantly higher in zzso group in contrast to other zzso The higher value of zzso dimension zzso was observed in control group, while the lowest value was found in the group which was treated by zzso zzso zzso The differences between zzso were observed in zzso group and zzso group in comparison to control zzso Our results revealed that zzso dimension analysis is a very useful tool in zzso differences between irregular shapes like blood vessels in zzso treated zzso Thus, the zzso of zzso zzso could be useful method in evaluating the efficacy of zzso
