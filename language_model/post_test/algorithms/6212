It is well known that zzso data record information on the coexistence in founder zzso of zzso at nearby zzso and the zzso from parent to offspring that reveal different, but zzso profiles of the genetic zzso Either conventional linkage analysis that assumes linkage equilibrium or zzso association tests zzso capture only partial information, leading to zzso For example, zzso will fail to detect even very tight linkage in the case where no zzso association exists, while a violation of the assumption of linkage equilibrium will result in biased zzso and reduced efficiency in linkage zzso In this article, by using a data zzso technique and the zzso algorithm, we propose a zzso approach that zzso both linkage and association analyses into a unified framework for general pedigree zzso Relative to either linkage or association analysis, the proposed approach is expected to have greater zzso accuracy and zzso zzso Carlo simulations support our theoretical expectations and demonstrate that our new zzso zzso is more powerful than either zzso or classic linkage zzso zzso can zzso estimate genetic parameters regardless of whether association exists, thus zzso the bias and less precision of traditional linkage analysis in the presence of zzso and zzso is capable of identifying tight linkage zzso The new approach also holds the theoretical advantage that it can extract statistical information to the maximum extent and thereby improve mapping accuracy and power because it zzso zzso zzso association study and zzso linkage analysis into a coherent zzso Furthermore, our method is zzso stable and zzso efficient, as compared to existing zzso methods that use the zzso zzso or zzso methods to maximize zzso zzso likelihood functions, and also offers the zzso of zzso information zzso Finally, we apply our methodology to a genetic study on bone mineral density zzso for the vitamin D zzso zzso gene and find that zzso is significantly linked to zzso at the one-third region of the zzso
