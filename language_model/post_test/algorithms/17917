zzso labeling networks zzso are zzso explaining the flow of isotope labeled molecules in a zzso zzso Moreover, they are the structural backbone of zzso flux analysis zzso by zzso zzso which has been established as a standard experimental tool in zzso To zzso an isotope labeling experiment zzso for zzso the structure of the corresponding zzso must be understood to a certain extent even by a zzso zzso zzso help to analyze the network structure but produce rather abstract zzso Here, the major obstruction is the high dimension of these networks and the large number of network components which, consequently, are hard to figure out zzso At the interface between theory and experiment, the three-dimensional interactive zzso tool zzso has been developed for exploring the network structure in a step by step zzso zzso and orientation within zzso are supported by exploiting the natural zzso structure of an underlying zzso network with stacked labeled particles on top of each zzso zzso Network exploration is facilitated by zzso zzso forward and backward path tracing and, most important, network component zzso All features of zzso are explained with an educational example and a realistic network describing carbon flow in the zzso acid zzso
