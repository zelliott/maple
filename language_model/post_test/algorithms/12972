In this communication, we will describe one unique phenomenon and the potential application of zzso In this work, the zzso relation of an zzso zzso zzso slab is analyzed zzso in which the zzso range surface zzso zzso zzso zzso whose energy zzso deeply into the fluid, are found with their losses being extremely small and sensitive to the change of the fluid zzso index when operating near their zzso zzso regions, where the zzso zzso are zzso By applying this phenomenon in detecting the fluid zzso index change, a zzso sensor based on intensity measurement is zzso It is a zzso structure with an zzso slab together with a flow cell filled with the detecting zzso It is found that a large scale of linear detection zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso to zzso with high resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Index zzso can be achieved for a very short device, which is 200 zzso
