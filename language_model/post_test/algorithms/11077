Many structural zzso approaches employ sequence zzso zzso zzso To improve fold recognition rates, zzso searching may include artificially evolved zzso acid zzso which were demonstrated to enhance the sensitivity of protein zzso in targeting midnight zone zzso 

We describe zzso details of zzso an zzso zzso that zzso protein sequences to stabilize the respective structures by a variety of zzso which are compatible with those commonly used in protein zzso In a case study focusing on zzso zzso domain, we show that artificially evolved sequences have quite high capabilities to recognize the correct protein structures using standard sequence zzso fold zzso 

zzso design protein sequences can be incorporated in existing sequence zzso zzso approaches to increase their zzso They also provide a desired linkage between protein structure and function in in zzso experiments that relate to zzso the zzso of protein structure space, the origin of folds and protein zzso zzso is freely available as a zzso zzso and a well-documented zzso software distribution at zzso
