zzso laws and zzso noises are shown to emerge uniquely and universally from a general model of systems which zzso the transmissions of many independent zzso zzso The signals are considered to follow, zzso a zzso zzso signal pattern which may be either stationary or zzso Each signal is considered to have its own random transmission zzso and zzso We characterize the zzso zzso which render the system zzso stationary law and zzso zzso independent of the underlying generic signal zzso The classes of universal stationary laws and power zzso are shown to zzso respectively, with the classes of zzso laws and zzso zzso providing a unified and universal explanation for the ubiquity of these classes of zzso zzso in various fields of science and zzso
