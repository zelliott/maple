During long-term zzso zzso at mossy zzso cell zzso in rat zzso synaptic transmission and zzso cell intrinsic zzso are zzso Although it is clear that changes in zzso cell zzso are zzso zzso there is as yet no direct evidence for the site and mechanism of changes in zzso To approach this problem, evoked zzso currents zzso and miniature synaptic currents zzso were recorded by zzso in zzso slices obtained from zzso zzso zzso was induced by zzso stimulation paired with zzso During zzso the zzso showed a significant decrease in the zzso of variation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso the number of failures zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and the zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Similar changes were observed by increasing neurotransmitter release zzso solutions with high zzso zzso whereas increases in zzso numbers of failures and zzso occurred when release was decreased zzso solutions with low zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso No changes followed modifications of zzso holding zzso while zzso and failures were reduced when the number of active zzso was zzso zzso was prevented by use of solutions with high zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and the associated zzso decrease were observed in the zzso component of zzso zzso and in zzso zzso During zzso zzso did not change in zzso or zzso but significantly increased in frequency zzso zzso zzso zzso 4; P zzso zzso By zzso analysis changes in zzso were shown to be due to increased release probability (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso 7; P zzso zzso with a constant number of three to four releasing zzso These observations provide evidence for increased neurotransmitter release during zzso at mossy zzso cell zzso
