Assessment of gene expression on spotted zzso is based on measurement of zzso intensity zzso by zzso zzso Unfortunately, zzso zzso intensity from zzso spots does not always correctly reflect gene expression zzso Low gene expression levels produce low zzso zzso which tend to be zzso with the local background while high gene expression levels produce high zzso zzso which rapidly reach the zzso zzso Most zzso that combine data acquired at different zzso of the zzso tube zzso assume that a change in scanner setting zzso the intensity zzso by a zzso zzso 

In this paper we introduce a new model of spot foreground intensity which zzso a zzso zzso independent scanner optical zzso This new model is used to implement a zzso Multiple zzso using a zzso zzso zzso method, which is based on a maximum likelihood zzso of the scanner optical zzso After having zzso scanner bias, zzso of the zzso zzso model are used for correcting the saturated spots zzso obtained at high zzso zzso by using their counterpart values at lower zzso zzso The method was compared to state-of-the-art multiple scan zzso using data generated from the zzso zzso zzso produced zzso that were highly correlated with zzso zzso As the scanner optical bias is accurately estimated within zzso this method allows also avoiding zzso zzso biases whatever the value of this optical zzso
