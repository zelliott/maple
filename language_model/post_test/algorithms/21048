We developed a zzso zzso program, zzso to identify tandem mass zzso that are highly likely to represent zzso prior to database zzso We identified statistically significant diagnostic features of zzso tandem mass zzso based on zzso trap zzso zzso zzso Statistics for the features are calculated from 376 validated zzso zzso and 376 zzso zzso A zzso support zzso machine zzso program, zzso was then trained on five selected zzso Data sets were assembled both from zzso analyses of large-scale zzso zzso from zzso cells, zzso and synthetic zzso These data sets were used to evaluate the capability of zzso to select zzso zzso tandem mass zzso When applied to unknown tandem mass zzso zzso can routinely remove zzso of tandem mass zzso while retaining zzso of zzso tandem mass zzso The program significantly reduced zzso time spent on database search by zzso Furthermore, zzso tandem mass zzso representing zzso can increase the number of zzso identifications under a zzso false positive zzso
