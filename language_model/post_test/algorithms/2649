Registration is one of the most common tasks of image analysis and computer vision zzso The requirements of most registration zzso include large capture range and fast zzso so that the zzso are robust to different scenarios and can be zzso in a reasonable amount of zzso For these purposes, registration in the zzso domain using zzso zzso is well suited and has been extensively studied in the zzso Another common requirement is zzso which is necessary for applications where certain regions of the image that would adversely affect the registration result should be zzso To address these requirements, we have derived a mathematical model that describes an exact form for embedding the masking step fully into the zzso domain so that all steps of translation registration can be zzso efficiently using Fast zzso zzso We provide zzso and zzso details that demonstrate the correctness of our zzso We also demonstrate how this masked zzso registration approach can be applied to improve the zzso zzso that zzso translation, zzso and scale in the zzso zzso We demonstrate the zzso efficiency, advantages, and correctness of our zzso on a number of images from real-world zzso Our framework enables fast, zzso zzso registration of images with masked zzso
