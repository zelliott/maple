The nature of the equilibrium zzso transition from the zzso state to a zzso zzso bundle was studied employing a dynamic zzso Carlo zzso in which the model protein chain was confined to a zzso zzso The model chain was allowed to hunt over all phase space, the target native state was not assumed a zzso and no zzso interactions were zzso The exterior vs the interior part of the protein is distinguished by the pattern of zzso and zzso interactions zzso into the primary zzso The importance of a statistical preference for forming zzso as a function of bend location in the primary zzso and zzso wheel type cooperative interactions were zzso and the necessary conditions for collapse of the chain to the unique native structure were zzso It was found that an zzso pattern of zzso interactions along with a statistical preference of the central zzso for bend formation are sufficient to obtain the zzso zzso The transition to the native state has an zzso zzso
