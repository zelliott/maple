In this paper we report on remote three-dimensional zzso imaging without the need for a zzso agent or other aids zzso detector zzso by utilizing a zzso mixing zzso zzso In this technique the beams coming from sample and reference are brought to interfere in a zzso zzso crystal zzso Such a setup allows the measurement of zzso zzso on rough sample zzso After data acquisition the initial pressure distribution is reconstructed by a zzso domain synthetic zzso focusing technique zzso We present three-dimensional imaging of a hair ribbon zzso on biological samples with embedded artificial blood vessels or pig zzso and zzso on a human zzso zzso
