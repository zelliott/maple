As more diagnostic testing options become available to physicians, it becomes more difficult to combine various types of medical information together in order to zzso the overall zzso To improve diagnostic performance, here we introduce an approach to zzso a zzso technique to combine zzso information, such as from different zzso feature categories, or zzso For zzso comparison we used two performance zzso The receiving operator characteristic zzso area under the curve zzso under the zzso curve zzso and the zzso partial area under the curve zzso This study used four zzso Linear zzso analysis zzso artificial neural network zzso and two zzso of our zzso technique, zzso zzso and zzso zzso decision zzso We applied each of these zzso with zzso zzso to two zzso breast cancer data zzso One of mass zzso features and a much more challenging one of zzso zzso zzso For the zzso data set, zzso outperformed the other zzso in terms of zzso zzso zzso zzso and achieved zzso zzso zzso The zzso surpassed the other zzso in terms of zzso zzso zzso zzso and reached zzso zzso zzso For the mass data set, zzso outperformed both the ANN and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and achieved zzso zzso zzso Although for this data set there were no statistically significant differences among the zzso zzso values zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso the zzso did significantly improve specificity versus the zzso at both zzso and zzso sensitivity zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, decision fusion directly zzso clinically significant performance measures, such as zzso and zzso and sometimes outperformed two well-known zzso techniques when applied to two different breast cancer data zzso
