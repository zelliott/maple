The problem of zzso zzso over Internet protocol networks is zzso The existence of zzso communication delay and the possibility of data losses are taken into zzso Since significant data loss may result in zzso of the reference trajectory transmitted through the communication channel, the proposed control scheme includes a filter that provides a smooth approximation of a possibly zzso reference zzso The stability of the overall system is guaranteed by a version of the zzso stable zzso zzso for functional differential zzso If the communication delay in the forward channel is an zzso zzso function of time, the proposed scheme guarantees that the slave zzso tracks the delayed trajectory of the master within a prescribed small zzso
