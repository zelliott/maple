This paper introduces hybrid random fields, which are a class of zzso zzso models aimed at allowing for efficient structure learning in zzso zzso zzso random fields, along with the learning zzso we develop for them, are especially useful as a zzso zzso technique (rather than a technique for zzso strict joint probability zzso In order to assess the zzso of the proposed model, we prove that the class of zzso zzso zzso by hybrid random fields strictly includes the class of joint probability zzso zzso by zzso zzso Once we establish this result, we develop a zzso zzso for learning the structure of hybrid random fields, which we call zzso zzso zzso On the one hand, we characterize some complexity properties of zzso zzso zzso both from a theoretical and from the experimental point of view, using a series of synthetic zzso On the other hand, we evaluate the accuracy of hybrid random fields (as learned via zzso zzso zzso by comparing them to various alternative statistical models in a number of pattern zzso and zzso zzso As the results show, learning hybrid random fields by the zzso zzso zzso zzso not only reduces significantly the zzso cost of structure learning with respect to several considered alternatives, but it also leads to models that are highly accurate as compared to the alternative zzso
