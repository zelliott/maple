zzso of anatomical structures using zzso imaging methods is an important tool in medicine to differentiate normal from pathological tissue and can generate large amounts of data for a zzso to zzso zzso these large data sets is difficult and zzso A new approach uses both supervised and zzso advanced machine learning techniques to zzso and segment zzso zzso This study describes the application of a novel hybrid zzso based on combining zzso transform and zzso zzso reduction zzso methods, to breast magnetic resonance imaging zzso data using three well-established zzso techniques, zzso zzso local linear embedding zzso and diffusion maps zzso to perform a comparative performance zzso 

Twenty-five breast zzso subjects were scanned using a zzso zzso zzso sequences used were zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso and dynamic zzso zzso zzso The hybrid scheme consisted of two steps: zzso and zzso of the zzso The zzso step was applied for zzso zzso zzso image zzso and zzso image zzso to match and zzso the zzso In the zzso step, zzso parameters were considered data dimensions and the zzso hybrid approach was applied to integrate the zzso parameters into a single image, termed the embedded zzso This was achieved by mapping all zzso zzso from the higher dimension to a lower zzso zzso zzso For zzso the authors compared the hybrid zzso with linear methods of principal component analysis zzso and zzso zzso zzso using synthetic zzso For the clinical application, the authors used breast zzso data, comparison was performed using the zzso zzso zzso image and evaluating the zzso of the segmented zzso 

The zzso hybrid approach was able to define and segment both synthetic and clinical zzso In the synthetic data, the authors demonstrated the performance of the zzso method compared with conventional linear DR zzso The zzso approach enabled successful zzso of the structures, zzso in most cases, zzso and zzso zzso The zzso approach was able to segment different breast tissue types with a high accuracy and the embedded image of the breast zzso data demonstrated fuzzy boundaries between the different types of breast zzso zzso zzso zzso and tissue with zzso zzso 

The proposed hybrid zzso methods were able to segment clinical breast data with a high accuracy and construct an embedded image that zzso the contribution of different zzso zzso
