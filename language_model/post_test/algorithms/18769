A novel method is developed for the fetal abdominal zzso extraction and measurement in ultrasound zzso Fetal abdominal circumference zzso is one of the standardized zzso in the zzso ultrasound zzso Among several standardized zzso zzso is best correlated with fetal growth but is also the most difficult to be accurately zzso To overcome the difficulties in the abdominal zzso zzso the proposed method is a zzso procedure that zzso several image zzso zzso The proposed method is able to make the best use of the strength of different zzso zzso while avoiding their zzso An enhanced instantaneous zzso of variation zzso edge detector is first developed to detect edges of the abdominal zzso and alleviate the effects of most zzso zzso Then, the zzso zzso zzso is employed to distinguish salient edges attributable to the abdominal zzso from weak edges due to the other zzso zzso the zzso zzso transform is applied to determine an elliptical zzso and obtain an initial zzso of the zzso Finally, the zzso zzso field zzso snake adapts the initial zzso to the real edges of the abdominal zzso zzso validation of the proposed method on synthetic images under different imaging conditions achieves satisfactory zzso accuracy zzso zzso on 150 clinical images are carried out in three aspects: comparisons between zzso and zzso variation, the fitness analysis between the automatically detected zzso and the manual zzso and the accuracy comparisons between automatic zzso and manual zzso in zzso of fetal weight zzso Experimental results show that the proposed method can provide consistent and accurate zzso The reductions of the mean absolute difference and the standard zzso of zzso based on automatic zzso are about zzso and zzso respectively, which indicate its potential in clinical zzso monitoring zzso
