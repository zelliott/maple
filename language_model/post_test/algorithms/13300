It is well known that observations of the spatial sample zzso zzso zzso also called the zzso zzso reveal that the ordered noise zzso of the zzso zzso zzso but common models predict equal noise zzso Random zzso theory zzso is used to derive and discuss properties of the zzso spectrum of the data zzso for linear zzso with an application to ocean acoustic zzso Noise on the array is considered either incoherent or zzso acoustic noise that is coherent across the zzso Using conventional three-dimensional or two-dimensional zzso noise models with full or zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso are explained using zzso zzso zzso data are analyzed and it is shown that the zzso of the zzso compare well with zzso It is demonstrated how zzso can be applied to study zzso spectrum zzso as dependent on array properties zzso spacing to wavelength zzso and data sampling zzso Apart from explaining the observed noise zzso spectrum, the improved model of the zzso spectrum has important applications in array signal zzso
