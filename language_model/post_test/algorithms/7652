We develop a matched signal detection zzso theory for signals with an intrinsic structure described by a weighted zzso zzso tests are formulated under different signal zzso In the simplest scenario, we assume that the signal is deterministic with noise in a zzso spanned by a subset of zzso of the graph zzso The conventional matched zzso detection can be easily extended to this zzso Furthermore, we study signals with certain level of zzso The test turns out to be a weighted energy zzso when the noise zzso is zzso More generally, we zzso that the signal follows a prior distribution, which could be zzso from training zzso The test statistic is then the difference of signal variations on associated graph structures, if an zzso model is zzso zzso of the zzso on graph is evaluated both by simulation and real zzso We apply it to the network zzso problem of Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso The preliminary results demonstrate that our approach is able to exploit the zzso structure of the data, and therefore achieve a better performance than the traditional principle component analysis zzso
