This study was to design a method to zzso evaluate three-dimensional zzso reconstruction accuracy of spatial relationship of dental models based on a zzso contact zzso measuring system, and to evaluate the accuracy of a common regional registration method for zzso jaw relation zzso zzso surface data of zzso dental casts with 10 positioning zzso and wax zzso rims of five patients were obtained using a dental zzso The jaw relation was reconstructed using the common regional registration in the zzso zzso zzso were obtained for line zzso vertical distance and horizontal distance between zzso points from two sources with upper jaw model base plane as a reference zzso The statistical description of measurement data was zzso zzso zzso s of line zzso vertical distance and horizontal distance between the center points of each data set were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Data was analyzed using the paired samples zzso and one-way analysis of zzso zzso zzso results of each patient and one-way analysis of zzso for the five patients showed no significant differences zzso Using the Faro Edge system and standardized positioning zzso quantitative evaluation of the zzso reconstruction accuracy of zzso jaw relation was zzso And results of common regional registration method met clinical zzso
