Volume rendering is a zzso technique that has important applications in diagnostic zzso and in zzso but has not achieved widespread use due, in part, to the lack of zzso analysis tools for comparison of volume rendering to conventional zzso zzso The volume rendering zzso zzso zzso a technique for three-dimensional zzso reconstruction of a structure identified on six principal zzso views, is introduced and zzso zzso involves three major steps: 1) zzso of the partial surfaces constructed from each of six zzso zzso 2) merging these processed partial surfaces to define the boundaries of a zzso and 3) zzso of the volume of the structure from this boundary zzso After testing on zzso zzso was applied to CT data of patients with cerebral zzso zzso zzso Because zzso zzso of the cerebral zzso is relatively insensitive to operator zzso such as the choice of zzso transfer function, and because precise zzso definition of the zzso is necessary for zzso treatment planning, it is representative of a class of structures that is ideal for testing and zzso of zzso zzso volumes obtained using zzso are intermediate to those obtained using zzso zzso and those obtained using zzso zzso zzso zzso routinely used zzso techniques for treatment planning for zzso zzso and potential expansions of zzso are zzso
