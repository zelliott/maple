We propose a novel approach to solving the zzso zzso inverse problem which is based upon a decomposition of the current density into a small number of spatial basis zzso It is designed to recover multiple sources of possibly different extent and depth, while being zzso with respect to phase angles and zzso of the coordinate zzso We demonstrate the zzso ability to reconstruct simulated sources of random shape and show that the accuracy of the recovered sources can be increased, when interrelated field patterns are zzso zzso this leads to large-scale mathematical problems, which are solved using recent advances in convex zzso We apply our method for zzso brain areas involved in different types of motor imagery using real data from zzso zzso zzso zzso Our approach based on zzso zzso of complex zzso zzso yields zzso focal sources in the zzso zzso
