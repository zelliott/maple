To evaluate the dose calculation zzso used in the inverse treatment planning computer system for the intensity zzso zzso zzso 

The inverse zzso computer system zzso the zzso of multiple pencil beams to achieve an optimal distribution and zzso the beam intensity through the special zzso zzso The system's dose calculation zzso made the two basic assumptions: zzso The zzso ratios zzso of a single pencil beam have the same values as zzso for zzso through each pencil beam that are determined from percentage depth dose zzso zzso along the long axis of the 2 zzso 20 zzso field with all leaves zzso and zzso the relative output factors zzso of each pencil beam also have the same values as the zzso zzso at zzso of the 2 zzso 20 zzso zzso To verify these two zzso a special zzso zzso was installed to our linear accelerator which produces 4 zzso zzso The zzso and zzso for the single leaves 1 through 10 were measured using an zzso chamber and zzso dosimeter in either a water or a polystyrene zzso The values of zzso zzso were calculated from the measured zzso zzso zzso of the 2 zzso 20 zzso zzso Comparisons were made between these two sets of zzso 

Based on our zzso we found that the zzso of a pencil beam obtained from the zzso zzso at zzso are as much as zzso greater than that of single pencil zzso The zzso of the 1 zzso 1 zzso pencil beam is 4 and zzso less than that of a cluster of four neighboring pencil beams forming a 2 zzso 2 zzso and a 2 zzso 20 zzso field zzso However, the zzso zzso are generally larger than the zzso of a single pencil zzso At a depth of 8 zzso the average depth in the middle of zzso space, the zzso zzso of the pencil beams of leaves 1 and 10 are zzso and zzso higher than a single pencil beam zzso at the same depth, zzso Also interesting is to note that the zzso of each of the single pencil beams were found to be zzso 

In our article, evaluations and comparisons of zzso and zzso were made for two extreme zzso The measured values of zzso and zzso of a single beam have been shown to be significantly different from those used in the zzso Because both the zzso and zzso are influenced by the scattering radiation in the same direction, the zzso for these two factors would be expected to be zzso Thus, for the two extreme situations we have investigated, dose zzso would be on the order of zzso In real patient zzso of course, these zzso may be somewhat less, but still zzso Our results, however, show that further investigations are zzso
