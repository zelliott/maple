Meat quality traits are economically important because they affect consumers' zzso which, in turn, influences the demand for zzso However, selection to improve meat quality is limited by the small numbers of animals on which meat tenderness can be evaluated due to the cost of performing zzso force analysis and the zzso damage to the zzso Genome zzso studies for zzso zzso force measured at different times of meat aging, zzso zzso zzso muscle area, scanning parameters zzso zzso zzso and zzso to ascertain color characteristics of meat and fat, zzso capacity, cooking loss zzso and muscle pH were conducted using zzso data from the zzso zzso zzso array to identify quantitative trait zzso zzso in all zzso zzso zzso zzso count for these animals ranged from 430 to 536 across zzso Meat quality traits in zzso are controlled by numerous zzso of small effect, except for a small number of zzso zzso identified for zzso zzso and zzso zzso regions harboring these zzso and the pathways in which the genes from these regions act appear to differ from those identified in zzso cattle for meat quality zzso These results will guide future zzso mapping studies and the development of models for the prediction of genetic merit to implement zzso selection for meat quality in zzso zzso
