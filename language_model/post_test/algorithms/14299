This paper presents the Environment zzso zzso zzso for modeling complex networks of zzso roads and pathways in virtual zzso zzso represents information about the layout of streets and sidewalks, the rules that govern behavior on roads and zzso and the locations of agents with respect to navigable zzso The framework serves as the zzso on which behavior programs for autonomous vehicles and zzso are zzso Pathways are modeled as ribbons in zzso The ribbon structure provides a natural coordinate frame for defining the local geometry of navigable zzso zzso includes a powerful zzso interface supported by robust and efficient code for locating objects on the ribbon network, for mapping between Cartesian and ribbon zzso and for determining behavioral constraints imposed by the zzso
