zzso flux analysis zzso is a powerful tool for exploring and zzso carbon traffic in zzso zzso zzso flux zzso requires zzso high-quality zzso zzso usually of biomass components including zzso zzso acids or central carbon zzso and zzso a mathematical model that relates the unknown zzso to the measured zzso Modeling requires a thorough knowledge of the structure of the underlying zzso network, often available from many databases, as well as the ability to make reasonable assumptions that will enable zzso of the zzso Here we describe a general methodology underlying zzso mathematical modeling of a zzso relationship and some of the accompanying zzso zzso One of two modeling strategies will need to be zzso depending on the type of isotope labeling experiment zzso These zzso modeling and zzso zzso different experimental and zzso zzso We discuss the concepts underlying these two types of modeling and demonstrate zzso modeling in a zzso zzso Our methodology should be zzso to most zzso zzso applications and should serve as a general framework zzso to many realistic zzso networks with little zzso
