The presence of artifacts plays a crucial role in automatic sedation systems and may introduce variable time delays zzso in the zzso zzso This paper presents a successful procedure to estimate the varying TD of the zzso index zzso monitor used in zzso control during intensive zzso The TD zzso zzso is based on the zzso analysis technique and the method is validated with real measured signals of zzso and zzso zzso prediction zzso control is used in combination with a Smith predictor to reduce the zzso burden imposed by the variable zzso The conclusion is that an online zzso of the zzso monitor improves the performance of the zzso system for reference zzso zzso zzso and overall zzso
