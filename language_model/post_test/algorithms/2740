Our aim is high spatial resolution imaging of maximum intensity projection zzso images in zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso by constructing a protocol for acquiring three-dimensional volume data with zzso zzso 

We eliminated zzso zzso zzso and zzso effective contrast behavior between fat and water before reaching a steady zzso is, during the transient zzso cover fat suppression by zzso In a phantom study, the optimal flip angle was investigated under the zzso zzso profile order using distilled water and baby oil to construct a protocol with zzso zzso Signal intensity, contrast, noise and zzso ratio were investigated to compare image qualities between the conventional and the constructed zzso zzso In a clinical study, three zzso and two zzso technologists visually evaluated clinical images of 20 volunteers for spatial resolution, contrast and overall reader confidence in two zzso 

We constructed an zzso protocol with zzso dimensions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at a flip angle of zzso We maintained the scan time but enlarged the zzso zzso dimensions from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and shortened image height from 48 zzso to zzso zzso Data from the phantom study were worse in the zzso protocol than in the conventional zzso However, overall reader confidence in the clinical images was significantly better in the zzso protocol than in the conventional protocol zzso 

Our study indicated the value of addressing high spatial resolution imaging of zzso images for zzso zzso by constructing an zzso zzso
