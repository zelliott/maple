zzso zzso tracking is highly relevant for many computer assisted zzso This is in particular due to the fact that the scientific community has not yet developed a general solution for tracking of flexible instruments within the human zzso zzso tracking solutions are highly attractive for minimally invasive procedures, since they do not require line of zzso However, a major problem with zzso tracking solutions is that they do not provide uniform accuracy throughout the tracking volume and the zzso highest accuracy is often only achieved close to the center of tracking zzso In this paper, we present a solution to the tracking problem, by mounting an zzso field generator onto a robot zzso zzso a new tracking zzso we take advantage of the electromagnetic tracking to detect the sensor within a specific zzso with known and optimal zzso We then use the more accurate and robust robot positioning for obtaining uniform accuracy throughout the tracking zzso Such an zzso zzso methodology guarantees optimal and uniform zzso by allowing us to always keep the tracked sensor close to the center of the tracking zzso In this paper, both dynamic accuracy and accuracy distribution within the tracking volume are evaluated using optical tracking as ground zzso In repeated evaluations, the proposed method was able to reduce the overall error from zzso zzso to a significantly improved accuracy of zzso zzso In addition, the combined system provides a larger tracking volume, which is only limited by the reach of the robot and not the much smaller tracking volume defined by the magnetic field zzso
