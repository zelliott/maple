zzso Imaging zzso where zzso intensity is based on image metrics zzso along streamline zzso provides a mechanism to study white matter zzso However, with zzso streamline zzso it is difficult to zzso the precise anatomical source and spread of injury or zzso This limitation can be overcome by modulating the zzso weight based on the distance of the zzso from a given anatomical location along the zzso which we term zzso distance informed zzso zzso The location of known zzso can be delineated on any given imaging zzso zzso zzso or zzso To demonstrate the clinical utility of this approach, we measured zzso cell zzso along zzso zzso tracts in 13 patients with newly diagnosed zzso and 1 patient with zzso zzso zzso and zzso maps were generated using information obtained from dynamic contrast enhanced zzso zzso under the curve, zzso and zzso maps zzso and zzso with zzso boundaries automatically extracted using a zzso zzso zzso The accuracy of the derived zzso volumes was compared to those generated using zzso zzso PET zzso The accuracy of the zzso volumes generated from the zzso maps was superior to volumes derived from the zzso geometric distance or baseline zzso zzso and zzso zzso The relative overlap and relative zzso rates for the zzso generated zzso volumes after zzso were found to be zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings show that zzso maps provide a useful framework for zzso zzso processes occurring along zzso zzso
