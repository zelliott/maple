This article zzso the zzso nuclear zzso effect zzso zzso interpretation problem using graph theory and presents a novel, zzso zzso distance network analysis zzso for zzso cross peak interpretation using assigned zzso zzso is a software suite that zzso this zzso distance network analysis zzso and zzso generates structures using the three-dimensional zzso protein structure calculation programs zzso or zzso The minimum input for zzso includes the zzso acid zzso a list of resonance assignments, and lists of zzso zzso and/or zzso cross zzso zzso can also analyze zzso proteins when zzso zzso experiments are zzso The quality of input data and final zzso structures is evaluated using recall, precision, and zzso zzso scores, a statistical measure of goodness of fit with the input zzso zzso has been tested on three protein zzso data sets for which high-quality structures have previously been solved by an expert, and yields comparable high-quality distance constraint lists and zzso protein structures in zzso We also compare several protein structures determined using zzso with corresponding zzso proteins determined with other independent zzso The program has been used in more than two dozen protein structure zzso several of which have already been zzso
