A popular commercially available zzso zzso technology employs sets of 25 base pair zzso zzso for measurement of gene expression zzso A mathematical zzso is required to zzso an estimate of gene expression from the multiple zzso Previously proposed methods for zzso gene expression data have either been substantially ad hoc or have relied on model assumptions that may be easily zzso Here we present a new zzso for calculating gene expression from probe zzso Our approach is functionally related to zzso zzso a zzso statistical technique that is often applied in limited data zzso We illustrate this approach using data from our study seeking a molecular fingerprint of zzso regulated genes for early detection of human zzso
