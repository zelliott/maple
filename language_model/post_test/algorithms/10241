zzso network zzso has been successfully used to zzso the regulatory relationships of genes from zzso zzso However, one major limitation of zzso approach is the zzso cost because the calculation time grows more than zzso with the dimension of the zzso In this paper, we propose a zzso greedy search method for efficient zzso Network zzso zzso this method limits the greedy search space by only selecting gene pairs with higher partial correlation zzso Using both synthetic and real data, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieved comparable results with standard greedy search method yet saved zzso of the zzso zzso We believe that zzso search method can be widely used for efficient zzso zzso in systems zzso
