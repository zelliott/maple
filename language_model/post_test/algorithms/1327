The current trend in zzso correction for single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is to measure and reconstruct the zzso zzso map using a transmission zzso performed either zzso or simultaneously with the zzso zzso This approach requires dedicated hardware and increases the cost (and in some cases the scanning zzso required to produce a clinical zzso zzso Furthermore, if short zzso zzso zzso are used for transmission imaging, the projection data may be zzso leading to errors in the zzso zzso zzso Our goal is to obtain information about the zzso distribution from only the measured zzso data by exploiting the fact that only certain zzso zzso are consistent with a given zzso zzso Ultimately this consistency information will either be used directly to compensate for zzso or combined with the incomplete information from zzso transmission zzso to produce a more accurate zzso zzso zzso In this manuscript the consistency conditions (which relate the measured zzso data to the zzso of the zzso zzso are used to find the uniform elliptical zzso object which is most consistent with the measured zzso zzso This object is then used for zzso correction during the reconstruction of the zzso zzso The method is tested using both simulated and zzso acquired data from zzso and zzso attenuating zzso The results show that, for uniform elliptical zzso the consistency conditions of the zzso data can be used to produce an accurate estimate of the zzso map without performing any transmission zzso The results also show that, in certain circumstances, the consistency conditions can prove useful for zzso compensation with zzso zzso
