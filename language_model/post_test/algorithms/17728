Recent studies have provided insights into the modular structure of genetic regulatory networks and emphasized the interest of quantitative functional zzso Here, to provide a zzso knowledge of the structure of functional zzso we describe an evolutionary procedure in zzso that creates small gene networks performing basic zzso We used it to create networks functioning as zzso switches or zzso The obtained circuits provide a variety of functional designs, demonstrate the crucial role of zzso zzso and highlight design principles also found in known biological zzso The procedure should prove helpful as a way to understand and create small functional zzso with diverse functions as well as to analyze large zzso
