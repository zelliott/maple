zzso zzso for pulmonary embolism zzso are widely implemented in the management of zzso A major drawback of a diagnostic zzso zzso is the use of several consecutive tests, which may be challenging in daily clinical zzso 

zzso whether the use of an algorithm, starting with a zzso zzso scan after a normal chest zzso is correctly used in daily clinical practice for diagnosing acute zzso zzso zzso scans of patients with suspected acute zzso were assessed to evaluate the use of the zzso diagnostic zzso 

A chest X-ray had been performed in 101 of the 130 patients who underwent zzso zzso 89 patients had a normal chest zzso The zzso scan was normal in zzso patients zzso zzso patients zzso had a zzso probability and zzso patients zzso a high probability for zzso Only 3 of the 30 patients with a zzso zzso scan zzso underwent a zzso zzso pulmonary zzso zzso zzso in contrast to the zzso that required a zzso scan in every patient with a zzso zzso zzso Overall, the diagnostic strategy, starting with a zzso scan as the baseline diagnostic tool with a prior chest zzso was appropriately followed in only zzso patients zzso 

A complex diagnostic zzso for diagnosing zzso is often not followed zzso This improper use of an zzso could lead to a potential delay of establishing or excluding zzso a delay of therapy and/or unnecessary zzso More simple zzso could resolve this diagnostic management zzso
