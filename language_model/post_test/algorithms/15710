To evaluate different zzso used to zzso retinal nerve zzso layer thickness zzso data obtained by scanning laser zzso in order to compare their relative abilities to discriminate between patients with zzso zzso nerve zzso layer defects and normal zzso 

48 eyes of 48 zzso patients with zzso zzso defects and 53 eyes of 53 healthy subjects were included in this zzso The zzso zzso defects were identified by zzso photography and/or slit lamp zzso zzso All patients were submitted to zzso examination using scanning laser zzso zzso nerve zzso zzso zzso zzso Technologies, zzso San Diego, CA, zzso Three methods of analysis of zzso data were zzso zzso software provided zzso zzso thickness zzso in 16 equal sectors around the zzso disc zzso zzso and zzso analysis of the curve of distribution of zzso thickness zzso Linear zzso functions were developed to assess sensitivity and specificity of the zzso based analysis and zzso analysis and were compared to the zzso zzso In addition, areas under the receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso were zzso 

At a fixed specificity of zzso the sensitivity of the linear zzso function from zzso data zzso zzso was zzso with an area under the zzso curve of zzso The linear zzso function from zzso measures had a comparable performance, with an area under the zzso curve of zzso and sensitivity of zzso for specificity at zzso At the same zzso the sensitivities of the zzso software provided parameters ranged from zzso to zzso The areas under the zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were significantly greater than the zzso curve area for the single best zzso zzso 

The zzso based analysis and the zzso analysis of zzso zzso data resulted in an improved detection of eyes with zzso zzso nerve zzso layer defects compared to the zzso software provided zzso
