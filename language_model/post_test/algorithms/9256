The authors propose a new zzso method for the fast evaluation of zzso zzso with zzso basis functions called the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In this method, the zzso potential is expanded in a basis of mixed zzso and zzso auxiliary functions that express the core and smooth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be evaluated by zzso zzso overlap zzso among two zzso basis functions and one mixed auxiliary zzso Thus, the zzso cost and zzso for large molecules are drastically zzso Several applications to molecular systems show that the zzso method is more efficient than the zzso integration approach that requires zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso method realizes a near linear zzso for both one-dimensional zzso zzso chains and three-dimensional diamond zzso
