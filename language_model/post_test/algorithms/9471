The unwinding free energy of 128 DNA zzso was correlated with the sum of interaction energies among DNA bases and their zzso zzso The former energies were determined by using the recently developed density functional theory procedure zzso by London zzso energy zzso that provides accurate zzso and stacking energies highly comparable with zzso basis set limit benchmark zzso zzso zzso zzso covering zzso energy was also used and yielded satisfactory zzso The latter method can be used for extended zzso The zzso energy was determined by using a zzso zzso zzso at zzso level zzso Various models were adopted to correlate theoretical energies with experimental unwinding free zzso Unless all energy components zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso were included and weighted individually, no satisfactory correlation zzso The most advanced model yielded very close correlation zzso zzso zzso fully comparable with the entirely empirical correlation introduced in the original zzso Analysis of the theoretical results shows the importance of zzso and zzso stacking zzso and especially the latter term plays a key role in determining zzso zzso
