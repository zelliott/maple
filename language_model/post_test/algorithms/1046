zzso modeling of zzso dynamic systems can be achieved by employing zzso expansions and zzso artificial neural networks in the form of the zzso network zzso This paper presents a different zzso of the zzso that can be employed to model zzso systems displaying complex dynamics zzso This is achieved by using two different filter banks, instead of one as in the original definition of the zzso in the input stage and selecting their structural parameters in an appropriate zzso zzso from simulated systems show that this method can yield accurate zzso models of zzso systems, even when considerable noise is present, separating at the same time the fast from the slow components of these systems zzso
