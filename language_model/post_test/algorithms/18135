As a zzso zzso unit of one or more adjacent zzso zzso play a key role in regulation and function in zzso biology, and a better understanding of how they are constituted and controlled is zzso Recent efforts have attempted to predict zzso status in zzso zzso using a variety of techniques and data zzso To date, zzso based zzso prediction strategies have mainly used predicted promoters and zzso present at the zzso of zzso unit as zzso with reasonable zzso However, zzso factor binding sites zzso typically found upstream of the first gene in an zzso have not yet been zzso 

Here we apply a method originally developed for the prediction of zzso in zzso coli that zzso the need for prior knowledge and tests its ability to predict zzso in zzso coli and the 'more zzso zzso important, zzso zzso We demonstrate that through building zzso specific zzso zzso zzso it is possible to predict zzso in zzso coli and zzso zzso with zzso and zzso accuracy respectively, using only zzso as zzso of zzso Additionally, the zzso of zzso footprint data of zzso coli is zzso 

zzso are proposed as novel independent features for use in zzso zzso prediction zzso alone or as part of a set of zzso given their efficacy as zzso zzso in zzso coli and zzso zzso We also show that zzso footprint data in zzso coli generally contains zzso repeats with significantly zzso zzso zzso greater zzso than random zzso zzso the zzso of putative zzso predicted can also enhance zzso zzso
