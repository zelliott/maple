zzso analyses of gene expression data are usually conducted based on their associations with the zzso of a particular zzso Many disease traits have a clearly defined zzso zzso zzso or zzso so that genes can be clustered based on the differences of expression levels between the two contrasting zzso zzso For example, cluster analysis based on zzso zzso has been successfully used in zzso zzso Some complex diseases have zzso that vary in a continuous manner and the method developed for a zzso trait is not immediately zzso to a continuous zzso However, understanding the role of gene expression in these complex traits is of fundamental zzso zzso it is necessary to develop a new statistical method to cluster expressed genes based on their association with a quantitative trait zzso We developed a zzso zzso method to zzso genes based on their association with a continuous zzso We used a linear model to describe the relationship between gene expression and the zzso zzso The model effects of the linear model zzso zzso zzso represent the strength of the zzso We assumed that the model effects of each gene follow a mixture of several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cluster assignment were accomplished via an zzso zzso zzso The method was verified by zzso two simulated zzso and further demonstrated using real data generated in a zzso experiment for the study of gene expression associated with Alzheimer's zzso
