Does zzso power for outcomes of zzso intensive care unit zzso patients get better with time? Or does it get zzso We determined the zzso power of zzso for Neonatal Acute zzso zzso scores and clinical intuitions as a function of day of life zzso for newborn infants admitted to our zzso 

We identified zzso infants admitted to our zzso during zzso who required mechanical zzso We calculated zzso scores on zzso 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, and weekly thereafter until either death or zzso We also asked zzso residents, zzso and zzso on each day of mechanical zzso zzso you think this child is going to live to go home to their family, or die before hospital zzso 

Two thousand zzso zzso scores were calculated for 285 zzso On zzso 1, zzso for zzso (24 zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher than zzso for survivors (13 zzso zzso However, this difference diminished steadily and by zzso 10 was no longer statistically significant zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso On each zzso day, at all ranges of zzso scores, there were at least as many infants who would ultimately survive as would zzso zzso the positive zzso value of any zzso value for subsequent mortality was zzso on all zzso zzso zzso profiles were obtained for 230 zzso infants reflecting over 11 zzso intuitions obtained on zzso patient zzso One hundred zzso zzso of 192 zzso profiles displayed consistent accurate prediction zzso least zzso of their zzso ventilation days were characterized by zzso prediction of zzso Twenty-five zzso of 192 surviving infants survived somewhat zzso that is, after at least 1 day characterized by at least 1 estimate of zzso zzso zzso of the 55 zzso died before zzso zzso zzso percent of the prediction profiles for these early dying infants were zzso zzso and zzso Twenty-two zzso of the 55 zzso died after zzso zzso zzso zzso of these 22 zzso infants were predicted to live by many observers on many hospital zzso zzso zzso of 230 zzso patients had at least 1 zzso day characterized by at least 1 prediction of zzso zzso zzso of these patients were incorrectly zzso that is, they zzso zzso infants who were predicted to die during but survived nonetheless were assessed zzso at 1 zzso Fourteen zzso of these 17 were not zzso zzso were clearly zzso 1 suspicious, and 5 had zzso 

If absolute certainty about mortality is the only criterion that can justify a decision to withhold or withdraw zzso treatment in the zzso these data would make such decisions difficult on the first day of life, and increasingly problematic zzso However, if we acknowledge that medicine is inevitably an zzso science and that clinical predictions can never be perfect, we can ask the more interesting question of whether good but less-than-perfect predictions of imprecise but ethically relevant clinical outcomes can still be zzso We think that they zzso that they zzso
