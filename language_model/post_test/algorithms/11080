Previous research has shown that information seekers in biomedical domain need more support in zzso their zzso A user study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a zzso based query suggestion interface for zzso zzso zzso The study also investigated the impact of search task familiarity on search behaviors and the effectiveness of the zzso 

A real user, user search request and real system approach was used for the zzso Unlike tradition zzso zzso where assigned tasks were used, the participants were asked to search requests of their zzso zzso researchers in Health Sciences participated in the evaluation - each conducted two research requests of their own, alternately with the proposed interface and the zzso zzso Several performance criteria were measured to assess the potential benefits of the experimental zzso including users' assessment of their original and eventual queries, the perceived usefulness of the zzso satisfaction with the search results, and the average relevance score of the saved zzso 

The results show that, when searching for an unfamiliar topic, users were more likely to change their queries, indicating the effect of familiarity on search zzso The results also show that the interface scored higher on several of the performance criteria, such as the zzso of the queries, perceived zzso and user zzso Furthermore, in line with our hypothesis, the proposed interface was relatively more effective when less familiar search requests were zzso 

zzso indicate that there is a selective zzso between search familiarity and search zzso One implication of the research for system evaluation is the importance of taking into consideration task familiarity when assessing the effectiveness of interactive zzso zzso
