Conventional approaches to population biology zzso the roles of zzso conditions, zzso flow and zzso as constraints on population zzso We argue here that this focus has obscured the role of time as a crucial constraint on zzso abilities to survive in some zzso Time constraints may be particularly intrusive both for species that live in intensely bonded groups (where the need to devote time to social interaction may ultimately limit the size of group that a species can maintain in a particular zzso and for zzso that face constraints on the length of the active zzso We use a linear programming approach that allows us to specify both how time allocations to different activities are influenced by local environmental and zzso variables and how these in turn limit group size and population zzso The linear programming approach identifies the zzso niche space within which a species can maintain coherent groups that are larger than the minimum viable group size (or zzso This approach thus allow us to understand better why a given zzso can survive in some zzso but not others, as well as the demographic stress that a population may zzso In addition, they also allow us to evaluate the implications of both past and future climate change for a zzso ability to cope with particular zzso
