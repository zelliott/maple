zzso networks in zzso and in zzso are spontaneously active in the absence of zzso generating highly variable bursts of zzso activity separated by up to seconds of zzso Previous zzso in adult rat zzso revealed an intriguing underlying organization of these zzso termed zzso zzso which is indicative of a critical network zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso avalanches persist throughout development in cortical slice cultures from newborn zzso More specifically, we find that in spite of large variations of average rate in activity, spontaneous bursts occur with zzso distributed sizes zzso zzso and a critical branching zzso close to zzso Our findings suggest that cortical networks zzso regulate a critical state during zzso zzso
