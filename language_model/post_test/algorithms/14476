This paper introduces a product zzso approach for approximate nearest neighbor zzso The idea is to decompose the space into a Cartesian product of zzso zzso and to zzso each zzso zzso A zzso is represented by a short code composed of its zzso zzso zzso The zzso distance between two zzso can be efficiently estimated from their zzso An zzso version increases precision, as it zzso the approximate distance between a zzso and a zzso Experimental results show that our approach searches for nearest neighbors zzso in particular in combination with an zzso file zzso zzso for zzso and zzso image zzso show excellent search zzso outperforming three state-of-the-art zzso The zzso of our approach is validated on a data set of two billion zzso
