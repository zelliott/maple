The purposes of this study were to develop a zzso cardiac zzso zzso method for use with zzso zzso zzso and evaluate its accuracy against manual zzso This zzso model was designed with two distinct zzso preparation and zzso During the model preparation phase, after manual image cropping and then image intensity zzso the zzso is separated from the background based on the difference in their intensity zzso and the zzso and zzso contours are zzso automatically as zeros of an underlying level set zzso During the model evolution phase, the model deformation is driven by the zzso of an energy function consisting of five terms: model intensity, edge attraction, shape zzso contours interaction, and zzso zzso The energy function is minimized zzso by zzso weighting the five terms in the energy function using an zzso zzso The validation experiments were performed on a pool of zzso data sets of five zzso The difference between the zzso zzso and manual zzso was sufficiently small as to be considered clinically zzso This relatively accurate zzso zzso method can be used to significantly increase the zzso of strain analysis of zzso zzso MR images for clinical zzso
