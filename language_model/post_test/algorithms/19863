zzso is one of the most important industrial zzso with a multitude of applications in both food and zzso zzso Although most commercial zzso are microbial zzso the potential of zzso zzso sources, especially plants, should not be zzso In this study, horse mango zzso zzso zzso fruit, known to produce latex with a blistering effect upon contact with human skin, was chosen as a source of zzso and the effect of the extraction process on its zzso activity zzso The crude zzso was extracted from the kernels and extraction was zzso by a response surface methodology zzso using a central composite zzso design zzso The variables studied were pH zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results obtained indicate that the zzso model is significant for all the variables zzso Based on the zzso model generated, optimal extraction conditions were obtained at pH zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the estimated response was zzso zzso zzso test results showed that the difference between the calculated and the experimental zzso activity value was only zzso Based on the zzso the effects of the variables arranged in ascending order of strength were zzso zzso pH zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
