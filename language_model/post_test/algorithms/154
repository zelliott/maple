In a series of recent papers, zzso a computer program based on the concept of hidden zzso random field, has been proposed to zzso the number and locations of zzso population units from the zzso and spatial locations of these zzso The method seems to be of broad appeal as it is zzso much simpler than other competing methods and it has been reported by its authors to be fast and zzso However, this methodology is not grounded in a formal statistical zzso method and seems to rely to a large extent on arbitrary choices regarding the parameters zzso The present article is an investigation of the accuracy of this method and an attempt to assess whether recent results reported on the basis of this method are genuine features of the genetic process or zzso of the zzso 

I zzso simulated data consisting of populations at zzso and linkage equilibrium and also data simulated under a scenario of zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso data previously zzso with this method are also zzso 

Using the zzso program under the zzso model to zzso data consisting of several genuine zzso populations with individuals of pure zzso leads to highly inaccurate results; Using the zzso program under the zzso model to zzso data consisting of a continuous zzso population leads to the zzso of zzso zzso populations whose number and features depend on the parameters zzso zzso previously reported about the zzso using zzso seem to a large extent to be zzso of the statistical methodology zzso The findings go beyond population zzso models and can be an help to design more efficient zzso based on zzso 

The data zzso in the present article are available from zzso
