We are developing an automated ultrasound zzso system wherein a digital zzso unit has been zzso with a motorized ultrasound zzso carriage above a special zzso zzso Challenges of this system are acquiring complete coverage of the breast and minimizing zzso We assessed these problems and investigated methods to increase coverage and stabilize the compressed zzso 

Visual zzso of the zzso contact area and breast periphery were made for 10 patients to estimate coverage zzso Various motion artifacts were evaluated in 6 zzso Nine materials were tested for zzso the paddle to the zzso Fourteen substances were tested for zzso the zzso to the paddle in zzso and zzso views and filling the gap between the peripheral breast and zzso zzso image registration software was used to register adjacent ultrasound zzso 

The average breast contact area was zzso The average percentage of the peripheral air gap filled with ultrasound gel was zzso zzso patient breathing proved equivalent to breath zzso whereas speech and sudden breathing caused unacceptable zzso An adhesive spray that preserves image quality was found to be best for zzso the breast to the paddle and minimizing zzso A highly viscous ultrasound gel proved most effective for zzso the zzso to the paddle for zzso and zzso views and for edge zzso 

The challenges of automated ultrasound scanning in a zzso breast imaging system have been addressed by developing methods to fill in peripheral gaps, minimize patient motion, and register and reconstruct zzso ultrasound image zzso
