The zzso zzso may be calculated from several zzso image acquisitions preceded by different diffusion zzso Unfortunately, these diffusion zzso cause geometric distortion that must be corrected before zzso of the zzso In the present paper we suggest and implement a method for retrospective correction of these zzso firmly based on a physical model for the zzso zzso This method simultaneously estimates subject movement and distortion parameters by finding the set of parameters that zzso residual error when fitting data to the diffusion zzso zzso We show how this notion can be zzso as a zzso form thereby zzso the zzso of a rapid zzso In addition, we suggest models for how zzso vary with slice position and zzso direction that allow us to substantially reduce the zzso of the zzso zzso Our results indicate that we are able to estimate both zzso zzso distortion and subject movement directly from the data without need of any additional zzso
