zzso modeling has emerged as an indispensable approach to resolve and predict the intricate interplay among the many zzso channels underlying zzso zzso However, simulation results using the classic zzso zzso zzso model or the superior zzso kinetic model of zzso channels often zzso significantly from native cellular signals despite using carefully measured zzso Here we found that the filters of zzso amplifier not only delayed the signals, but also introduced zzso and that the residual series resistance in experiments altered the command zzso which had never been fully eliminated by improving the amplifier zzso To remove all the above zzso a virtual device with the parameters exactly same to that of amplifier was introduced into zzso kinetic modeling so as to establish a zzso zzso We demonstrate that our novel zzso approach fully restores the native zzso of zzso with the data recorded at any condition, and predicts spike zzso and firing patterns clearly distinctive from those without zzso
