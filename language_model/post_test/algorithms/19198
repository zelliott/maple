This study aimed to zzso in healthy volunteers, the relationship between the plasma zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and its effects on zzso blood pressure after a single oral administration of zzso 2 zzso M zzso zzso healthy volunteers participated in this zzso zzso and zzso modeling were performed subject by zzso First, plasma zzso were fitted according to a zzso model with zzso zzso and zzso zzso Then the maximum drug-induced decrease zzso effect zzso was developed to describe the zzso relationships between zzso and zzso blood pressure and plasma zzso using the zzso parameters that were previously zzso 

For zzso blood pressure, zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso The corresponding value for decrease in zzso blood pressure was zzso zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso on zzso and zzso blood pressure could be zzso by an zzso zzso effect compartment zzso The obtained zzso rate constant values zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso blood pressure and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso blood zzso were consistent with the rapid development of pharmacological zzso zzso zzso of zzso that zzso an effect at 50% of zzso zzso values were similar for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blood zzso A decrease in zzso blood pressure was the most sensitive response after oral administration of a single dose of zzso 

The direct zzso effects of zzso can be characterized by an zzso effect compartment zzso
