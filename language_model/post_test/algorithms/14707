zzso is crucial and becoming increasingly important to many applications in wireless sensor zzso This paper presents a network-based positioning system and outlines recent work in which we have developed an efficient zzso approach to zzso a mobile sensor using time of arrival zzso and angle of arrival zzso information employing multiple seeds in the zzso zzso By receiving the periodic broadcasts from the seeds, the mobile target sensors can obtain adequate observations and zzso themselves zzso The proposed positioning scheme performs location zzso in three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso positioning with particle zzso and zzso zzso fuzzy zzso Based on the distance zzso and the initial position estimate, zzso fuzzy control scheme is applied to solve the zzso adjustment zzso The simulations show that the proposed approach provides zzso flexibility and robust improvement in position zzso
