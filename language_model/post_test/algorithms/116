Previously, we showed that adoptive transfer of in zzso zzso and ex zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells zzso at day zzso after transplant increased zzso and zzso zzso counts at day zzso and zzso zzso immune responses in patients with zzso Here, we investigated the safety and zzso of zzso recovery after zzso zzso at day zzso after zzso 

In this phase zzso zzso clinical trial, 50 patients with myeloma received zzso after high-dose zzso followed by infusions of zzso at day zzso after zzso Patients also received zzso and zzso zzso using a zzso zzso vaccine only zzso zzso zzso zzso 24) or the zzso zzso vaccine plus an zzso zzso vaccine for zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The mean number of T cells infused was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At day 14 after zzso the median zzso zzso and zzso counts were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels increased early after transplant and zzso levels correlated significantly to day 14 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso responses were zzso zzso infusions were well tolerated with no effect on zzso zzso Eight patients zzso developed a zzso zzso zzso characterized by zzso and fever that was clinically and zzso indistinguishable from grade 1 to 3 acute zzso disease zzso of the gastrointestinal tract zzso zzso and/or grade 1 to 2 zzso zzso (four zzso 

zzso zzso transfers achieve robust zzso recovery early after transplant and induce zzso zzso zzso in a subset of zzso
