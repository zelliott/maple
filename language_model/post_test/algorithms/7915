We present a robust method to register three-dimensional zzso zzso images to magnetic resonance images zzso based on anatomical features, which is designed to be used in the registration pipeline for zzso zzso zzso onto two-dimensional live zzso images during cardiac zzso zzso The features used in image registration are the zzso surface of the left zzso and the zzso line of the descending zzso The zzso left zzso surface is generated using a fully automated algorithm, and the zzso left zzso surface is produced using a zzso zzso method provided by the zzso software zzso zzso that it is routinely used in clinical zzso We test our method on data from six volunteers and four zzso We validated registration accuracy using two zzso the first calculated a root mean square distance error using expert identified anatomical landmarks, and the second method used zzso as landmarks in two clinical zzso zzso zzso show a mean error of zzso zzso which is acceptable for our clinical application, and no failed registrations were zzso In addition, our zzso works on clinical data, is fast and only requires a small amount of manual zzso and so it is zzso for use during cardiac zzso zzso
