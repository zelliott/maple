There are little data on the effects of zzso on cerebral blood volume zzso We studied the effects of changes in zzso on zzso and cerebral blood flow zzso during zzso zzso in eight New Zealand white zzso We also investigated the effects of zzso over time on zzso and zzso during zzso zzso zzso At zzso the mean zzso zzso zzso and zzso values were zzso zzso zzso zzso g and 56 zzso 28 zzso zzso zzso When zzso was reduced from 41 to 27 zzso zzso no significant change in either zzso or zzso was observed zzso zzso zzso However, increasing zzso from 41 to 58 zzso zzso resulted in a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso 39 zzso zzso P zzso zzso In the control group, there were no significant changes in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso during 2 h of zzso zzso These results indicate that, during zzso zzso cerebrovascular zzso of blood flow and blood volume is maintained during zzso but is markedly diminished during zzso 

During zzso zzso in rabbits with normal zzso a reduction in the zzso carbon dioxide level may not always be accompanied by a reduction in brain blood flow and blood zzso
