zzso flexibility creates errors in the comparison of protein zzso Even small changes in backbone or zzso zzso can radically alter the shape of zzso binding zzso These changes can cause structure comparison programs to overlook functionally related proteins with remote evolutionary similarities, and cause others to incorrectly conclude that closely related proteins have different binding preferences, when their zzso are actually zzso zzso the latter effort, this paper applies protein structure prediction zzso to enhance the zzso of zzso proteins according to their binding preferences, despite radical zzso zzso 

Specifically, structure prediction zzso can be used to zzso existing structures against the same zzso This process can return proteins in very different zzso to similar, zzso comparable zzso zzso on close zzso exploits the accuracy of structure predictions on closely related zzso but structure prediction is often a zzso zzso zzso zzso can generate subtly different models with very different binding cavities that make structure comparison zzso We present a first method to mitigate such zzso called zzso zzso that examines a large number of predicted structures to eliminate extreme models of the same binding zzso 

Our results, on the zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso can enable proteins in very different zzso to be returned to states that can be zzso zzso zzso that would have been erroneously classified as having different binding preferences were often correctly classified after zzso while structures that would have been correctly classified as having different binding preferences almost always remained zzso The zzso zzso which exhibited less sequential diversity than the zzso zzso zzso was classified more accurately after zzso than the zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced errors from models with unusual zzso that distort the shape of the binding site, enhancing zzso zzso 

This paper demonstrates that protein structure prediction can compensate for zzso variety in the comparison of zzso binding zzso While protein structure prediction introduces new uncertainties into the structure comparison problem, our results indicate that unusual models can be ignored through an analysis of many models, using techniques like zzso zzso These results point to applications of protein structure comparison that extend beyond existing crystal zzso
