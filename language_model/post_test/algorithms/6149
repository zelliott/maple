To measure the diagnostic accuracy of zzso strain gauge zzso in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism zzso 

Two researchers zzso recruited 425 patients with zzso chest pain presenting to the emergency department zzso Lower limb zzso strain gauge zzso was performed in the zzso All patients underwent an independent reference standard diagnostic zzso to establish the presence or absence of zzso A low modified zzso clinical probability combined with a normal zzso excluded zzso All others required diagnostic imaging with zzso interpreted ventilation zzso scanning and/or zzso zzso zzso pulmonary zzso Patients with a zzso CT had digital zzso pulmonary zzso All patients were followed up clinically for 3 zzso 

The sensitivity of zzso strain gauge zzso was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso and specificity zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso The negative likelihood ratio was zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and positive likelihood ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

Lower limb zzso strain gauge zzso does not aid in the diagnosis of zzso
