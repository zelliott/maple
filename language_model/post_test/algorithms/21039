A principal goal of zzso studies is to identify the genes showing differential expression under distinct zzso In such studies, the selection of an optimal test statistic is a crucial challenge, which depends on the type and amount of data under zzso While previous studies on simulated or zzso zzso do not provide practical guidance on how to choose the best method for a given real zzso we introduce an enhanced zzso zzso which enables the selection of a suitable zzso zzso statistic directly from the zzso In comparison with existing ranking methods, the zzso statistic shows good performance consistently under various simulated conditions and on zzso zzso zzso Further, the feasibility of the novel statistic is confirmed in a practical research setting using data from an in-house zzso zzso study of zzso gene expression zzso These results suggest that the procedure zzso the selection of an appropriate test statistic for a given zzso without relying on a zzso zzso which may bias the findings and their zzso Moreover, the general zzso procedure is not limited to detecting differential expression only but could be extended to a wide range of other applications as zzso
