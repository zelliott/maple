zzso calling procedures vary from laboratory to laboratory for many zzso zzso Even within the same laboratory, application of different experimental protocols often leads to zzso The impact of these ambiguities ranges from irksome to zzso zzso the ambiguities can increase effective sample size and preserve evidence in favor of zzso zzso Because different data sets may contain different numbers of zzso merging is zzso not a simple process of matching zzso one to zzso zzso data sets manually is difficult, zzso and zzso due to differences in zzso hardware, zzso methods, molecular weight standards, and curve fitting zzso zzso is particularly difficult if few or no samples occur in common, or if samples are drawn from ethnic groups with widely varying zzso zzso It is dangerous to align zzso simply by adding a constant number of base pairs to the zzso of one of the data zzso To address these issues, we have developed a zzso model and a zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso zzso for sampling the zzso distribution under the zzso Our computer program, zzso zzso the zzso and almost always accurately and efficiently finds the most likely correct zzso Common zzso zzso across laboratories in the same ethnic group are the single most important cue in the zzso zzso zzso the zzso alignments with the greatest zzso probabilities under several merging zzso It also reports when data sets cannot be confidently zzso These features are emphasized in our analysis of simulated and real zzso
