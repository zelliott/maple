To produce and test an zzso to automatically zzso natural zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso scans of human zzso 

The zzso presented divides the zzso surface into regions of zzso and zzso by looking for sharp increases and decreases in zzso characteristic of step changes between zzso The accuracy of an automatic zzso zzso assessment based on these regions is assessed against serial zzso assessment and manual examination of the same zzso images, using data from 68 previously scanned and zzso teeth with varying levels of natural zzso zzso 

Only three teeth were found to be free of zzso by zzso The results of the automated analysis correlate well with zzso assessment with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and with manual CT assessment with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The depth of zzso zzso correlated with zzso with an zzso correlation zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso N zzso zzso and with manual assessment with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso N zzso zzso zzso is found to generally underestimate zzso compared to zzso zzso 

The zzso presented can successfully segment zzso scans into zzso zzso and zzso regions, and the results show that the depths of zzso zzso zzso can be accurately and zzso measured automatically using zzso However, if zzso zzso is to be accurately assessed by a computer, better scans will be required than those used zzso
