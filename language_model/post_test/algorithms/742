The development of the zzso Carlo code zzso zzso zzso zzso for the simulation of the transport of zzso and heavier zzso in zzso media is zzso The code zzso a zzso of zzso (available as zzso zzso extends the transport of zzso zzso from standard targets to that of zzso in arbitrary zzso materials, taking into account zzso zzso zzso and multiple zzso scattering zzso The consistency of the results obtained with zzso has been verified against experimental data and other existing zzso Carlo codes zzso zzso as well as with deterministic models for zzso zzso comparing depth zzso of energy deposition by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso on zzso The zzso code yields zzso consistent with a proper treatment of nuclear zzso zzso Energy zzso up to and well beyond the Bragg peak due to nuclear zzso are well zzso zzso agreement is also found with experimental zzso of the number of fragments of a given type, as a function of depth in water, produced by zzso and zzso zzso of 670 zzso zzso although less zzso agreement is observed for heavier projectiles such as zzso zzso of the same zzso The calculated zzso zzso differential in energy and angle produced in a mimic of a zzso rock by zzso with zzso zzso of 290 zzso zzso also shows good agreement with experimental zzso It is concluded that a careful analysis of stopping power data for different zzso is necessary for radiation therapy applications, since an incorrect zzso of the position of the Bragg peak might lead to a significant zzso from the prescribed dose in small target zzso The results presented in this study indicate the usefulness of the zzso code for zzso Carlo simulations in the field of light zzso radiation zzso
