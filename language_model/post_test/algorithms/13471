Color zzso flow imaging takes a great value in diagnosing and zzso benign and zzso breast zzso However, scanning of color zzso zzso is zzso and zzso In this paper, a novel breast zzso system based on zzso ultrasound and color zzso flow imaging is zzso First, different feature extraction methods were used to obtain the texture and geometric features from zzso ultrasound zzso In color zzso feature extraction stage, several spectrum features are extracted by applying blood flow zzso analysis to zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso coherent zzso method is proposed based on color zzso zzso which is helpful for designing to the zzso detection of flow zzso from different blood flow zzso fields zzso Finally, a support zzso machine zzso with selected feature zzso is used to zzso breast tumors into benign and zzso The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed zzso diagnosis system is useful for reducing the unnecessary biopsy and death zzso
