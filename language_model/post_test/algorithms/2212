The function of DNA is to specify protein zzso The zzso zzso used in zzso acids is translated to the 20 base alphabet of proteins (plus a stop zzso via the genetic zzso The code is neither overlapping nor zzso but has zzso sequences read in successive zzso zzso until reaching a stop zzso The true genetic code uses three bases for every zzso zzso The efficiency of the genetic code can be significantly increased if the requirement for a fixed zzso length is dropped so that the more common zzso acids have shorter zzso lengths and rare zzso acids have longer zzso zzso More efficient codes can be derived using the zzso and Huffman coding zzso The zzso achieved using a Huffman code cannot be improved zzso I have used these zzso to derive efficient codes for representing protein sequences using both two and four zzso The length of DNA required to specify the complete set of protein sequences could be significantly shorter if zzso used a variable zzso zzso The restriction to a fixed zzso length of three bases means that it takes zzso more DNA than the minimum necessary, and the genetic code is zzso zzso One can think of many reasons why this zzso efficient code has not zzso there is very little zzso so almost any zzso causes an zzso acid zzso Many zzso will be potentially lethal zzso zzso if the zzso leads to a change in zzso zzso It would be more difficult for the machinery of zzso to cope with a variable zzso zzso Nevertheless, in the strict and narrow sense of coding for protein sequences using the minimum length of DNA possible, the Huffman code derived here is zzso
