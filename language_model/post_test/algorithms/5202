A simple, easily zzso zzso statistic is described that can detect the presence of a functional relationship in zzso zzso Given a sample of data points zzso the zzso value is nearly 1 if y is a linear function of zzso with little zzso it is greater than 1 if y is a zzso function of zzso and it is close to 2 if zzso and y are zzso and independently zzso The statistic can be used to rapidly screen through large data sets to identify the most functionally related variable zzso As an zzso the statistic is used to detect relations between zzso zzso energy and functions of a series expansion for chain zzso
