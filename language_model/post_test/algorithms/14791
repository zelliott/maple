This paper proposes a novel technique which provides energy efficient circuit design for sensors zzso The overall system presented requires a minimum number of independently zzso sensors and zzso which enable it to reduce the power consumption by setting unused sensors to zzso This technique reduces hardware requirements, time and zzso problems with a zzso zzso Our proposed algorithm, which hands over the controls to two software zzso for the sensing and moving zzso can greatly improve the overall system zzso Based on the experimental results, we observed that our system, which is using sensing and moving managers, the four sensors required only zzso zzso power consumption when a robot arm is moved a total distance of 17 zzso This system is designed for robot applications but could be implemented to many other human environments such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
