We derive the values for the zzso and zzso zzso needed for zzso simulations of cardiac zzso using homogenization of partial differential zzso In our model, cardiac zzso are zzso prisms and gap junctions appear in a distributed manner as flux boundary conditions for zzso zzso Using directly measurable zzso such as cellular dimensions and zzso and zzso gap junction zzso strengths, we zzso obtain effective zzso close to those given by simulations with a detailed zzso zzso et zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This model provides a convenient framework for studying the effect on zzso of aligned zzso zzso arrangements of cells and the effect of different zzso of gap junctions along the zzso zzso
