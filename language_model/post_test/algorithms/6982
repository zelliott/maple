We have developed a new method for the prediction of zzso sequences that bind to a zzso given a three-dimensional structure of the protein in complex with a zzso By applying a recently developed sequence prediction zzso and a novel ensemble averaging zzso we generate a diverse collection of zzso sequences that are predicted to have significant affinity for the zzso Using output from the simulations, we create zzso scoring zzso or virtual interaction profiles zzso zzso of zzso for a collection of binding motifs to sequences determined zzso indicates that the prediction zzso is accurate and zzso to a diverse range of zzso With these zzso one can scan protein sequence databases rapidly to seek binding partners of potential biological zzso Overall, this method can significantly enhance the information contained within a zzso zzso crystal structure, and enrich the data obtained by experimental selection methods such as zzso zzso
