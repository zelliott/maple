A new approach is presented for improving the zzso efficiency of zzso ground water models based on the zzso element method zzso The zzso is an extension of the existing zzso algorithm, which combines the effects of multiple zzso elements into Laurent series and Taylor series zzso zzso With the new zzso zzso zzso Laurent series are zzso in a zzso zzso data structure with direct mathematical relationships between parent and child zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly accelerate the evaluation of the complex potential and discharge function in models that contain a large number of zzso elements at multiple zzso This evaluation process, the primary zzso cost of zzso models, is required to determine the element zzso generate zzso zzso and trace zzso The performance of the zzso zzso is demonstrated with a simplified model based on the Lake Ontario watershed geometry zzso thousands of zzso features at multiple geographic zzso
