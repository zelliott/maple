The objective of this study was to develop a method of predicting pipe friction head loss, which is a key factor in pipeline transportation of zzso zzso thereby zzso design for pipeline zzso The study involved both zzso and analysis of pipeline zzso Moreover, the study led to the representation of pipe friction head loss as functions of average zzso transportation distance, pipe diameter, pipe interior zzso and zzso zzso and zzso
