During the last decade, protein analysis and zzso have been established as new tools for understanding various biological zzso As the identification of proteins after classical separation techniques, such as two-dimensional gel zzso have become standard methods, new challenges arise in the field of zzso The development of zzso zzso combines functional zzso like regulation, zzso and zzso with the identification of proteins for deeper insight into cellular zzso zzso different mass zzso techniques for the analysis of zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso have been established as well as isolation and separation methods for the analysis of highly complex samples, zzso protein complexes or cell zzso Furthermore, zzso of protein levels within cells is becoming a focus of interest as mass zzso methods for relative or even absolute zzso have currently not been zzso zzso or zzso databases have been an essential part of protein identification up to zzso Thus, de zzso sequencing offers new possibilities in protein zzso studies of organisms not yet completely zzso The intention of this review is to provide a short overview about the current capabilities of protein analysis when addressing various biological zzso
