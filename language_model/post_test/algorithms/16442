zzso evoked potential zzso recordings have been analyzed through independent component analysis zzso in the zzso however, the performance varies depending on the zzso zzso zzso There are very few studies that concentrate on the optimum zzso selection for zzso the zzso components zzso while also recovering the specific artifact generated with the normal functioning of a cochlear implant zzso The objective of this research is to determine which zzso algorithm, zzso statistics zzso or zzso statistic zzso is more plausible to remove this artifact and estimate the zzso The optimal parameters of three such zzso zzso for zzso the components from a database of recordings were determined, and then the estimates for the zzso and zzso artifact were compared using each zzso All the zzso estimate the zzso artifact reasonably well, although only one zzso zzso is better positioned to estimate the zzso this is primarily because it uses the zzso structure of this signal as part of the zzso zzso
