A number of representation schemes have been presented for use within learning zzso systems, ranging from zzso zzso to artificial neural zzso This paper presents results from an investigation into using a temporally dynamic symbolic representation within the zzso learning zzso zzso In particular, zzso zzso networks are used to represent the traditional zzso production system rules to solve zzso reinforcement learning problems and to perform symbolic regression, finding competitive performance with traditional genetic programming on a number of composite zzso zzso In addition, the network zzso are later repeatedly sampled at varying zzso intervals to perform zzso predictions of a financial time zzso
