zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso has been proven to be useful for studying brain zzso However, due to the existence of noise and zzso mapping between the zzso signal and the actual neural activity is zzso Because of the difficulty, differential pattern analysis of zzso brain images for healthy and diseased cases is regarded as an important research zzso From zzso scans, increased blood zzso can be identified as activated brain zzso Also, based on the zzso images of the volume data, zzso provides the functional information for detecting and analyzing different parts of the zzso 

In this paper, the capability of a zzso method that performed an zzso zzso based on modified maximum model zzso in our previous study is zzso The zzso zzso is designed by adopting modified maximum correlation model zzso to detect active regions that contain significant zzso Specifically, in the study, the zzso zzso is examined based on two groups of zzso zzso and healthy subjects to verify the ability of the zzso that enhances the quality of signal activities in the interested regions of the zzso After zzso the algorithm, discrete zzso transform zzso is applied to identify the difference between healthy and zzso zzso 

We successfully showed that our zzso zzso improves the zzso signal activity for both healthy and zzso zzso In addition, we found that zzso based features can identify the difference between healthy and zzso zzso 

The results of this study provide insights of associations of functional abnormalities in dyslexic subjects that may be helpful for zzso identification from healthy zzso
