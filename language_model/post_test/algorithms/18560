A zzso zzso for constructing multiple zzso in zzso modeling of proteins is zzso The zzso zzso variable values in zzso based on a cost function and on statistical analysis of zzso zzso that remain are used for constructing an ensemble of best zzso In test cases, the zzso zzso retains all the best solutions, compared to an exhaustive scan of the full set of zzso Individual zzso are constructed by adding zzso zzso zzso zzso are extracted from a database of proteins and their zzso include bond lengths and all zzso Single zzso are constructed from both zzso and zzso terminals to the center, and loop closure is evaluated by a combination of penalties for the zzso closure and zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions with the rest of the zzso Large ensembles of each loop are clustered and re-evaluated with a refined zzso energy zzso The reduced, clustered set of each loop is then employed to construct simultaneously all the zzso The zzso was applied to construct simultaneously six zzso in zzso zzso family zzso incorporating a total of zzso zzso The best zzso for reconstructing the zzso is zzso A for zzso zzso zzso in the zzso Data zzso and zzso A for human zzso zzso zzso The multiple loop zzso with lowest energy have higher zzso values, of zzso A and zzso A, zzso The average zzso values for the first 1000 zzso are zzso A and zzso A, zzso Models for the zzso structures of zzso and of zzso were constructed on the basis of zzso The zzso model is found to be more flexible in the zzso region than its zzso zzso
