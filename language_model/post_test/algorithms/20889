The statistical characterization of the spatial structure of large animal groups has been very limited so far, mainly due to a lack of empirical data, especially in three dimensions zzso Here we focus on the case of large flocks of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso We reconstruct the zzso positions of individual birds within flocks of up to few thousands of zzso In this respect our data constitute a unique zzso We perform a statistical analysis of zzso structure by using two quantities that are new to the field of collective animal zzso namely the conditional density and the pair correlation zzso These tools were originally developed in the context of condensed matter zzso We explain what is the meaning of these two zzso how to measure them in a reliable way, and why they are useful in assessing the density fluctuations and the statistical correlations across the zzso We show that the zzso density zzso displayed by zzso flocks gives rise to an anomalous zzso of the conditional zzso We also find that the pair correlation function has a structure incompatible with a zzso arrangement of zzso In fact, our results suggest that flocks are somewhat intermediate between the liquid and the gas phase of physical zzso
