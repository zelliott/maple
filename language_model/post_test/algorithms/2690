A modified zzso zzso Chemical zzso string zzso zzso zzso another zzso is suggested as a method for including the structural information of a given zzso making it straightforward and more easily zzso The zzso theme is zzso for checking the structural identity with higher sensitivity and generating three-dimensional zzso structures from the one-dimensional zzso string with less ambiguity than the general zzso zzso The modifications to zzso provide zzso single bonds, zzso of zzso compounds, zzso and zzso and parity of atoms with a lone zzso Additionally, zzso better preserves the original information of the given input file zzso using the zzso information, hydrogen count zzso and original bond type, which are not considered or zzso considered in zzso and zzso When zzso is used to perform a zzso check on a zzso chemical structure database, zzso it shows more discriminating power than zzso The structural information provided by zzso is in a compact format, making it a promising solution for handling large chemical structure zzso
