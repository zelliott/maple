The study aims at identifying zzso zzso information significantly related with zzso crashes on urban zzso for different crash zzso Since the data used in this study are zzso zzso collected outside the zzso of a designed zzso an information discovery approach is adopted for this zzso 

Random zzso which are ensembles of individual trees grown by zzso zzso and zzso zzso algorithm, are applied in numerous applications for this zzso Specifically, conditional zzso forests have been zzso In each tree of the conditional zzso forest, splits are based on how good the association zzso zzso test statistics are used to measure the zzso Apart from identifying the variables that improve zzso zzso the methodology also clearly identifies the variables that are neutral to zzso and also those that decrease zzso 

The methodology is quite zzso in identifying the variables of interest in the database zzso zzso drug use and higher posted speed limits contribute to severe zzso Failure to use safety equipment by all passengers and presence of zzso in the vulnerable age group (more than 55 years or less than 3 zzso increased the severity of injuries given a crash had zzso A new zzso zzso has been used in this study, which assigns crashes to zzso zzso or access points based on the information from site location, traffic control, and presence of zzso 

The authors were able to identify zzso locations where severe crashes tend to zzso For example, segments and access points were found to be riskier for single vehicle zzso Higher skid resistance and zzso also contributed toward increased severity of injuries in zzso
