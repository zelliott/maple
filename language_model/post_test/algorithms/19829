To investigate the performance of a new software-based zzso quality assessment zzso 

The software-based system employs a novel image processing zzso which detects the levels of image clarity, withdrawal zzso and level of the zzso preparation in a real-time fashion from live video zzso zzso levels of image zzso and the withdrawal zzso below which the zzso could be considered adequate have initially been determined arbitrarily by review of sample zzso videos by two experienced zzso zzso an overall zzso quality rating was zzso based on the percentage of the withdrawal time with adequate zzso zzso zzso 1, when the percentage was zzso 2, when the percentage was zzso zzso In order to test the proposed zzso and zzso zzso screening zzso withdrawal videos from a specialized ambulatory colon cancer screening center were collected, automatically processed and zzso Quality ratings on the withdrawal were compared to the zzso in the same zzso Then, 3 experienced zzso reviewed the collected videos in a blinded fashion and rated the overall quality of each withdrawal zzso zzso 1, poor; 3, zzso 5, zzso based on 3 major aspects: image quality, colon preparation, and withdrawal zzso The automated quality ratings were compared to the averaged zzso quality ratings using zzso correlation zzso 

Fourteen screening zzso were zzso zzso zzso were detected in zzso zzso of the collected zzso video zzso As a proof of concept, the zzso software rated zzso withdrawal as having better zzso than the zzso in the 10 videos which did not have any zzso zzso percent time with adequate zzso zzso zzso zzso for withdrawal and 50% zzso zzso for zzso P zzso zzso zzso times during which no zzso were removed ranged from 4-12 zzso The median quality rating from the automated system and the zzso was zzso zzso range zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively for all zzso video zzso The automated rating revealed a strong correlation with the reviewer's rating zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was good correlation of the automated overall quality rating and the mean zzso withdrawal speed rating zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was no correlation of automated overall quality rating with mean zzso image quality rating zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

The results from a novel automated real-time zzso quality feedback system strongly agreed with the zzso quality zzso Further study is required to validate this zzso
