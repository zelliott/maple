We propose a general method to maximize the zzso contrast between an object and its background using a predetermined zzso polarization zzso After a first zzso of the zzso properties of the scene by classical Mueller imaging, we evaluate the incident polarized field that zzso scattered polarization states by the object and background, as opposite as possible on the zzso e zzso With a detection method zzso for a zzso imaging system, zzso Carlo simulations of low flux coherent imaging are performed with various objects and backgrounds having different properties of zzso zzso and zzso With respect to classical Mueller imaging, possibly associated to the polar decomposition, our results show a noticeable increase in the zzso distance used as our contrast zzso
