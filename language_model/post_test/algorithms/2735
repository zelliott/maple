The aim of this study was to explore the relationship of scanning parameters zzso zzso reconstruction kernels and slice thickness with image quality and radiation dose in a zzso 

The chest of an zzso phantom was scanned on a zzso scanner zzso zzso Definition zzso using different clinical zzso including zzso and zzso zzso Four scan protocols were zzso 1) zzso zzso zzso 2) zzso zzso zzso 3) zzso zzso zzso and 4) zzso with zzso zzso 89, zzso The automatic exposure control was switched off for all the scans and the zzso selected was in between zzso and zzso The raw data were reconstructed using the reconstruction kernels zzso zzso and zzso and slice thicknesses were zzso and zzso Finally, the same parameters and procedures were used for the scanning of water zzso Friedman test and zzso test were used for statistical zzso 

The zzso based on the given zzso values showed significantly lower exposure for protocol 4, when compared to protocol 1 zzso difference zzso protocol 2 zzso zzso zzso and protocol 3 zzso zzso zzso The highest change in zzso Units was observed with zzso zzso zzso unit zzso compared to protocol 2 zzso The differences in noise between the different clinical protocol data sets were statistically significant zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso and protocol 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso protocol shows the highest image noise zzso for zzso slice zzso and zzso for zzso slice zzso zzso The difference between reconstruction kernel zzso and zzso images made using zzso reconstruction thickness was statistically significant zzso and zzso slice thickness shows the significance of zzso between zzso and zzso zzso In both cases, the lowest image noise was obtained from zzso reconstructed zzso Again the slice thickness significantly affects image noise zzso and the noise was higher at zzso compared to that at zzso slice zzso 

The clinical zzso reconstruction zzso slice thickness and phantom diameter or the density of material it contains directly affects the image zzso zzso energy protocol shows the lowest zzso compared to all other protocols zzso the fused image shows excellent image quality and the noise is same as that of single or zzso mode protocol zzso Advanced CT technology improves image quality and considerably reduces radiation zzso
