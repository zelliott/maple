Mass zzso is being used to generate protein profiles from human serum, and zzso data obtained from mass zzso have attracted great interest for the detection of early stage zzso However, high zzso mass zzso data cause considerable zzso In this paper we propose a feature extraction zzso based on zzso analysis for high zzso mass zzso zzso A set of zzso detail zzso at different scale is used to detect the transient changes of mass zzso zzso The experiments are performed on 2 zzso A highly competitive zzso compared with the best performance of other kinds of zzso models, is zzso Experimental results show that the zzso detail zzso are efficient way to characterize features of high zzso mass zzso and reduce the zzso of high zzso mass zzso
