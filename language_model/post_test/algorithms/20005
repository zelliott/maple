zzso scores for prediction of coronary heart disease zzso in older adults are zzso 

To develop a zzso zzso risk prediction model for older adults that accounts for competing risks for zzso 

2 zzso cohort studies, using data from zzso participants in the zzso Health Study zzso and zzso participants in the Rotterdam Study zzso 

Community settings in the United States zzso and zzso the Netherlands zzso 

zzso aged 65 years or older who were free of cardiovascular zzso 

A composite of nonfatal zzso zzso and coronary zzso 

During a median follow-up of zzso and zzso years, zzso zzso and zzso zzso participants had zzso events, zzso Deaths from zzso causes largely exceeded the number of zzso events, complicating accurate zzso risk zzso The prediction model had moderate ability to discriminate between events and zzso zzso zzso in both zzso and European men and zzso and zzso in zzso and European zzso The model was zzso predicted risks were in good agreement with observed zzso Compared with the zzso point scores, the prediction model classified elderly zzso persons into higher risk categories but elderly European persons into lower risk zzso zzso in zzso accuracy were not consistent and depended on cohort and zzso Adding newer cardiovascular risk markers to the model did not substantially improve zzso 

The model may be less zzso in nonwhite zzso and the comparison zzso model was not designed for adults older than 79 zzso 

A zzso risk prediction model that accounts for deaths from zzso causes among older adults provided zzso risk estimates but was not substantially more accurate than zzso point zzso Moreover, adding newer risk markers did not improve zzso These findings emphasize the difficulties of predicting zzso risk in elderly persons and the need to improve these zzso
