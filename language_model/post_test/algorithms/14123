The zzso avascular zone zzso is known to enlarge in diabetic zzso In a preliminary study, the authors applied a region growing zzso to zzso zzso to detect the zzso in a zzso zzso 

The zzso in 44 zzso zzso of 44 eyes of 41 patients with diabetic zzso underwent manual zzso then analysis with the region growing function of the zzso image analysis zzso The same zzso was applied after median filtering of the zzso 

zzso zzso was zzso between the first two authors, zzso between the first author and zzso detection before median filtering and zzso after median zzso Average surface areas however, were smaller with zzso detection zzso zzso before and zzso zzso after median zzso than with manual detection zzso zzso 

zzso detection of the zzso is possible, but refinements need to be made in zzso quality and/or image zzso to improve zzso
