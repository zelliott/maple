In zzso zzso testing of materials with a zzso structure the scattering from the grains causes zzso noise, which masks flaw echoes in the measured zzso Several filtering methods have been proposed for improving the zzso zzso In this paper we present a comparative study of methods based on the zzso zzso zzso with zzso discrete and zzso packet zzso are evaluated by means of zzso ratio zzso Measured and simulated zzso signals are used to verify the proposed zzso zzso For comparison, we use zzso ratio enhancement related to fault echo zzso and filtering efficiency specific for zzso zzso The best results in our setup were achieved with the zzso packet zzso zzso
