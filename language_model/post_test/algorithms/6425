The purpose of this study was to determine whether admission zzso zzso zzso criteria can exclude zzso injury in stable patients sustaining blunt abdominal zzso 

Seven hundred zzso zzso stable patients with suspicion of blunt abdominal trauma were included in the zzso Admission data for clinical examination, zzso routine laboratory studies, zzso zzso findings, and zzso zzso zzso zzso score were zzso Each patient underwent zzso abdominal zzso Injuries were considered major if they required surgery or zzso zzso At the zzso institution, zzso is routinely performed if there is a zzso injury of American Association for the Surgery of zzso grade II or higher or a liver injury of American Association for the Surgery of zzso grade III or zzso zzso analysis was performed to determine the value of isolated and combined clinical, zzso and laboratory parameters in depicting an zzso injury with regard to CT results and clinical zzso 

The best combination of criteria to identify a major abdominal injury was obtained when zzso chest zzso and three laboratory parameters zzso zzso zzso zzso white blood cell count, and zzso were zzso zzso zzso of zzso of patients without major injuries fulfilled these zzso The only combination of criteria that completely excluded zzso injury was obtained when clinical criteria combined with a zzso zzso zzso score zzso 13, bedside zzso studies, and laboratory data were all normal, but only zzso zzso of zzso of patients without abdominal injury fulfilled these zzso
