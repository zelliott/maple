To determine the correlation of qualitative zzso wave zzso zzso pattern zzso to quantitative zzso zzso and whether it is representative of quantitative zzso values with similar zzso 

From October 2012 to January zzso 267 breast masses of 236 women zzso age: zzso zzso zzso years, zzso zzso zzso who had undergone zzso zzso zzso and subsequent biopsy were zzso US zzso final assessment and qualitative and quantitative zzso zzso were zzso zzso between pattern zzso and mean zzso maximum zzso elasticity ratio and standard zzso were zzso zzso performances of zzso zzso zzso zzso and US combined to zzso values were calculated and zzso 

Of the 267 breast masses, 208 zzso were benign and 59 zzso were zzso zzso zzso significantly correlated with all quantitative zzso zzso showing highest correlation with maximum zzso r zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly decreased in US combined to zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso while specificity was significantly zzso zzso to zzso zzso Area under the zzso curve zzso did not show significant differences between zzso US to US combined to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso shows high correlation to maximum zzso and may be representative of quantitative zzso zzso When combined to zzso zzso zzso improves specificity of zzso
