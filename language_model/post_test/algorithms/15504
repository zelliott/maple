The wear factors, zzso zzso of two sets of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cup liners, when articulated against zzso zzso zzso zzso heads, were determined in a hip joint wear zzso All test conditions used were the same for both sets, with the exception that in one set zzso six zzso the bovine serum concentration in the test zzso zzso was zzso while it was zzso for the other set zzso seven zzso For each liner in each set, the values of the following independent or explanatory variables were zzso the zzso toughness zzso in zzso of the zzso the degree of zzso zzso of the zzso the mean surface zzso zzso in zzso of the zzso and the zzso clearance between the zzso head and the liner zzso in zzso All the results in both sets were combined and zzso analyses were performed between zzso on the one hand, and various combinations of zzso zzso and zzso on the other zzso It was found that the strongest correlations were obtained when P was included, but that zzso and U are also important zzso Within the range of values of the independent variables used, the recommended relationship zzso This relationship has many potential zzso such as for screening zzso zzso that are being considered as candidates for zzso zzso cup liners, and for conducting studies of the sensitivity of zzso to a change in a value of a specified independent variable (with the values of all the other independent variables held zzso These zzso as well as the study limitations, are discussed in zzso
