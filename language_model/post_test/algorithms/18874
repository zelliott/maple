A method of rapid determination of zzso a and zzso contents of zzso based on zzso analysis of the digital images of the zzso is zzso The color variation of zzso during zzso is evaluated by the brightness of the three primary colors zzso green, and zzso The brightness values of the three primary colors are modeled as two linear correlation functions zzso zzso for zzso zzso a and zzso zzso zzso The zzso a and zzso contents predicted by the proposed model are compared with that determined by the standard zzso The good agreement of the model predictions with experimental results is demonstrated with a squared correlation zzso zzso of zzso for zzso a and zzso The reliability of the zzso model was verified in real zzso of the zzso in a zzso Growth zzso contents of zzso a and zzso corresponded very well with previously reported zzso
