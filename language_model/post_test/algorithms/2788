It is well known that the zzso of some genes in a genetic regulatory network is useful for avoiding zzso states associated with some diseases like zzso For this purpose, both optimal zzso control and zzso control policies have been zzso zzso networks zzso and its extension zzso zzso networks zzso as useful and effective tools for zzso gene regulatory systems have received much attention in the zzso zzso The control problem for these models has been studied zzso The optimal control problem in a zzso can be formulated as a zzso dynamic programming zzso In the previous studies, the optimal control problems did not take into account the hard constraints, zzso to include an upper bound for the number of controls that can be applied to the captured zzso This is important as more treatments may bring more side effects and the patients may not bear too many zzso A zzso for the optimal zzso control problem with hard constraints introduced by the zzso This model is state independent and the objective function is only dependent on the distance between the desirable states and the terminal zzso An approximation method is also given to reduce the zzso cost in solving the zzso Experimental results are given to demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed zzso and zzso
