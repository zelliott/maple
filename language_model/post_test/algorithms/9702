Automatic measurement of zzso blood pressure is important, but the available commercial automatic blood pressure meters, mostly based on zzso are of low zzso 

In this study, we present a zzso technique for automatic measurement of zzso blood pressure, based on zzso signals measured simultaneously in fingers of both zzso After inflating the pressure cuff to a level above zzso blood pressure in a relatively slow rate, it is slowly zzso The cuff pressure for which the zzso signal zzso during the zzso of the zzso was taken as the zzso blood zzso The zzso for the detection of the zzso signal zzso zzso determination of the zzso in which the zzso signal zzso to the cuff is expected to appear, utilizing the zzso signal in the free hand, and zzso discrimination between random fluctuations and zzso zzso The detected zzso in the zzso were identified as zzso zzso if they met two criteria, based on the pulse zzso and on the correlation between the signal in each segment and the signal in the two neighboring zzso 

zzso of the zzso automatic technique to zzso the reference standard, shows that the standard zzso of their differences was zzso zzso For subjects with zzso blood pressure above 130 zzso the standard zzso was even lower, zzso zzso These values are much lower than the 8 zzso value imposed by zzso standard for automatic blood pressure zzso 

The zzso technique for automatic measurement of zzso blood pressure, and the zzso which was presented in this study, seems to be zzso
