Numerous zzso methods of zzso prediction and zzso breeding value zzso based on zzso association models have been zzso zzso the methods have been based either on zzso chain zzso Carlo or on faster maximum a zzso zzso The demand for more accurate and more efficient zzso has led to the rapid emergence of zzso methods, zzso at the expense of zzso principles for zzso model zzso In this article we go back to the basics and build a zzso zzso association model for quantitative and zzso traits with carefully defined zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this treatment we consider alternative model structures, using indicator variables and zzso zzso We make the most of the zzso analysis, enabled by the zzso zzso of the prior zzso by zzso the fully conditional zzso zzso of the parameters and using the acquired known zzso in building fast generalized zzso zzso zzso
