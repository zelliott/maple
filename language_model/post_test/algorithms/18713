A complex of zzso with zzso was zzso by mixing water solutions of zzso nitrate and zzso sodium salt in a zzso zzso ratio of zzso The complex was characterized and identified by zzso analysis, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mass spectral data, zzso and zzso zzso analysis of the complex indicated the formation of a compound of the composition zzso R standing for the zzso The reaction of zzso with zzso was studied in detail by the zzso zzso The zzso formation of two complexes, zzso zzso and zzso was established in the pH region zzso The equilibrium zzso for zzso and zzso complexes were determined to be zzso and zzso zzso
