This paper proposes a novel hybrid genetic zzso for feature zzso Local search operations are devised and embedded in hybrid zzso to fine-tune the zzso The operations are zzso in terms of their zzso power, and their effectiveness and timing requirements are analyzed and zzso The zzso technique produces two desirable zzso a significant improvement in the final performance and the acquisition of zzso zzso The hybrid zzso showed better convergence properties compared to the classical zzso A method of performing rigorous timing analysis was developed, in order to compare the timing requirement of the conventional and the proposed zzso zzso performed with various standard data sets revealed that the proposed hybrid zzso is superior to both a simple zzso and sequential search zzso
