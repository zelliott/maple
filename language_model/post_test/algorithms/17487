For flexible control of zzso it is important to associate preceding zzso response with its zzso Since the zzso prefrontal zzso zzso plays a major role in such control, it is likely that this area has a zzso mechanism of coding zzso such as zzso based on the nature of the zzso response made immediately zzso To test this hypothesis, we examined zzso activity in the zzso while monkeys performed a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso task that had two reward zzso In this task, the correct response was rewarded in half of the trials only and the subject could not expect the outcome zzso The response was followed by a fixation of 2 s zzso We also employed a fixation zzso task that required monkeys to fixate on the peripheral target only, with two reward conditions that were similar to those in the zzso zzso zzso activity of a subset of zzso zzso was modulated by both the direction of the preceding response and its zzso None of these zzso showed directional zzso activity in the zzso zzso These results suggest that a subset of zzso zzso represent zzso zzso zzso associated with directional zzso made immediately zzso
