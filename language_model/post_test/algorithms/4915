Positive therapeutic response without adverse side effects to zzso nucleus deep brain stimulation zzso zzso for Parkinson's disease zzso depends to a large extent on zzso location within the zzso The zzso region of the zzso zzso the preferred location for zzso zzso lies zzso in a region also marked by distinct beta zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In this study, we present a real-time method to accurately zzso zzso of the zzso during surgery, based on zzso recordings zzso and a Hidden zzso Model zzso zzso zzso zzso were used, obtained from 21 zzso patients who underwent bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso Root mean square zzso and power spectral density zzso of the zzso were used to train and test an zzso in identifying the zzso zzso region zzso and zzso zzso within the zzso The zzso zzso were compared to the decisions of a human zzso The zzso identified zzso the zzso boundary of the zzso and zzso with an error of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso standard zzso and with detection reliability zzso zzso 1 zzso of 95, 86, and zzso zzso The zzso was successful despite a very coarse zzso method and was robust to zzso zzso Thus, using an zzso in conjunction with zzso and zzso measures of zzso zzso can provide improved refinement of zzso entry and exit in comparison with previously reported automatic methods, and introduces a novel zzso detection of a distinct zzso zzso
