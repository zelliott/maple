Imaging systems that form estimates using a statistical approach generally yield images with zzso resolution zzso That is, the reconstructed images possess resolution properties marked by zzso and/or zzso zzso We have previously developed a zzso penalty for zzso zzso reconstruction that yields nearly uniform resolution zzso We demonstrated how to calculate this penalty efficiently and apply it to an idealized zzso zzso zzso zzso system whose geometric response is zzso In this paper, we demonstrate the efficient calculation and application of this penalty to zzso zzso (The method is most appropriate when the system zzso has been zzso We apply the penalty to a large field of view PET system where crystal penetration effects make the geometric response zzso and to a two-dimensional single zzso zzso zzso zzso system whose detector responses are modeled by a zzso zzso with zzso varying zzso at zzso We perform a simulation study comparing reconstructions using our proposed zzso approach with other reconstruction methods and demonstrate the relative resolution zzso and discuss tradeoffs among zzso that yield nearly uniform zzso We observe similar noise performance for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso approaches with carefully matched resolution, so choosing one zzso over another should be made on other factors like zzso complexity and convergence rates of the zzso zzso Additionally, because the zzso zzso and the proposed zzso approach can outperform one another in terms of resolution uniformity depending on the desired reconstruction resolution, we present and discuss a hybrid approach adopting both a penalty and zzso
