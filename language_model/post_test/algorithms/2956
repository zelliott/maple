To compare zzso variations in zzso the whole breast for treatment planning using two zzso zzso 

zzso contours were generated by a zzso image zzso breast zzso method zzso by mapping the whole breast clinical target volume zzso from a template case to a new patient zzso Eight breast radiation zzso modified the zzso contours as necessary to achieve a clinically appropriate zzso and then zzso the same case from scratch for zzso The times to complete each approach, as well as the zzso variations, were zzso The template case was also mapped to 10 breast cancer patients with a body mass index of zzso zzso The three-dimensional zzso distances and volume overlapping analyses were zzso to zzso zzso zzso 

The median time to edit the zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso the zzso from scratch zzso faster, p zzso zzso The mean zzso distance was noticeably reduced from zzso zzso among the contours generated from scratch to zzso zzso using the zzso method zzso zzso zzso The zzso contours in 10 patients achieved zzso volume overlap before correction and required editing of zzso zzso zzso of the contoured zzso 

zzso zzso variations suggested a lack of consensus regarding the zzso even among breast cancer zzso Using the zzso method produced more consistent results and required less zzso The zzso method can be successfully applied to patients with different body mass zzso
