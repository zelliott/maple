Bone age rating is associated with a considerable zzso zzso which limits its usefulness in modern pediatric zzso An automated computerized method would theoretically solve this problem but has been surprisingly difficult to zzso 

We review the development of automated bone age assessment and describe how the conceptual understanding of bone age rating shifted from a zzso theory to a more intuitive and zzso zzso The role of the zzso system from 1992 is zzso The zzso system from 2008 employs zzso models of each bone to locate the bones and extracts the component of the bone appearance related to maturity in a zzso statistical zzso Two clinical studies have been published on its zzso defined as the root mean square zzso from manual zzso Other studies addressed the precision of the method, defined as its ability to give the same result on a repeated zzso expressed as the zzso on a single zzso 

The accuracy of the automated bone age determination was zzso zzso and the precision was zzso zzso More than zzso of the images could be zzso The system was validated on children with various diagnoses of short stature in the bone age range zzso zzso for boys and zzso zzso for zzso 

The reviewed validation studies suggest that this automated bone age determination system has adequate zzso precision, and efficiency to be clinically zzso
