zzso which uses ultrasound to image the tissue strain that results from an applied zzso can display zzso and zzso tissue with high zzso However, its application to liver in zzso may be problematic due to the presence of respiratory and cardiovascular sources of zzso The aim of this study was to measure the zzso component of natural liver motion for the purpose of planning future work that will either use the motion to produce elasticity images or will compensate for it when employing an external source of zzso A total of 36 sequences of 7 s real-time radio frequency zzso echo images of the liver were acquired from six healthy volunteers during zzso using a stationary zzso zzso zzso For each image zzso the zzso and lateral components of displacement were measured for each pair of consecutive zzso images using zzso zzso The zzso character of these zzso was then zzso using a novel approach, employing proper zzso decomposition, zzso the dominant motion patterns are described by zzso with the highest zzso The motion patterns of different liver segments were complex, but they were also found to be zzso highly zzso and capable of producing measurable zzso in the zzso These observations provide good evidence to suggest that it may be possible to correct for natural liver motion when using an zzso applied displacement for elasticity zzso It was also found that about zzso of all liver motion could be described using the first zzso Use of only this component of the motion will greatly simplify the design of a mechanical system to be used in an objective study of elasticity imaging of zzso and excised zzso in the presence of simulated zzso liver zzso
