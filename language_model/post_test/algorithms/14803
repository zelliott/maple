A model based on zzso zzso component zzso and a neural network is proposed for the zzso diagnosis of sensor zzso zzso predicted values of sensors are zzso by using historical data measured under zzso conditions and a zzso zzso zzso the squared prediction error zzso of the sensor system is zzso A fault can then be detected when the zzso suddenly zzso If more than one sensor in the system is out of order, after combining different sensors and reconstructing the signals of combined sensors, the zzso is calculated to locate the faulty zzso Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by simulation and comparison studies, in which two sensors in the system are out of order at the same zzso
