Recent zzso zzso sequencing technologies provide large amounts of quantitative zzso data, and thus, biologists currently need to process vast quantities of the data on a regular zzso The first step of the process is almost always smoothing of the data because biomedical data generally tend to contain a lot of zzso In this first step, classical zzso zzso are widely zzso however, the second-generation zzso transform has not been used in biomedical zzso zzso based on the second-generation zzso is more effective than classical zzso methods because it employs zzso zzso functions and does not require zzso explicit base zzso Since biomedical data usually lack zzso it is more useful in biomedical research to use the second-generation zzso than to use the classical zzso zzso we propose a novel smoothing method based on the second-generation zzso and zzso zzso which enables to determine robust thresholds for zzso zzso and apply it to synthetic and real zzso zzso Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed zzso
