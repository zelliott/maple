The need for zzso gating presents many difficulties in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso imaging techniques eliminate the need for zzso gating in zzso zzso but they cannot offer the spatial and zzso resolution provided by segmented acquisition zzso Previous MR zzso techniques have demonstrated an ability to provide cardiac gating zzso however, these techniques result in decreased imaging zzso The purpose of this work was to develop a new zzso zzso acquisition technique that eliminates these efficiency deficits by zzso the motion synchronization signal directly from the same MR signals used for image zzso Three separate strategies are proposed for zzso the zzso signal from data acquired using zzso zzso zzso echo peak zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso techniques were performed on seven normal zzso A comparison of the results showed that they provided zzso image series with no significant differences in image quality compared to that obtained with conventional zzso gating zzso zzso techniques represent an important practical advance in clinical zzso because they enable the acquisition of high zzso and spatial resolution cardiac zzso images without the need for zzso gating and with no loss in imaging zzso
