The paper is concerned with methods for the zzso of the zzso time zzso since the most recent common zzso of a sample of zzso DNA zzso The methods take advantage of prior knowledge of population zzso in addition to the molecular zzso While some theoretical results are zzso a central focus is on zzso zzso These methods are easy to zzso and, since explicit zzso tend to be either unavailable or zzso they are also more useful and more zzso in most zzso zzso are presented that allow for the effects of uncertainty in our knowledge of population size and zzso rates, for zzso in population sizes, for regions of different zzso rate, and for zzso concerning the zzso time of the entire zzso The methods are illustrated using recent data from the human Y zzso
