In this article, the authors present a novel real-time cancer detection technique by using needle zzso forces in conjunction with zzso criteria during zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments and pathological analysis were performed for developing a zzso detection zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso method was performed to identify the statistically significant zzso zzso A baseline force model was then developed using these significant zzso The threshold force model that estimated the lower bound of the zzso tissue forces was formulated by adding an adjustable zzso to the baseline force zzso zzso between sensitivity and specificity was obtained by varying the threshold value of the zzso from which the zzso characteristic zzso curve was zzso zzso zzso programming was used to zzso the zzso model by maximizing the area under the zzso curve zzso using a set of zzso patient zzso When the zzso model was evaluated using an independent set of zzso patient data, an zzso of zzso was zzso The feasibility of cancer detection in real time during zzso interventions was zzso
