Four out of eight zzso zzso almond oil, zzso oil, zzso oil and zzso nut zzso were rich sources of zzso fatty acids like olive zzso zzso seed oil, rice barn oil zzso zzso toasted zzso oil and walnut oil contained high levels of essential fatty zzso The order of zzso stability determined by zzso measuring of the induction period at four temperatures (90 degrees C, 100 degrees C, 110 degrees C, and 120 degrees zzso was found to be zzso oil zzso rice zzso oil approximately toasted zzso oil zzso zzso oil zzso almond oil zzso zzso oil zzso grape seed oil zzso walnut zzso zzso zzso fatty acid oils gave a linear relationship between 100 times the zzso of the induction period against the total zzso fatty acid content obtained as zzso + zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso while the zzso fatty acid oils gave an exponential zzso In the case of rice zzso and zzso zzso zzso prediction from the zzso of the zzso plots and the zzso factors was compared well with that of storage time given by the oil zzso In the cases of the other oils (with an exception of zzso nut zzso the predicted zzso were significantly lower than that of the storage times; especially, walnut oil zzso prone to zzso gave zzso times lower zzso than the zzso storage zzso
