This paper analyzes local and global behavior of several zzso systems which zzso some artificial neural network zzso zzso models originally designed for principal component analysis zzso in the characterization of random zzso These systems implicitly performed the spectral analysis of correlation zzso zzso positive zzso zzso Here, the proposed zzso cover both zzso zzso as well as fully zzso zzso Local stability analysis is performed via zzso and global behavior is analyzed by constructing several zzso zzso
