The probability of recovering consciousness in acute zzso patients depends on central nervous system damage and complications acquired during their stay in the intensive care zzso The objective of this study was to establish a relation between the zzso Index zzso and other variables derived from the analysis of the zzso zzso with the probability of recovering consciousness in patients in a coma state due to severe cerebral zzso 

Twenty-five critically ill, unconscious zzso patients from whom sedative drugs were withdrawn at least 24 h before zzso recording were zzso zzso zzso zzso spectral edge frequency, burst suppression ratio, and frontal zzso were recorded for 20 zzso The zzso condition of the patients was measured according to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients were followed up for assessment of recovery of consciousness for 6 months after the zzso The studied variables were compared between the group of patients who recovered consciousness and those who did not zzso Their zzso ability was evaluated by means of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was used to model the relation between variables and probability of recovery of zzso zzso was used to validate the proposed zzso 

There were statistically significant differences between the group of patients who recovered consciousness and those who did not with respect to zzso zzso zzso and zzso frontal zzso signal quality index values, and zzso The zzso zzso values were zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso The odds ratio for zzso in the zzso zzso model was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso results reported a zzso median absolute zzso performance error of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso and a zzso median zzso performance error of zzso zzso 

The study zzso and other zzso and clinical variables has enabled construction and zzso of a model relating zzso to the probability of recovery of consciousness in patients in a coma state due to a severe brain injury, after sedation has been zzso
