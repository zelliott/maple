To compare the performance of a neural network in identifying visual field defects with the performance of other available zzso 

A zzso neural network with a single hidden layer was trained to recognize visual field defects previously collected in a zzso follow-up glaucoma study, and then tested on fields taken from the same study but not used in the zzso The receiver operating characteristics of the network then were compared with the previously determined performance of other zzso on the same data zzso 

At a specificity greater than zzso the neural network was more sensitive than any of the available zzso (although only the global zzso were available for comparison, as the cluster and zzso zzso did not achieve such high specificity at their current zzso At a lower specificity zzso the neural network was unable to attain the high sensitivity of the cluster or zzso zzso in fact, the cluster zzso from the zzso zzso study was significantly more zzso 

The receiver operating characteristics of a zzso neural network designed to detect visual field defects were zzso At a very high specificity zzso a neural network performed better than the global zzso However, at a lower specificity zzso the neural network performed worse than cluster and zzso zzso
