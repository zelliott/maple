zzso zzso motion zzso provides a useful model for many physical and biological phenomena demonstrating long-term zzso and zzso spectral zzso In this model, only one zzso is necessary to describe the complexity of the data, the zzso zzso zzso The development of accurate zzso for H is a topic of interest in areas such as zzso image processing and heart rate zzso zzso zzso The development of a zzso zzso utilizing the zzso zzso zzso is zzso the zzso is designed for a signal model consisting of zzso and additive white zzso The performance of this zzso is tested on simulated noisy zzso data sets, and found to provide more accurate estimates of H than a maximum likelihood zzso for zzso and the zzso fluctuation analysis zzso zzso
