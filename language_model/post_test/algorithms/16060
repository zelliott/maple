This work aims to validate a time domain zzso model for the zzso propagation of a short pulse of finite zzso sound beam propagation in a zzso zzso The complete evolution equation is simply derived by a zzso of elementary operators corresponding to the zzso effect zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso distortion zzso effects are treated independently using a first order zzso zzso Using the method of fractional steps, the normal particle zzso and the zzso pressure are calculated plane by plane, at each point of a two-dimensional spatial grid, from the surface of the plane circular zzso to a specified zzso The LA operator is a time zzso between the particle zzso and the zzso zzso filter built after the zzso zzso The zzso operator is a zzso transformation obtained by following an implicit zzso zzso zzso The zzso operator is the usual zzso zzso We present a comparison between theoretical and experimental zzso pressure zzso and zzso pressure zzso for fundamental zzso zzso second, third and fourth zzso obtained after spectral zzso
