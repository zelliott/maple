The objective was to validate the measurement of zzso zzso in humans by zzso zzso zzso zzso by comparing zzso with those from single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with high spatial resolution (including the differentiation of zzso and zzso zzso may be possible by zzso CT in zzso Although there are encouraging data from experiments with dogs, the technique has not been validated in zzso In 11 patients, zzso CT measurement of regional zzso in a single zzso slice was compared with that obtained by zzso and in 14, zzso of zzso CT was zzso The zzso CT scanner was set to acquire 20 images, gated to zzso The images were divided into 32 equal zzso and the time course and extent of zzso of the left zzso cavity and zzso were analyzed to calculate absolute zzso The zzso zzso were also divided into 32 segments for zzso The pattern of relative zzso by segment was represented as a zzso In 18 of 22 paired scans, the mean difference of the position of the minimum and maximum points of the zzso was less than 4, indicating close agreement between the two zzso When scoring zzso zzso as normal or zzso there was agreement between the methods in 129 of 176 segments zzso see zzso zzso zzso zzso difference zzso 1 zzso of zzso scans was zzso zzso zzso zzso and during zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso Absolute zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso at rest was zzso zzso zzso zzso During zzso infusion, zzso increased to a mean of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso CT and intravenous contrast can be used to assess relative zzso zzso in humans, at rest and during zzso zzso although it may underestimate absolute zzso particularly at high zzso
