We propose a novel, efficient and intuitive approach of zzso zzso zzso from the whole zzso shotgun sequencing zzso zzso Our method, zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso is based on effective length zzso using uniquely zzso areas of gene and zzso zzso zzso Using the known zzso sequence model such as zzso zzso zzso the numbers of all possible zzso and zzso zzso reads: the former being sequences mapped to all zzso zzso of a single gene exclusively and the latter uniquely mapped to a single zzso zzso The results are used to estimate the effective length of genes and zzso taking experimental zzso of zzso size into zzso zzso zzso based on 27 randomly selected genes in two human cell lines and computer simulation experiments demonstrated superior accuracy of zzso over other recently developed zzso zzso covers a large proportion of genes and zzso zzso and offers a measure of consistency zzso zzso for each gene between an independently measured zzso level and the sum of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso to both zzso and zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso could make a standard method in zzso gene transcript levels from zzso zzso
