We implemented negative zzso zzso zzso on a hybrid zzso zzso mass zzso to conduct zzso reactions using zzso zzso and radical zzso zzso In addition to zzso ladders of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso generated intense neutral loss zzso corresponding to the entire or partial zzso zzso from zzso acids zzso a given zzso Thus, a critical step towards the characterization of this recently introduced fragmentation technique is a systematic study of synthetic peptides to identify common neutral losses and preferential fragmentation zzso zzso 46 synthetic peptides with high mass accuracy and high resolution analysis permitted facile determination of the chemical composition of each neutral zzso We identified 19 unique neutral losses from 14 zzso acids and three modified zzso zzso and assessed the specificity and sensitivity of each neutral loss using a database of zzso confidently identified peptides generated from zzso shotgun experiments employing zzso zzso and negative zzso zzso As zzso neutral losses indicate the presence of certain zzso zzso we determined that many neutral losses have potential diagnostic zzso We envision this zzso of neutral losses being incorporated into database search zzso to improve zzso identification specificity and to further advance characterization of the zzso zzso
