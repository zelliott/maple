Two major aspects have made the genetic and zzso study of zzso extremely zzso First, increased zzso or zzso combinations due to multiple zzso result in complex gene actions and interactions for quantitative trait zzso zzso in zzso Second, zzso zzso in zzso undergo a complex biological process including either zzso or zzso formation, or zzso For zzso zzso different degrees of preferential zzso pairings may occur during zzso In this article, we develop a zzso model for mapping zzso in zzso by considering the quantitative inheritance and zzso mechanism of zzso zzso This zzso zzso model is implemented with the zzso zzso to simultaneously estimate zzso position, zzso effects, and zzso linkage zzso by incorporating the impact of a zzso zzso determining zzso zzso pairings (the preferential pairing zzso zzso studies are performed to investigate the performance and zzso of our statistical method for zzso zzso The implication and extension of the zzso zzso model are zzso
