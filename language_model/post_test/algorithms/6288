zzso image reconstruction zzso have the potential to produce low noise zzso Early stopping of the iteration process is problematic because some features of the image may zzso zzso On the other hand, there may be noise zzso with increased number of zzso zzso we examined the stabilizing effect of using two different prior functions as well as image representation by zzso so that the number of zzso could be increased without noise zzso Reconstruction was performed of simulated zzso and of real data acquired by zzso zzso zzso Image quality measures were calculated for images reconstructed with or without zzso Both zzso stabilized the iteration zzso The first prior based on the zzso function reduced the noise without significant loss of contrast recovery of small spots, but the drawback of the method was the difficulty in finding optimal values of two free zzso The second method based on a median root prior has only one zzso zzso which was easy to set, but it should be taken into account that the image resolution while using that prior has to be chosen sufficiently high not to cause the complete removal of small zzso In conclusion, the zzso penalty function gives accurate and low noise images, but it may be difficult to determine the zzso The median root prior method is not quite as accurate but may be used if image resolution is zzso
