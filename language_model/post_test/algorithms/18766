This study compared the abilities of three zzso zzso multiple model zzso using a single zzso zzso richer data multiple model zzso using all zzso zzso and the sequential interacting multiple model zzso describe zzso and zzso zzso data from patients within a zzso surgery unit who had variable zzso zzso All zzso start with multiple sets of discrete zzso support points obtained from zzso population zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso then estimate their zzso zzso probabilities by conventionally assuming that the estimated zzso zzso are fixed and unchanging throughout the period of data zzso In contrast, the zzso sequential zzso zzso permits zzso estimates to jump from one population model support point to another, as new data are zzso if the probability of a different support point fitting the more recent data is more zzso Several initial zzso jump probability settings were zzso zzso zzso and zzso a probability range of zzso to zzso The data sets comprised 550 zzso concentration zzso from 135 patients and 555 zzso concentration zzso from 139 zzso The zzso zzso performed poorly with both zzso zzso precision was obtained with the zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso fitted the data with the highest zzso A zzso jump probability gave the best zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso to 50% range setting performed poorly, especially for zzso In zzso the zzso zzso described and tracked drug concentration data well in these clinically unstable zzso Further investigation of this new approach in routine clinical care and optimal dosage design is zzso
