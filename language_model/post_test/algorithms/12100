zzso dilution zzso zzso are used to estimate an unknown cell fraction of interest within a zzso This paper discusses a method for designing an zzso using the distribution of the cell fraction of interest, examining three different design zzso geometric zzso equally spaced zzso and zzso Two common zzso methods, minimum zzso and maximum likelihood, also are zzso These designs and zzso methods, coupled with varying numbers of zzso per dilution and zzso per design, are compared zzso through computer zzso Performance measures zzso were mean relative bias and mean squared zzso
