The Integrated zzso zzso zzso is the zzso pressure topography zzso metric used for assessing the zzso of zzso junction zzso relaxation in the Chicago zzso of zzso zzso However, because the zzso value is also influenced by zzso zzso zzso we hypothesized that its normal limits should vary with different patterns of zzso 

Five hundred and zzso two selected zzso studies were used to compare the accuracy of alternative analysis zzso to that of a zzso expert (the zzso zzso Chicago zzso metrics were scored manually and used as zzso for zzso programs that zzso either strict zzso interpretation zzso abnormal zzso threshold of 15 zzso or a zzso and zzso tree zzso model that selected variable zzso thresholds depending on the associated zzso zzso 

The sensitivity of the zzso model for zzso zzso was better than that of the zzso approach zzso on account of using variable zzso thresholds that ranged from a low value of zzso zzso to distinguish type I zzso from absent zzso to a high value of zzso zzso to distinguish type III zzso from zzso zzso zzso Additionally, type II zzso was diagnosed solely by zzso zzso without the zzso entering the zzso 

zzso interpretation of zzso studies more closely mimics that of a zzso expert when zzso thresholds for impaired zzso relaxation are adjusted depending on the pattern of associated zzso zzso The range of zzso zzso suggested by the zzso model ranged from 10 to 17 zzso
