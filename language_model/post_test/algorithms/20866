The structures of zzso derivatives were zzso with zzso and zzso at zzso zzso level zzso Some structural and electric zzso were obtained from the single point energy calculation and natural bond zzso analysis at the level of zzso zzso As zzso pump zzso a zzso model was built with genetic zzso zzso and partial least square zzso zzso The high zzso and zzso indicates the derived model has a good zzso power which can be used in prediction of activity for new zzso zzso This model gives us a revelation that the activity of zzso derivatives as zzso pump inhibitor can be improved by properly increasing the molecular volume and Mulliken atomic charge of zzso or lowering the zzso and Mulliken atomic charge of zzso in zzso and it was found from this article that a zzso relationship can be built for small samples with large zzso by zzso the zzso with zzso and analyzing with zzso With this model, a new compound, zzso was predicted to lower the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso for zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso pump protein over zzso zzso Basic structure of zzso
