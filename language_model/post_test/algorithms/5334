We propose a new approach for zzso a population of synthetic genetic zzso which consists in the zzso of a colony of zzso by external zzso We present a model where the zzso dynamics is affected by periodic changes in zzso We introduce an additional zzso in the bacteria in order to correlate the temperature variations with the enhancement of the zzso rate of a certain zzso This can be done by introducing a promoter that is related to the heat shock zzso This way, the expression of that gene results in a protein that enhances the overall zzso zzso results show coherent zzso of the population for a certain range of the external frequency, which is in turn related to the natural zzso frequency of the modified zzso Finally we study the transient times related with the loss of synchronization and we discuss possible applications in biotechnology of large-scale production coupled to synchronization events induced by heat zzso
