zzso treatment failure is commonly associated with drug resistance and the selection of a new regimen is often guided by zzso resistance zzso The interpretation of complex zzso data poses a major zzso We have developed artificial neural network zzso models that predict zzso response to therapy from zzso zzso and other clinical zzso Here we compare the accuracy of ANN with alternative zzso zzso random forests zzso and support zzso machines zzso 

Data from zzso treatment change episodes zzso were identified from the zzso Resistance Response Database Initiative zzso database and zzso at random into a training set of zzso and a test set of zzso The training set was then zzso using an zzso zzso in this zzso validation scheme for training individual zzso zzso zzso six input variables were used for training the models: 55 baseline zzso zzso the 14 potential drugs in the new treatment zzso four treatment history zzso baseline viral zzso zzso count and time to follow-up viral zzso The output variable was follow-up viral zzso Performance was evaluated in terms of the correlations and absolute differences between the individual zzso predictions and the actual zzso zzso 

The correlations zzso between predicted and actual zzso varied from zzso to zzso for zzso zzso to zzso for zzso and zzso to zzso for zzso The mean absolute differences varied from zzso to zzso for zzso zzso to zzso for zzso and zzso to zzso for zzso ANN models were significantly inferior to zzso and zzso zzso The predictions of the zzso zzso and zzso committees all correlated highly significantly with the actual zzso of the independent test zzso producing zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The mean absolute differences were zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso There were no statistically significant differences between the three zzso Combining the zzso zzso improved correlations between predicted and actual zzso zzso The combination of all three committees gave a correlation of zzso The mean absolute differences followed a similar zzso 

zzso and zzso models can produce predictions of zzso response to zzso treatment that are comparable in accuracy to a committee of ANN zzso Combining the predictions of different models improves their accuracy zzso This approach has potential as a future clinical tool and a combination of ANN and zzso models is being taken forward for clinical zzso
