zzso is arguably the most researched of all plant zzso A dynamic model of leaf photosynthesis that includes each discrete process from light capture to zzso zzso zzso is zzso It was developed by linking and extending our previous models of zzso II zzso energy transfer and zzso zzso carbon metabolism to include electron transfer processes around zzso I zzso zzso transfer between the zzso and zzso zzso synthesis and zzso reduction to provide a complete zzso Different regulatory processes linking the light and dark reactions are also zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso pH and zzso zzso zzso zzso mechanisms, as well as the regulation of zzso activities via the zzso zzso Although many further feedback and zzso controls undoubtedly exist, it is shown that zzso effectively mimics the typical zzso of leaf zzso zzso zzso evolution, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and membrane potential following zzso in light, zzso and zzso observed in intact zzso zzso The model provides a framework for guiding engineering of improved zzso efficiency, for evaluating multiple zzso measures used in emerging zzso facilities, and for quantitative assessment of strengths and weaknesses within the understanding of photosynthesis as an integrated zzso
