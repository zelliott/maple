For many infectious diseases, protective immunity can be zzso by vaccination with zzso zzso zzso derived from these proteins are bound to major zzso complex zzso molecules and presented to zzso receptors to stimulate an immune zzso We show here that, zzso bacterial proteins known zzso to elicit a protective immune response are relatively depleted in peptides predicted to bind to human zzso zzso We propose three zzso reasons for this: the lack of precision of current zzso software, the low zzso of zzso zzso in vaccine zzso or evolutionary pressure exerted on bacteria by the immune zzso We suggest that there is little value in predicting candidate vaccines based on high zzso zzso zzso
