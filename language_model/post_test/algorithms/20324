The diagnosis of blunt cervical zzso injury zzso is made difficult by its zzso occurrence and delayed zzso Beginning in January of 1995, we used zzso zzso zzso zzso of the neck to screen for zzso We hypothesized that zzso could be incorporated into the zzso of patients sustaining blunt neck injury as a screening zzso for zzso and that zzso would increase the early detection of zzso 

zzso review of all zzso for the years January of 1988 to June of 1997 at a Level I trauma zzso zzso diagnosed before introduction of zzso zzso January of 1988 to December of 1994) were compared with those after zzso January of 1995 to June of zzso 

The overall zzso of zzso for the entire time period was zzso Motor vehicle crash zzso was the most common zzso with focal zzso deficit zzso or zzso zzso the most common presenting clinical zzso zzso added only a few additional minutes to the time required for the zzso of patients sustaining blunt neck injury in whom zzso was zzso The zzso of zzso increased from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Fisher exact zzso zzso was associated with a decrease in mean time to make the diagnosis of zzso zzso hours zzso zzso zzso hours zzso In addition, zzso was associated with a decrease in the zzso of permanent zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Fisher exact zzso 

We conclude that zzso does not significantly increase the time of the diagnostic zzso of the patient with injuries caused by blunt zzso The introduction of zzso at our institution was associated with an increase in the detection rate of zzso Earlier detection of zzso may allow for more timely therapeutic intervention and potentially prevent permanent zzso zzso
