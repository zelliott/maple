We have examined the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso expressing the zzso channel, with symmetrical zzso and zzso and 2 zzso zzso After brief strong zzso to activate the channels (2 zzso at zzso zzso holding potential zzso zzso currents relaxed zzso at all zzso The time constant of the relaxation was zzso zzso dependent from zzso to zzso zzso zzso for 31 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso but zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso This suggests a mixture of zzso zzso zzso at very negative zzso and nearly zzso zzso zzso measured by test zzso following that protocol was consistent with zzso zzso During zzso lasting zzso zzso zzso was strong but incomplete zzso zzso zzso was also produced by long, weak zzso zzso zzso 220 zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which could not be explained by zzso zzso exclusively from the open zzso Recovery from zzso was exponential and fast zzso zzso 85 zzso at zzso zzso but zzso zzso zzso Recovery was similar after zzso steps to zzso zzso or zzso steps to zzso zzso suggesting rapid zzso of zzso and zzso zzso There was little current at zzso zzso during recovery from zzso consistent with zzso of the channels recovering through the open zzso The results are well described by a kinetic model where zzso is zzso coupled to the movement of the first three zzso sensors to zzso One consequence of zzso zzso is that zzso channels continue to zzso after zzso primarily from the open state, which leads to cumulative zzso during repetitive zzso
