New software zzso was developed to provide an automated procedure for identifying and zzso zzso species in urinary zzso The first step was to strictly define operative conditions of sample preparation because they have a significant influence on the stability of various zzso zzso Second, we determined the zzso zzso of a zzso curve required to develop the automated zzso This was illustrated by the study of zzso and zzso as both constituents represent one of the most frequent associations found in stones analyzed in our zzso The following zzso equation was obtained with a correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso Y zzso zzso + zzso - zzso where Y is the zzso ratio zzso and zzso is the percentage of zzso in the zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso was measured at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The third step was to validate the zzso procedure in routine analysis by comparing zzso results with those of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was better than that previously reported using various computerized systems with a mean zzso of zzso zzso developed in zzso to identify main and minor components found in urinary stones, even in complex zzso containing up to seven constituents, allowed us to lower the detection threshold down to 1 to zzso depending on the main zzso
