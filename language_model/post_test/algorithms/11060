The apparent diffusion zzso zzso is analyzed for the case of zzso diffusion zzso zzso zzso zzso expressions are obtained in the zzso expansion of the zzso for an arbitrary number of zzso zzso These expressions are universal and valid for arbitrary system zzso The zzso conditions of the zzso expansion of zzso are obtained in the framework of a simple zzso model of restricted zzso These conditions are shown to be substantially different for zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso the zzso expansion is valid when the period of a single zzso is smaller than the characteristic diffusion time, the frequency dependence of zzso being practically the same for any zzso In contrast, for the zzso zzso the zzso regime can be achieved only when the total diffusion time is smaller than the characteristic diffusion time, the frequency dependence of zzso being different for different zzso
