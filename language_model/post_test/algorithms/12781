zzso calcium entry zzso has been proposed as the main process controlling zzso entry in zzso zzso Although recent breakthroughs in experimental studies of zzso have been made, its mathematical modeling has not been zzso In the present work, zzso is viewed as a feedback control system subject to an zzso zzso zzso and an zzso calcium zzso We then design a dynamic output feedback controller to reject the zzso and track zzso resting levels in the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The constructed feedback control system is validated by published experimental data and its global zzso stability is proved by using the zzso zzso zzso We then simulate the dynamic responses of zzso and zzso two major components in the operation of the zzso channels, to the depletion of zzso in the zzso with zzso which show that: zzso Upon the depletion of zzso in the zzso the zzso of activated zzso and zzso cluster are elevated zzso indicating that zzso is accumulating in the zzso junctions and that the zzso portion of the active zzso is binding to zzso and driving the opening of zzso channels for zzso zzso zzso after the zzso zzso addition, the zzso of both zzso and zzso cluster decrease but still much higher than the original zzso We also simulate the system responses to the zzso zzso which show that, when a sequence of periodic zzso zzso is applied, the system returns to its equilibrium after each zzso This indicates that the designed feedback controller can reject the zzso and track the zzso
