We introduce zzso zzso Field Reconstruction zzso a novel technique for the inverse imaging of zzso zzso The method was designed to simultaneously achieve two zzso a) zzso with respect to the orientation of the coordinate system, and b) a preference for zzso of the solutions and their spatial zzso This was achieved by defining the regulating penalty function, which renders the solutions unique, as a global zzso of local zzso We show that the method can be successfully used for solving the zzso inverse zzso In the joint zzso of 2-3 simulated zzso zzso always reliably recovers the true zzso The competing methods have limitations in distinguishing close sources because their estimates are either too smooth zzso Minimum zzso or too scattered zzso zzso In both zzso and noisy simulations, zzso has the smallest zzso error according to the Earth zzso zzso zzso which is introduced here as a meaningful measure to compare arbitrary source zzso We also apply the method to the simultaneous zzso of left and right zzso zzso generators from real zzso zzso Compared to its peers zzso was the only method that delivered correct location of the source in the zzso area of each zzso in accordance with zzso prior zzso
