zzso treatment with various zzso agents for the termination or prevention of zzso zzso zzso is not yet zzso This is in part because the drugs may not be sufficiently selective for the atrium, and they often cause zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso current zzso is found in the atrium but not in the zzso and it has been recognized as a potentially promising target for zzso drugs that would be without zzso zzso Several new agents that specifically block zzso have been zzso They block zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso Here we use mathematical models of normal and zzso remodeled human zzso action zzso to examine the effects of the blockade zzso of zzso on zzso action potential duration zzso It was found that after zzso zzso an zzso blocker with fast onset can effectively prolong zzso at any stimulus frequency, whereas a blocker with slow onset zzso zzso in a zzso manner only when the recovery is zzso The results suggest that the zzso and time dependence of zzso blockade should be taken into account in the testing of zzso zzso This modeling study suggests that a simple zzso protocol with a short pulse of approximately 10 zzso at 1 zzso may be useful to identify the effective zzso drugs among various zzso zzso
