The mean pressure difference across the valve in zzso zzso is an indicator of the severity of the obstruction to zzso zzso determination of the mean pressure zzso by zzso zzso is, however, complicated by the squared relation between instantaneous zzso and pressure zzso The zzso of a new simple formula for calculation of the mean pressure difference from the peak pressure difference was evaluated in 26 patients with zzso zzso The formula is: delta zzso zzso zzso delta zzso where delta zzso is the mean pressure zzso and delta zzso the peak pressure zzso There was a close correlation between the mean pressure differences determined by application of the formula to the peak pressure differences measured at zzso and the mean pressure differences obtained by zzso zzso zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso zzso zzso The correlation between mean pressure differences determined by continuous wave zzso ultrasound and the formula and those measured by zzso was also close zzso zzso zzso SEE zzso zzso zzso zzso and only three patients showed a difference between the two methods of greater than 10 zzso zzso The new formula is a simple and reliable means of zzso the mean pressure difference from zzso recordings and it zzso the comparison of zzso and zzso zzso
