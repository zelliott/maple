For a specific structure of zzso zzso starting from a 5 A phase set, about zzso of the 2 A zzso are correctly determined within an error of 18 degrees by applying a zzso refinement zzso The refinement proceeds both in real and zzso zzso In extending the structure from 5 to 2 A, the zzso of the reflections are the only requirements for this zzso In contrast to the conventional phase extension zzso the zzso are used not only in the zzso synthesis but also in the zzso density zzso
