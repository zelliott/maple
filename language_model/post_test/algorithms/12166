The main aim of this study was to develop and implement an zzso for the zzso accurate and automated identification of paths leading from buried protein zzso pockets and cavities in dynamic and zzso protein structures to the outside zzso 

The zzso to perform a skeleton search was based on a zzso distance function grid that was developed and implemented for the zzso zzso The program identifies and zzso routes from the interior of the protein to the bulk zzso zzso was primarily developed for zzso but the zzso is sufficiently robust to allow the analysis of any molecular system, including zzso acids or zzso zzso zzso can be performed using discrete structures from zzso analysis and zzso experiments as well as with zzso from molecular dynamics zzso The fully functional program is available as a zzso version and as plug-in for the molecular modeling program zzso Additionally, selected functions are accessible in an online zzso 

The zzso developed automatically finds the path from a starting point located within the interior of a zzso The zzso is sufficiently rapid and robust to enable routine analysis of molecular dynamics zzso containing thousands of zzso The zzso is based on zzso metrics and provides an easy method to find a zzso zzso the spine, of complicated objects such as a protein zzso It can also be applied to many other zzso zzso is freely available from the web site zzso
