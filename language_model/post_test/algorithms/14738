This paper proposes a distributed zzso for establishing connectivity and location zzso in zzso wireless sensor zzso The zzso exploits the information flow while coping with distributed signal processing and the requirements of network zzso Once the zzso procedure and communication protocol are performed, sensor clusters can be merged to establish a single global coordinate system without zzso sensors using only distance zzso In order to adjust the sensor positions, the refinement schemes and cooperative fusion approaches are applied to reduce the zzso error and improve the measurement zzso This paper outlines the technical foundations of the zzso techniques and presents the tradeoffs in zzso zzso The feasibility of the proposed schemes is shown to be effective under certain assumptions and the analysis is supported by simulation and zzso zzso
