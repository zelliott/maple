In cells lacking the zzso zzso zzso initiation of zzso zzso II zzso occurs inappropriately within the zzso regions of zzso rather than being restricted to the zzso zzso It was previously reported that this zzso zzso occurs zzso in long zzso and in genes that are infrequently zzso Here, we mapped the transcripts produced in an zzso zzso strain lacking zzso and applied rigorous statistical methods to identify sites of cryptic zzso at high zzso We find that suppression of cryptic zzso occurs independent of gene length or zzso zzso Our conclusions differ with those reported previously because we obtained a zzso zzso we accounted for the fact that gene length and zzso frequency are not independent zzso and we accounted for several zzso biases that make cryptic zzso easier to detect in long, infrequently transcribed zzso These new results and conclusions have implications for many commonly used zzso analysis approaches, and for the evolution of zzso zzso zzso II zzso initiation in zzso
