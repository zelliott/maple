We investigated whether the prerequisite of the maximum slope and zzso methods are satisfied in pancreatic zzso CT and whether the measured parameters between these zzso are zzso 

We examined nine zzso injected with zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso The abdominal zzso and zzso and zzso arteries were selected as the input arteries and the zzso zzso the output zzso For the maximum slope method, we determined the zzso contrast volume of each artery by measuring the area under the curve zzso and compared the peak enhancement time in the zzso with the contrast appearance time in the zzso zzso For the zzso method, the zzso collection rate of contrast medium was zzso We calculated the pancreatic tissue blood flow zzso tissue blood volume zzso and mean transit time zzso using both zzso and investigated their correlation based on vessel zzso 

The artery zzso significantly decreased as it neared the zzso zzso In all cases, the peak time of the zzso zzso was shorter than the appearance time zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso combination exhibited the highest collection rate zzso and was the only combination that was significantly correlated between zzso zzso and zzso in both zzso 

zzso of a vessel nearest to the zzso is considered as a more appropriate zzso zzso vessel selection is important in comparison of the zzso parameters obtained by different zzso
