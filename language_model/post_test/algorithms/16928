Additional information about risk genes or risk pathways for diseases can be extracted from zzso association studies through analyses of groups of zzso The most commonly employed approaches involve combining individual marker data by adding the test statistics, or summing the zzso of their zzso and then using zzso testing to derive empirical zzso that allow for the statistical dependence of zzso tests arising from linkage zzso zzso In the present study, we use simulated data to show that these approaches fail to reflect the structure of the sampling error, and the effect of this is to give undue weight to correlated zzso We show that the results obtained are internally inconsistent in the presence of strong zzso and are zzso inconsistent with the results derived from zzso zzso We also show that the results obtained from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso testing, but not those obtained from permutations, are consistent with the theoretically expected zzso and that the zzso test has greater power to detect zzso associations in real zzso Finally, we show that while the results from zzso testing can be made to approximate those from zzso and zzso zzso zzso testing through aggressive zzso pruning of zzso this comes at the cost of loss of zzso We conclude that when conducting zzso analyses of sets of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso testing, which give equivalent results, are preferable to the other more commonly applied zzso
