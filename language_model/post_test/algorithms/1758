zzso membrane proteins zzso play important roles in cell zzso In addition, zzso are targeted by multiple zzso The identification of zzso from zzso sequences and successful prediction of their secondary and zzso structures is a challenging task due to short zzso regions with high variation in zzso zzso an effective and accurate zzso method for discrimination of zzso from their primary sequences is zzso In this paper, we have analyzed the performance of various machine learning mechanisms for discriminating zzso such zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in conjunction with discrete methods such zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso acid composition zzso and hybrid versions of these zzso The performance of the zzso is evaluated by two zzso using zzso zzso After the zzso we have observed that zzso zzso using zzso zzso makes it quite effective in discriminating zzso zzso zzso achieves the highest success rates of zzso accuracy for discriminating zzso from zzso and zzso and zzso zzso from zzso membrane and zzso zzso respectively on zzso While on zzso zzso zzso achieves zzso zzso and zzso zzso for discriminating zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso It is observed that the zzso performance of our proposed method is satisfactory and is better than the existing zzso Thus, it might be an effective tool for high zzso innovation of zzso
