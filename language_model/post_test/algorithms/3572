An inversion method for the characterization of atmospheric condensed zzso from infrared zzso zzso is zzso The method is tested with both synthetic zzso zzso and the zzso of particles that flow in a zzso flow zzso The method is applied to the zzso zzso recorded by the Atmospheric Trace zzso zzso instrument carried by the Space zzso during three missions in 1992, 1993, and zzso The volume density and particle size distribution for zzso zzso are obtained as a function of zzso The density and size distribution of ice particles in several zzso clouds are also zzso The probable radius of the ice particles in the high-altitude zzso zzso clouds is found to be approximately zzso zzso
