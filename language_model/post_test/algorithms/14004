In a number of engineering problems, zzso in zzso petroleum engineering, zzso intervals of measured series data zzso are to be attributed a class maintaining the constraint of zzso and standard zzso methods could be zzso zzso in this case needs involvement of an expert who observes the magnitude and trends of the signals in addition to any a zzso information that might be zzso In this paper, an approach for zzso this zzso procedure is zzso zzso a zzso zzso is developed and applied to segment the measured zzso zzso the salient features of these segments are extracted using boundary energy zzso Based on the measured data and extracted features to assign classes to the segments zzso are zzso they employ zzso Trees, ANN and Support zzso zzso The methodology was tested in zzso zzso soil using measured data from zzso zzso Testing and satisfactory results were zzso
