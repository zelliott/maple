This technical report presents the recent progress in the design and construction of a closed loop automated seating zzso zzso test results are zzso The system is designed to measure seating surface forces and control the seating surface geometry of a seated zzso It uses force information as feedback to determine custom seating contours which produce desired seating zzso Ultimately, the system is intended to be used for research studies with zzso The system consists of an zzso zzso zzso seating surface which is controlled by a zzso zzso zzso are used to move force sensing zzso up or down until the desired seating surface characteristic is zzso zzso test results are presented and zzso A zzso control zzso has been written and found to produce relatively uniform force zzso for soft, zzso loads of various zzso
