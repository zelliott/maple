To compare the image quality and diagnostic confidence of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso using filtered back projection zzso and zzso reconstruction techniques zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso stone was placed inside an zzso zzso phantom at the pelvic zzso Fifteen scans were performed on a zzso zzso CT system using different tube zzso zzso 100, and 120 zzso and zzso products zzso 15, 30, 70, and 100 zzso Image reconstruction using zzso and zzso zzso reconstruction in image zzso resulted in 30 data zzso zzso image quality was evaluated by noise zzso zzso doses were estimated for each data set with use of an established zzso zzso zzso image quality and confidence level were rated by two zzso 

Noise was systematically lower for images reconstructed with zzso compared to zzso (55 zzso 30 vs 65 zzso 26 zzso zzso P zzso zzso for volume CT dose index values above about zzso zzso (or an effective dose of about zzso zzso for both zzso For the 14 scans rated to have diagnostic image quality, the estimated effective doses ranged from zzso to zzso zzso for males and from zzso to zzso zzso for zzso zzso image quality and diagnostic confidence for zzso was not significantly better than those for zzso 

In a phantom study for CT of zzso zzso improves objective image quality compared to zzso above a certain dose zzso However, this does not translate into improved zzso image quality or a higher degree of confidence for the diagnosis of zzso urinary zzso
