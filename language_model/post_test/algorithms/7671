Respiratory motion is a complicating factor for many applications in medical imaging and there is significant interest in dynamic imaging that can be used to estimate such zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso is an attractive zzso for motion zzso but current techniques cannot achieve good image contrast inside the zzso zzso learning is a powerful tool to discover the underlying structure of zzso zzso zzso the zzso of multiple zzso can be useful to establish relationships between different types of zzso However, the current state-of-the-art in zzso alignment is not robust to the wide variations in zzso structure that may occur in clinical zzso In this work we propose a novel, fully automatic technique for the simultaneous alignment of large numbers of zzso with varying zzso zzso We apply the technique to reconstruct high-resolution and zzso dynamic zzso zzso images from multiple zzso zzso for the purpose of respiratory motion zzso The proposed method is validated on synthetic data with known ground truth and real zzso We demonstrate that our approach can be applied to reconstruct significantly more accurate and consistent dynamic images of the lungs compared to the current state-of-the-art in zzso zzso
