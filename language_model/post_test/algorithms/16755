zzso and zzso costs are continuing to fall, and many individuals are undergoing these assessments as research participants and zzso The issue of secondary zzso zzso findings in zzso analysis is controversial, and data are needed on methods of detection and their zzso We piloted secondary zzso detection by analyzing zzso for zzso in zzso syndromes in subjects zzso for zzso zzso We performed zzso sequencing on zzso zzso participants, and in 37 zzso we interpreted zzso that cause zzso cancer syndromes by using an zzso that filtered results on the basis of zzso type, quality, and frequency and that filtered zzso entries on the basis of defined categories of zzso We identified zzso sequence zzso that differed from the human zzso zzso were made on the basis of sequence quality zzso zzso and high frequency in the cohort zzso zzso or zzso (17 zzso leaving 334 zzso of potential clinical zzso These were further filtered on the basis of zzso of literature zzso Seven participants, four of whom were of zzso Jewish descent and three of whom did not meet zzso referral criteria, had deleterious zzso or zzso zzso One participant had a deleterious zzso zzso which causes zzso zzso sequencing, coupled with multidisciplinary zzso detected clinically important zzso in zzso zzso four of such zzso were in individuals without a significant family history of zzso We conclude that secondary zzso of high clinical importance will be detected at an appreciable frequency in zzso and we suggest that priority be given to the development of more efficient modes of interpretation with trials in larger patient zzso
