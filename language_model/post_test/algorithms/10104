Gene expression patterns characterizing zzso molecular zzso of zzso are difficult to zzso We suspect a combination of biological and zzso factors confounds interpretation of zzso expression zzso We seek to clarify the nature and relative contributions of these factors, to focus additional zzso and to improve the accuracy and consistency of zzso zzso zzso 

We analyzed gene expression and clinical data for 340 zzso in The Cancer Genome zzso zzso We developed a logic model to analyze potential sources of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and used standard linear zzso and linear zzso reduction zzso to investigate the nature and relative contributions of each zzso 

zzso sources of zzso error, including individual sample zzso batch effects, and zzso and technical noise make measurable but zzso minor contributions to inconsistent molecular zzso Our analysis suggests that three, previously underappreciated factors may account for a larger fraction of zzso zzso inherent zzso relationships among the genes used in conjunction with zzso zzso that assume zzso skewed data zzso assumed to be zzso and zzso zzso zzso among tumors, of which we propose three zzso 

Our analysis of the zzso data demonstrates a zzso role for technical factors in molecular zzso inconsistencies in zzso but also suggests that biological zzso abnormal data distribution, and zzso relationships among genes may be responsible for a zzso larger component of zzso zzso These findings may have important implications for both zzso research and for zzso application of other zzso biological zzso
