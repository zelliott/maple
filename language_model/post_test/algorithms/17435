Despite the importance of zzso gating zzso zzso zzso for zzso function assessment, neither prevalence of gating errors nor their influence on zzso cardiac parameters has been zzso 

zzso anomalies in zzso of counts versus projection angle for each zzso segment were detected visually and zzso zzso prevalence was tabulated for zzso patients zzso 1) with prospective coronary artery disease zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso counts were analyzed from all reconstructed cinematic zzso slices to assess zzso effects on percentage of zzso count increase, generally assumed to equal percentage of wall zzso In a separate retrospective analysis of 41 patients zzso zzso with coronary artery disease zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso having no significant zzso 36 of whom also underwent equilibrium zzso zzso original projection data were altered to simulate zzso zzso count patterns to evaluate effects on zzso function and zzso zzso 

Group 1 patients consisted of zzso without gating zzso zzso with count losses only in the last zzso zzso due to inconsistent transient increase of heart rate, zzso with count decreases in several late intervals due to consistently variable rates, zzso with early zzso count increases paired with late zzso count decreases due to zzso beats and zzso with erratic count changes due to zzso zzso zzso count patterns were strongly associated zzso zzso zzso with zzso detected by zzso zzso In group 2 simulations, zzso volumes changed by only zzso and ejection fraction zzso by only zzso from control values and correlated zzso zzso or zzso zzso with control values for all simulated zzso zzso and equilibrium zzso zzso zzso correlated similarly zzso zzso zzso for control and all zzso Percentage changes from control in zzso zzso extent and severity were larger than processing zzso limits, the largest change being for zzso zzso Control wall zzso was zzso significantly lower zzso zzso zzso than for simulated zzso reflecting similar observations for group 1 zzso 

Even though zzso volumes and zzso were affected minimally by zzso both zzso analysis and wall zzso were zzso zzso quality assurance of gating may be critically important for obtaining accurate zzso zzso
