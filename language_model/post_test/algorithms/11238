In this work, a methodology for the zzso identifiable zzso determination zzso is zzso This systematic approach is proposed to be used for structure and zzso identification of zzso models of biological reaction zzso Usually, this kind of problems are zzso with large correlations between zzso zzso the related inverse problems for zzso determination and analysis are zzso zzso and zzso difficult to zzso The proposed zzso methodology comprises several tasks: zzso model selection, zzso tracking of an adequate initial guess, and zzso an zzso zzso zzso step which includes an identifiable zzso subset selection zzso zzso and accuracy analysis of the estimated zzso The zzso zzso is based on the analysis of the sensitivity zzso by rank revealing zzso zzso Using this, a reduction of the zzso search space to a reasonable zzso which can be reliably and efficiently estimated from available zzso is zzso The simultaneous zzso and zzso zzso process for zzso production from cellulosic material is used as case study for testing the zzso The successful application of zzso to the zzso process demonstrates a relatively large reduction in the identified zzso zzso It is shown by a zzso that using the identified parameters (even though the reduction of the search zzso the model is still able to predict the experimental data zzso Moreover, it is shown that the model is easily and efficiently adapted to new process conditions by solving reduced and well zzso zzso
