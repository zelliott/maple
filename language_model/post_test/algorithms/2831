In this work, fundamental aspects on the zzso zzso monitoring of alcoholic zzso in synthetic zzso zzso zzso and zzso and natural media zzso and zzso are zzso zzso are explained in terms of zzso zzso zzso zzso gas production and zzso zzso The effect of each one of these zzso upon zzso zzso has been independently zzso It is shown that, regarding the sound zzso the simplest systems behave as zzso zzso of sugar and ethanol in water, where, in the course of time, zzso are transformed into zzso according to the zzso zzso A zzso approach, based on the excess volume concept and the density and zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been used to calculate these zzso in the zzso zzso and to obtain the zzso of the main zzso throughout the zzso reaching a good correlation (especially for the media of simplest zzso In all the processes zzso the data obtained from the zzso zzso followed the changes caused by the zzso zzso asserting the potential of mechanical waves to monitor zzso and, in general, zzso zzso
