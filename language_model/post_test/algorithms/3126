Early risk zzso is important in the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes zzso 

To develop a rapidly available risk zzso tool for use in all zzso 

Application of modern data mining and machine learning zzso to a derivation cohort of zzso zzso patients included in the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso registry between 2001 and 2005; prospective model testing in two validation zzso 

The most accurate prediction of zzso mortality was achieved with the zzso zzso zzso zzso algorithm, with input of seven variables available at first patient zzso age, zzso class, zzso blood pressure, heart rate, zzso zzso zzso history of heart failure, history of cerebrovascular zzso The zzso for the derivation cohort zzso was essentially maintained in important subgroups, and zzso over five risk categories, ranging from zzso to zzso predicted zzso was zzso zzso were validated zzso against an independent zzso cohort zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso model significantly outperformed established zzso zzso tools in both validation zzso In comparison to a zzso zzso model, the zzso model proved to be more robust when tested on the zzso validation cohort zzso zzso vs zzso zzso of the zzso model prediction was maintained at 12-month follow-up in an independent cohort zzso zzso 1972, zzso zzso 

The zzso model is a zzso accurate zzso risk zzso tool for the complete range of zzso based on variables available at first patient zzso
