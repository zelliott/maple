Biological time series often display complex zzso with several interacting rhythmic zzso Renal zzso for instance, involves at least two separate mechanisms both of which can produce zzso variations in the pressures and flows of the individual zzso Using zzso analysis we propose a method to examine how the instantaneous frequency and zzso of a fast mode is modulated by the presence of a slower zzso Our method is applied both to experimental data from zzso and zzso rats showing different zzso patterns and to simulation results obtained from a zzso based model of the zzso pressure and flow zzso We reveal a zzso interaction between the two mechanisms that regulate the zzso blood flow in the form of frequency and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
