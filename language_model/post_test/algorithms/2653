This paper intends to extend the zzso zzso developed by zzso zzso and Tai zzso zzso in several zzso First, we propose a new zzso approach for global zzso of the continuous zzso model with applications to the zzso constant zzso model for zzso image zzso Different from the existing methods, we work directly with the zzso setting without using convex relaxation, which is thereby termed as a direct zzso Second, we provide the sufficient and necessary conditions to guarantee a global zzso Moreover, we provide efficient zzso based on a reduction in the intermediate unknowns from the zzso zzso zzso As a result, the underlying zzso involve significantly fewer parameters and unknowns than the zzso use of zzso zzso zzso zzso they are fast and easy to zzso Furthermore, they can produce global zzso under mild zzso
