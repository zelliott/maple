Changes in the zzso behavior of the brain electrical activity are believed to be associated to zzso brain zzso We propose a novel methodology to identify the different states of the zzso brain, based on the zzso mapping of the time varying relative power of zzso zzso zzso beta and gamma frequency zzso estimated from zzso Using zzso zzso algorithm, points of interest are identified in the zzso zzso and their zzso over time are used for finding out relations with zzso zzso in the zzso These zzso are used to train a Hidden zzso Model zzso which models the different zzso brain states and the transition among zzso zzso to 10 patients suffering from focal seizures, with a total of 30 zzso over zzso of data, the methodology shows good results (an average point-by-point accuracy of zzso for the identification of the four brain zzso zzso zzso and zzso The results suggest that the zzso dynamics captured by the proposed methodology are related to the zzso brain states and transitions involved in focal zzso
