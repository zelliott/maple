Temperatures and melting zzso of zzso zzso I and II of natural zzso together with the temperature dependence of their lattice parameters and the specific volume of the melt at ordinary pressure, have been zzso With these results, a zzso zzso zzso phase zzso accounting for the zzso relationships between these zzso has been constructed by way of the zzso zzso The dependence of the melting temperature on the pressure has also been determined for each phase by zzso differential zzso zzso It was found that, upon increasing the pressure, the melting zzso zzso to the zzso triple point zzso zzso zzso K, zzso zzso zzso zzso in close agreement with its zzso zzso This zzso that Phase II should exhibit a stable phase region at higher zzso
