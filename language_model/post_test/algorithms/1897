zzso cardiac imaging is particularly interesting in the zzso setting since it would provide both image guidance for accurate procedural planning and cardiac functional evaluations directly in the operating zzso Imaging the heart in zzso using a slowly rotating zzso system is extremely challenging due to the limitations of the data acquisition system and the high zzso resolution required to avoid motion zzso In this paper, a data acquisition scheme and an image reconstruction method are proposed to achieve zzso cardiac zzso zzso zzso imaging with zzso spatial resolution and high zzso resolution using a slowly rotating zzso zzso The data are acquired within 14 s using a single zzso rotation with a short scan angular zzso The enabling image reconstruction method is the prior image constrained compressed sensing zzso zzso The prior image is reconstructed from data acquired over all cardiac zzso Each cardiac phase is then reconstructed from the zzso gated cardiac data using the zzso zzso To validate the method, several studies were zzso Both zzso simulations using a hybrid motion phantom with zzso background anatomy as well as physical phantom studies have been used to demonstrate that the proposed method enables accurate reconstruction of image objects with a high zzso spatial zzso A canine animal model scanned in zzso was used to further validate the zzso
