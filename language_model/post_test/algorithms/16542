The zzso zzso of therapeutic zzso is determined by target and zzso zzso zzso These zzso factors need to be considered during prediction of human zzso based upon zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso established for small molecules using data from multiple animal species cannot be directly applied to zzso Here, different methods for projecting human clearance zzso from animal zzso data for 13 therapeutic zzso zzso zzso exhibiting linear zzso over the tested dose ranges were zzso simple zzso zzso zzso versus body zzso zzso zzso with correction factors, zzso zzso based on rule of zzso and zzso from only zzso monkey zzso zzso A better correlation was obtained between the observed human zzso and the estimated human zzso based on zzso monkey zzso data and an zzso zzso zzso of zzso for zzso than other zzso zzso Human zzso profiles were also reasonably predicted from the zzso monkey data using zzso time method with a fixed zzso of zzso for zzso and zzso for volume of zzso In conclusion, we expanded our previous work and others and further confirmed that zzso from zzso monkey alone can be successfully scaled to project human zzso profiles within linear range using simplify zzso and zzso plots with fixed zzso
