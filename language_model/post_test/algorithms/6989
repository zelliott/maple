A field zzso experiment, simulating point source contamination, was conducted to investigate zzso and transport of zzso zzso and zzso in a volcanic zzso sand zzso zzso laboratory incubation tests were also carried out to determine degradation zzso Field transport of the pesticides was observed to the significant under zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso transport model, zzso was used for analysis of the field zzso A lump reduction rate constant was used in this paper to zzso all the irreversible reduction processes zzso degradation, irreversible zzso zzso and zzso for the pesticides zzso into particles and zzso which are assumed to follow a zzso rate zzso zzso from the field experiment suggest that zzso zzso was the most mobile zzso factor R zzso zzso and underwent least mass zzso zzso zzso was the least mobile (R zzso zzso and underwent the greatest mass zzso zzso the mobility of zzso (R zzso zzso was similar to that of zzso zzso (R zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be used to zzso the appearance of zzso in zzso sand zzso zzso from the incubation tests suggest that zzso zzso was zzso only in the mixture of groundwater and zzso material zzso rate constant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso not only in the mixture of groundwater and zzso material zzso constant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but also in the groundwater alone zzso constant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not zzso over 57 days incubation in either the mixture of zzso material and groundwater or the groundwater zzso zzso rates measured in the batch tests were much lower than the total reduction zzso This suggests that not only degradation but also other irreversible processes are important in attenuating pesticides under field zzso zzso the use of zzso degradation rates could underestimate reduction of pesticides in field zzso
