Sleep medicine is gaining more and more interest and importance both within medical research and clinical zzso The investigation of sleep and associated disorders requires the overnight acquisition of a huge amount of zzso data derived from various sensors zzso zzso as well as consecutive time-consuming manual analysis zzso zzso zzso the development of automatic analysis systems has become a major focus in sleep research in the recent years, resulting in the development of zzso for the analysis of different zzso zzso zzso zzso breathing zzso In this study, an open source zzso published by Hamilton et zzso was used for zzso analysis, whereas the analysis of breathing signals was done using an zzso published by Clark et zzso using also variations of the zzso pressure for the detection of breathing zzso The zzso zzso analysis was done with a self-made algorithm, whereas zzso analyses are currently under development, using both frequency analysis zzso and pattern recognition zzso Although all these zzso have proved to be quite useful, their zzso and reliability still needs to be verified in future zzso Taking into account that during a standard zzso recording data from approximately 8 hours of sleep are collected, it is zzso that processing this amount of data by the described zzso very often exceeds the calculating capacity of current standard zzso Using zzso technology, this limitation can be zzso by splitting zzso data and distributing it to several analysis zzso zzso zzso based automatic analysis systems may improve the effectiveness of zzso investigations and thereby diminish the costs for health care zzso
