zzso represents a zzso population of patients with systemic zzso and variable zzso Identification of clinical, zzso and laboratory parameters with zzso utility could contribute to zzso of death hazard and tailoring of zzso 

zzso zzso and laboratory data from 311 patients with zzso diagnosed in a single university zzso from 1988 to 2011 were examined for zzso significance in zzso zzso and zzso and zzso Tree zzso zzso We zzso all published zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso from 1985 to date in order to describe defining zzso 

Most patients zzso poorly differentiated zzso or zzso zzso in visceral sites zzso and were managed with combination zzso Median overall survival for all patients was 8 months zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis established that only zzso zzso zzso zzso cut off zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the visceral zzso and performance status zzso zzso zzso for zzso 0-1) retained independent zzso zzso These three parameters were used for developing a zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which produced a dynamic zzso point score and classified patients in low, intermediate and high risk groups with median survival times of 36, zzso and 5-8 months zzso We identified 15 published zzso series describing zzso zzso with common, as well as zzso patient characteristics and zzso 

We developed a simple and easy to use zzso zzso zzso based on readily available zzso and laboratory zzso However, analysis of all published series revealed lack of zzso consensus, highlighting the zzso of the zzso
