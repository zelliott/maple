We have developed reliability scores for five widely used membrane protein zzso prediction methods, and have applied them both on a test set of 92 bacterial plasma membrane proteins with zzso determined zzso and on all predicted zzso bundle membrane proteins in three fully zzso zzso zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso We show that the reliability scores work well for the zzso and zzso methods, and that they allow the probability that the predicted zzso is correct to be estimated for any zzso We further show that the available test set is biased towards zzso proteins when compared to the zzso data sets, and provide estimates for the expected prediction accuracy of zzso across the three zzso Finally, we show that the performance of zzso is considerably better when limited experimental information (such as the zzso location of a zzso C zzso is available, and estimate that at least ten percentage points in overall accuracy in zzso predictions can be gained in this zzso
