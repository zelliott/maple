We conducted a study to assess zzso of high-dose zzso acid for 24 h after administration of the drug in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with zzso zzso zzso zzso acid involved a zzso of 30 zzso infused over 15 zzso followed by a 16 zzso zzso infusion until chest closure with a 2 zzso load within the pump zzso zzso acid followed zzso zzso best described using a zzso model, with a total body clearance that zzso the zzso zzso zzso Mean plasma zzso acid zzso during the zzso period and in the first 6 zzso hours were consistently higher than the suggested threshold to achieve zzso zzso and zzso zzso of tissue zzso zzso With recent studies implicating high-dose zzso acid as a possible zzso of zzso zzso following cardiac surgery, the minimum effective yet safe dose of zzso acid in high-risk cardiac surgery needs to be zzso
