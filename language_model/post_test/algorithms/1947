The most appropriate method of evaluating the effective atomic number zzso consideration of zzso zzso Previously, this required quite zzso zzso which is why many scientists zzso to zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this work is to develop zzso software for the zzso zzso zzso of effective atomic numbers relevant within the context of medical physics, zzso the commonly employed simplistic power law zzso 

Visual Basic was used to develop a zzso allowing the straightforward calculation of effective atomic zzso zzso interaction cross section zzso are constructed for energies spanning zzso to zzso and elements zzso zzso for composite media are constructed via linear zzso of the fractional constituents and contrasted against the zzso zzso at each energy, thereby zzso an effective atomic number through zzso of adjacent cross section zzso zzso are of the order of zzso 

zzso allows rapid zzso calculation of effective atomic numbers for a range of zzso or zzso media, allowing zzso of zzso properties and comparison of different media (for instance assessment of water zzso The accuracy of zzso has been validated against numerous published theoretical and experimental predictions, demonstrating good zzso The results also show that commonly employed zzso approaches are zzso even in their intended regime of zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, comparing the effective atomic numbers of composite materials using zzso approaches even in a relative fashion is shown to be zzso 

zzso zzso easy zzso of effective atomic numbers as a function of energy, as well as average and zzso zzso The results are significantly more accurate than normal zzso zzso The software is freely available to interested readers, who are encouraged to contact the zzso
