zzso zzso zzso zzso is a face recognition breakthrough in recent years which has successfully addressed the recognition problem with sufficient training images of each gallery zzso In this paper, we extend zzso to applications where there are very few, or even a single, training images per zzso Assuming that the zzso variations of one subject can be zzso by a sparse linear combination of those of other subjects, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso applies an auxiliary zzso zzso dictionary to represent the possible variation between the training and testing zzso The dictionary atoms typically represent zzso sample differences zzso from either the gallery faces themselves or the generic faces that are outside the zzso Experimental results on the zzso and zzso databases show that zzso has better zzso ability than zzso for zzso face recognition under variable expressions, zzso zzso and zzso The superior results of zzso suggest that if the dictionary is properly constructed, zzso zzso can zzso well to the large-scale face recognition problem, even with a single training image per zzso
