zzso zzso zzso for zzso therapy based on imaging methods has been challenging because of a variety of zzso One of the uncertainties in image zzso of zzso zzso is correction for zzso in large blood vessels anterior to the zzso We developed a method to correct for background zzso contributed from blood in large vessels and tested it in a pilot zzso 

CT images of 26 patients receiving zzso or zzso zzso were used to measure the inside diameters of the zzso and inferior zzso zzso zzso at the top of zzso and the bottom of zzso and to measure the length of this vessel zzso The volume was calculated for this vessel segment, and then the zzso in that volume at each imaging time was determined using a zzso blood zzso concentration as established by serial blood zzso This vessel segment typically overlapped with zzso zzso in anterior and zzso zzso zzso The contribution of this background zzso to the zzso activity of the zzso spine region of interest zzso from serial zzso images was determined, taking into account differences in zzso between vessel segments and zzso zzso 

The total blood volumes varied from 25 to 94 zzso with a mean of 51 zzso This mean is zzso of the mean zzso volume of 3 zzso zzso measured in some of these zzso Thirteen of the 14 patients evaluated for zzso position had the zzso segment completely within the zzso zzso For the zzso a mean of zzso was in the zzso zzso zzso for zzso in major blood vessels that were in the zzso led to lower zzso dose zzso 

To improve the accuracy of zzso spine zzso zzso zzso one can adjust zzso in the large vessels by methods that measure the volume, position, and depth of vessels in the zzso
