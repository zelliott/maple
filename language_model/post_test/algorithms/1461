In general, the zzso model zzso like rate constants, area under the curve zzso zzso are estimated via a zzso zzso where the values obtained from zzso relationships within one subject zzso zzso are considered to be functionally related to the drug zzso zzso In many cases zzso zzso and their respective standard errors are calculated zzso The determination of drug zzso in zzso as well as in the serum of small animals zzso zzso in dependence of the time after administration often does not permit the establishment of reasonable profiles within one subject suited for conventional zzso analyses and zzso zzso zzso only one experimental value per organ or animal is zzso The consequence is that most zzso parameters are to be estimated on the basis of the mean zzso rather than via the mean of individual zzso zzso In all cases of a zzso relationship between a target item and the zzso the zzso based zzso and the zzso profile based zzso need not zzso In addition, in the former case zzso zzso may be either difficult to obtain or not zzso In order to get zzso zzso as well as to enable comparisons between different treatment regimens, in addition to zzso testing as a step towards human dose finding studies, various zzso techniques zzso and zzso zzso were applied to generate zzso from independent zzso and compared to their more conventional counterparts where zzso zzso studies based on different zzso zzso models zzso elimination after zzso zzso zzso elimination after zzso zzso simple zzso zzso revealed that even the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with replacement per time zzso performs quite zzso
