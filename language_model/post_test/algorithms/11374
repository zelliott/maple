Given the complexity and interactive nature of biological systems, constructing zzso and coherent network models of these systems and subsequently developing efficient approaches to analyze the assembled networks is of immense zzso The integration of network analysis and dynamic modeling enables one to investigate the behavior of the underlying system as a whole and to make zzso testable predictions about zzso aspects of the processes zzso In this paper, we present a tutorial on the fundamental steps of zzso modeling of biological regulatory zzso We demonstrate how to zzso a zzso network model from the available experimental data, analyze the network using zzso measures, and convert it into a zzso dynamic zzso For each step, the pitfalls one may encounter and possible ways to circumvent them are also zzso We illustrate these steps on a toy network as well as in the context of the zzso zzso segment polarity gene zzso
