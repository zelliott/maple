This study measures the effect of case management interview zzso on 1,000 long-term zzso employees' probability of returning to zzso In contrast to previous studies, we use instrumental variables to correct for selection effects in zzso Using a competing hazard rate model, we find that zzso increases the probability of returning to work for the zzso leave employer, but has no effect on the probability of zzso work for a new zzso We argue that zzso either motivates the zzso employees to resume work or adjusts for zzso information between the employee and the zzso leave zzso
