Most real-world distribution systems can be modeled as distribution networks, where a commodity can flow from source zzso to sink zzso through junction zzso One of the fundamental characteristics of distribution networks is the functional zzso which reflects the ability of maintaining its function in the face of internal or external zzso In view of the fact that most distribution networks do not have any zzso control mechanisms, we consider the problem of how to improve the functional zzso in a decentralized zzso To achieve this goal, we study two important problems: 1) how to formally measure the functional zzso and 2) how to improve the functional zzso of a network based on the local interaction of its zzso First, we derive a utility function in terms of network zzso to characterize the functional zzso of a distribution zzso Second, we propose a decentralized network pricing zzso where each zzso need only communicate with its distribution neighbors by sending a zzso signal to its upstream neighbors and receiving zzso signals from its downstream zzso By doing so, each zzso can determine its outflows by maximizing its own payoff zzso Our mathematical analysis shows that the decentralized pricing mechanism can produce results equivalent to those of an ideal zzso zzso with complete zzso Finally, to demonstrate the properties of our zzso we carry out a case study on the zzso natural gas distribution zzso The results validate the convergence and effectiveness of our mechanism when comparing it with an existing zzso
