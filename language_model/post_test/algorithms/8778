This paper presents the optimal design of an zzso zzso for the rehabilitation of the shoulder zzso This robot structure is constituted of two zzso zzso and is linked to the arm through passive degrees of freedom zzso to drive the zzso and zzso movements of the upper zzso The optimal design of this structure is performed through two zzso The first step is a zzso zzso process aiming to find the best parameters characterizing the robot and its position relative to the zzso The second step is a comparison process aiming to select the best solution from the zzso results on the basis of several criteria related to practical zzso The optimal design process leads to a solution outperforming an existing solution on aspects as zzso or zzso while being more zzso
