Having traditionally relied on zzso of bone mineral density, it is now established that the consideration of other risk variables improves the zzso of fracture zzso Whereas several models are available, the zzso models are the most extensively zzso The approach uses easily obtained clinical risk factors to estimate 10 year fracture zzso with or without zzso neck bone mineral density zzso to enhance fracture risk zzso It has been constructed and validated using primary data from population based zzso around the world, including zzso from North America, Europe, Asia and zzso The zzso tool should not be considered as a gold standard, but rather as a platform technology on which to build as new validated risk indicators become zzso zzso the present models provide an aid to enhance patient assessment by the integration of clinical risk factors alone and/or in combination with zzso
