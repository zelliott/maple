zzso zzso the relative proportion of zzso and normal cells in a sample, affects the sensitivity of zzso zzso copy number analysis, cancer gene expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso is traditionally estimated by pathological review of zzso zzso however this method is both zzso and prone to error due to zzso within zzso and zzso differences between the sample viewed during pathological review and tissue used for research zzso In this paper we describe a statistical model to estimate zzso zzso from zzso array profiles of paired zzso and normal samples using shifts in zzso zzso frequency at regions of loss of zzso zzso in the zzso We also provide zzso a software zzso of the zzso Our experiments showed that there is a medium correlation zzso zzso see zzso between tumor zzso estimated by zzso and pathology zzso Interestingly there is a high correlation zzso zzso see zzso zzso see zzso zzso between zzso estimates by zzso and deep Ion zzso sequencing of known zzso zzso zzso and a weaker correlation zzso zzso see zzso between zzso sequencing and pathology zzso This suggests that zzso may be a more accurate predictor of zzso zzso than pathology zzso zzso can be downloaded from zzso
