A novel fuzzy neural network, the zzso zzso based zzso zzso Network zzso and its two zzso zzso are proposed in this zzso They are the zzso zzso zzso learning and the zzso zzso zzso zzso leaning zzso These two learning zzso are used in zzso to identify relevant fuzzy zzso In contrast with other zzso zzso the proposed zzso have many advantages, such as being fast, reliable, efficient, and easy to zzso POP learning is a simple zzso learning zzso It essentially performs zzso zzso it suffers from the shortcoming of having to consider all the possible zzso The second algorithm, the zzso learning algorithm, truly identifies the fuzzy rules which are relevant and does not use a zzso method zzso irrelevant fuzzy rules are eliminated from an initial rule zzso In addition, it is able to adjust the structure of the fuzzy neural zzso The proposed zzso learning zzso is able to delete invalid feature zzso according to the fuzzy rules that have been zzso zzso experimental results and discussions are presented for a detailed analysis of the proposed zzso
