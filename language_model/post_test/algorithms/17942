In the United States, zzso plasma zzso is commonly used for urgent reversal of zzso however, dosage recommendations are difficult to zzso If zzso a proposed method that uses a zzso relationship between international zzso ratio zzso and zzso factor activity zzso would be zzso This study zzso evaluated a proposed equation with adult medical zzso who received zzso for zzso zzso For each patient the equation was used to predict the dose of zzso required to achieve the observed change in zzso which was then compared to the actual zzso The equation was considered successful if the predicted dose was within zzso of the actual zzso zzso analyses included subjects who received zzso vitamin zzso subjects with zzso zzso zzso and subjects with significantly elevated zzso zzso Of the 209 patients screened, 91 met criteria for inclusion in the zzso Use of the equation to calculate the predicted dose of zzso was successful in 11 patients zzso with use of actual body weight for prediction and in 23 patients zzso with use of ideal body weight zzso zzso zzso The equation performed similarly in all zzso zzso The mean predicted zzso dose was significantly greater than the actual dose in all patients when actual body weight was used zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso modeling of repeat zzso zzso to zzso produced a model that accounted for 57% of the zzso in repeat zzso The value predicted from the model was closer to the actual zzso than was the value predicted from the published equation in every comparison, but it was statistically different only when actual body weight was zzso This study revealed that a published equation for calculation of zzso dose to reverse oral zzso resulted in doses that were significantly higher than the actual zzso Use of ideal body weight improved accuracy but was still not successful for the majority of zzso Until trials are able to zzso demonstrate the accuracy of a zzso model for zzso dosing will remain largely zzso
