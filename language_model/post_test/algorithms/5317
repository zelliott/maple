A system identification methodology based on zzso spectral operators and an zzso system reduction zzso is proposed, leading to a new approach for zzso modeling of zzso zzso systems on zzso zzso A continuous model structure is devised allowing for terms of arbitrary zzso order and zzso zzso zzso spectral operators are introduced to realm of inverse problems to zzso that continuous structure and arrive with spectral accuracy at a discrete zzso Finally, least squares combined with an zzso system reduction zzso are employed to solve for the parameters and eliminate the redundancies to achieve a zzso zzso A zzso case study of identifying the zzso zzso equation demonstrates the superior accuracy of the proposed zzso spectral identification over its finite difference zzso
