zzso of changes in brain cortical thickness is useful for the assessment of regional gray matter zzso in neurodegenerative zzso A new zzso method, called zzso zzso zzso zzso detection zzso has been developed for the measurement of changes in cortical thickness in magnetic resonance images zzso acquired over zzso zzso creates a zzso cortical model which is zzso zzso to match images from individual time zzso The zzso was designed to work reliably for lower resolution images, such as the zzso with zzso zzso zzso previously acquired for many clinical trials in multiple sclerosis zzso zzso was evaluated to determine zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso for images with zzso zzso zzso and zzso for images with zzso zzso zzso The mean absolute accuracy error was zzso zzso as determined by comparison of zzso zzso to cortical thickness measured directly in zzso zzso zzso sensitivity for correctly detecting at least zzso change was zzso in a simulation zzso A comparison to zzso showed good agreement zzso zzso for global mean zzso zzso was also applied to zzso acquired over 18 months in secondary progressive zzso patients who were zzso at two different zzso zzso thinning was detected in this group in both the lower and higher resolution zzso zzso detected a higher rate of cortical thinning in zzso patients compared to healthy controls over 2 zzso These results show that zzso can be used for reliable measurement of cortical zzso in zzso studies, even in lower resolution zzso
