zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso were prepared by an zzso emulsion zzso evaporation zzso This study was designed to investigate the preparation, in zzso release, in zzso zzso and tissue distribution of a zzso zzso zzso zzso are characterized according to drug zzso size and zzso With a dynamic light scattering zzso and a transmission electron zzso it is shown that the zzso zzso had a mean size of approximately zzso zzso with narrow size distribution and a zzso zzso The in zzso release profiles indicate that the release of zzso from the zzso exhibit a sustained release zzso A similar phenomenon is observed in a zzso study in rats, in which zzso of the zzso zzso were zzso higher than that of zzso zzso The zzso study in mice showed that the zzso zzso not only decreased drug zzso by liver, but also increased distribution of drug in zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso may efficiently load, protect and retain zzso in both in zzso and in zzso zzso and could be a useful drug carrier for zzso zzso administration of zzso
