zzso engineering of biological form and function requires zzso design over several orders of space and zzso Recent advances in the zzso understanding of zzso compound materials, zzso design approaches in molecular synthetic biology zzso and traditional soft zzso and increasing zzso in generating structural and chemical zzso environments that promote cellular zzso have enhanced the ability to zzso such zzso architecture in engineered biological zzso Here we combined these capabilities in a systematic design strategy to reverse engineer a muscular zzso We report the construction of a freely swimming zzso from chemically zzso rat tissue and silicone zzso as a proof of zzso The zzso termed zzso were designed with computer simulations and experiments to match key zzso of zzso propulsion and feeding performance by zzso mimicking structural design, stroke zzso and zzso zzso The combination of the engineering design zzso with quantitative benchmarks of zzso performance suggests that our strategy is broadly zzso to reverse engineering of muscular zzso or simple life forms that pump to zzso
