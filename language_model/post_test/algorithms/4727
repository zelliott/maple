To zzso verify the feasibility of focused heating in the neck region by an array of two rings of six electromagnetic zzso We also measured the dynamic specific zzso rate zzso steering possibilities of this setup and compared these zzso patterns to zzso 

Using a specially constructed laboratory zzso zzso zzso including a zzso zzso muscle zzso we performed zzso zzso by electric field, zzso sheet zzso and, using the zzso technique, by zzso zzso and infrared zzso Using phase zzso we also steered the zzso distribution in zzso and zzso zzso All measured zzso were compared with the predictions by a zzso zzso electromagnetic zzso 

A central 50% zzso focus of 35 zzso 3 zzso in diameter and about 100 zzso 15 zzso in length was obtained for all investigated zzso Furthermore, this zzso focus could be steered toward the desired location in the zzso and zzso directions with an accuracy of approximately 5 zzso The zzso zzso as measured by all three experimental methods were well predicted by the zzso 

The results of our study have shown that focused heating in the neck is feasible and that this focus can be effectively steered in the zzso and zzso zzso For quality assurance zzso we believe that the zzso sheet provides the best compromise among effort, speed, and zzso although a more specific and improved design is zzso
