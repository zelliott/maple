The solution of many zzso zzso problems is carried out by zzso which generally make use of local search zzso These zzso use some kind of neighborhood structure over the search zzso The performance of the zzso strongly depends on the properties that the neighborhood zzso on the search zzso One of these properties is the number of local zzso Given an instance of a zzso zzso problem and a neighborhood, the zzso of the number of local zzso can help not only to measure the complexity of the instance, but also to choose the most convenient neighborhood to solve zzso In this paper we review and evaluate several methods to estimate the number of local zzso in zzso zzso zzso The methods reviewed not only come from the zzso zzso literature, but also from the statistical zzso A thorough evaluation in synthetic as well as real problems is zzso We conclude by providing recommendations of methods for several zzso
