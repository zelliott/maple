zzso orientation mapping through diffusion zzso imaging zzso is a powerful zzso technique for zzso white matter zzso zzso in the zzso Although zzso provides a robust way to measure fiber orientation, it has some limitations linked to the use of zzso zzso and long diffusion zzso zzso including relatively low spatial zzso Development of alternative zzso methods for fiber orientation mapping is therefore valuable, in part to allow validation of zzso zzso In this study, we used the orientation dependence of zzso zzso and frequency difference zzso to generate three zzso maps of the fiber orientation in zzso from zzso zzso zzso images acquired from post zzso brain tissue samples oriented at multiple angles to zzso Through zzso derivation and zzso zzso the relationships connecting variations in zzso and frequency difference values to the angle between the underlying zzso fiber orientation and the direction of zzso were zzso High resolution zzso fiber orientation maps zzso were then formed by comparing zzso and frequency difference data, acquired with the sample at multiple zzso to the field, to zzso models based on the derived expressions for the angular dependence of each zzso By comparing the resulting zzso zzso with zzso zzso from the same tissue sample, we demonstrate that fiber orientation mapping based on zzso echo zzso has the potential to become an important tool for investigating zzso in brain zzso
