We introduce a new statistical model for time series that zzso segments data into regimes with approximately linear dynamics and zzso parameters of each of these linear zzso This model combines and zzso two of the most widely used zzso zzso models -- hidden zzso models and linear zzso systems -- and is closely related to models that are widely used in the control and zzso zzso It can also be derived by extending the mixture of experts neural network zzso Jordan, zzso & Hinton, zzso to its fully zzso version, in which both expert and gating networks are zzso zzso the zzso probabilities of the hidden states of this model is zzso intractable, and therefore the exact expectation zzso zzso zzso cannot be zzso However, we present a zzso approximation that zzso a lower bound on the zzso and makes use of both the forward and backward zzso for hidden zzso models and the Kalman filter zzso for linear zzso zzso We tested the zzso on artificial data sets and a natural data set of zzso force from a patient with sleep zzso The results suggest that zzso approximations are a viable method for zzso and learning in switching zzso zzso
