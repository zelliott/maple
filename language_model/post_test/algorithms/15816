To determine the relative value of two-dimensional zzso zzso vs carotid duplex scanning and to devise an zzso cost-effective diagnostic approach for older patients with cerebral zzso 68 consecutive patients in zzso rhythm who suffered focal cerebral zzso were zzso All patients underwent zzso zzso and carotid duplex scanning in addition to routine clinical zzso 

Twenty-five of 68 patients had zzso zzso zzso by zzso nine zzso of these 25 had left zzso mural zzso demonstrated by zzso zzso In contrast, none of 43 patients without zzso zzso zzso had clinically zzso findings diagnosed by zzso zzso Duplex zzso however, identified zzso abnormal findings in the carotid artery zzso to the involved cerebral zzso in 23 patients zzso 

Thus, in older patients in zzso rhythm who suffer a cerebral zzso event, carotid duplex scanning has a higher diagnostic yield than zzso zzso and appears to be a more cost-effective initial zzso Our data suggest that in patients with carotid distribution cerebral zzso events and no obvious cardiac source for zzso by history and physical examination, zzso zzso should be limited to those with evidence of zzso zzso zzso by zzso such management should zzso diagnostic yield and cost zzso
