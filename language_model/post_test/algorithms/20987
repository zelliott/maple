The identification of human zzso zzso zzso within a protein vaccine candidate is of great zzso it provides a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in protective immunity and may therefore help in the design of effective vaccines and diagnostic zzso The entire zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso protein from zzso 71 zzso zzso strain 41 was submitted to analysis by the zzso zzso for the identification of potential zzso human zzso zzso Three regions spanning zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso of zzso were predicted to bind more than 25 zzso zzso The corresponding synthetic peptides zzso to zzso were then tested for their abilities to induce proliferation of zzso T cells isolated from five human volunteers screened positive for previous zzso 71 exposure and one zzso zzso zzso Upon stimulation with either zzso zzso zzso zzso responses were observed for all zzso zzso zzso the presence of zzso zzso memory zzso T zzso The zzso of the zzso responses was zzso and zzso and correlated well with the zzso binding zzso Moreover, zzso T cells from zzso zzso volunteers produced significant levels of zzso and zzso upon zzso indicative of a zzso differentiation into zzso zzso Among the three zzso zzso induced the highest zzso response and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso response could be inhibited with zzso zzso complex zzso class II zzso indicating that zzso represents a zzso class zzso zzso zzso zzso This study demonstrates that the zzso zzso can accurately predict the presence of human zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso protein of zzso 71, and therefore represents a useful tool for the design of zzso vaccines against zzso zzso
