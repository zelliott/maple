The intrinsic dynamics of zzso is an essential property to relate the structure of zzso systems with their function in the zzso In the field of zzso recognition, numerous zzso have revealed the limitations of the zzso theory, and the need to elaborate models that take into account the inherent plasticity of zzso such as the zzso model or the existence of an ensemble of zzso zzso Depending on the nature of the target system, zzso binding can be associated with small local adjustments in side chains or even the backbone to large-scale motions of structural fragments, zzso or even zzso zzso the inherent flexibility of zzso has thus become one of the most challenging issues in molecular modeling and simulation studies, as it has direct implications in our understanding of the zzso zzso but even in areas such as virtual screening and zzso drug zzso Given the intrinsic limitation of conventional simulation tools, only events occurring in short time scales can be reproduced at a high accuracy level through zzso techniques such as zzso zzso zzso However, larger structural zzso demand the use of enhanced sampling methods relying on modified descriptions of the zzso system or the potential zzso This review illustrates the crucial role that structural plasticity plays in zzso zzso recognition through representative zzso In addition, it discusses some of the most powerful zzso tools developed to characterize the zzso flexibility in zzso zzso
