Resolution enhanced zzso zzso imaging zzso is a new zzso pulse sequence for the generation of rapid zzso contrast with high spatial zzso zzso provides zzso contrast by using zzso spaced inversion zzso throughout a balanced zzso free zzso zzso zzso In zzso these energy and time intensive zzso inversion zzso and associated zzso preparation are removed from zzso after acquisition of the data around the center of zzso zzso evolution simulations demonstrate zzso contrast in zzso as well as reduction in the widening of the point spread function zzso (by up to a factor of 4) to a near ideal case for zzso Phantom zzso is used to characterize and compare the contrast and spatial resolution properties of zzso zzso balanced zzso zzso Acquisition zzso zzso Spin Echo zzso and zzso spin echo and to zzso the fraction of zzso acquired using zzso zzso images in the abdomen and brain demonstrate similar contrast and improved spatial resolution in zzso compared with zzso comparison balanced zzso zzso and zzso spin echo images are zzso zzso is capable of providing high spatial resolution zzso images in 1 s or less per zzso
