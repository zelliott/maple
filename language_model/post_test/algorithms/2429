The aim of the study was to determine whether heart failure is associated with an increased risk of major zzso fractures that is independent of bone mineral density zzso 

We conducted a zzso cohort study in zzso Canada, by linking a clinical registry of all adults 50 zzso of age and older who underwent initial zzso testing from zzso with administrative zzso We collected osteoporosis risk factors, zzso medications, and zzso zzso zzso zzso identified zzso heart failure before the zzso test and new fractures zzso The main outcome was time to major zzso fractures zzso clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and multivariable zzso hazards models were used for zzso 

The cohort consisted of zzso adults; zzso zzso had zzso heart zzso zzso with heart failure were significantly zzso zzso zzso older zzso zzso 66 zzso and had more previous fractures (21 zzso zzso and lower total hip zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than those zzso There were zzso incident fractures over the zzso zzso Overall, zzso of heart failure subjects had incident major fractures compared with zzso of those without zzso hazard ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso Adjustment for osteoporosis risk factors, zzso and medications attenuated but did not eliminate this association zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nor did further adjustment for total hip zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Heart failure is associated with a zzso increase in major fractures that is independent of traditional risk factors and zzso and it also identifies a high-risk population that may benefit from increased screening and treatment for zzso
