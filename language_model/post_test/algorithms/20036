Cooperative zzso is a successful trend of evolutionary zzso which allows us to define partitions of the domain of a given problem, or to integrate several related techniques into one, by the use of evolutionary zzso It is possible to apply it to the development of advanced zzso methods, which integrate several machine learning techniques into a single zzso A novel approach zzso instance selection, instance zzso and feature weighting into the framework of a zzso model is presented in this zzso We compare it with a wide range of evolutionary and zzso related methods, in order to show the benefits of the employment of zzso to apply the techniques considered zzso The results zzso contrasted through zzso statistical tests, show that our proposal zzso other methods in the comparison, thus becoming a suitable tool in the task of enhancing the nearest neighbor zzso
