We present a method for establishing zzso between human cortical surfaces that exactly matches the positions of given point landmarks, while attaining the global minimum of an objective function that zzso how far the mapping deviates from zzso On each surface, a zzso transformation is applied to the zzso distance zzso resulting in a zzso metric with isolated cone point zzso at the zzso zzso each surface is mapped to a zzso zzso a zzso surface with each point landmark corresponding to a pillow zzso An initial zzso mapping exactly zzso the landmarks, and zzso descent is used to find the single, global minimum of the zzso energy of the remainder of the zzso Using a population of real zzso cortical surfaces with manually labeled zzso zzso as landmarks, we evaluate the approach by how much it zzso surfaces and by its biological zzso how well it zzso zzso anatomical landmarks and by how well it promotes expected associations between cortical thickness and zzso We show that, compared to a zzso approach that balances a zzso between minimizing landmark mismatch and zzso energy, our method has similar biological zzso superior surface zzso a better theoretical foundation, and fewer arbitrary parameters to zzso We also compare to zzso zzso in the zzso domain to show that sacrificing exact zzso of the mapping does not cause noticeable reductions in biological zzso
