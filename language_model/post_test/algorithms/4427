zzso analysis of gene expression zzso is a powerful technique for global gene expression zzso allowing simultaneous analysis of thousands of transcripts without prior structural and functional zzso zzso discovery and zzso have become fundamental approaches to analyzing such large-scale gene expression zzso From the pattern discovery perspective, zzso techniques have received great zzso However, due to the statistical nature of zzso data zzso underlying zzso traditional zzso techniques may not be suitable for zzso data zzso Based on the adaptation and improvement of zzso zzso and zzso zzso techniques, this paper presents two new zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso data zzso Tested on synthetic and experimental zzso data, these zzso demonstrate several advantages over traditional pattern discovery zzso The results indicate that, by incorporating statistical properties of zzso data, zzso and zzso as well as a hybrid approach zzso zzso based on the combination of zzso and zzso offer significant improvements in pattern discovery and zzso for zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso platform, which may improve and accelerate zzso data mining, was zzso The system is freely available on request from the authors for nonprofit zzso
