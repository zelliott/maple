Two rapid zzso zzso for construction of cerebral blood flow zzso and oxygen zzso zzso images with dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso These zzso are based on the linear least squares zzso and generalized linear least squares zzso zzso Using the conventional zzso model and multiple zzso studies, we derived a linear relationship for brain tissue activity to zzso blood activity, zzso zzso blood activity and zzso brain tissue zzso The zzso technique is zzso efficient as no zzso analysis is required, while zzso is used to refine the estimates obtained from zzso A comparative study using zzso least squares zzso zzso revealed excellent correlation between the new zzso for various noise levels expected in clinical zzso A sensitivity analysis was performed to examine reliability and zzso of the zzso zzso In view of the results, zzso and zzso provide rapid and reliable estimates of zzso and zzso when applied to dynamic PET zzso These zzso are particularly suitable for zzso construction of high resolution and highly accurate PET functional zzso
