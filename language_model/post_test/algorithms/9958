We demonstrate an zzso reconstruction technique to significantly improve the depth of focus and contrast of three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso A zzso scanned virtual zzso element records reflections from the object of zzso A synthetic zzso focusing technique maintains fine spatial resolution over a large image zzso zzso the spatial zzso of the received signals across the zzso zzso provides a zzso zzso approach to significantly improve image zzso Test images show a spatial resolution of zzso zzso maintained over a 16 zzso depth of field, and up to a 30 zzso improvement in zzso zzso
