A quantitative zzso model describes the tissue transformation during healing of a zzso zzso of a sheep zzso The model predicts bridging of the bone ends through cartilage, followed by the growth of a callus zzso and finally, the zzso of callus after zzso of the zzso zzso We suggest bone density or the zzso of elasticity do not sufficiently characterize healing tissue for zzso zzso In addition to the stimulus reflected by strain energy density we introduce a new zzso factor based upon stress zzso and which predicts areas of a high zzso zzso Our model zzso three basic types of zzso namely bone, cartilage and zzso zzso A fuzzy controller is proposed to model the tissue zzso A set of fuzzy rules derived from medical knowledge has been implemented to describe tissue transformation such as zzso or zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso logic is able to model tissue transformation processes within the zzso simulation of zzso zzso This approach improves the simulation tools and zzso the potential to zzso planning of animal experiments and conduct zzso zzso
