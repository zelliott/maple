zzso zzso signal has long been viewed as the dominant translation initiation signal in zzso Recently, zzso zzso which lack zzso regions zzso on their zzso have been shown abundant in zzso However, current large-scale in zzso analyses on initiation mechanisms in bacteria are mainly based on the zzso initiation way, other than the zzso zzso The study of zzso genes in bacteria remains open, which causes uncertain understanding of translation initiation mechanisms for zzso 

Here, we study signals in translation initiation regions of all genes over zzso bacterial and 72 zzso zzso then make an effort to construct an evolutionary scenario in view of zzso genes in zzso With an zzso designed to identify zzso in upstream regions of genes for a zzso we zzso all genes into zzso zzso and zzso genes according to the category of the most probable signal in their upstream zzso zzso occurrence of zzso signals about 10 zzso upstream to translation initiation site zzso in bacteria most probably means zzso zzso 

Our analysis reveals that zzso genes are totally zzso although not dominant, in a variety of zzso Especially for zzso and zzso more than zzso percent of genes are zzso zzso in closely related bacterial zzso our results imply that the change of translation initiation mechanisms, which happens between the genes zzso from a common zzso is zzso dependent on the zzso zzso Analysis on the zzso of zzso genes further shows that the proportion of zzso genes in bacteria has a decreasing trend in zzso
