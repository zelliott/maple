With zzso zzso zzso zzso simultaneous imaging of two zzso processes relies on discrimination of the energy of the zzso gamma rays, whereas the application of zzso imaging to zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging has been limited by the characteristic zzso zzso 

To address this zzso we developed a novel approach based on generalized factor analysis of dynamic sequences zzso that exploits zzso differences between zzso and applied it to zzso imaging of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with simulated human data and experimental zzso monkey zzso We show theoretically and verify by simulation and measurement that zzso can separate zzso and zzso zzso that are made nearly zzso 

The theoretical development shows that zzso can decompose the studies at several zzso zzso It zzso the zzso and zzso study so that they can be analyzed as though they were obtained zzso zzso If additional zzso constraints can be zzso further decomposition is zzso zzso For the example of zzso specific and zzso binding can be determined on a zzso zzso We found good agreement between the estimated zzso factors and the simulated ground truth time activity zzso zzso and between the zzso factor images and the corresponding ground truth activity zzso with errors less than zzso zzso in zzso of specific zzso binding and relative metabolism activity were within zzso compared to the ground truth zzso We also evaluated our approach in simultaneous zzso brain PET studies in a zzso monkey and obtained accuracy of better than zzso in a zzso volume, for zzso activity zzso 

Dynamic image sequences acquired following zzso injection of two PET zzso can be separated into components based on the differences in the zzso provided their kinetic behaviors are zzso
