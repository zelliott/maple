A unique application of zzso modeling is described to compare hospital bed occupancy with reported severe adverse events amongst zzso The probabilities of the occurrence of adverse events as a function of hospital occupancy are calculated using zzso and zzso zzso zzso All models indicate that higher occupancy rates lead to an increase in adverse zzso The analysis identified that at an occupancy level of zzso there is a zzso chance of one severe event occurring and a zzso chance of at least one severe event zzso This modeling contributes evidence toward the management of hospital occupancy to benefit patient zzso
