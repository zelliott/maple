A lightness zzso that separates surface zzso from zzso in a zzso world is zzso automatically from a set of examples, which consist of pairs of input zzso zzso and desired output zzso zzso zzso The algorithm, which resembles a new lightness zzso recently proposed by Land, is approximately equivalent to filtering the image through a zzso receptive field in individual chromatic zzso The zzso technique, optimal linear zzso requires only one zzso that the operator that zzso input into output is zzso This assumption is true for a certain class of early vision zzso that may therefore be zzso in a similar way from zzso Other methods of zzso zzso from examples, or zzso such as zzso do not yield a significantly better lightness zzso
