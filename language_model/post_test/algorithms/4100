For the first time, several zzso zzso zzso models including partial least zzso zzso zzso power zzso zzso multiple linear zzso projections zzso zzso robust zzso zzso zzso partial robust zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso basis zzso zzso least zzso zzso machines zzso zzso zzso neural network zzso discrete zzso zzso zzso and back zzso zzso have been constructed on the basis of zzso first order square wave zzso zzso data for the simultaneous determination of zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at a glassy carbon zzso zzso to identify which technique offers the best zzso The compositions of the zzso zzso were selected according to a zzso lattice design zzso and validated with an external set of zzso zzso An zzso least squares zzso zzso zzso zzso was applied for correcting the zzso A correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to data alignment and lack of zzso was tackled by potential shift zzso The effects of several zzso techniques such as genetic zzso zzso zzso signal correction zzso mean centering zzso robust median centering zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso smoothing zzso on the zzso ability of the mentioned zzso models were zzso The best zzso technique was found for each zzso According to the results zzso the zzso was recommended to simultaneously zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in human serum zzso
