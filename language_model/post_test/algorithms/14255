zzso zzso zzso zzso image reconstruction is an zzso problem requiring maximum measurement zzso Recent zzso systems claim 60 to 80 zzso zzso Achieving higher values is hard in practice since zzso must be performed at relatively high frequency, on a living subject, while using components whose tolerance is usually higher than zzso To circumvent this difficulty, a method for zzso the electronic circuits of an zzso system was developed in order to zzso the circuits and incorporate the model in the reconstruction zzso The proposed approach is based on a zzso method for solving electrical circuits and has been applied to the zzso which contains the front-end electronic circuits of our zzso The method is used to simulate the system characteristic zzso which are then zzso with the zzso method to find optimal component zzso A zzso was built with the new component values and its simulated performance zzso were compared with network zzso zzso As a result of the zzso the zzso at the operating frequency was increased to minimize the effects of variations in zzso contact zzso The zzso and gain frequency responses were also reshaped to reduce noise sensitivity and unintended signal zzso zzso the model in the reconstruction zzso should further improve overall performance of an zzso zzso
