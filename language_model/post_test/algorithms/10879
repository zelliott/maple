The zzso of a zzso distribution, constructed by making marginal transformations of each zzso captures all the information in the zzso distribution about the dependence between two zzso For frailty models for zzso data the choice of a family of zzso for the random frailty zzso to the choice of a zzso family for the zzso A class of tests of the hypothesis that the zzso is in a given zzso family, with unspecified association zzso based on zzso right censored data is zzso These tests are based on first making marginal zzso transformations of the data and then comparing a zzso estimate of the zzso to an estimate based on the assumed family of zzso A number of options are available for choosing the scale and the distance measure for this zzso zzso levels of the test are found by a modified zzso zzso The procedure is used to check the appropriateness of a gamma or a positive stable frailty model in a set of survival data on Danish zzso
