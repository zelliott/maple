We present an zzso description of the zzso alignment effect of zzso optical systems with circular zzso The description shows that zzso and tilt produce lateral displacement of the field and zzso zzso whilst a zzso directly zzso the aberration zzso by zzso zzso distances and scale factors of the two zzso This reveals that a zzso surface not only changes its aberration zzso but also affects those of subsequent surfaces, which is the essence of the zzso alignment zzso This description, combined with primary aberration theory, was applied to various zzso systems to approximate their aberrations and alignment sensitivities given by zzso The results demonstrate the accuracy and zzso of this zzso We also discuss the potential usefulness of the description in zzso the zzso zzso between zzso
