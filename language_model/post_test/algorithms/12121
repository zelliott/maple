Wave packet motion in the laser dye zzso 1 in methanol is investigated by zzso resolved transient zzso zzso The spectral range of zzso zzso was accessible by amplified broadband probe zzso covering the overlap region of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The influence of zzso wave packets on the optical signal is analyzed in the frequency domain and the time zzso For the analysis in the frequency domain an zzso is presented that accounts for interference effects of zzso zzso zzso By this method zzso phase and zzso time of zzso modes are retrieved as a function of probe wavelength and zzso due to zzso modes are zzso The analysis of the data in the time domain yields complementary information on the intensity, central zzso and spectral zzso of the optical zzso spectrum due to wave packet zzso
