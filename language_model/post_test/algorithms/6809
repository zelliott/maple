A new method enabling the determination of 15 priority zzso zzso compounds zzso proposed by the US National zzso Program zzso has been developed and applied to diesel exhaust zzso zzso The zzso procedure consists of zzso extraction zzso and zzso zzso on zzso zzso followed by zzso extraction and zzso on a zzso zzso zzso The method gives good zzso for all zzso studied except zzso and zzso for which recovery values are below zzso The use of zzso zzso trap and its capacity to achieve zzso storage enhanced the sensitivity of the method, enabling the detection of zzso zzso in the low zzso zzso concentration zzso Intermediate polarity zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso enabled better zzso when applied to zzso analysis, than the generally used zzso zzso zzso This is observed mainly for separation of zzso compounds belonging to the zzso and zzso zzso The application of this method to zzso sampled from the exhaust of a diesel engine and in confined locations such as a tunnel has shown that all zzso of the zzso list could be zzso except zzso No zzso or zzso could be detected in such zzso The method is sufficiently sensitive to be zzso to environmental exposure zzso in occupational health zzso
