Previous studies have shown that zzso pH zzso alters gating and zzso properties of cardiac zzso and zzso zzso However, a comprehensive study investigating the effects of zzso on all other zzso calcium channels is zzso Here, we report the effects of zzso on zzso parameters slope factor zzso zzso potential zzso reversal potential zzso and maximum slope zzso zzso of the nine known zzso zzso calcium channels zzso expressed in zzso zzso In all cases, zzso of the zzso bathing solution results in a zzso shift in the zzso curve and reduction in peak current zzso Relative to a zzso zzso of zzso statistically significant zzso shifts in Va were observed for all channels at zzso zzso except zzso and zzso which showed significant shifts at zzso zzso and zzso All channels displayed significant reductions in zzso relative to zzso zzso at zzso zzso except zzso zzso and zzso which required zzso to zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso channels displayed the largest changes in zzso and exhibited the largest reduction in zzso compared with other channel zzso Taken together, these results suggest that significant zzso of calcium channel currents can occur with changes in zzso zzso of the external solution did not produce significant shifts in observed zzso or blockade of outward currents for any of the nine channel zzso Finally, we tested a simple zzso model of current block by assuming blockade of the pore by a single zzso In all cases, the amount of blockade observed could not be explained in these simple terms, suggesting that zzso zzso is more complicated, involving more than one site or gating modification as has been previously described for cardiac zzso and zzso zzso
