Live cell imaging has become an indispensable technique for cell zzso However, when grown on zzso glass used for live cell imaging many cultured cells move even during relatively short observation times and focus can drift as a result of mechanical zzso and/or temperature zzso zzso imaging therefore requires constant adjustment of the imaging field and focus position to keep the cell of interest zzso in the zzso zzso We show here that this limitation can be overcome by tracking cells in a fully automated way using the mass zzso of cellular zzso Combined with automated multiple location zzso this method dramatically increases the zzso of high-resolution live cell imaging zzso
