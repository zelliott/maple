zzso of ambient zzso concentration on zzso transport across the thin ascending limb of zzso loop zzso were examined by the in zzso zzso zzso When zzso concentration in the bathing fluid was decreased from zzso zzso to zzso 0 zzso at 37 degrees C, the relative zzso of zzso to zzso zzso estimated from the zzso diffusion zzso changed from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 7, P less than zzso When zzso concentration of the zzso fluid was reduced, zzso was zzso When zzso concentration in the bathing fluid was changed from zzso to zzso 0 zzso the zzso flux zzso for zzso zzso was zzso whereas the value for zzso was zzso indicating that the reduction of zzso concentration in the bathing fluid selectively zzso zzso transport without affecting zzso zzso By contrast, at 23 degrees C, the elimination of zzso from the bathing fluid caused only a small reduction of zzso Although at 23 degrees C zzso of the bathing fluid caused only little or no decrease in zzso zzso the elimination of zzso from the bathing fluid under acid pH markedly suppressed the zzso zzso zzso The pH zzso zzso of relative zzso zzso examined at three different zzso zzso at 37 degrees C revealed that the interaction between zzso and zzso was zzso zzso of zzso zzso which reduced zzso zzso zzso to the bath caused an irreversible suppression of zzso zzso suggesting that the decrease in zzso zzso concentration also zzso the zzso transport across the zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
