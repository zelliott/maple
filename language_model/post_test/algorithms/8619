A method and device for measuring zzso concentration in a scattering medium have been zzso A spectral range of zzso zzso is considered for wavelength selection because of its deeper penetration into biological tissue and the presence of a zzso zzso zzso An zzso based on selected zzso is proposed to minimize interference from other zzso The optimal distance between the light source and the detector for diffuse zzso measurement zzso the influence of medium zzso The proposed zzso and measuring device are tested with a solution containing milk with added zzso zzso zzso between 0 and 2000 zzso are determined with a correlation zzso of zzso We also investigate the influence of concentration variations of other substances such as water, zzso zzso and cholesterol when they are mixed in a scattering zzso
