The paper presents a case where an implant for a part of the zzso (with zzso zzso affected by cancer was created and implanted by using the specific reverse modeling method and solid zzso zzso The method provides surgeons with a fast and reliable tool for tissue engineering and zzso and therefore improves the quality of life for zzso Digital images of healthy zzso samples were used to develop a reverse modeling zzso that zzso generates a necessary and sufficient zzso of the tissue geometry to be zzso in an inexpensive and zzso zzso In this particular case, the redesign of the missing part of the zzso in zzso software took three zzso At the same time, the suitable zzso of the geometry affects the fabrication of simpler and less expensive casting zzso Furthermore, the core of the developed zzso for the reverse modeling of zzso can be applied in the reverse modeling improvement of other tile (or zzso zzso
