Recently, the authors proposed an zzso scheme to estimate the first order zzso scatter by zzso the zzso formula so that the first order scatter zzso is expressed as a function of the primary zzso zzso on the zzso In this work, the authors apply the scheme to zzso obtained 6 zzso cone beam CT projections in which the primary zzso zzso is the unknown of zzso With the assumption that the zzso scatter zzso is either constant or zzso to the first order scatter zzso an zzso approach is proposed to estimate both primary and scatter zzso from projections by utilizing their zzso The zzso approach is evaluated by comparisons with zzso measured zzso ratios of a zzso phantom and with zzso Carlo simulations of virtual zzso The convergence of the zzso is fast and the accuracy of scatter correction is zzso For a sufficiently long zzso water phantom with 10 zzso of zzso the relative error of estimated primary zzso zzso was within zzso zzso and zzso zzso when the phantom was projected with 6 zzso and 120 zzso zzso imaging systems, zzso In addition, the zzso approach for scatter zzso is applied to 6 zzso zzso projections of a zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso The scatter correction is demonstrated to significantly improve the accuracy of the reconstructed linear zzso zzso and the contrast of the projections and reconstructed zzso images generated with a zzso 6 zzso zzso
