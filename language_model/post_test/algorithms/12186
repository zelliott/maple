Efforts to remove the dense zzso phase liquids zzso in subsurface by zzso them face with risks of driving the zzso deeper into zzso zzso In this paper, a zzso zzso of zzso by mixed zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and sodium zzso zzso zzso in zzso systems was zzso Given 1:40 phase ratio of zzso zzso mixed zzso exhibited significantly zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, when the total zzso concentration was up to zzso zzso the condition when zzso by the mixture was better than those zzso with individual components by zzso The zzso zzso depended on the initial ratios of zzso to zzso the initial zzso zzso and the properties of zzso Given the total zzso zzso zzso zzso increased with the fraction of zzso in mixed zzso On the contrary, did with the total zzso zzso The zzso capacity by zzso zzso and zzso of mass ratio of zzso were determined and compared with those by single zzso In the view of the mass zzso ratio zzso the mixed zzso could zzso more zzso than single zzso at given zzso zzso Reduction in partition of zzso and synergistic zzso were responsible for the significant zzso extent of mixed zzso The work presented here demonstrates that mixed zzso zzso would be preferred over the corresponding single zzso for zzso zzso of zzso which could decrease risks of driving the zzso deeper into zzso
