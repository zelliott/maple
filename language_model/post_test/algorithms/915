A new approach to surveillance of zzso zzso the major cardiovascular zzso is described using an zzso which depends primarily on zzso data, using evidence of chest pain and positive zzso findings as supplemental information zzso This approach is evaluated with respect to zzso by minimally trained zzso cost, and zzso with respect to different hospital systems as well as changes in diagnostic techniques and/or zzso over zzso Two pilot studies demonstrate that, in comparison to more traditional approaches, the new surveillance system provides at least a 50% reduction in cost, is highly zzso over different hospital systems, and zzso is resilient to changes in diagnostic procedures or zzso The more general zzso of such an innovative surveillance approach to other disease zzso in which one reliable procedure contains most of the diagnostic information, is discussed with particular reference to zzso
