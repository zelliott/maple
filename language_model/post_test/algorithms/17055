We investigated the frequency and extent of changes in heart position and geometry independent of body motion during stress zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Following an exercise treadmill test, patients had a zzso zzso acquisition which was followed immediately by a zzso image acquisition for 1 zzso with the camera position identical to the first view of the zzso zzso Point sources were placed on the body to monitor patient zzso zzso motion was assessed by an approach which zzso a zzso technique applied to cardiac count profiles along the horizontal and vertical directions from the first view of the zzso study and the zzso zzso A large percentage zzso of cases had some degree of horizontal or vertical zzso Pixel shifts in cardiac position of zzso or zzso 2 zzso (12 zzso occurred in zzso of zzso In 37% of patients who moved the cardiac motion was consistent with simple translation of the heart and thus amenable to correction using proposed zzso zzso zzso The peak heart rate achieved during stress and the ratio of the heart rate immediately before zzso acquisition to the resting heart rate were determined to be independent zzso of patient motion during zzso zzso zzso motion changes were minimal at zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso of zzso The implications of these findings for the accuracy of zzso zzso require further zzso
