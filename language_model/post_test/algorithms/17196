The importance of zzso analysis of a zzso binding phenomenon through zzso equation has been widely zzso While several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are available for determining the binding parameters of zzso zzso phenomenon, there is no easily available software covering the class of phenomena described by the McGhee and von zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 86, zzso zzso We report here zzso software, zzso developed in zzso zzso for the zzso zzso of binding parameters of a zzso zzso interaction doing best fit to the experimental data on the basis of McGhee and von zzso equation for a zzso zzso zzso A new zzso has also been incorporated to guide the process of least square analysis and subsequent determination of binding zzso
