We present the first zzso that selects zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso experiments on a large zzso For example, zzso for human genes can be found within 50 zzso This becomes possible by using the longest common zzso as a specificity measure for candidate zzso We present an zzso based on a zzso array with additional information that is efficient both in terms of memory usage and running time to rank all candidate zzso according to their zzso We also introduce the concept of master sequences to describe the sequences from which zzso are to be zzso zzso such as zzso zzso melting temperature, and zzso are incorporated in the master sequence at a zzso stage and thus kept separate from the main selection zzso As a result, custom zzso can now be designed for any zzso zzso just as the technology for on-site chip synthesis is becoming increasingly zzso
