A zzso zzso method, previously applied to radiation hybrid data, is applied to the zzso Analysis Workshop 12 simulated family data to assess the zzso feasibility for ordering dense markers that have been typed in a set of zzso of three or more zzso zzso is based on minimizing the total number of crossovers zzso in a set of zzso where zzso origin can be assigned to each specific zzso but locus order is zzso It is shown that, for average locus spacing of about 2 zzso and a set of 300 to 600 zzso locus ordering can be reliably determined for sets of at least 50 zzso However, in the absence of crossovers between some pairs zzso of zzso no unique order can be identified and sets of orders that are equally likely will be zzso The method presented can be used to obtain reasonable sets of ordered zzso that can then be used by other methods to refine the statistical confidence of the locus zzso
