The design of zzso for surgical training and planning poses a great number of technical zzso Therefore the focus of systems and zzso was mostly on the more restricted minimal invasive zzso This paper tackles the more general problem of open surgery and presents efficient solutions to several of the main zzso In addition to an improved collision detection scheme for computing interactions with even heavily moving zzso a zzso system for the zzso rendering has been realized in order to reach the best performance of zzso zzso A flexible way of modeling complex surgical tools out of simple basic components is zzso In order to achieve a realistic and at the same time fast relaxation of the zzso the approach of explicit finite elements has been substantially zzso We are able to demonstrate realistic simulations of interactive open surgery zzso
