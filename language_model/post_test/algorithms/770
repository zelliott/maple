Identification of functional zzso factor binding sites in zzso sequences is notoriously zzso The critical problem is the low specificity of predictions, which directly reflects the low target specificity of DNA binding zzso To overcome the noise produced in predictions of individual binding sites, a new generation of zzso achieves better zzso specificity by focusing on locally dense clusters of binding zzso zzso is a leading method for binding site cluster detection that determines the significance of observed sites while correcting for local compositional bias of zzso The zzso is highly flexible, applying any set of input binding models to the analysis of a zzso zzso From the user's perspective, a key feature of the system is that no reference data sets of regulatory sequences from zzso genes are required to train the zzso The output from zzso consists of an ordered list of sequence segments that contain potential regulatory zzso We have chosen the features in zzso such that sequence and zzso retrieval is highly zzso resulting in a web server that is intuitive to zzso zzso is available at zzso
