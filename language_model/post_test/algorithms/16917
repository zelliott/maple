zzso flow based image registration operates under the assumption that the mass of the zzso material is zzso from one image to the zzso Depending on how the mass conservation assumption is zzso the performance of existing zzso flow methods is limited by factors such as image quality, noise, large magnitude zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso Median of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso method introduced here is based on a zzso zzso least squares, zzso flow model that describes the displacement of a single zzso that lends itself to a simple grid search zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inaccurate grid search point matches, corresponding to erroneous local zzso of the zzso zzso flow model, are removed by a novel filtering approach based on least median of squares fitting and the forward search zzso detection zzso The spatial accuracy of the method is measured using ten zzso CT image sets and large samples of expert determined landmarks (available at zzso The zzso method produces an average error within the zzso error on eight of the ten cases, indicating that the method is capable of achieving a high spatial accuracy for zzso CT zzso
