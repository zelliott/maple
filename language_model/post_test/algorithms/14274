A new sequence is presented that combines zzso zzso zzso zzso with fast spiral chemical shift zzso It allows the acquisition of zzso zzso without line splitting with a minimum total measurement time of less than 5 zzso for a field of view of 24 zzso and a nominal zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed with 17 zzso zzso steps in zzso zzso zzso and an average echo time of 151 zzso which was determined by simulating the zzso experiment for the spin systems of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso total zzso zzso compounds zzso zzso and zzso were detected in a healthy volunteer with no or only minor baseline zzso within 14 zzso on a 3 T MR zzso
