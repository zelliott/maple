zzso zzso signals have been used for comparative study of two groups of healthy zzso from any cardiovascular risk zzso and diabetic (as cardiovascular disease risk zzso subjects in the zzso range zzso zzso The peripheral blood zzso were recorded simultaneously from right and left index fingers for 90 zzso zzso have been modeled with the zzso model in the zzso of 300 sample points with 100 sample points overlap between zzso Model parameters of three segments based on the highest fitness zzso than zzso of modeled segments were retained for each zzso zzso principal component analysis zzso was applied to the parameters of retained segments to eliminate the existing correlation among parameters and provide zzso zzso The first principal component zzso zzso zzso of zzso was significantly greater in diabetic than in control groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso In addition the seventh principal zzso which contains zzso of the data zzso was significantly lower in diabetic than in control groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso Finally, linear discrimination analysis zzso was used to zzso the zzso The zzso was done using the robust zzso zzso zzso could zzso the subjects with zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity while the male subjects resulted in a highly acceptable result for the sensitivity zzso The present study showed that zzso signals can be used for vascular function assessment and may find further application for detection of vascular changes before onset of clinical zzso
