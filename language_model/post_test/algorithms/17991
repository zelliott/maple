De zzso prediction of protein structures, the prediction of structures from zzso acid sequences which are not similar to those of zzso resolved structures, has been one of the major challenges in molecular zzso In this paper, we develop a new method of de zzso zzso which combines the zzso assembly method and the simulation of physical folding process: structures which have consistently assembled fragments are zzso searched by zzso molecular dynamics of zzso zzso The zzso test shows that the prediction is improved when the candidate structures are zzso by an zzso derived score zzso
