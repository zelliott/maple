To validate a new index, the zzso index zzso based on area change in a zzso view and length reduction in the horizontal zzso view, which is used to quickly zzso detect right zzso with an abnormal ejection fraction zzso during a cardiac zzso zzso zzso can be used to avoid a complete zzso of the zzso contours of normal right zzso 

Sixty patients zzso zzso were zzso included to zzso the zzso formula by zzso of the area under the zzso zzso and zzso thresholds were chosen to obtain zzso zzso Another 340 patients zzso zzso were zzso recruited to test zzso capacity to detect right zzso zzso with an abnormal zzso zzso 

The appropriate threshold to obtain zzso sensitivity in group A was zzso In group B, with the zzso zzso zzso yielded a sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso zzso would have saved zzso of the RV studies in our population, without inducing any diagnostic zzso zzso and zzso correlation was good zzso zzso 

zzso combines two simple RV measures, and brings significant improvement in zzso efficiency by zzso zzso that require a complete zzso 

zzso Assessment of right zzso ejection fraction zzso with zzso is time zzso zzso zzso zzso is not always assessed during cardiac zzso zzso zzso index zzso allows rapid detection of abnormal zzso during cardiac zzso zzso zzso saves one third of the operator zzso zzso Every cardiac zzso could include zzso assessment by means of zzso
