zzso zzso approaches for zzso assignment is a three steps process: zzso identify all putative zzso between the zzso zzso identify gene anchors and zzso link anchors to identify best gene matches given their order and zzso In this article, we engineer two methods to improve two important aspects of this pipeline zzso steps zzso and zzso First, computing sequence similarity data zzso zzso is a zzso intensive task for large sequence sets, creating a bottleneck in the zzso assignment zzso We have designed a fast and highly zzso zzso method zzso based on zzso counts to rapidly compare all pairs of sequences in a large protein sequence set to identify putative zzso Second, availability of complex zzso containing large gene families with prevalence of complex evolutionary events, such as zzso has made the task of assigning zzso and zzso zzso Here, we have developed an zzso graph matching strategy where at each iteration the best gene assignments are identified resulting in a set of zzso and zzso We find that the zzso zzso is faster than existing methods and maintains high accuracy in identifying similar zzso The zzso graph matching strategy also showed high accuracy in identifying complex gene zzso zzso zzso available from zzso zzso complete zzso assignment pipeline (including zzso and the zzso graph matching zzso available from zzso
