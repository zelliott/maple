zzso by mechanical analysis of bones and zzso systems, a zzso zzso law describing the zzso mechanical zzso of both cortical and zzso bone in zzso (not zzso zzso is zzso The proposed model which mathematical zzso is established within the framework of generalized standard materials accounts for three distinct material evolution modes where elastic, plastic and damage aspects are closely zzso The zzso elasticity of bone is described by a zzso model and distinct damage zzso in tension and zzso by a zzso generalized Hill zzso The plastic criterion is based on the intact elastic compliance zzso The zzso applies three distinct projections based on the relationship between the internal variables and zzso Their respective consistent zzso operators are zzso zzso resolutions of several boundary value problems and a zzso application are presented to illustrate the potential of the zzso model and demonstrate the expected zzso convergence of the zzso
