The zzso method is frequently used to determine the mechanical work performed by a system, for instance, when analyzing muscles or describing the work balance at the joint zzso While for these examples usually only one-dimensional movements are investigated, for two- or three-dimensional movements, such as leg function during walking and running, the zzso has to be zzso In this paper, we present an zzso derivation that extends the zzso method to two-dimensional zzso plane zzso Three effects contribute to the mechanical work of the zzso zzso forces directed along the leg zzso zzso forces acting perpendicular to the leg zzso and zzso a shift of the center of pressure zzso during zzso These three contributors to the mechanical work performed can be interpreted as three general tasks of the zzso To demonstrate the new zzso method, we analyzed experimental data on zzso running and zzso The results indicate that the proposed new generalized zzso concept is suitable for describing the overall mechanical work performed on the zzso during stance with energy consistent net work zzso Depending on the type of zzso specific contributions of each work term were found that characterize leg function during zzso
