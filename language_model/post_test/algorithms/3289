A framework for detecting zzso zzso activity in broadband time series is zzso First, a zzso zzso mode is extracted from a broadband zzso Second, it is tested whether the extracted mode is significantly different from zzso filtered noise, modeled as a linear zzso process possibly passed through a zzso zzso zzso If a zzso zzso mode is positively zzso it can be further analyzed using zzso approaches such as phase synchronization zzso For linear processes standard approaches, such as the zzso analysis, are more zzso The method is illustrated in a zzso example and applied to analyze zzso obtained human electroencephalogram time series from a sleeping zzso
