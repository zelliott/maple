The deterministic limit of a zzso zzso model in the sequence space approach is zzso zzso are identified with zzso zzso zzso is zzso as a zzso process, fitness functions are of zzso type, where the fitness of a sequence is determined by the zzso distances to a number of zzso zzso Using a maximum principle for the population mean fitness in zzso the error threshold phenomenon is studied for zzso zzso fitness functions with small numbers of zzso Different from previous investigations of the zzso model, the system shows error threshold zzso not for all fitness functions, but only for certain zzso zzso
