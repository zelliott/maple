To identify zzso markers that are zzso of progressive zzso disease in patients with early zzso arthritis zzso 

The study involved an inception cohort of 111 consecutive patients with zzso and a disease duration of zzso zzso Patients were treated according to an zzso designed to avoid zzso of mild disease and to accelerate treatment in patients who had continuous disease zzso Patients were evaluated for the presence of clinical and laboratory disease activity zzso We determined the frequency of zzso T cells by flow zzso zzso gene zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso and 26 zzso zzso in 19 candidate genes by multiplex zzso and zzso to an immobilized probe zzso Data were analyzed using zzso odds models to identify zzso markers zzso of zzso progression over 2 years on serial zzso zzso 

After 2 years, disease activity in zzso of the cohort was controlled by treatment with zzso and zzso zzso Forty-eight percent of the patients did not develop zzso Older age, presence of zzso at zzso presence of zzso factor, zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso particularly zzso for zzso were zzso zzso of zzso zzso Promising novel markers were the frequency of zzso T cells as an zzso zzso and a zzso in the zzso zzso 

Clinical disease activity in patients with early zzso can frequently be controlled with zzso treatment, but this is not always sufficient to prevent new zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso age, and zzso markers are zzso of poor zzso zzso A zzso in the zzso gene may identify patients who have a low risk of zzso zzso
