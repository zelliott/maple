A genetic zzso zzso is presented for the zzso of zzso and zzso prostate zzso The end points for zzso are incorporated in an objective function of zzso zzso utility zzso As an application of the zzso the minimum zzso total source strength required to deliver a given dose was correlated with the average dimension for prostate implants carried out under the current template and seed spacing zzso zzso improvements in quality were observed, in terms of both the minimum peripheral dose and tumor cell surviving zzso when zzso implants were compared to the corresponding zzso implants for given target zzso In addition, zzso simulation of source zzso indicates that the zzso and zzso advantages of zzso zzso can tolerate a reasonable level of seed placement uncertainties observed zzso In zzso the zzso application provides an automated design strategy for prostate implant planning, and at the same time zzso the potential for systematic zzso of a set of end points that can sustain practical zzso
