Changes in cerebral blood flow zzso zzso pulse zzso reflect zzso changes of the cerebral zzso based on the theory of pulse wave zzso zzso zzso pulse onset relative to zzso zzso is zzso However, it introduces zzso factors of zzso origins for characterizing the cerebral zzso This study introduces an approach to reducing zzso influences on zzso zzso This correction approach is based on modeling the relationship between zzso zzso and systemic zzso blood pressure zzso pulse zzso It is tested using an existing data set of zzso and zzso from 14 normal subjects undergoing pressure cuff tests under both zzso and acute hypoxic zzso The results show that the proposed zzso zzso correction approach produces a more accurate measure of cerebral vascular changes, with an improved positive correlation between zzso zzso and the zzso zzso time series, for example, correlation zzso increased from zzso to zzso for zzso cuff zzso traces at zzso In conclusion, this study suggests that zzso of systemic zzso zzso improves zzso zzso zzso which in turn improve the characterization of cerebral vascular zzso
