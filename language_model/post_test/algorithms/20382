In earlier work, my colleagues and I described a zzso model for genetic data from zzso composed of affected zzso and their zzso This model allows detection of and discrimination between effects of an inherited zzso versus effects of the maternal zzso which presumably would be zzso by prenatal zzso Like the transmission zzso test zzso the zzso test zzso based on this model is not sensitive to associations that are due to genetic zzso When used as a method for testing for linkage zzso the zzso can be regarded as an alternative to the zzso When one or both parents are missing, the resulting incomplete zzso must be discarded to ensure zzso of the zzso thereby sacrificing zzso By contrast, when the problem is set in a likelihood zzso the zzso zzso allows the incomplete zzso to contribute their information to the zzso without zzso of the zzso zzso demonstrate that much of the lost statistical power can be recaptured by means of this zzso zzso In fact, power is reasonably good even when no zzso is zzso example, when a study is designed to include only mothers of zzso Information from siblings also can be incorporated to further improve the statistical power when genetic data from parents or zzso are zzso
