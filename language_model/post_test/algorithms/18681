This work describes a study of zzso and zzso zzso complexes of the symmetrical, zzso bridging zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and structural characterization by zzso of the zzso complexes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso complexes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso complex zzso zzso are zzso along with the crystal structures of 4, 6, and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso complexes feature a zzso zzso band around 600 zzso The coordination of a second metal zzso results in a dramatic red shift of the zzso band to beyond 700 zzso zzso and square wave zzso of the zzso complexes exhibit one zzso zzso zzso as well as several zzso reduction zzso The first two zzso attributed to reduction of the zzso zzso are substantially zzso shifted compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consistent with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso The zzso complexes exhibit two zzso zzso zzso zzso waves, despite the chemical zzso of the two metal centers, indicating a significant zzso interaction zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso quantum yield, and lifetime zzso at room temperature in zzso zzso have shown that the complexes exhibit zzso zzso which occurs in the zzso between 950 and zzso zzso The zzso complex 8 exhibits zzso only from the zzso fragment, the intensity of which is less than zzso of that observed in the corresponding zzso complex zzso no zzso from the zzso unit is observed, and an zzso zzso constant of zzso zzso or zzso 3 zzso zzso is zzso The nature of the zzso process is briefly zzso
