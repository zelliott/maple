The objective of this study was to determine the relationship of length to zzso tube zzso size in newborns and to use this relationship to develop a tool for predicting zzso zzso The study, a prospective zzso and validation of a zzso model, took place in the zzso intensive care units zzso in two urban teaching zzso zzso zzso zzso derivation set - 39 zzso zzso admitted to the zzso zzso set - 69 zzso newborns from the same zzso Leak percentages were measured in zzso zzso where the actual zzso size did not correlate with the zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso weight, and leak zzso A zzso tape was developed using the derivation set and published zzso zzso The accuracy of the tape was validated on a separate set of zzso The average relative difference between zzso weight and actual weight was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and was evenly distributed throughout all the weight zzso The tape predicted actual zzso size in zzso of cases zzso zzso and was correct within 1 tube size zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The only error in prediction of zzso size was in zzso zzso weight zzso were tested on 100 subjects and predicted actual weight within zzso in zzso of zzso We concluded that length is an accurate predictor of zzso size and weight in term and zzso newborns and may be useful in situations in which weights are zzso such as emergency zzso
