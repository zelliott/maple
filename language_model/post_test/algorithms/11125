The chemical property of zzso groups that renders them indispensable to zzso is their zzso zzso mechanical studies undertaken here to understand the effect of point zzso on zzso zzso channels illustrate zzso how zzso polarization also contributes to zzso zzso zzso channels regulate zzso salt concentration zzso by transporting zzso zzso zzso One of the zzso binding sites in the channel's selectivity zzso the zzso site, also binds zzso zzso which blocks zzso zzso This zzso property of zzso zzso has been vital in understanding zzso zzso In most zzso the zzso site is composed of four zzso zzso zzso The K channels that carry zzso instead of zzso are significantly less susceptible to zzso block and have reduced zzso We find that these differences can be explained by the lower zzso of zzso compared with zzso because zzso carries one less zzso zzso group than zzso A zzso substitution in the zzso site reduces its zzso which, in turn, reduces zzso binding by several zzso per zzso Although the loss in binding affinity is high for zzso the loss in zzso binding affinity is also significant zzso which reduces channel zzso These results zzso in general, how zzso function can rely on the polarization induced by zzso groups, especially those that are zzso to charged zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
