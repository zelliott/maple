As a major class of zzso zzso long zzso zzso zzso have been implicated in various critical biological zzso zzso researches have linked zzso and zzso of zzso to a variety of human disorders and zzso However, to date, only a few human zzso have been associated with zzso zzso it is very important to develop a zzso method to globally predict potential associated diseases for human zzso In this paper, we developed a zzso framework to accomplish this by combining human zzso expression profiles, gene expression profiles, and human zzso gene zzso zzso this framework to available human long zzso zzso zzso zzso expression data, we showed that the framework has reliable zzso As a result, for zzso zzso the zzso of our zzso is zzso and the prediction accuracy is about zzso This study will be helpful for identifying novel zzso for human diseases, which will help in understanding the roles of zzso in human diseases and facilitate zzso The corresponding codes for our method and the predicted results are all available at zzso
