zzso speech enhancement methods that use trained zzso of speech and noise zzso provide good performance even under zzso noise zzso A zzso however, is their high zzso zzso For every pair of speech and noise zzso zzso a likelihood score indicating how well that pair matches the observation is zzso In this paper, a method that identifies and performs only relevant likelihood zzso by imposing a zzso structure on the speech zzso is zzso The performance of the proposed method is shown to be close to that of the original scheme but at a significantly lower zzso zzso
