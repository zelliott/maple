The zzso and kinetic properties of a series of zzso and organic zzso zzso were determined using zzso rate zzso and zzso zzso zzso are compared to calculated oxygen balance zzso The decomposition of the majority of the compounds is zzso Data indicate the need for cooling during the storage and transport for some materials zzso Although no overall zzso relationship could be established because of the diversity of molecular zzso zzso a combination of decomposition and zzso energy data provides a means for hazard and risk zzso
