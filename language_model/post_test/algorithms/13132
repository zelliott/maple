This work is devoted to the prediction of a series of 208 structurally diverse zzso zzso using the Random Forest zzso based on the zzso molecular zzso The zzso model was established and identified as a robust predictor of the experimental zzso values, producing good external zzso zzso of zzso a standard error of prediction zzso of zzso for an external prediction set of 51 zzso which were not used in the development of zzso zzso By using the zzso built-in measure of the relative importance of the zzso an important zzso number of group donor atoms for zzso (with N and zzso been identified to play a crucial role in zzso zzso zzso We hope that the developed zzso model will be helpful in the screening and prediction of novel unknown zzso zzso zzso
