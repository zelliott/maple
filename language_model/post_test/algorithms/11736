The objective of this study was to conduct an zzso zzso study zzso the evolution of two- and three-dimensional geometrical zzso zzso The evolution of regional and local zzso zzso was analyzed between two zzso visits on a cohort of 28 adolescents with progressive idiopathic zzso Mean age at the first visit was zzso zzso zzso years old and averaged time zzso between two assessments reached zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained from zzso reconstructed zzso The initial zzso Cobb angle was on average zzso degrees zzso zzso degrees zzso 14 zzso zzso The evolution of spinal zzso and zzso zzso was assessed statistically in terms of zzso absolute variations, and of zzso variations zzso with respect to time and to the increase in Cobb zzso At the zzso level, zzso zzso increased with curve severity in a relatively consistent pattern for most zzso patients and zzso rotation mainly increased towards curve zzso with zzso zzso No consistent evolution was associated with the angular orientation of the maximum zzso zzso zzso changes zzso and zzso were observed in important zzso zzso of this study challenge the existence of a typical zzso evolution pattern and suggest that the zzso evolution is quite variable and zzso
