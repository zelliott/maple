We present the DNA zzso zzso a novel zzso for real-time acquisition and zzso of images from fluorescent DNA zzso A white light beam illuminates the target sample allowing the images grabbing on a high sensibility and zzso zzso device camera zzso zzso This zzso device permits to acquire images faster and of higher quality than the traditional zzso The DNA zzso images are processed to recognize the DNA chip spots, to analyze their superficial distribution on the glass slide and to evaluate their geometric and intensity zzso zzso form conventional techniques, the spots analysis is fully automated and the zzso does not require any additional information about the DNA zzso zzso The zzso hardware and software architecture is zzso zzso results are shown from experiments performed on real DNA zzso
