One of the applications of zzso and zzso is the design of improved drug administration zzso In its simplest form only global zzso of the response to a zzso are used to obtain the dosing scheme leading to the desired drug plasma concentration zzso For further improvement on these simple administration regimens it is necessary to have additional information on the drug zzso in terms of either a disposition equation model or a zzso zzso Due to the high zzso of individual responses to the same dosing scheme the design of drug administration regimens is often based on the average zzso parameters of a data base of zzso Although widely used, this approach presents some problems since the average disposition equation model and the average zzso model are inconsistent between themselves and with the global zzso of the average zzso In this paper methods and zzso for the zzso of alternative population zzso models are developed and their use is illustrated using zzso data available from the zzso
