By combining a zzso procedure with the program zzso a program zzso has been developed which processes zzso images that do not contain serial zzso images and may have a few or no full zzso After each image was processed by zzso the zzso and structure zzso of the reflections were estimated using a zzso method to refine the zzso factor, the relative temperature factor, the mosaic spread, cell constants, and zzso angles for each independent zzso The zzso calculation significantly improved the quality of the zzso from the reflections obtained by the initial zzso calculation and crystal structural refinement confirmed the zzso The zzso calculation indicated that the reflection of the present crystal had a rocking curve that was steeper at the middle of the profile and more gradual at both ends of the profile than that assumed in the program zzso
