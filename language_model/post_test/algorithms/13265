We introduce an integration of dynamic light scattering zzso and optical zzso zzso zzso for high-resolution zzso imaging of zzso diffusion and zzso zzso analyzes fluctuations in light scattered by particles to measure diffusion or flow of the zzso and zzso uses zzso gating to collect light only scattered from a small volume for high-resolution structural zzso zzso the integration of zzso and zzso enables high-resolution zzso imaging of diffusion and zzso We derived a theory under the assumption that zzso and moving particles are mixed within the zzso resolution volume and the moving particles can exhibit either zzso or zzso zzso Based on this theory, we developed a fitting zzso to estimate dynamic parameters including the zzso and zzso zzso and the diffusion zzso We validated zzso zzso of diffusion and flow through zzso simulations and phantom zzso As an example application, we performed zzso imaging of the living animal brain, resulting in zzso maps of the absolute and zzso zzso the diffusion zzso and the zzso of zzso
