The conventional linear integral zzso methods may lead to important errors in the determination of the zzso energy when the significant variation of the zzso energy with the conversion degree zzso zzso proposed an advanced zzso zzso method, which allows the zzso energy to be accurately determined zzso J zzso zzso 2001, 22, zzso However, the use of the zzso method raises the problem of the time-consuming zzso without zzso A new zzso linear integral zzso method for the determination of the zzso energy as a function of the conversion degree has been proposed, which is capable of providing valid values of the zzso energy even if the latter strongly varies with the conversion zzso Also, the new method leads to the correct values of the zzso energy in much less time than the zzso zzso The application of the new method is illustrated by processing of theoretically simulated data of a strongly varying zzso energy zzso
