zzso release zzso zzso zzso zzso is widely used over 110 countries worldwide, and is among the drugs recommended as a zzso therapy in the major guidelines for the management of zzso In search for a most suitable controlled release zzso of zzso we investigated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso affecting the release rate of zzso from zzso zzso were investigated, focusing on the internal structure of the zzso The effects of the zzso zzso the zzso dimensions zzso and the microscopic zzso zzso zzso of the zzso on the release rate of zzso were investigated on the basis of the linear least square equation as well as the zzso zzso A relation between the actual value and predicted value based on the linear least square equation exhibited a fairly good zzso zzso Furthermore, the release rate of zzso was represented based on the zzso equation including the values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso It is likely that the release rate of zzso from zzso zzso is mainly controlled by zzso and zzso but zzso zzso was less zzso
