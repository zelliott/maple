In this paper, we propose a practical and efficient method for finding the globally optimal solution to the problem of determining the pose of an zzso We present a framework that allows us to use zzso zzso and zzso zzso for solving various types of pose and registration problems involving zzso (or zzso zzso Traditional methods such as the zzso closest point zzso or bundle adjustment methods for camera pose may get trapped in local zzso due to the zzso of the corresponding zzso zzso Our approach of solving the mathematical zzso problems guarantees global zzso The zzso scheme is based on ideas from global zzso theory, in particular convex zzso in combination with zzso zzso We provide a zzso optimal zzso and demonstrate good performance on both synthetic and real zzso We also give examples of where traditional methods fail due to the local zzso zzso
