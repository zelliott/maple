We present a highly accurate zzso system for zzso zzso called zzso It combines in an unprecedented manner the flexibility of generalized hidden zzso models zzso with the zzso power of modern machine learning methods, such as Support zzso Machines zzso Its excellent performance was proved in an objective competition based on the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Considering the average of sensitivity and zzso the zzso version of zzso exhibited the best prediction performance on zzso zzso and transcript level for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The fully developed version shows superior performance in 10 out of 12 evaluation criteria compared with the other participating gene zzso including zzso and zzso An in-depth analysis of zzso zzso predictions revealed that approximately zzso predicted genes were not contained in the current zzso zzso Testing a subset of 57 of these genes by zzso and sequencing, we confirmed expression for 24 zzso of zzso zzso missed 300 zzso zzso out of which 205 were zzso zzso testing of 24 of these genes resulted in a success rate of merely zzso These findings suggest that even the gene catalog of a well-studied zzso such as zzso zzso can be substantially improved by zzso zzso We also provide gene predictions for the four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Comparing the resulting zzso among these organisms and to the known protein universe, we identified many zzso gene zzso In a quality assessment of several available zzso for these zzso we find that zzso predictions are most zzso
