Hidden zzso models zzso are frequently used to zzso zzso data, where the same set of subjects is repeatedly observed over zzso In this context, several sources of zzso may arise at individual and/or time level, which affect the hidden process, that is, the transition probabilities between the hidden zzso In this paper, we propose the use of a finite mixture of zzso zzso zzso to face the zzso zzso The zzso of the model allows us to take into account observed sources of zzso by means of a proper set of zzso time and/or individual dependent, explaining the variations in the transition zzso Moreover, we handle the zzso sources of zzso at the individual level, due to, for example, omitted zzso by introducing a random term with a discrete zzso The resulting model is a finite mixture of zzso that can be used to zzso individuals according to their dynamic zzso or to estimate a mixed zzso without any assumption regarding the distribution of the random term following the zzso maximum likelihood zzso We test the effectiveness of the proposal through a simulation study and an application to real data on alcohol zzso
