The zzso equation derived from the zzso law principle at zzso state via mathematical induction and deduction for different reaction sequences and mechanisms and different types of zzso has been shown to be the unified theory for the zzso zzso Hill zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso It is shown that dose and effect are interchangeable via defined zzso This general equation for the single drug effect has been extended to the multiple drug effect equation for zzso zzso These equations provide the theoretical basis for the combination index zzso equation that allows quantitative determination of drug zzso where zzso zzso 1, zzso 1, and zzso 1 indicate zzso additive effect, and zzso zzso Based on these zzso computer software has been developed to allow automated simulation of zzso and antagonism at all dose or effect zzso It displays the zzso curve, zzso plot, combination index plot, zzso zzso index plot, and zzso for in zzso or in zzso zzso This theoretical development, experimental design, and computerized data analysis have facilitated zzso analysis for single drug evaluation or zzso and radiation risk assessment, as well as for drug or other entity combinations in a vast field of disciplines of biomedical zzso In this review, selected examples of applications are given, and zzso examples of experimental designs and real data analysis are also zzso The merging of the zzso law principle with mathematical zzso has been proven to be a unique and effective scientific method for general theory zzso The zzso principle and its zzso law based computer software are gaining increased applications in biomedical sciences, from how to effectively evaluate a single compound or entity to how to zzso use multiple drugs or zzso in combination zzso
