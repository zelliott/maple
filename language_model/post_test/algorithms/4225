A zzso model zzso phantom containing zzso with various in zzso zzso plaque compositions was constructed and zzso on a clinical 64 slice zzso zzso system using 80 and 120 zzso settings and two other zzso zzso systems at 80 zzso zzso of the simulated zzso plaque solutions in the images was evaluated by six zzso The effective doses of the protocols employed were estimated using phantom zzso zzso placed at identical zzso The zzso system allowed reduction in effective dose in comparison with the conventional zzso system for imaging of the carotid plaque zzso without degrading image zzso The zzso dose was less than zzso with a mean dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso using two measuring techniques zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso The image quality analysis showed no significant differences in the zzso zzso zzso of the best performing zzso zzso clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso using a zzso U zzso zzso indicate that zzso zzso may produce comparable zzso resolution for zzso representations of soft plaque types with respect to zzso zzso This study suggests that the utility of low zzso CT techniques for evaluating carotid vulnerable zzso plaque merits further zzso
