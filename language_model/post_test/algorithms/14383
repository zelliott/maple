This paper proposes a novel method for the extraction and zzso of individual motor unit action zzso zzso from intramuscular zzso zzso 

The proposed method automatically detects the number of template zzso clusters and zzso them into normal, zzso or zzso It consists of three steps: zzso zzso of zzso zzso recordings, zzso zzso detection and zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The approach has been validated using a zzso of zzso recordings and an zzso collection of zzso The correct identification rate for zzso zzso is 93, 95 and zzso for normal, zzso and zzso zzso zzso percent of the superimposed zzso were correctly zzso The obtained accuracy for zzso zzso is about zzso 

The proposed method, apart from efficient zzso decomposition addresses automatic zzso zzso to zzso zzso or normal classes directly from raw zzso zzso
