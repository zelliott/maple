To assess the efficacy of zzso MR zzso zzso to evaluate early responses to zzso chemotherapy in breast cancer patients, as compared to that of the standardized zzso value zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This retrospective study included seven patients with breast cancer who had both zzso zzso MRS and zzso zzso zzso acquired before, zzso and after zzso zzso 

The averages of the zzso zzso integral value and peak zzso before chemotherapy were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Three cases became negative for both zzso and peak zzso after two cycles of chemotherapy, and one patient became negative before zzso In the remaining three patients, the zzso of both values paralleled the time course of chemotherapy zzso The difference between zzso and peak zzso before, zzso and after chemotherapy was r zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The reduction rate zzso of both values after chemotherapy was also correlated zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

A change in the zzso integral value is well correlated with that of peak zzso in the time course of zzso zzso thus, breast zzso MRS is thought to be an alternative to sequential zzso zzso
