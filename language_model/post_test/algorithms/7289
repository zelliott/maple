Traditional zzso zzso zzso detection methods, zzso the widely used general linear model zzso assume that the zzso zzso responses follow the zzso or zzso stimulus zzso Typically, these zzso zzso are performed zzso zzso and then are usually followed by statistical zzso Despite remarkable successes and wide adoption of these methods, it remains largely unknown how functional brain regions interact with each other within specific networks during task performance blocks and in the zzso In this paper, we present a novel zzso pipeline to statistically zzso and sparsely represent zzso functional interaction patterns within the working memory network during task performance and in the zzso Specifically, a collection of zzso interactions are zzso via the greedy zzso search zzso zzso for both task and baseline zzso In the next stage, an effective online dictionary learning zzso is zzso for sparse representation of the zzso zzso interaction zzso Application of this framework on a working memory zzso zzso data reveals interesting and meaningful zzso of the learned sparse dictionary atoms in task and baseline zzso In comparison with traditional zzso zzso detection and recent zzso functional connectivity analysis, our framework offers a new methodology for representation and exploration of zzso functional activities in the zzso
