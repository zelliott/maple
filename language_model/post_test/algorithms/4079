In this paper, we look at the acceleration of zzso coupled zzso using the graphics processing unit zzso Specifically, we port to the zzso a number of components of zzso zzso finite element code developed for simulating zzso zzso On the basis of a criterion of zzso cost, we implemented on the zzso the zzso and zzso solution steps for the zzso problem and the zzso and residual evaluation for the mechanics zzso Performance of the zzso zzso is then compared with single core CPU zzso execution as well as zzso CPU zzso zzso with equivalent theoretical zzso zzso show that for a human scale left zzso mesh, zzso acceleration of the zzso problem provided zzso of zzso with SC and zzso times compared with zzso for the solution of the zzso zzso zzso of up to zzso with SC and zzso with zzso was also observed for the zzso zzso Using the same human zzso the zzso zzso of mechanics zzso zzso provided zzso of up to zzso with SC and zzso with zzso
