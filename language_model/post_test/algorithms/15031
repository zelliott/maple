A technique is proposed to compensate for the slice zzso artifact and improve the zzso ratio zzso of zzso zzso This method is composed of two zzso mapping of the internal zzso and design of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso pulse is designed with its phase response as the negative of the product of a chosen echo time and the zzso internal zzso profile in a specified region of interest zzso The designed zzso pulse can zzso the spin zzso at a selected echo time and therefore effectively recover the signal loss due to both linear and zzso internal zzso zzso zzso and application of the method are described in this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
