The highly fluorescent zzso zzso and zzso were employed to detect zzso calcium responses in zzso zzso zzso following zzso of cell surface zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso was rapid and showed a strong preference for the very transient phase of the response which has been identified as a zzso of zzso zzso zzso had significantly less effect on the longer lasting increase in zzso free calcium which involved an influx of zzso zzso Whole zzso were used as a check on zzso which were monitored at a single zzso in order to eliminate changes that were not zzso It was found that such changes could arise from the association of zzso or its zzso zzso with zzso zzso since this affected their zzso zzso In addition, the loading of resting cells with dye zzso was shown to be greatly enhanced by the inclusion of a small amount of the zzso zzso zzso in the incubation zzso A spectral analysis of labeled cells showed that the extent of zzso of zzso dye was improved as well as the rate of zzso by zzso
