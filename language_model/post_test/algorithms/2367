The most widely used zzso test for deep vein zzso is zzso zzso imaging of the lower zzso The best evaluated of the zzso approaches are ascending contrast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso Economic evaluation is aimed at helping decision makers to reach their goal of maximizing the health of the population served, subject to the available zzso 

The data that provided the basis for this cost effectiveness analysis were derived from a prospective study of approximately 500 patients referred to a regional zzso program with a first episode of clinically suspected deep vein zzso The application of cost effectiveness analysis to the diagnosis of deep vein zzso is readily accomplished using cost zzso This cost effectiveness technique makes it possible to rank the diagnostic approaches from zzso to zzso with the best approach defined as that which accomplishes the desired health effect at minimum zzso zzso zzso zzso may be defined in this context as the number or proportion of patients with deep vein zzso correctly identified by objective testing or, the number or proportion in whom treatment was correctly zzso 

Clinical diagnosis is cost zzso zzso Canadian, zzso zzso zzso diagnosis using zzso testing was the most cost zzso zzso zzso zzso is more costly zzso Canadian, zzso zzso than serial zzso zzso zzso Canadian, zzso zzso Combined zzso zzso and serial zzso zzso offers a less costly strategy zzso Canadian, zzso zzso than serial zzso zzso 

zzso testing is zzso zzso testing is zzso avoiding unnecessary hospital zzso zzso testing is the most cost zzso The most widely used test, serial zzso zzso is less cost effective than serial zzso zzso The combined approach of initial zzso zzso followed by serial zzso zzso combines the advantage of an initial ultrasound image with less costly serial zzso zzso
