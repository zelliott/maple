A novel chaotic zzso zzso is presented and its zzso dynamics and zzso functions are zzso A set of paralleled N zzso accepts a common analog input and zzso a set of N chaotic zzso Three zzso which guarantee that the zzso can zzso the analog input into a zzso of the N chaotic zzso are zzso zzso a spike zzso of the summed zzso can mimic zzso of various zzso zzso the zzso do not zzso to each other and thus the summed zzso can have N times higher zzso resolution than each single zzso and zzso firing rates of the zzso can be adjusted by internal zzso The zzso are proven by using zzso zzso maps and are confirmed by zzso simulations as zzso Electronic circuit zzso methods of the paralleled zzso are also presented and typical paralleled zzso functions are confirmed by both experimental zzso and zzso zzso
