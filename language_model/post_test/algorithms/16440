The aim of the paper is the development of an accurate zzso model to zzso the current density flowing through the heart of a virtual human body, and induced by an external electric or magnetic zzso The model has been zzso validated and then applied to investigate the main characteristics of the heart magnetic zzso This has been carried out by comparing the current density induced in the cardiac region by an external magnetic pulse with the corresponding quantity due to the more traditional electric zzso zzso stimulation is studied because it offers some zzso in fact, compared with the electrical zzso this technique is zzso and might allow the stimulation of a dressed zzso The design constraint of the whole system is represented by the current density, whose zzso and intensity are a compromise between the strength of the magnetic induction field and the pulse rise zzso
