The aim of this study was to investigate a method which zzso the effects of geometric distortion on various zzso zzso used to determine zzso zzso such as zzso angle, zzso appraisal, AB plane angle, projections on the zzso plane, zzso horizontal zzso plane, the zzso zzso and the zzso line, in an attempt to zzso the correlation between zzso This was accomplished by zzso the Bolton 12-year zzso averaged template on a patient's tracing using zzso analysis and performing zzso while exchanging the patient's reference zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso FH plane, zzso plane, zzso plane, and zzso line) with those of the zzso The zzso zzso were then compared with their classic counterparts using correlation zzso The above zzso zzso classic and zzso were applied to 71 patients zzso zzso mean age zzso years, standard zzso zzso zzso years and 45 zzso mean age of zzso years, zzso zzso zzso zzso rank correlation zzso was calculated between the classic zzso and their zzso counterparts, resulting in a consistent increase in the correlation between the zzso zzso in comparison with the classic zzso This increase varied in absolute value from zzso to zzso All zzso zzso were highly correlated zzso zzso zzso absolute zzso Although correlation calculations do not represent a true measure of diagnostic performance, it is hoped that improving their correspondence zzso the possibility of the different tests agreeing on the patient's zzso zzso decreasing the possibility of zzso or even totally opposing diagnostic outcomes resulting from their application to zzso Class I, II, and III zzso
