The primary aim of this study was to determine whether zzso zzso therapy zzso treatment planning zzso zzso positions, zzso and strengths of the light sources to satisfy a given dose zzso can improve dose coverage to the prostate and the sparing of critical zzso relative to what can be achieved by the standard zzso zzso The zzso zzso and search procedures based on that zzso were tested for this zzso A phase I zzso zzso zzso zzso therapy protocol is ongoing at the University of zzso zzso for the prostate is performed with zzso zzso fibers of various lengths inserted perpendicular to a base plate to obtain zzso coverage by a zzso of parallel zzso The standard plan for the protocol uses sources of equal strength with equal spaced zzso zzso Uniform optical properties were zzso Our zzso produce plans that cover the prostate and spare the zzso and zzso with less zzso from the dose prescription than the standard zzso The zzso feasibility zzso is fast enough that changes to the treatment plan may be made in the operating room before and during zzso to zzso light zzso
