Long acquisition times are still a limitation for many applications of magnetic resonance imaging zzso specially in 3-D and dynamic zzso Several zzso reconstruction techniques have been proposed to overcome this zzso These techniques are based on acquiring less samples than specified by the zzso criterion and zzso the zzso data by using some sort of prior zzso Most of these reconstruction methods use prior information based on zzso of the zzso zzso of the images and therefore they are prone to introduce spatial or zzso zzso Instead of using the zzso zzso we propose to use information that allows us to sort the zzso of an image from darkest to zzso The set of order relations which sort the zzso of an image has been called intensity zzso The intensity order of an image can be estimated from zzso images, adjacent slices in zzso acquisitions, zzso correlation in dynamic sequences or from prior zzso Our technique for reconstruction using intensity order zzso consists of looking for an image that zzso the intensity order and zzso the zzso between the acquired and reconstructed zzso zzso show that TRIO can effectively reconstruct zzso cardiac MR images zzso factor of zzso zzso correctly the zzso evolution of the zzso Furthermore, TRIO is used as a second stage reconstruction after reconstructing with other techniques, zzso sliding window and zzso zzso to estimate the order zzso In all cases the images are improved by zzso
