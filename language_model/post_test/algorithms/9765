Diabetes zzso and zzso are common in chronically zzso zzso major patients, occurring in the second and third decades of zzso We zzso that pancreatic iron deposition would zzso cardiac iron zzso representing an environment favorable for zzso iron zzso To test this hypothesis, we examined pancreatic and cardiac iron in 131 zzso major patients over a zzso zzso zzso iron zzso zzso 50 zzso was detected in zzso of patients and pancreatic iron zzso zzso 28 zzso in zzso of zzso zzso and cardiac zzso were correlated zzso zzso zzso with significant pancreatic iron occurring nearly a decade earlier than cardiac zzso A pancreatic zzso less than 100 zzso was a powerful negative predictor of cardiac iron, and pancreatic zzso more than 100 zzso had a positive zzso value of more than zzso In serial analysis, changes in cardiac iron were correlated with changes in pancreatic iron zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but not liver iron zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso As a result, pancreatic zzso zzso offer important early recognition of zzso conditions suitable for future cardiac iron deposition and complementary information to liver and cardiac iron during zzso zzso zzso abdominal and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging examinations could significantly reduce costs, magnet time, and need for sedation in young zzso
