This paper presents an automatic zzso zzso for video frames captured by a zzso zzso that closely zzso depth zzso from a stereo zzso The frames are segmented into foreground and background layers that comprise a subject zzso and other objects and zzso The zzso produces correct zzso even in the presence of large background motion with a nearly stationary zzso This research makes three key zzso First, we introduce a novel motion zzso referred to as zzso inspired by research in object zzso Second, we propose zzso the zzso likelihood from the spatial context of zzso The zzso is efficiently learned by random zzso Third, we introduce a general zzso of zzso zzso that zzso both theoretical and experimental comparisons of several known zzso zzso and generates new zzso In our zzso zzso algorithm, diverse visual cues such as motion, motion context, color, contrast, and spatial zzso are fused by means of a conditional random field zzso zzso zzso is then achieved by zzso zzso zzso on many sequences of our zzso application demonstrate that our algorithm, which requires no zzso is effective in a variety of scenes, and the zzso results are comparable to those obtained by stereo zzso
