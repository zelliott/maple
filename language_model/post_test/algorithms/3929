zzso activity plays a pivotal role in zzso insulin zzso from pancreatic zzso Recent findings have shown that the zzso characteristics of human zzso differ from their zzso zzso We show that the zzso responses in human zzso to a range of zzso channels zzso are zzso In some cells, zzso of zzso zzso currents has no effect on action potential zzso while it increases the firing frequency dramatically in other zzso zzso channel block can sometimes reduce action potential zzso sometimes abolish electrical activity, and in some cells even change zzso electrical activity to rapid zzso We show that, in contrast to zzso zzso zzso zzso are not necessary for action potential generation, and, surprisingly, a zzso zzso zzso even zzso action potential zzso By including zzso and zzso dynamics in a previous mathematical model of electrical activity in human zzso we investigate the zzso and zzso zzso responses to zzso channel antagonists, and use our findings to obtain insight in previously published insulin zzso zzso Using our model we also study zzso signals, and simulate slow zzso by adding a zzso zzso component to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso responses in human zzso must be taken into account for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying insulin zzso in health and disease, and as shown here, the interdisciplinary combination of experiments and modeling increases our understanding of human zzso zzso
