This paper presents zzso methods to analyze zzso mass zzso data for quantitative comparison of peptides and zzso in zzso The methods are applied to identify candidate zzso in serum samples of zzso participants from zzso 73 zzso zzso zzso cases, 52 patients with chronic liver disease zzso consisting of zzso and zzso cases, and 78 population zzso Two complementary sample preparation methods were applied prior to generating mass zzso zzso low molecular weight zzso enrichment of each serum sample was carried out for zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were zzso released from proteins in each serum sample and zzso for zzso zzso of zzso A peak selection zzso was applied to identify the most useful zzso and zzso zzso for accurate detection of zzso cases from high-risk population of patients with zzso In addition to global zzso selected by the whole population based approach, where zzso labeled patients are treated as a single group, zzso zzso were identified by searching for zzso that are zzso abundant in a zzso of patients zzso The peak selection process was preceded by peak zzso where we eliminated zzso that have significant association with zzso such as age, zzso and viral infection based on the zzso and zzso zzso from population zzso The performance of the selected zzso and zzso zzso was evaluated in terms of their ability in detecting zzso cases from patients with zzso in a blinded validation set and through the zzso zzso Finally, we investigated the possibility of using both peptides and zzso in a panel to enhance the diagnostic capability of these candidate zzso Further evaluation is needed to examine the potential clinical utility of the candidate zzso and zzso markers identified in this zzso
