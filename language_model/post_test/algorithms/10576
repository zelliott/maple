We study two mechanisms for the formation of protein patterns near zzso of living cells by mathematical zzso zzso of protein zzso by zzso zzso interactions is contrasted with zzso due to a zzso zzso reaction cycle of proteins near the zzso While both processes lead eventually to quite similar patterns, their evolution occurs on very different length and time zzso zzso produces periodic protein patterns on a spatial scale below zzso zzso in a few seconds followed by extremely slow zzso whereas zzso results in a pattern wavelength comparable to the typical cell size of 100 zzso within a few minutes suggesting different biological functions for the two zzso
