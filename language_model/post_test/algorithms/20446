We present a model for zzso of the isolated zzso zzso sheep liver which allows examination of drug disposition by the intact zzso We studied the disposition of sodium zzso zzso in seven zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and compared the results with earlier data from the zzso fetal sheep liver zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 1994, 48, zzso zzso of zzso pressure, oxygen consumption, zzso ratio, zzso flow, and liver zzso indicated that the preparation was both viable and stable over a 2 h zzso zzso zzso was added to the zzso by constant infusion (30 zzso and the zzso zzso shunt zzso by injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso extraction ratio of zzso was zzso 56 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and clearance of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso We conclude that the isolated zzso zzso sheep liver is a useful experimental model which will facilitate the study of the zzso physiology and pharmacology of the zzso There is considerable maturation of the zzso zzso of zzso between the late fetal and early zzso periods in the zzso
