The zzso zzso operating zzso curve is the most commonly used statistical tool for describing the zzso accuracy of a diagnostic zzso Classical zzso of the zzso curve relies on data from a simple random sample from the target zzso In practice, zzso is often complicated due to not all subjects undergoing a definitive assessment of disease status zzso zzso of the zzso curve based on data only from subjects with verified disease status may be badly zzso In this work we investigate the properties of the doubly robust zzso method for zzso the zzso curve under zzso bias originally developed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso the area under the zzso zzso The DR method can be applied for continuous scaled tests and allows for a zzso process of selection to zzso We develop the zzso zzso distribution and examine its finite sample properties via a simulation zzso We exemplify the DR procedure for zzso of zzso zzso with data collected on patients undergoing electron beam computer zzso a diagnostic test for zzso of the zzso
