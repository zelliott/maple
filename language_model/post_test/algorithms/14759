We introduce an energy-efficient Rate zzso Media Access Control zzso zzso for zzso Wireless Sensor Networks zzso Previous research shows that the dynamic and zzso nature of wireless communications is one of the major challenges to reliable data delivery in zzso zzso achieves high link reliability in such situations by zzso trading off data rate for channel zzso The extra gain that can be achieved reduces the packet loss rate which contributes to reduced energy expenditure through a reduced numbers of zzso We achieve this at the expense of raw bit rate which generally far exceeds the zzso link zzso To minimize communication energy consumption, zzso selects the optimal data rate based on the estimated link quality at each data rate and an zzso model of the energy zzso Our model shows how the selected data rate depends on different channel conditions in order to minimize energy zzso We have implemented zzso in zzso for an zzso sensor platform (the zzso on top of a state-of-the-art zzso Media Access Control zzso zzso and evaluated its performance by comparing our zzso with the original zzso using both simulation and zzso
