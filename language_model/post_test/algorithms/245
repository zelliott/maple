We present a modulated zzso zzso method, which uses a train of zzso shaped zzso zzso separated by 180 degrees zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso efficiently zzso chemical shifts and zzso due to zzso differences, resulting in zzso high-resolution diffusion weighted zzso This allows for the simultaneous spectral characterization of the diffusion of several molecular species with different chemical zzso The technique is robust against zzso artifacts, field zzso and imperfections in the zzso generating zzso The feasibility of the technique is demonstrated by measuring the diffusion of water, oil, and zzso salt in a highly concentrated zzso zzso The diffusion of water and salt reveal precise information about the zzso size distribution below the zzso Common zzso size distribution explains both the data for water with finite long-range diffusion and the data for salt with negligible long-range zzso The results of water diffusion show that the technique is efficient in zzso the effects of molecular exchange between droplets and restricted diffusion within zzso The effects of water exchange suggest that droplets of different sizes are zzso distributed within the zzso
