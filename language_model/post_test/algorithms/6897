In this study we compared duplex zzso zzso conventional zzso and CT zzso for the evaluation of zzso zzso complications following zzso liver transplantation zzso 

CT zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and Volume zzso zzso was performed in 11 patients with zzso suspect of zzso artery zzso or zzso after routine duplex zzso zzso Eight patients underwent conventional zzso 

CT detected three out of four duplex zzso false zzso and confirmed the diagnostic suspect in four zzso In two cases it showed a shift of the blood flow towards the zzso artery with zzso zzso In one case a wrong delay rendered the study zzso In seven out of eight patients conventional zzso confirmed CT zzso zzso zzso The follow up of zzso zzso complications is now performed with duplex zzso zzso this technique has a satisfactory sensitivity and zzso but far from zzso Therefore in some patients the diagnosis of zzso obstruction might be delayed, with the risk of serious zzso in other cases with zzso false positive findings, useless zzso examinations are zzso In our experience CT zzso proved to be a precious zzso which might be included in the diagnostic zzso of zzso complications after zzso Particularly CT zzso seems to be suitable for the cases of zzso between clinical and duplex zzso findings, to improve the overall diagnostic zzso 

In our experience zzso proved to be accurate and satisfactory as a second step examination after zzso in the diagnostic zzso of adult zzso zzso zzso
