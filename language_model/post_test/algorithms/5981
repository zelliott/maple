zzso zzso zzso were fragmented in the zzso source to study the influence of zzso bases on zzso Several zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso base, zzso zzso or zzso zzso were zzso Low cone zzso fragmentation yields a loss of the zzso base with a preferential loss for the zzso base closer to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as a preferential loss of zzso over zzso Higher cone zzso produces backbone fragmentation with complementary zzso and zzso zzso close to the zzso zzso On the basis of these zzso we located the zzso base in the sequence for all of the zzso zzso
