zzso zzso perform sequential steps of zzso without zzso from their zzso zzso This mechanism is considered essential for efficient zzso zzso of zzso cellulose zzso zzso zzso but a theoretical framework for zzso zzso remains to be fully zzso In this paper, we suggest a deterministic kinetic model that relies on a zzso set of zzso reactions and a zzso zzso zzso It is shown that this approach is zzso in the sense that it leads to zzso simple expressions for the zzso rate, and only requires data from standard zzso techniques as experimental zzso Specifically, it is shown that the zzso reaction rate at steady state may be expressed by a zzso function related to the conventional zzso zzso The main difference is a zzso zzso zzso which represents the probability of the zzso zzso from the zzso strand before completing zzso sequential zzso steps, where zzso is the mean zzso number measured zzso Typical zzso zzso have high zzso zzso and therefore this probability is zzso This has significant kinetic zzso for example the zzso specific rate zzso for zzso zzso is much lower than the zzso rate constant zzso We discuss how relationships based on this theory may be used in both comparative and zzso analyses of zzso
