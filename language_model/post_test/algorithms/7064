This paper outlines an application of the theory of simulated zzso to molecular matching zzso Three cooling schedules are zzso zzso exponential and dynamic zzso The objective function is the sum of the elements of the difference distance zzso between the two molecules generated by continual zzso of one zzso zzso tests of the zzso have been performed on random coordinate data together with two related protein zzso zzso problems, inherent in the assignment of atom zzso are effectively overcome by simulated zzso The zzso outlined here can readily zzso molecular matching problems with 150 zzso
