zzso second order kinetic expressions of Ho, zzso and zzso zzso et zzso and Ritchie were fitted to the experimental kinetic data of zzso green onto activated carbon by zzso and linear zzso zzso method was found to be a better way of obtaining the parameters involved in the second order rate kinetic zzso Both linear and zzso zzso showed that the zzso and zzso and Ritchie's zzso second order model were the zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that both zzso et zzso and Ho have similar ideas on the zzso second order model but with different zzso The best fit of experimental data in Ho's zzso second order expression by linear and zzso zzso method showed that Ho zzso second order model was a better kinetic expression when compared to other zzso second order kinetic zzso The amount of dye zzso at zzso zzso was predicted from Ho zzso second order expression and were fitted to the zzso zzso and zzso Peterson expressions by both linear and zzso method to obtain the zzso zzso The best fitting zzso zzso was found to be the zzso and zzso Peterson zzso zzso Peterson is a special case of zzso when the constant g equals zzso
