To assess zzso salvage in acute ST segment zzso zzso zzso zzso by using zzso zzso 

zzso consecutive patients zzso zzso mean age 59 zzso 10 zzso with a first acute zzso underwent acute zzso coronary intervention with successful restoration of zzso grade 3 zzso zzso was performed 2 zzso 1 days after zzso on a standard zzso T MR Scanner that included a zzso free zzso zzso imaging for zzso function and an zzso fast low angle shot zzso 8 zzso TE 4 zzso zzso 25 degrees ) sequences for late zzso enhancement zzso following the injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso at risk zzso was zzso by the volume of zzso exhibiting zzso and/or impaired wall zzso The zzso salvage index zzso was calculated as the volume of the MR minus the volume of zzso divided by the volume of the zzso zzso therapy was rated successful with an ST zzso resolution zzso zzso or zzso and was considered inadequate below zzso 

zzso size zzso was 17 zzso zzso of zzso mass, the mean zzso was zzso zzso zzso and the zzso was zzso zzso zzso There was a good correlation between the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Thirty patients had an zzso below zzso and 14 patients had an zzso greater than zzso The zzso was greater in patients with a zzso resolution of more than zzso (12 zzso 11 zzso 6 zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

A simple MR zzso based upon the relationship of functional zzso which includes zzso stunning, to the extent of zzso zzso zzso is in accordance with zzso as a clinical marker of successful zzso in acute zzso zzso
