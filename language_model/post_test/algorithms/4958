In this work we studied the contents of zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso stability in various stages of industrial processing, due to the implication of these values on the quality of the final zzso The results of the zzso stability at different values of pH showed residual zzso activity at alkaline pH zzso zzso zzso and zzso and high stability at pH zzso These results show that pH treatment is not an efficient method to zzso the zzso zzso The presence of residual zzso activity in all steps of industrial processing was also verified, showing that zzso can change the quality of the pulp during zzso
