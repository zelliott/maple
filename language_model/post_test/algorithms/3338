The structure and work principle of an ultraviolet zzso counting imaging detector based on wedge and strip zzso with induction zzso mode are zzso Two methods of zzso the charge footprint size are zzso One way is theoretical calculation and zzso The physical course of electrons is simulated from the zzso plate output side to the zzso zzso The calculated results show that the final charge footprint size is sensitive to the thickness of ceramic and not sensitive to the charge footprint size on the zzso zzso The other way is experimental image zzso The final charge footprint size can be estimated according to the position where the light line of resolution board image begins to zzso Both methods show that the charge footprint size is sensitive to the ceramic zzso The two methods are simple and effective for zzso of charge footprint size of zzso counting imaging detector with induction zzso
