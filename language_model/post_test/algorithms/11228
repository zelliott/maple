zzso is one of the most important intellectual abilities of the human zzso Here we propose an efficient decision-making system which uses optical energy transfer between quantum dots zzso zzso by optical zzso interactions occurring at scales far below the wavelength of zzso The simulation results indicate that our system zzso the zzso rule, which is known as the zzso zzso for human decision-making zzso This suggests that we can produce a zzso which makes decisions efficiently and zzso by exploiting the intrinsic zzso dynamics involving zzso zzso by optical zzso zzso
