Data analysis often requires a zzso model approach, zzso the best model or models are selected from a well chosen set of candidate models and subsequent zzso zzso is zzso The selection of the model or models which are best supported by the data can be accomplished using various zzso The present work focuses on the comparison of two approaches namely the corrected zzso information criterion zzso and the zzso for sparse data sets, which are common in medical zzso The selection of the true model and the determination of relevant zzso parameters as the zzso the volume of distribution and the mean residence time are examined using zzso Carlo simulations with zzso zzso The data (N zzso 10 per zzso are generated from a sum of two zzso which parameters were determined by fitting to zzso data of zzso zzso zzso zzso in blood zzso Four different normal distributed zzso statistical errors zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The set of candidate models consists of sums of up to 3 zzso Comparisons with two different model set sizes were zzso All candidate models are fitted to the generated data and selected according to the zzso and the zzso Both selection criteria perform well for our zzso The selection frequency of functions of lower dimension increases zzso to the statistical error for both criteria, while for higher zzso the zzso tends to choose a model of lower dimension more frequently than the zzso In addition, the zzso fraction decreases zzso to the statistical error for both methods but selection frequency of function of higher dimension is larger using the zzso The choice of the adequate model set is important for the positive effect of model averaging concerning the bias and the zzso of the estimated zzso It is in general assumed and has been confirmed in this study that zzso zzso using the zzso has clear advantages over the zzso
