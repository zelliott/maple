This paper introduces a hedge operator based fuzzy divergence measure and its application in zzso of zzso in case of chronic zzso leukemia using light microscopic images of peripheral blood zzso The concept of modified discrimination measure is applied to develop the measure of divergence based on Shannon exponential zzso and zzso measure of zzso These two measures of divergence are compared with the existing zzso and validated by ground truth zzso Finally, it is found that hedge operator based divergence measure using zzso zzso achieves better zzso accuracy zzso zzso for normal and zzso for chronic zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso index has been performed to compare the segmented image with ground truth ones where it is found that that the proposed scheme leads to higher zzso index zzso for normal, zzso for chronic zzso zzso
