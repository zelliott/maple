This paper presents the semantic zzso architecture for generic indexing of multimedia zzso The semantic zzso extracts semantic concepts from video by exploring different paths through three consecutive analysis steps, which we derive from the observation that produced video is the result of an zzso zzso We exploit this zzso metaphor for zzso zzso The zzso starts with the content analysis zzso In this analysis step, we follow a zzso approach of indexing zzso The style analysis step is the second analysis zzso Here, we tackle the indexing problem by viewing a video from the perspective of zzso Finally, in the context analysis step, we view zzso in zzso The virtue of the semantic zzso is its ability to learn the best path of analysis steps on a zzso zzso To show the zzso of this novel indexing approach, we develop detectors for a lexicon of 32 concepts and we evaluate the semantic zzso against the 2004 zzso zzso video retrieval zzso using a news archive of 64 zzso Top ranking performance in the semantic concept detection task indicates the merit of the semantic zzso for generic indexing of multimedia zzso
