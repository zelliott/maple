In this paper, a zzso approach for heartbeat and zzso detection from an optical zzso signal is zzso zzso zzso is a sensitive device that detects physical changes of zzso length due to external zzso When in direct or indirect contact with human body zzso hidden in a bed zzso mechanical and acoustic activity of cardiac muscle and zzso reflect in the zzso zzso enabling entirely unobtrusive monitoring of heartbeat and zzso A novel, zzso zzso approach was developed for this zzso The first phase selects best performing combinations of detection methods on a training set of zzso The second phase applies the selected methods to test set of signals and zzso all the zzso of vital zzso The test set consisted of 14 subjects cycling an zzso until reaching their zzso heart zzso The following resting periods were analyzed showing high efficiency zzso zzso zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso zzso zzso and accuracy zzso absolute error of zzso intervals zzso zzso for heartbeat zzso and acceptable efficiency zzso zzso zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso zzso zzso and accuracy zzso absolute error of intervals between zzso events zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso
