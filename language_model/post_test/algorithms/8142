Biological networks are prone to internal zzso fluctuations and external zzso zzso represents a crucial property of these networks, which zzso the effects of internal fluctuations and external zzso In this paper biological networks are formulated as coupled zzso differential systems operating at different zzso under vanishing zzso In contrast to previous work viewing biological zzso uncertain systems as zzso to a known nominal linear system, the zzso biological system is modeled as zzso zzso to a known zzso idealized system and is represented by two zzso zzso In addition, conditions for the existence of a global uniform zzso of the zzso biological system are zzso By using an appropriate zzso function for the coupled system, a zzso upper bound for the fast zzso associated with the fast state is zzso The proposed robust system design principles are potentially zzso to robust zzso network zzso Finally, two examples of two important biological networks, a neural network and a gene regulatory network, are presented to illustrate the zzso of the developed theoretical zzso
