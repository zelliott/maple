The molecular basis of zzso A has been extensively studied over the last two decades, and this analysis of the factor VIII zzso gene has rendered it one of the most studied of all human zzso A wide range of different zzso types has been identified that includes the novel zzso zzso involving regions in zzso 1 and 22 of the zzso gene as well as many zzso types found in other genetic diseases, including large and small deletions and zzso and point zzso resulting in nonsense, zzso and zzso site zzso zzso zzso that develop in a proportion of patients with zzso A following replacement therapy are now known to correlate with zzso zzso type and zzso This correlation is demonstrated, and a potential zzso for predicting inhibitor development in newly diagnosed patients is zzso Many patients with mild zzso A have a zzso between the levels of zzso determined by the zzso and zzso zzso The molecular basis of the zzso is zzso This article thus highlights both the molecular basis of zzso and some of the additional information that can be gained from determination of the zzso responsible for zzso in affected zzso
