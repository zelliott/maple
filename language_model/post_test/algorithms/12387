A novel system combining acoustic wave zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso was developed for the study of zzso zzso reduction zzso by zzso zzso zzso gave information about the growth of zzso zzso and zzso zzso gave information about the concentration of zzso zzso zzso A combined system response model, for zzso zzso reduction zzso at lower initial zzso zzso zzso was derived and proved based on the novel zzso Taking into account the effect of bacterial growth on zzso zzso reduction, the new model successfully simulated zzso zzso zzso zzso By fitting zzso zzso reduction data toward the derived model, the kinetic parameters related to the process were zzso When the concentration of zzso was 10 g zzso the zzso reduction rate constant K zzso and the maximum specific zzso zzso reduction rate constant zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It was found that the combined system can provide zzso reliable, and two-dimensional kinetic information, and can be applied to study other biological zzso
