With the advent of zzso zzso experiments such as zzso of zzso proteins comes the need to zzso sets of proteins as an ensemble, as opposed to the traditional zzso zzso Although there are several publicly available tools that facilitate the analysis of protein sets, they do not display integrated results in an zzso image or do not allow the user to specify the proteins to be zzso 

We developed a novel zzso approach to zzso the zzso of sets of zzso As proof of principle, we zzso two sets of proteins identified in published protein array zzso The distance between any two proteins was measured as the graph similarity between their Gene zzso zzso zzso These distances were then clustered to highlight zzso of proteins sharing related GO zzso In the first set of proteins found to bind small zzso zzso of zzso we identified three zzso containing four or five proteins each that may help to zzso how zzso affects cell growth whereas the original authors chose only one novel protein from the array results for further zzso In a set of zzso zzso we identified zzso of proteins associated with different zzso structures that were not highlighted by the analysis performed in the original zzso 

By determining the distances between zzso our methodology reveals trends and enrichment of proteins of particular functions within zzso zzso at a higher sensitivity than zzso of zzso zzso In an era of increasingly complex zzso such tools will help in the zzso of new, testable hypotheses from zzso experimental zzso
