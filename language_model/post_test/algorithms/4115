A core problem in monitoring water quality of a river basin is identifying an optimal positioning of a limited number of zzso zzso Various zzso criteria have been suggested for this selection process in earlier zzso However, the search for sets of sampling sites that satisfy such criteria poses a challenging zzso problem, especially for a large zzso Here, we show that for particular types of objective functions, the zzso procedure can be dramatically simplified via an zzso with the zzso of Shannon zzso On this basis, we propose an efficient zzso that can easily determine the optimal location of water quality sampling sites in a river zzso The proposed zzso can be used zzso or in conjunction with a zzso zzso zzso such as a genetic zzso For the latter, the proposed zzso filters only competitive candidates and makes a contribution to reducing the problem size zzso The superior performance of the proposed method is demonstrated via its application to actual river networks examined in earlier studies, in which the proposed method determines more optimal solutions in a shorter zzso zzso The idea presented in this study can also be applied to other problems in which the objective function can be formulated in a similar functional zzso
