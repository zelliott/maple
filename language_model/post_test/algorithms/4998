zzso experimental design for a clinical trial involves specifying a utility function that models the purpose of the trial, in this case the selection of patients for a diagnostic zzso The best sample of patients is selected by maximizing expected zzso This zzso task poses difficulties due to a zzso discrete design space and, also, to an expected utility formula of high zzso A zzso optimal design method is feasible in this zzso In addition, two deterministic zzso that perform a systematic search over the design space are developed to address the zzso zzso
