zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso alcohols and the linear alcohol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were tested in a zzso sludge zzso system to assess their zzso zzso and to predict levels of free alcohol derived from zzso zzso in treated zzso zzso rates for primary zzso were similar for all alcohols zzso zzso and were used to predict removal under typical treatment zzso zzso zzso of fatty alcohols ranged from zzso to zzso consistent with published field zzso During the zzso of the zzso zzso lower than expected levels of fatty alcohol based upon the assumption that zzso occurs through central zzso were zzso Rather than fatty zzso the major zzso were polar materials resulting from omega zzso of the zzso chain prior to or concurrent with central zzso The amounts of free fatty alcohols that were formed from zzso in zzso and escape into zzso were negligible due both to their rapid degradation and to the finding that formation of free alcohol through central zzso is only a minor degradation zzso in activated zzso
