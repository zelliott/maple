zzso zzso made from cast zzso zzso zzso suffer from zzso of the zzso spring zzso With similar devices made from Type 4 gold zzso the zzso members are considered zzso zzso of the combined zzso and strength properties of the zzso show that the lower zzso of elasticity of the gold doubles its overall effectiveness in spring members such as zzso zzso zzso To match this, the strength of zzso zzso zzso must be zzso Since this appears unlikely, improvement to the design of the spring members is the only way to rectify this zzso zzso zzso arms are required to have adequate elasticity to deflect out of the zzso zzso adequate zzso to produce retention and adequate strength to resist accidental zzso Current designs have no published rational basis to meet these requirements, and appear far from zzso An analysis of the forces applying to zzso arms and design for uniform stress along the arm produced a shape which differs substantially from the currently used zzso zzso The zzso dimensions are related to the angular distance from the tip of the zzso A theoretical comparison of the difference between the theoretical and current designs cannot be made as the current design for tapered zzso is not zzso It is proposed that improved performance over present zzso designs can be obtained by using zzso of the derived zzso However, the manufacture of zzso of the required complex shape and variable size is zzso and the next best alternative of zzso of constant cross section along their length was zzso zzso calculations for this form showed that the loss of zzso in using a zzso of constant cross section instead of the ideal was only 23 per zzso It is proposed that zzso of constant cross section along their zzso with a thickness chosen according to the size of the tooth used for the zzso will present a significant improvement in zzso zzso Further, it will provide a systematic method of selecting zzso thickness which is not presently zzso
