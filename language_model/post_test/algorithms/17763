When applied to zzso zzso data, zzso curve resolution methods, in particular alternating least squares zzso make it possible to calculate the concentration profiles and the zzso of all species involved in the reaction of curing zzso zzso In this paper, the model reaction between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was studied at 95 degrees zzso A zzso spectrum was recorded every five minutes throughout the zzso reaction zzso The data display rank zzso This problem was overcome by zzso additional information to the system in the form of known zzso of some zzso The recovered zzso and concentration profiles zzso reproduced the experimental zzso In this way, zzso of the zzso associated with the experimental zzso was zzso A value of zzso was obtained for lack of fit while the similarity zzso r between the zzso recovered and the zzso corresponding to the three pure species involved in the reaction were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The maximum and minimum limits associated with the ALS solutions were zzso which made it possible to limit to a considerable extent the ambiguity that is characteristic of these curve resolution zzso
