A modified version of zzso maximum likelihood zzso zzso using a zzso relaxation zzso for noise suppression, or dynamic zzso zzso has been zzso The aim of this study was to assess the capability of zzso reconstruction for quantitative zzso brain zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso healthy volunteers were studied using a zzso PET zzso The PET study included 3 sequential PET scans for zzso zzso and H zzso zzso zzso First, the number of main zzso (N zzso in zzso was zzso in relation to image convergence and statistical image zzso To estimate the statistical zzso of reconstructed images on a zzso basis, a zzso zzso method was applied using zzso PET zzso Once the optimal N zzso was determined, statistical image noise and quantitative zzso zzso cerebral blood flow zzso cerebral blood volume zzso cerebral zzso rate of oxygen zzso and oxygen extraction fraction zzso were compared between zzso and conventional zzso zzso images were zzso so that their spatial resolutions were matched with zzso images with a zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Based on the count recovery data, N zzso zzso 3 was determined as an optimal zzso for zzso PET zzso The zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso reconstruction resulted in less statistical noise, especially in a zzso region compared to zzso zzso of quantitative values between zzso and zzso was zzso For zzso images, average gray matter values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These values were comparable to corresponding values with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso reconstruction is zzso to quantitative zzso PET study and is superior to conventional zzso in terms of image zzso
