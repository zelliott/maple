The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the accuracy of the outcome in soft tissue prediction through use of a computer imaging system after zzso zzso zzso 

The study sample consisted of 30 adults who had undergone zzso surgery that included the zzso and zzso procedures and optional zzso to correct zzso zzso All the patients had lateral zzso zzso and profile photographs taken within 6 months before surgery and at least 6 months after zzso The computer-generated soft tissue image and the actual zzso profile were zzso The accuracy of this computer-generated profile image was zzso 

The results indicated that the zzso tip, soft tissue A point, and upper lip presented the least predicted errors in zzso zzso While the zzso tip presented higher zzso Lower lip prediction was found to be the least accurate region and it tended to be located anterior to the actual zzso In the vertical plane, most of the predictions revealed higher accuracy than those in the zzso zzso There were no statistically significant differences between the predictions of the groups with and those without zzso 

zzso image prediction was suitable for patient education and zzso However, efforts are still needed to improve the accuracy and reliability of the prediction program and to include the consideration of changes in soft tissue tension and muscle zzso The accuracy of this system in soft tissue prediction should be carefully zzso
