zzso structures, exemplified by the Venus zzso and slap zzso can transit between different zzso upon certain external zzso Here we study, through three-dimensional finite element simulations, the zzso behaviors in elastic plates in the absence of terminate zzso but with zzso in one (or zzso of the two composite zzso Both the scenarios with and without a given geometric zzso angle are investigated, the results of which are consistent with recent theoretical and experimental zzso This work can open ample venues for zzso designs of zzso structures with large zzso with applications in designing zzso zzso for biomedical research and zzso structures in aerospace zzso
