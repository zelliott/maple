We present zzso and penalized weighted zzso zzso reconstruction methods for zzso zzso zzso zzso where the weights are based on the zzso of a model error and depend on the unknown zzso The penalty function for the latter method is chosen so that certain a zzso information is zzso The zzso used to minimize the zzso objective functions guarantee zzso estimates and, zzso they zzso faster than the maximum likelihood zzso zzso zzso and produced images that had significantly better resolution and zzso Although simulations suggest that the proposed zzso are globally zzso a proof of convergence has not yet been zzso Nevertheless, we are able to show that the zzso method produces estimates that decrease the objective function zzso with increasing zzso
