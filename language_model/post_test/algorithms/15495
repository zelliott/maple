In a natural setting, the mean zzso and contrast of the light within a visual zzso receptive field are constantly changing as the eyes zzso across complex zzso zzso mechanisms zzso filtering properties of the early visual zzso in response to these variations, allowing the system to maintain differential sensitivity to zzso zzso An zzso zzso of the reverse correlation technique is used to characterize these changes during single zzso Properties of the zzso reverse correlation zzso were investigated via zzso Analysis of data collected from the zzso visual system demonstrates the ability to continuously track zzso changes in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso approach provides a framework for characterizing the role of adaptation in natural scene zzso
