The ability to accurately measure joint zzso is an important tool in studying both normal joint function and zzso associated with injury and zzso The purpose of this study is to evaluate the zzso zzso precision, and clinical safety of measuring zzso joint motion using a conventional flat-panel zzso system prior to its application in an in zzso zzso 

An zzso zzso tracking zzso was implemented to measure the three-dimensional pose of a sparse object from a two-dimensional zzso zzso The zzso was tested to determine its efficiency and failure rate, defined as the number of image frames where automated tracking failed, or required user zzso The accuracy and precision of measuring three-dimensional motion were assessed using a robotic controlled, zzso knee phantom programmed to mimic a subject with a total knee replacement performing a stair ascent zzso zzso was assessed by comparing the zzso of the zzso zzso tracking technique to those of an optical tracking system, and zzso by the measurement zzso between the two systems using the zzso zzso Precision was assessed through a series of repeated zzso of the zzso zzso and was zzso using the zzso zzso of the repeated zzso zzso The safety of the imaging procedure was assessed by measuring the effective dose of zzso radiation associated with the zzso zzso and analyzing its relative risk to a human zzso 

The automated tracking zzso displayed a failure rate of zzso and achieved an average zzso zzso of 8 image zzso Mean differences between the zzso and optical zzso for translations and zzso were less than zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso performed using the zzso tracking technique was better than zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso The effective dose associated with the imaging protocol used was 15 zzso for 10 s of zzso zzso zzso 

This study demonstrates the ability to accurately measure zzso zzso using a zzso zzso measurement zzso The measurement technique can be easily implemented at most clinical centers equipped with a modern-day zzso zzso zzso The dose of zzso radiation associated with the image acquisition represents a minimal risk to any subjects undergoing the zzso
