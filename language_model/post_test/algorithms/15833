The zzso plot zzso the zzso equation by zzso zzso zzso as a function of zzso zzso The plot is linear with a negative slope for a single class of zzso sites and zzso for multiple classes of zzso zzso zzso plots suffer from the limitation that there is no true independent zzso Experimental errors form a zzso distribution that rests neither parallel to the v axis nor zzso zzso but rather along a line emanating from the zzso zzso the range of s values produces increasingly large errors in the calculated zzso and zzso values, especially when multiple sites are zzso zzso data containing no error produces accurate zzso using either the zzso or zzso zzso With zzso and zzso zzso previously derived by fitting data with the statistically valid zzso zzso the zzso plot may be used accurately to display multiple site zzso
