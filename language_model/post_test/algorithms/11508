zzso networks are being used widely in medicine and other areas to create zzso models from zzso The statistical method that most closely parallels neural networks is zzso zzso This paper outlines some ways in which neural networks and zzso zzso are similar, shows how a small modification of zzso zzso can be used in the training of neural network models, and illustrates the use of this modification for variable selection and zzso model building with neural zzso
