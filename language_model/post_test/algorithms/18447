zzso muscle zzso zzso recovery from exercise has been fitted to a zzso zzso However, a number of experiments indicate that at low muscle zzso a zzso fit is not zzso We have performed in zzso zzso zzso of zzso during recovery from high-intensity intermittent exercise where muscle pH dropped below zzso (35 out of 40 zzso zzso of a statistical analysis showed that zzso should be rejected in 32 out of 40 zzso zzso a zzso Carlo simulation was carried out to test the quality of competing models used in the literature at low zzso zzso zzso and changing rate zzso resource zzso For each model, random zzso errors were imposed on simulated zzso recovery before performing the zzso A zzso function (three estimated zzso provided a correct zzso of parameters zzso normally distributed, poorly correlated zzso and, therefore, should be zzso When alternative functions are required, as in 32 cases out of 40 in the present study, it is demonstrated that a zzso function (five estimated zzso is not well suited zzso were zzso whereas a zzso function (four estimated zzso provides correct zzso of the zzso It is concluded that a zzso fit to zzso recovery is too sensitive to experimental errors to be zzso zzso and zzso relevance of zzso are zzso
