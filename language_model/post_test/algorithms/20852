We describe a method that uses direct zzso for measuring zzso zzso zzso relaxation rates to describe protein functional zzso Key advantages of method include the zzso zzso unique access to zzso groups that lack a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso that can derail zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso avoidance of artifacts caused by incomplete water zzso We demonstrate the approach for both backbone and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso results is supported by their agreement with those obtained from established zzso zzso zzso we show that the zzso approach provides access to the zzso groups of functionally important zzso that are invisible via zzso zzso methods because of zzso zzso the zzso method fills gaps inherent in zzso zzso relaxation experiments, and thus provides a novel complementary tool for zzso studies of zzso zzso
