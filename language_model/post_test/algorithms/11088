The aim of this study was to zzso the influence of image resolution on the apparent zzso zzso zzso of the magnetic resonance zzso signal in human zzso tissue in zzso and in phantom zzso 

This prospective study included 17 healthy volunteers zzso 32 zzso 8 years, 6 zzso zzso zzso maps were zzso via zzso fitting of zzso zzso zzso echo data measured at zzso T zzso time zzso 150 zzso flip angle zzso zzso minimum echo time zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso 16 zzso and at 3 T zzso 140 zzso zzso zzso minimum zzso 2 zzso zzso 5 zzso 16 zzso with varying nominal volumes of the zzso zzso (from zzso to zzso zzso For each zzso size, mean zzso values were zzso in regions of interest drawn in the left and right zzso zzso For data acquired using minimum zzso size, the mean zzso values were zzso over the zzso and zzso zzso The squared zzso of the zzso was zzso to evaluate the goodness of the zzso exponential zzso Six zzso MR images of a water phantom were acquired using a zzso zzso echo sequence zzso zzso zzso 108 zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso 20 zzso at 3 T after zzso adjustment and in the presence of a uniform background zzso of 40 zzso The nominal zzso size was varied in a range between 2 and zzso zzso 

Mean zzso values of zzso zzso zzso s zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso s zzso zzso zzso were zzso at zzso zzso At 3 zzso the zzso of the right zzso was zzso zzso zzso s and the cortical zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values were found over the left kidney at both field zzso zzso zzso values were observed for increasing zzso volume in both the water phantom and zzso tissue zzso At a constant slice thickness of 4 zzso the decrease in the zzso resolution from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso led to a maximum increase of the zzso zzso of zzso at zzso T and of zzso at 3 zzso zzso the slice thickness from 3 to 8 zzso at a constant zzso resolution of zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in a maximum increase of the zzso zzso of zzso at zzso T and of zzso at 3 zzso On the other hand, increasing the zzso size improved the goodness of the fit implied by the smaller zzso 

The phantom experiments and in zzso acquisitions of healthy zzso tissue documented a significant dependence of the apparent zzso relaxation rate on the spatial resolution of the MR imaging zzso In clinical practice, the zzso volume for the zzso of zzso zzso should be zzso in a compromise between minimizing the effects of zzso field zzso and maintaining a sufficiently high zzso ratio and goodness of zzso When comparing quantitative zzso among different publications, the influence of the spatial resolution should be taken into zzso
