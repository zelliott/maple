To evaluate the clinical and zzso factors of zzso We also tested the zzso zzso to compare the assessment of fracture risk in patients with primary or secondary zzso 

A prospective study carried out in a large sample of 123 men and 246 zzso All subjects had a zzso zzso and zzso examination of zzso and zzso zzso 

The prevalence of primary zzso zzso vs women zzso p zzso zzso and secondary zzso zzso vs women zzso p zzso zzso osteoporosis did not differ between the zzso In contrast, the prevalence of primary osteoporosis was significantly higher than secondary causes zzso zzso zzso in both men and zzso While women came to our attention for prevention of zzso men sought help because of clinical symptoms or zzso zzso such as zzso As evaluated by the zzso zzso patients with zzso do not need treatment, in agreement with Italian zzso The estimated risk of major zzso and hip fractures was significantly higher in women with secondary osteoporosis compared to men and also compared to women with primary zzso 

The prevalence of secondary osteoporosis in men is similar to that in women and it is less frequent than commonly zzso In patients with secondary zzso zzso calculation may provide an estimate of a particularly high fracture risk in patients whose bone fragility is usually attributed to another zzso
