We established a database of alternative zzso forms zzso for nine zzso zzso zzso are defined by comparing zzso zzso with zzso sequences using zzso taking known zzso information (from the zzso zzso zzso programs compare the ends of each aligned sequence pair for deletions or insertions in the zzso zzso which indicate the existence of alternative zzso forms with respect to the zzso zzso Moreover, we defined the alternative zzso profile of each human zzso It indicates the number of alternatively spliced zzso zzso the number of zzso spliced zzso zzso as well as the number of alternative zzso sites zzso per zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso coverage and can be used as a quality indicator for the predicted alternative zzso zzso The zzso value specifies the zzso propensity of a zzso Additionally, the tissue type information of all zzso was zzso This allows zzso restriction of the search to certain zzso and zzso calculation of the zzso zzso and zzso These scores are suitable for the zzso of tissue specificity of certain zzso Furthermore, the zzso stage and disease information of the zzso is zzso zzso is accessible at zzso
