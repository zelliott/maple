Bone is able to adapt itself to the mechanical and biological environment by changing its zzso and/or orientation of its internal zzso in a process known as bone zzso As a consequence, a change of bone mechanical properties is produced leading to an optimum structure, able to bear the external loads with the minimum zzso This adaptation is carried out by a zzso association of cells known as zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso old bone and sometimes produce new organic zzso zzso zzso that is later zzso This involves changes in zzso damage level zzso of zzso accumulated by zzso zzso and mineral zzso All of these features were taken into account in a previous model, but the whole process and therefore the resulting bone zzso zzso was considered zzso The model proposed zzso recognizing that bone is actually zzso tries to explain how zzso modify the zzso by changing their progressing zzso We check the potential of the model to predict the alignment of the bone zzso with the external loads in different zzso Then, the model is also applied to obtain the zzso and mechanical properties of the human zzso zzso under zzso loads with initial conditions corresponding to a heterogeneous, but otherwise zzso zzso
