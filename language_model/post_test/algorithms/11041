Although zzso gene zzso has been studied over decades, many aspects of the process remain poorly zzso zzso recent studies have revealed that zzso in many zzso are far more complex than previously zzso Genes in an zzso are often alternatively and zzso transcribed under different conditions, and a large portion of genes and zzso regions have zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso similar studies have not been conducted in the model zzso E coli zzso thus it is unknown whether or not the zzso possesses similar complex zzso Furthermore, although zzso becomes the major method for analyzing the complexity of zzso zzso it is still a challenging task to accurately assemble full length transcripts using short zzso zzso 

To fill these gaps, we have zzso the zzso of zzso coli zzso under different culture conditions and growth zzso using a highly specific directional zzso technique that can capture various types of transcripts in the bacterial cells, combined with a highly accurate and robust zzso and tool zzso zzso for assembling full length zzso We found that zzso of expressed zzso were zzso in their putative alternative forms, zzso genes had putative zzso transcripts and zzso zzso regions had putative zzso transcripts under different culture conditions and growth zzso 

As has been demonstrated in many other zzso zzso coli zzso also has a highly complex and dynamic zzso under different culture conditions and growth zzso Such complex and dynamic zzso might play important roles in the physiology of the zzso zzso is a highly accurate and robust zzso for assembling full-length transcripts in zzso using directional zzso short zzso
