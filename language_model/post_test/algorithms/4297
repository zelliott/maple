During zzso signaling molecules produced by one cell population direct gene regulatory changes in neighboring cells and influence their zzso fates and spatial zzso One of the earliest events in the development of the zzso zzso is the establishment of three germ zzso consisting of the zzso zzso and zzso Attempts to measure gene expression in zzso in different germ layers and cell types are typically complicated by the zzso of cell types within biological samples zzso zzso as the responses of individual cell types are zzso into an zzso observation of zzso cell zzso Here, we propose a novel method to zzso gene regulatory circuits from these zzso zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso using gene network zzso zzso and then test the ability of the zzso networks to predict spatial gene expression zzso 

We use two zzso models with different underlying assumptions that incorporate existing network information, an zzso model for zzso data and a zzso model for time series data, and contrast the performance of the two zzso We apply our method to both control and zzso zzso at multiple time points to reconstruct the core zzso and zzso regulatory zzso Those zzso networks are then used in combination with known zzso spatial expression patterns of a subset of genes to predict spatial expression patterns for other zzso Both models are able to predict spatial expression patterns for some of the core zzso and zzso zzso but interestingly of different gene subsets, suggesting that neither model is sufficient to zzso all of the spatial patterns, yet they are complementary for the patterns that they do zzso 

The presented methodology of gene network zzso combined with spatial pattern prediction provides an additional layer of validation to zzso the regulatory circuits controlling the zzso dynamics in embryonic zzso
