This paper is concerned with analyzing zzso stability zzso for a class of switched zzso systems with time delays under zzso zzso Due to the existence of switching zzso the switching of the controller does not coincide accurately with the switching of the zzso the zzso is stabilized with the matched zzso the zzso is zzso otherwise, the zzso may be not zzso We establish efficient condition, in terms of an upper bound on the switching zzso and in terms of a lower bound on the matched time intervals for the zzso and the zzso which ensures zzso for the whole switched zzso zzso Finally, an illustrative example is presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the zzso
