Failure mode and effects analysis zzso can be employed to reduce medical errors by identifying the risk ranking of the health care failure modes and taking priority action for safety zzso The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel approach of data zzso The approach is to integrate zzso and a mathematical zzso zzso analysis zzso with zzso zzso zzso in the field of data zzso The risk indexes zzso zzso and zzso of zzso are viewed as multiple zzso of zzso The practicality and usefulness of the proposed approach is illustrated by one case of health zzso Being a systematic approach for improving the service quality of health care, the approach can offer quantitative corrective information of risk indexes that thereafter reduce failure zzso For safety improvement, these new targets of the risk indexes could be used for management by zzso But zzso cannot provide quantitative corrective information of risk zzso The novel approach can surely overcome this chief shortcoming of zzso After combining zzso zzso model with zzso the two zzso of patient safety, medical cost zzso be together zzso
