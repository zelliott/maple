zzso zzso zzso occasionally develops in the chin following dental treatments, and evaluation of the involved nerve damage is important for zzso The zzso test is a method of evaluating nerve zzso but it is not widely used because its accuracy and reliability have not yet been zzso 

This study aimed to determine the accuracy and reliability of zzso measurement of the chin by using the zzso zzso 

The subjects were 19 healthy volunteers (7 women, 12 zzso aged 21 to 36 years zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso including the warm and cold zzso thresholds zzso and zzso zzso were measured on the chin, forehead, and neck by using a zzso To evaluate zzso zzso we measured the zzso thresholds on 3 different days zzso 1, 3, and zzso 

The zzso and zzso of the right chin were 460 zzso 165 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 133 zzso respectively, and those of the left chin were zzso zzso 112 zzso and zzso zzso 147 zzso zzso The zzso thresholds of the right and left chin were significantly correlated (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso measurement was more accurate in the case of the chin than in the case of the zzso The zzso thresholds measured over the 3 days varied very little zzso correlation zzso zzso indicating high zzso zzso 

The zzso technique is accurate and highly zzso zzso it may be a useful method for determining the zzso threshold of the zzso
