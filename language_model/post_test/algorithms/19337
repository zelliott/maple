In this paper, we derive a zzso zzso zzso for image reconstruction in X-ray zzso zzso zzso zzso when the zzso maps at the energies of the zzso zzso are zzso In zzso a sample is zzso with pencil beams of zzso zzso radiation that stimulate the zzso of zzso zzso from atoms of elements whose zzso or zzso lie below the energy of the stimulating zzso zzso and rotating the object through the beam allows for acquisition of a zzso zzso that can be used to reconstruct images of the distribution of the elements in zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso and it is thus necessary to correct for zzso of the incident and zzso zzso The zzso map is, however, generally known only at the stimulating beam energy and not at the energies of the various zzso zzso of zzso We have developed a zzso image reconstruction strategy for this zzso The approach zzso between updating the distribution of a given element and updating the zzso map for that zzso zzso zzso The approach is guaranteed to increase the penalized likelihood at each zzso Because the joint objective function is not necessarily zzso the approach may drive the solution to a local zzso To encourage the zzso to seek out a reasonable local zzso we include in the objective function a prior that encourages a relationship, based on physical considerations, between the zzso zzso map and the distribution of the element being zzso
