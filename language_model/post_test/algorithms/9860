In our attempt to fully automate the data acquisition and processing of zzso analysis of dissolved synthetic zzso phase correction was found to be the most challenging zzso Several approaches in literature were evaluated but none of these was found to be capable of phasing zzso zzso with sufficient zzso and high enough accuracy to fully eliminate intervention by a human zzso Step by step, aspects from the process of zzso phase correction were translated into mathematical concepts and zzso This included area zzso peak height zzso negative peak zzso and baseline zzso It was found that not one single approach would lead to acceptable results but that a combination of aspects was required, in line again with the process of manual phase zzso The combination of baseline zzso area zzso and negative area zzso was found to give the desired zzso The zzso was found to be zzso which means that the correct zzso order and first order phasing parameters are returned independent of the position of the starting point of the search in this zzso zzso When applied to high zzso zzso zzso the accuracy was such that the returned phasing parameters were within a distance of zzso degrees in the two zzso zzso space which resulted in an average error of zzso in calculated properties such as zzso composition and end zzso
