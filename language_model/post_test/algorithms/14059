Given the number of zzso and muscles in the human body, there are typically an infinite number of ways to perform the same action, a feature of directed movements known as zzso zzso The coordination and regulation of movements, Oxford, zzso zzso Here we present a new type of performance analysis based on the idea of a zzso zzso zzso We show how this mapping arises naturally from the idea of a goal function that theoretically defines a task and, in the presence of zzso determines the set of all possible task solution strategies, the goal equivalent zzso zzso The approach also yields estimates of the sensitivity of zzso errors to zzso zzso and we derive a general formula expressing the relationship between the zzso We apply these ideas to the analysis of redundant zzso data from subjects performing an aiming task carried out with and without a laser zzso It is shown that in order to characterize performance one must consider two factors in addition to the body zzso first, the degree of alignment between body zzso and the zzso and second, the sensitivity parameters that control the degree to which zzso body zzso is amplified at the zzso Both of these factors can be zzso using the estimated zzso zzso We show that the performance for three conditions involving two different nominal postures and two different sensory conditions zzso zzso can be classified by examining the zzso of data in an zzso sensitivity zzso plane associated with the zzso
