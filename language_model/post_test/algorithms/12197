Eleven different species of marine zzso were screened at different pH conditions on the basis of zzso zzso zzso Among the zzso a green zzso zzso zzso exhibited a highest zzso of zzso zzso at pH zzso and 100 zzso initial zzso zzso Further experiments were conducted to evaluate the zzso zzso potential of zzso zzso zzso zzso data obtained at different pH zzso and temperature zzso degrees zzso conditions were fitted well with zzso model followed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso A maximum zzso zzso capacity of zzso zzso was observed at optimum conditions of zzso zzso and 30 degrees C zzso according to the zzso zzso It was observed from the kinetic data that the zzso zzso process using zzso zzso follows zzso zzso Various zzso zzso such as zzso degrees , zzso degrees and zzso degrees were calculated and they indicated that the present system was a spontaneous and an zzso zzso The influence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso along with zzso present in the wastewater was also zzso zzso of zzso zzso from the zzso biomass were examined using zzso M zzso at different pH conditions in three zzso zzso A zzso column (2 zzso zzso and 35 zzso zzso was employed to evaluate the continuous zzso performance of zzso zzso The column experiments at different bed heights and flow rates revealed that the maximum zzso zzso was obtained at the highest bed height zzso zzso and the lowest flow rate (5 zzso zzso data were fitted well with Thomas, zzso and modified zzso zzso The column zzso studies were carried out for three zzso zzso A loss of zzso performance was observed during zzso cycles indicated by a shortened breakthrough time and a decreased zzso zzso
