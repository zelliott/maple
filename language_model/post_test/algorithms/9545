De zzso sequencing of peptides using tandem zzso is difficult due to missing zzso zzso in the zzso commonly obtained after zzso of zzso precursor zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso obtained in an zzso mass zzso upon electron transfer zzso zzso significantly increases the sequence coverage with diagnostic zzso In the de zzso sequencing zzso zzso presented here, a zzso approach was combined with an efficient mass decomposition zzso to exploit the complementary information contained in zzso and zzso zzso After zzso the parameters for the zzso on a zzso training data set obtained for peptides from nine known zzso the zzso zzso was applied to the de zzso sequencing of peptides derived from a whole protein extract of zzso zzso zzso To zzso pairs of zzso and zzso zzso contained in this data set, 675 fully correct sequences were zzso which represent a success rate of zzso It is shown that the zzso zzso yields significantly improved sequencing accuracy as compared with published approaches using only zzso zzso or combined zzso and zzso zzso
