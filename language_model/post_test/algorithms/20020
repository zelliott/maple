zzso studies suggest possible associations between zzso zzso and risk of zzso zzso However, whether zzso zzso are risk factors of zzso labor remains zzso Our goal was to evaluate the associations between zzso zzso and risk of zzso delivery by conducting a zzso of prospective cohort zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso databases were searched through January 2012 to identify studies that met zzso inclusion zzso Data were extracted using standardized zzso Either a zzso or a zzso model was used to calculate the overall combined relative ratio zzso with its corresponding zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to evaluate the relationship between zzso zzso and zzso delivery zzso zzso analyses were mainly performed by type of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Eleven prospective cohort studies involving 35 zzso participants were zzso The combined zzso of zzso delivery for pregnant women with zzso zzso compared with the reference group was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis yielded the combined zzso of zzso delivery for pregnant women with zzso compared with the reference group was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas pregnant women with positive zzso had no obvious risk of zzso delivery compared with the reference group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis restricted to studies excluding women with zzso dysfunction yielded similar zzso zzso analysis suggested that the status of exclusion or inclusion of women with zzso dysfunction was the major source of zzso in this zzso No evidence of publication bias was zzso 

Current evidence suggests that the presence of zzso in pregnant women significantly increases the risk of zzso zzso
