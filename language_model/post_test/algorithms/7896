Researchers are compelled to use zzso zzso sequence alignment tools instead of zzso zzso zzso due to space and time constraints, thereby losing significant amount of zzso zzso is a possible solution, though, till date, the zzso is restricted to database searching through database zzso In this paper, the power of a cluster computer is zzso for developing a parallel algorithm, zzso zzso first, the detection of regions that are potentially zzso followed by their actual zzso zzso is found to reduce the timing requirement by a factor of zzso 9 and 99 when used with the basic local alignment search tool zzso and zzso respectively, while keeping the sensitivity similar to the corresponding zzso For zzso related zzso which remain zzso by zzso zzso with SW can be zzso Again, for zzso zzso when SW becomes zzso intractable, the proposed method can still align them reasonably fast with high zzso
