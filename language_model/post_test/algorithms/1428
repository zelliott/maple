zzso zzso which consists of knowledge zzso and knowledge zzso often is considered the weakest link in the design of expert zzso Systems frequently are built on the knowledge of one expert and require extensive use of knowledge engineering techniques to elicit this knowledge from the zzso zzso zzso are a potential alternative method of knowledge acquisition for expert system zzso The aim of this pilot study was to examine the feasibility of applying machine learning techniques, specifically, zzso zzso to an existing research database as a method for knowledge zzso and knowledge representation for expert system zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso Trees zzso that generate decision trees were selected for the analysis using a data set of 201 patients hospitalized for zzso zzso zzso Neither C4 nor zzso produced trees with an accuracy that was significantly better than the baseline accuracy zzso for prediction of outcome in the data zzso The mean accuracy of the C4 decision trees was below baseline and the mean accuracy of zzso decision trees was zzso The experts found both zzso zzso but not adequate, and identified important missing predictor zzso The study findings suggest that additional research is needed to examine the appropriate use of zzso zzso in the transformation of nursing data and information into nursing zzso
