The efficacy of neural network zzso and partial zzso zzso methods is compared for the prediction of zzso chemical shifts for both zzso and zzso zzso using very large databases containing millions of chemical zzso The chemical structure description scheme used in this work is based on individual atoms rather than functional zzso The performances of each of the methods were zzso in a systematic manner described in this zzso Both of the methods, zzso and neural network zzso produce results of a very similar quality, but the zzso zzso is approximately zzso times zzso
