This paper presents an efficient technique for generating zzso triangular zzso from range zzso The zzso consists of two zzso First, a zzso number of points is zzso sampled from the given range zzso Those points are chosen by taking into account the surface shapes represented in the range image in such a way that points tend to group in areas of high zzso and to disperse in zzso zzso This selection process is done through a zzso inherently parallel zzso in order to gain zzso Once the image has been zzso the second stage applies a two and one zzso Delaunay zzso to obtain an initial triangular zzso To favor the preservation of surface and orientation zzso zzso and zzso zzso present in the original range image, the aforementioned triangular mesh is zzso modified by applying an efficient edge flipping zzso zzso with real range images show accurate triangular approximations of the given range images with low processing zzso
