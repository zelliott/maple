Previous studies by our group have demonstrated the feasibility of zzso imaging of zzso zzso to assess zzso and spatial changes in peripheral and zzso zzso In this study, we validate the zzso zzso and zzso of a new zzso zzso approach for serial quantitative evaluation of targeted zzso images of peripheral zzso in zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso mice subjected to zzso zzso 

Mice zzso zzso zzso underwent surgical zzso of the right zzso artery to induce unilateral zzso zzso One week after zzso a zzso zzso zzso targeted at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10) or a zzso negative control zzso zzso zzso 5) was injected, and 60 zzso later in zzso zzso images were zzso Mice were zzso tissue from zzso and zzso zzso was excised for zzso counting zzso of zzso activity, and zzso zzso ratio was zzso zzso images were analyzed using a new zzso approach that applies complex volumes of interest zzso derived from zzso of the zzso images onto zzso images to calculate zzso activity ratios for the zzso and zzso zzso Studies were zzso for determination of zzso and zzso zzso To compare zzso zzso zzso analysis with traditional manual zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso images, zzso images were summed onto a single zzso zzso zzso zzso were manually drawn and zzso ratio zzso Our new zzso analysis approach was applied to additional groups of mice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) zzso before and 1 and 4 zzso after zzso artery zzso 

Our new zzso approach for the evaluation of images of zzso zzso targeted with zzso demonstrated both a high zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an accuracy zzso zzso zzso for zzso of relative zzso activity relative to zzso Analysis of serial zzso images demonstrated a significant increase in relative zzso retention in the zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso mice at 1 zzso after zzso There was a significant zzso zzso decrease in zzso zzso in zzso mice relative to zzso animals, which was not observed at baseline or 4 zzso after zzso 

A new zzso analysis of images of zzso zzso targeted with zzso provides a zzso approach for serial quantitative evaluation of peripheral zzso The zzso and accuracy of this approach allows for quantitative analysis of serial targeted molecular images of lower zzso has zzso to other targeted zzso or PET zzso and may have implications for clinical imaging in patients with peripheral zzso zzso
