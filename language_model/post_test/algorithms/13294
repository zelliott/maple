The linear noise approximation zzso is a way of zzso the zzso time evolution of a zzso chemically reacting zzso It can be obtained either as the lowest order correction to the deterministic chemical reaction rate equation zzso in van zzso zzso expansion of the chemical master equation zzso or by zzso the zzso chemical zzso zzso However, neither of those zzso sheds much light on the zzso of the zzso The problematic character of the zzso expansion of the zzso for some chemical systems, the zzso of zzso the chemical zzso equation at two terms, and the sometimes poor agreement of the zzso with the solution of the zzso have all raised concerns about the zzso and usefulness of the zzso Here, the authors argue that these concerns can be resolved by viewing the zzso as an approximation of the chemical zzso equation zzso This view is already implicit in Gardiner's derivation of the zzso from the truncated zzso zzso as that equation is zzso equivalent to the zzso However, the zzso can be more convincingly derived in a way that does not involve either the truncated zzso equation or the zzso zzso This derivation shows that the zzso will be zzso at least for a limited span of time, for any system that is sufficiently close to the zzso zzso zzso The relatively easy derivation of the zzso from the zzso shows that the zzso shares the zzso conditions of zzso and it also suggests that what the zzso really gives us is a description of the initial departure of the zzso from the zzso as we back away from the zzso limit to a large but finite zzso The authors show that this approach to the zzso zzso its zzso zzso its limitations, and zzso an easier path to its zzso
