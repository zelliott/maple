We discuss in this paper the validation of an open source framework for the solution of problems arising in zzso The proposed framework is assessed through experimental data for fluid flow in an idealized medical device with rigid boundaries and a zzso benchmark for flow in zzso zzso The core of the framework is an open source parallel finite element library that features several zzso to solve both fluid and zzso interaction zzso The zzso results for the flow in the idealized medical device zzso of a zzso zzso a narrow zzso and a sudden zzso are in good quantitative agreement with the measured zzso components of the zzso and pressures for three different flow rates corresponding to zzso zzso and turbulent zzso We emphasize the crucial role played by the accuracy in performing zzso integration, mesh, and time step to match the zzso The zzso zzso interaction benchmark deals with the propagation of a pressure wave in a zzso elastic zzso The zzso pressure wave speed and frequency of zzso and the zzso zzso of the fluid on the tube axis are close to the values predicted by the zzso solution associated with the zzso A detailed account of the methods used for both benchmarks is zzso
