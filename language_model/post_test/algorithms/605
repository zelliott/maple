zzso reaction time, a simple model of zzso behavior, has been extensively investigated and its role in zzso elementary mental organization has been zzso However, little is known about the zzso mechanisms underlying zzso To zzso the zzso zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso signals were collected during a simple reaction task paradigm using simple cues consisting of different zzso and simple triggered movements executed by different zzso We hypothesized that a specific neural network that characterizes simple reaction time would be activated irrespective of the input zzso and output zzso Such a neural network was found in the right zzso superior zzso cortex, right zzso cortex, left zzso zzso cortex, zzso zzso and zzso frontal zzso The right zzso superior zzso zzso and right zzso zzso were also activated by different zzso sensory cues in the absence of zzso The shared neural network may play a role in sensory triggered zzso
