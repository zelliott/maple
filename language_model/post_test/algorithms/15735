The origin of the concept of a molecular complex between oxygen and zzso can be traced to zzso a century and a half zzso zzso zzso concepts of zzso provided a path to quantitative zzso of these zzso zzso Then, it took a quarter of a century before a proper format was prepared in terms of four zzso zzso and their associated binding zzso Since then, experimental zzso of these zzso binding zzso have consistently disclosed that successive values of zzso to zzso are zzso above those expected if every zzso of zzso maintained the same, zzso unchanging affinity for zzso An alternative analysis of the observed cooperative interactions has been obtained by zzso the roots of the zzso of the zzso binding equation and zzso an alternative binding equation containing zzso that for zzso are complex zzso These zzso have the dimensions and properties of equilibrium zzso They provide some novel zzso insights into zzso zzso
