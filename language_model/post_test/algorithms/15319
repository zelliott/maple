zzso zzso has been found to play a role in addictive behavior and is altered in psychiatric zzso zzso zzso zzso display two functionally distinct modes of zzso activity: low- and zzso zzso A puzzling feature of the zzso zzso is the following combination of its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso evokes zzso zzso whereas other zzso zzso stimuli zzso zzso zzso zzso or applied zzso block firing zzso We suggest a new zzso model that reproduces this combination of responses and explains recent experimental zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation evokes zzso firing and is more effective than zzso zzso zzso We further reduce the model to a single compartment and analyze the mechanism of the distinct zzso response to zzso zzso zzso other zzso Standard zzso analysis shows that the mechanism is based on a decrease in the zzso of calcium zzso The analysis confirms that the zzso zzso dependence provided by the zzso block of the zzso determine its capacity to elevate the firing zzso We further predict that the moderate slope of the zzso dependence plays the central role in the frequency zzso Additionally, we suggest a zzso current that sustains zzso firing or firing in the absence of zzso zzso zzso We predict that the zzso current zzso which has been observed in the zzso zzso is the best fit for this critical zzso We show that a zzso and a zzso zzso mechanisms form a structure of zzso negative feedback zzso in the zzso zzso The structure connects research of zzso zzso firing with zzso biology and determines common minimal models for investigation of zzso of zzso which is critical for normal function of both zzso
