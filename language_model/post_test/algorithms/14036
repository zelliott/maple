To address zzso sensitivity in lung zzso before and after radiation treatment zzso 

Twelve patients were each studied with two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scans and 3 patients each with one zzso PET zzso with zzso concentration zzso and maximum standard zzso value zzso zzso The zzso zzso sensitivity, g from zzso zzso and zzso index, zzso from zzso zzso zzso was calculated by linear zzso zzso zzso were corrected to zzso zzso with g zzso for a pure zzso effect, R zzso zzso 

There were no significant differences in zzso but zzso were different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso between two zzso PET zzso Linear zzso yielded g zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso The zzso after zzso for 3 patients without zzso with g correction were different by zzso zzso and + zzso suggesting varying effects from zzso R values were also different and mean R zzso zzso zzso was significantly different from zero zzso zzso zzso consistent with successful zzso as confirmed by zzso zzso 

The extra dimension of zzso sensitivity, g besides zzso incorporated in the combined zzso zzso may be a useful global zzso evaluation index even with differing zzso
