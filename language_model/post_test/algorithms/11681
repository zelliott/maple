We describe the development and evaluation of a simple slide rule that enables the bedside determination of the infusion rate for a particular target plasma concentration of zzso The infusion rate to reach this target concentration at time zzso is the product of the target zzso body weight, and a correction factor that depends on the time elapsed from the start of the initial zzso Our zzso infusion zzso slide rule, constructed along this principle, performs the zzso analogous to the principle of the classical slide rule, as addition of zzso We calculated the percentage zzso of the predicted concentration obtained by zzso versus predicted zzso obtained using the infusion rates determined from the zzso slide zzso The evaluation using zzso simulations zzso for a constant target concentration of 3 zzso zzso of zzso a mean zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the first 15 zzso and a mean zzso of zzso zzso zzso between 16 and 300 zzso The mean zzso after changing the target from 3 zzso zzso to 1, 2, 4, or 5 zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso This zzso zzso slide rule combines the advantages of minimal financial and technical cost with reasonable zzso
