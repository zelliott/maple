The structures of the same zzso determined under different conditions, provide clues toward understanding the role of structural changes in the zzso zzso zzso changes are usually identified as zzso motions, which are defined using a particular threshold of zzso such as domain zzso However, each protein actually zzso motions with various size and magnitude zzso In this study, to describe protein structural changes more zzso we propose a method based on zzso zzso This method enables the illustration of a wide range of protein motions in a single tree zzso named the zzso zzso We applied the method to 432 proteins exhibiting large structural changes and classified their Motion Trees in terms of the characteristic zzso of the zzso This zzso of the Motion Trees revealed clear relationships to their protein zzso zzso complex structural changes are significantly correlated with zzso protein zzso
