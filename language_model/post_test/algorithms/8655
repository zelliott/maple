This communication presents the development of an optimal digital zzso filter based on the Wiener theory for zzso the peak zzso of the left zzso pressure zzso zzso The magnitude zzso function is used to estimate the signal and noise zzso The peak zzso obtained by this method is found to be within zzso of the results obtained by a zzso zzso data fit and a zzso zzso
