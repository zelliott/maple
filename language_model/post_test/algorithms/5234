The ability to predict zzso binding modes without the aid of zzso experiments may accelerate and reduce the cost of drug discovery zzso Despite significant recent progress, virtual screening has not yet eliminated the need for zzso zzso For example, after a lead compound has been identified, the precise binding mode is still typically determined by experimental structural zzso This structural knowledge is then employed to guide lead zzso We present a step toward improving zzso binding mode prediction for a set of zzso known to interact with a common zzso There is thus an important distinction between this work and traditional virtual screening zzso Whereas traditional approaches attempt to identify binding zzso from a large database of available compounds, our approach aims to more accurately predict the binding mode for a set of zzso which are already known to bind the target zzso The approach is based on the hypothesis that each active site contains a set of interaction points which binding zzso tend to zzso In a more traditional context, these interaction points make up a zzso zzso Our zzso first performs traditional zzso zzso for each known zzso The ranked lists of candidate binding modes are then evaluated to identify a set of poses zzso zzso with respect to a zzso map generated from the same zzso We have extensively demonstrated the application of the zzso to four protein systems zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and attained predictions with an average zzso zzso zzso A for all tested zzso This represents a typical improvement of zzso A (up to zzso zzso over the zzso virtual zzso zzso Our zzso is independent of the zzso method and may significantly improve binding mode prediction of virtual zzso zzso
