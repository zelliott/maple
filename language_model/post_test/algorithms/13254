Instead of the conventionally atmospheric correction zzso using the zzso and shortwave infrared zzso an alternative practical atmospheric correction zzso using the ultraviolet wavelength for zzso waters (named zzso is proposed for satellite ocean color imagery in the zzso The principle of the zzso is based on the fact that the zzso zzso at ultraviolet zzso can be neglected as compared with that at the visible light zzso or even zzso zzso in most cases of highly zzso waters due to the strong zzso by detritus and colored dissolved organic zzso The zzso zzso uses the ultraviolet band to estimate the zzso scattering zzso zzso and it does not need any assumption of the water's optical zzso zzso by both of the simulated data and in zzso data show that the zzso is appropriate for the retrieval of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso can be used for all the current satellite ocean color sensors, and it is especially useful for those ocean color sensors lacking the shortwave infrared zzso Moreover, the zzso can be used for any zzso waters with negligible zzso zzso at ultraviolet zzso Based on our work, we recommend the future satellite ocean color remote sensors setting the ultraviolet band to perform the atmospheric correction in zzso zzso
