Changes in effective population size impinge on patterns of molecular zzso zzso slightly deleterious zzso are more likely to drift to fixation in smaller zzso which should typically also lead to an overall acceleration in the rates of zzso This prediction has been validated zzso for several zzso and island zzso Here, we first show that rate zzso are also evident in bacterial pathogens whose recent shifts in zzso make them prime candidates for reduced effective population size: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using closely related zzso to analyze substitution rate dynamics across six zzso independent bacterial zzso we demonstrate that relative rates of coding sequence evolution are biased according to gene functional zzso zzso genes that buffer against slightly deleterious zzso such as zzso experience stronger rate zzso than other functional classes at both zzso and synonymous zzso Although theory predicts altered evolutionary dynamics for buffer zzso in the face of accumulating deleterious zzso to observe even stronger rate zzso is zzso We suggest that buffer zzso experience elevated substitution rates because the zzso of deleterious zzso in the remainder of the zzso favors zzso zzso in zzso zzso the zzso is evident across zzso independent zzso supporting the hypothesis that reductions in effective population size predictably induce zzso responses in genes that buffer against slightly deleterious zzso
