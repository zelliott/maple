We describe an alternative method for scoring of the zzso alignment of two biological zzso Designed to overcome the bias due to the composition of the zzso it measures the distance (in standard zzso between the given alignment and the mean value of all other alignments that can be obtained by a zzso of either zzso We demonstrate that the standard zzso can be calculated zzso By concentrating upon the zzso case, the mean and standard zzso can be calculated exactly and in two steps, the first being zzso time, where N is the length of the zzso the second in a fixed number of calculations, zzso in zzso zzso We argue that this statistic is a more consistent measure than a similarity score based upon a standard scoring zzso Even in the zzso case, the statistic proves in many cases to be more accurate than the commonly used zzso zzso and zzso 1988) gapped zzso in which the sequence is matched against a random sample of the zzso We demonstrate the use of the zzso as a secondary filter which screens out several well-known types of false positive, reducing the amount of manual screening to be done by the zzso
