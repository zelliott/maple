Data zzso refers to the process of zzso a system's state from a time series of zzso (which may be noisy or zzso in conjunction with a model for the system's time zzso Here we demonstrate the zzso of a recently developed data zzso method, the local ensemble transform Kalman zzso to zzso zzso zzso chaotic flows in zzso zzso zzso Using this technique we are able to extract the full temperature and zzso fields from a time series of zzso zzso In addition, we describe extensions of the zzso for zzso model zzso Our results suggest the potential usefulness of our data zzso technique to a broad class of experimental situations exhibiting zzso zzso
