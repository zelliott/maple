A statistical model is presented that represents the zzso of major tissue classes in single-channel magnetic resonance zzso cerebral zzso Using the model, cerebral images are segmented into gray matter, white matter, and zzso fluid zzso The model accounts for random noise, magnetic field zzso and biological variations of the zzso zzso zzso are modeled by a finite zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso nature of the tissue regions are modeled by a three-dimensional zzso zzso random field zzso A zzso algorithm, based on the statistical model, approximately finds the maximum a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and estimates the model parameters from the image zzso The proposed scheme for zzso is based on the zzso conditional modes zzso zzso in which measurement model parameters are estimated using local information at each site, and the prior model parameters are estimated using the zzso after each cycle of zzso Application of the zzso to a sample of clinical MR brain scans, comparisons of the zzso with other statistical methods, and a validation study with a phantom are zzso The zzso constitutes a significant step toward a complete data driven zzso approach to zzso of MR images in the presence of the random noise and intensity zzso
