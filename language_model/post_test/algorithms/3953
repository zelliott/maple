A method is proposed that aims at identifying clusters of individuals that show similar patterns when observed zzso We consider zzso models that are widely used for the modeling of zzso zzso In contrast to the classical assumption of a normal distribution for the random effects a finite mixture of normal zzso is zzso Typically, the number of mixture components is unknown and has to be zzso zzso by data driven zzso For this purpose, an zzso zzso approach is considered that uses a penalized normal mixture as random effects zzso The penalty term shrinks the zzso distances of cluster centers based on the group lasso and the fused lasso zzso The effect is that individuals with similar time trends are merged into the same zzso The strength of zzso is determined by one zzso zzso For finding the optimal zzso zzso a new model choice criterion is zzso
