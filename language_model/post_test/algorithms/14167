The threshold zzso diameter test is used as a zzso measure of image quality in zzso This observation task is called zzso known zzso known zzso because the signals are usually low contrast disks in known positions, and the background is uniform except for noise zzso The performance of the observer zzso this task can to some extent be predicted from knowledge of the noise power in the image background, and adoption of the assumption that the noise is sampled through an zzso of the same area as the test feature being zzso In order to extend this approach to zzso of clinical images, the effect of the cluttered anatomical background on the detection task must be zzso To study the effect on detection of nearby structure, a series of zzso tests was carried out using a progressively restricted background area of zzso noise, and a range of object zzso It was found that the zzso ability to detect low contrast objects is progressively reduced as the area of the search area is reduced, the difficulty of the task increasing rapidly as the diameter of the restricted search area falls to less than twice that of the target zzso The results suggest the presence of a search pattern that scales in proportion with the size of the test zzso
