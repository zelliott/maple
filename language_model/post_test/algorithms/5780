zzso is an inverse measure of movement zzso and can be calculated from the first-time zzso of acceleration obtained from a zzso zzso zzso zzso or from the zzso zzso of position obtained from a zzso zzso The aims of this study were to zzso in 10 zzso subjects who are chewing zzso zzso zzso measures derived from zzso data obtained from the zzso zzso device and from acceleration data obtained from a zzso used in the same jaw movement recordings, zzso whether there was a significant relationship between zzso measures derived from both devices and zzso the degree of agreement between the two zzso zzso data were calculated in the opening phase, the closing phase, and over the full chewing cycle as the first-time zzso from acceleration obtained from the zzso and the zzso zzso from zzso for each of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso There was a significant correlation between both measures of zzso over the full chewing cycle and during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was no significant correlation in the closing phase zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso test showed that zzso derived from the zzso can differ by up to zzso below and zzso above that derived from the zzso These results suggest that zzso measures derived from a zzso system cannot substitute for zzso measures derived from an zzso
