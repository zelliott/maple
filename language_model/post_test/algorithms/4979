The zzso indirect zzso for measuring resting energy expenditure zzso is less cumbersome than many other zzso We tested the hypothesis that the zzso zzso is as well suited for determining zzso in older people as traditional zzso In 50 healthy persons (24 men and 26 zzso age range, zzso zzso zzso by zzso was validated against zzso zzso indirect zzso as a criterion zzso zzso energy expenditure by zzso was recorded at 2 different time intervals to find optimal conditions for older zzso Also, zzso by 7 published equations was zzso The zzso procedure was used to test agreement between zzso Multiple zzso analysis was applied to develop a new equation for predicting zzso from zzso The zzso zzso and most empirical equations significantly zzso mean zzso in both zzso zzso equation zzso mean zzso Limits of agreement were wide for zzso and narrow for most empirical zzso The zzso and zzso equations had smallest limits of agreement in men zzso zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso equations in women zzso zzso zzso A new equation was developed for the zzso device improving both predictions of mean and individual zzso zzso zzso zzso standard error of the estimate zzso 136 zzso zzso Using this zzso zzso of subjects were lying within zzso of measured zzso compared with only zzso when using the zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso zzso is suitable for measuring zzso in healthy older adults when the new prediction equation is zzso This zzso is not zzso to frail older zzso
