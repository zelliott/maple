Bone zzso zzso stem cells zzso are responsible for both lifelong daily maintenance of all blood cells and for repair after cell zzso Until recently the cellular mechanisms by which zzso accomplish these two very different tasks remained an open zzso Biological evidence has now been found for the existence of two related mouse zzso zzso First, a dormant zzso zzso population which harbors the highest zzso potential of all blood cells but is only induced into active zzso in response to zzso zzso And second, an active zzso zzso subset that by and large produces the zzso and mature cells required for maintenance of day-to-day zzso Here we present zzso analyses further supporting the zzso concept through extensive modeling of experimental DNA zzso cell zzso zzso Our conclusion that the presence of a slowly dividing zzso of zzso is the most likely explanation zzso the various possible causes including zzso cellular zzso of the observed long term zzso zzso zzso is confirmed by the deterministic and zzso models presented zzso Moreover, modeling both zzso zzso zzso and dilution in three stages and careful treatment of the zzso detection sensitivity permitted improved estimates of zzso turnover zzso This analysis predicts that zzso cycle about once every zzso days and zzso about once every zzso zzso We further predict that, using zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso can be achieved after zzso days of zzso Interestingly, the zzso proportion is now estimated to be around zzso of total zzso - more than twice that of our previous zzso
