An zzso for zzso rules from a standard zzso zzso neural network is zzso The trained network is first pruned not only to remove redundant connections in the network but, more important, to detect the relevant zzso The zzso generates rules from the pruned network by considering only a small number of zzso values at the hidden zzso If the number of zzso connected to a hidden unit is sufficiently small, then rules that describe how each of its zzso values is obtained can be readily zzso Otherwise the hidden unit will be split and treated as output units, with each output unit corresponding to an zzso zzso A hidden layer is inserted and a new zzso is formed, trained, and zzso This process is repeated until every hidden unit in the network has a relatively small number of input units connected to zzso Examples on how the proposed zzso works are shown using real-world data arising from molecular biology and signal zzso Our results show that for these complex problems, the zzso can extract reasonably compact rule sets that have high zzso accuracy zzso
