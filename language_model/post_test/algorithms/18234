Several methods and zzso have recently been proposed that allow for the systematic evaluation of simple zzso models from zzso or zzso zzso Models built in this way generate good quantitative predictions of the future activity of zzso under temporally structured current zzso It is, however, difficult to compare the advantages of various models and zzso since each model is designed for a different set of zzso Here, we report about one of the first attempts to establish a benchmark test that permits a systematic comparison of methods and performances in predicting the activity of rat cortical zzso zzso We present early zzso to the benchmark test and discuss implications for the design of future tests and simple zzso zzso
