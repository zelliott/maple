zzso heel effect renders large-scale background zzso in digital zzso Conventional zzso zzso is performed at zzso zzso distance zzso and zzso the zzso characteristic of heel zzso It results in a residual zzso background in the corrected zzso when the SID settings for zzso and correction zzso In this work, the authors develop a robust and efficient zzso method for digital zzso detector gain correction adapted to zzso heel effect, without resorting to physical zzso zzso complicated heel effect models, or zzso zzso and zzso 

The authors present the zzso projection correction zzso In our approach, conventional zzso zzso are performed only twice, at the minimum and maximum zzso of the system in typical clinical zzso A fast zzso separation zzso is devised to extract the detector gain and basis heel patterns from the zzso SID zzso The zzso detector gain is independent of zzso while the basis heel patterns are zzso by the zzso and zzso The heel pattern at any SID is obtained from the zzso basis heel pattern via projection imaging zzso The system gain desired at a specific acquisition SID is then constructed using the projected heel pattern and detector gain zzso 

The method was evaluated for flat field and anatomical phantom image zzso It demonstrated promising improvements over zzso and conventional gain zzso methods, lowering their correction errors by approximately zzso and zzso zzso The separation zzso was able to extract the detector gain and heel patterns with less than zzso error, and the zzso corrected images showed zzso appealing uniform background across the zzso 

The zzso correction method has substantially improved on conventional zzso corrections for digital zzso imaging in an zzso zzso The technique is relatively simple, and can be easily incorporated into zzso gain zzso zzso It offers a potentially valuable tool for zzso digital zzso images to boost image quality of zzso chest and cardiac zzso as well as automated computer aided diagnostic zzso
