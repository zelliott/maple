This paper shows that zzso broadband zzso of electromagnetic waves having arbitrary zzso is possible by use of zzso zzso zzso zzso These useful features are confirmed by zzso simulations in which different lengths of CW pairs are combined as one periodic zzso unit and placed near to a perfect electric conductor zzso So far zzso zzso have exhibited some interesting features, which are not available from conventional zzso zzso straightforward adjustment of electromagnetic properties and size zzso The paper shows how with proper design a broad range of zzso characteristics may be zzso
