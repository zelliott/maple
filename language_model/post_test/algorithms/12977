A broadband zzso liquid crystal zzso device with a zzso structure is demonstrated by using an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso pattern of the zzso zzso zzso depends on the concentration of zzso doped in the mixture of zzso and the cooling rate of the mixture from a temperature higher than the clear zzso zzso changes in the bulk and surface properties of the zzso cells, such as a promotion of zzso zzso help to form a zzso structure with a broadband reflection of light; the latter can be used for improvement of zzso zzso zzso A higher zzso concentration and a higher cooling rate both improve the appearance of the zzso zzso zzso
