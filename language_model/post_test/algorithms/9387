zzso analysis of flexible zzso systems such as zzso zzso or zzso proteins with flexible zzso is a difficult task as high-resolution techniques are barely zzso A new approach, ensemble zzso method zzso is proposed to zzso characterize flexible proteins in solution using zzso X-ray scattering zzso The flexibility is taken into account by allowing for the coexistence of different zzso of the protein contributing to the experimental scattering zzso These zzso are selected using a genetic zzso from a pool containing a large number of randomly generated models covering the protein zzso zzso zzso criteria are developed to analyze the zzso selected models and to determine the optimum number of zzso in the zzso zzso fitting of multiple scattering patterns from deletion zzso if available, provides yet more detailed local information about the zzso The efficiency of zzso is demonstrated in model and practical examples on completely or partially unfolded proteins and on zzso proteins interconnected by zzso In the latter case, zzso is able to distinguish between rigid and flexible proteins and to directly assess the zzso zzso
