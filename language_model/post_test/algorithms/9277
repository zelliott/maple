There are two important issues in zzso zzso zzso zzso ability to describe the behavior of the system in an zzso zzso zzso zzso ability to approximate the outcome of the system zzso As these two objectives usually exert contradictory requirements on the zzso model, certain compromise has to be zzso This letter proposes a novel rule reduction algorithm, zzso zzso rule reduction, and an zzso tuning process to balance zzso and zzso The zzso rule reduction zzso uses zzso ordering, which represents the degree of coverage of the samples by the rule, as an importance measure of each rule to merge the membership functions and hence reduces the number of the zzso Similar membership functions zzso are merged by a specified similarity measure in an order of zzso importance, and the zzso equivalent rules are deleted from the rule zzso The rule with a higher zzso importance will be retained among a set of zzso The zzso are tuned through the least mean square zzso zzso to reduce the modeling zzso The tuning of the zzso and the reduction of the rules proceed zzso to achieve a balance between zzso and zzso Three published data sets by zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso the Pat synthetic data set zzso Mitra, & Mitra, 2003), and the traffic flow density prediction data set are used as benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed zzso Good zzso as well as high modeling zzso are zzso simultaneously and are suitably zzso against other well-established zzso zzso
