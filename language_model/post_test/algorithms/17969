We consider the zzso problem for zzso acids and describe an efficient zzso zzso for closing zzso zzso in zzso zzso Using six new internal coordinates to represent the zzso zzso which we call the zzso the original closure problem with six free zzso angles in each zzso can be reduced to one with only four degrees of zzso zzso zzso techniques have been used to solve the resulting zzso zzso and a test of the closure zzso on a set of zzso consisting of more than zzso zzso was able to zzso the native zzso angles in every zzso in the test set without zzso We show how the zzso probability density zzso when the original zzso angle representation is mapped onto the new zzso We also present statistical evidence showing that the delta and zzso zzso angles are zzso and how this zzso affects the zzso probability density in the zzso In addition to the zzso the same zzso zzso can also be applied to close the zzso zzso The zzso is freely available at zzso
