At our center, the zzso zzso zzso device is used for newborn hearing screening based on zzso zzso zzso zzso In 2006, an zzso zzso stimulus was implemented in the device to increase the reliability and quality of the screening zzso In 2002, an automated response detection zzso had been zzso This study analyzes the screening results using the zzso zzso device with the implemented zzso stimulus and automated response detection zzso 

The data presented were collected in the zzso nursery as part of the newborn hearing screening program following a two stage screening zzso To focus the study on the typical routine zzso data from zzso babies were not zzso Overall, data from zzso babies zzso males and zzso zzso screened from March 2006 to April 2011 were analyzed in this zzso 

Out of the zzso babies screened, zzso passed zzso prior to hospital discharge zzso as 1st stage in this hearing screening zzso zzso the zzso pass rate of the hearing screening with the zzso zzso device was zzso The resulting referral rate was zzso The median test time per ear zzso time for preparation and data zzso was zzso with a range of zzso zzso zzso The number of infants referred for 2nd stage, zzso zzso was zzso Of this group, 71 passed zzso and 188 failed the zzso in one or both zzso zzso including both the zzso and zzso screening results, the bilateral pass rate was zzso and zzso were referred for diagnostic zzso zzso testing was performed on all of the 188 infants who were zzso zzso showed that 47 of these babies had hearing zzso This zzso to a positive zzso value for a refer result of zzso The observed prevalence of hearing impairment in our population was zzso zzso results for 141 of the referred newborns proved that they had normal zzso That is, 141 out of zzso newborns had a zzso result with the zzso zzso zzso zzso the device had a specificity of zzso During the time period of this study, no baby who passed the hearing screening was later found to have hearing zzso suggesting a sensitivity of zzso However, due to the limited number of newborns and the short time period after screening for the more recently screened babies, a reliable estimate of the sensitivity cannot be yet made from our program zzso The theoretical sensitivity of the zzso 11 device is zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso is a reliable device for auditory zzso response newborn hearing screening and it provides results within a very short zzso Due to the implemented method for automatic detection of zzso the use of the device does not require an experienced zzso allowing it to be used by trained technicians in locations outside the department of zzso such as the zzso zzso
