zzso virus zzso changes often result from multiple alternative molecular mechanisms, where each mechanism involves changes to a small number of key zzso zzso we propose to learn zzso functions, using zzso zzso Form zzso as the assumed functional zzso In this study we develop zzso learning zzso that attempt to construct zzso as zzso combinations of zzso We demonstrate the learning zzso consistency and efficiency on simulated zzso and establish their biological relevance using a variety of real zzso virus zzso representing different viral zzso including drug resistance, zzso and zzso We compare our zzso with previously published machine learning zzso in terms of prediction zzso zzso performance shows superior accuracy to other machine learning zzso on the zzso drug resistance zzso and the zzso promoter gene zzso The zzso are powerful in zzso the zzso mapping from a moderate number of labeled zzso as are typically produced in zzso zzso They can also greedily learn zzso from large zzso The zzso zzso of our zzso will be made publicly zzso
