zzso functions zzso are fundamental to the study of synchronization in complex zzso zzso For example, for a coupled zzso network, a necessary condition for synchronization to occur is that the zzso at the corresponding zzso zzso parameters be zzso To understand the typical behaviors of the zzso for various chaotic zzso is key to predicting the collective dynamics of a network of these zzso We address this issue by zzso zzso zzso for known chaotic zzso Our zzso and analysis indicate that it is generic for zzso being negative in a finite zzso of a zzso zzso zzso A general scheme is proposed to zzso the typical behaviors of zzso into four zzso These results are verified by direct simulations of zzso dynamics on networks of actual coupled zzso
