zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was studied by electron spin echo envelope zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso electron with several zzso were zzso in particular those of the zzso bound to the iron zzso Combining the experimental information here presented and previous continuous zzso zzso resonance and electron nuclear double resonance results, some details on the electronic structure of the zzso center in the protein are zzso These results are discussed on the basis of a molecular model that considers one zzso electron localized mainly in the iron d zzso and propagation of the spin density within the zzso center via spin polarization of the nitrogen zzso The coexistence of two zzso forms at zzso pH values in this zzso zzso is also discussed taking into account the experimental zzso
