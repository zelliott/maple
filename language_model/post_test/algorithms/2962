A problem often encountered in zzso zzso is that an existing chemical shift list of a protein has to be used to assign an experimental spectrum but does not fit sufficiently well for a safe zzso A similar problem occurs when temperature or pressure series of zzso zzso are to be evaluated zzso We have developed two different zzso zzso and zzso that fulfill this zzso In the present contribution their performance is analyzed employing a set of simulated and experimental two-dimensional and three-dimensional zzso obtained from three different zzso A new zzso based on atom and zzso acid specific chemical shift zzso is introduced to weight the chemical shift contributions in different dimensions zzso
