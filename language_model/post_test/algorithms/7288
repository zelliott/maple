zzso of structural and functional zzso across different brains is one of the most fundamental issues in the human brain mapping zzso Recently, several zzso zzso studies have demonstrated that consistent white matter fiber connection patterns can predict brain function and represent common brain zzso across individuals and zzso and along this direction, several approaches have been proposed to discover large-scale cortical landmarks with common structural connection zzso However, an important limitation of previous approaches is that the rich anatomical information such as zzso folding patterns has not been incorporated into the landmark discovery procedure zzso In this paper, we present a novel zzso discovery framework that defines and zzso a dense map of cortical landmarks that possess zzso consistent anatomical and fiber zzso zzso This framework effectively zzso reliable and rich zzso zzso and fiber zzso information for landmark zzso zzso and zzso which are formulated and solved as an energy zzso zzso zzso results based on zzso data demonstrate that the identified 555 cortical landmarks are zzso predictable and exhibit accurate structural and functional zzso across individuals and zzso offering a universal and individualized brain reference system for zzso zzso
