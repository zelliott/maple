The zzso relaxation rate zzso zzso in zzso foams measured by use of a multiple spin echo sequence is found to be dependent on the echo time zzso This property, referred to as zzso originates to a large extent from molecular zzso of water within internal field zzso that result from magnetic zzso differences between the gel and air zzso Another contribution to the zzso relaxation rate is surface zzso zzso simulations are performed to investigate the relation between the foam zzso (the mean air bubble radius and standard zzso of the air bubble zzso and foam composition properties (such as magnetic zzso diffusion zzso and surface zzso at one hand and the zzso at the other zzso The simulated zzso of gel foam are in agreement with the measured zzso By zzso the zzso parameters and simulated zzso properties a zzso relationship is obtained that enables the mean air bubble size to be derived from measured zzso zzso The zzso mean air bubble size of a zzso foam is in agreement with the bubble size measured with X-ray zzso This illustrates the feasibility of using zzso zzso zzso to determine the size of air bubbles in zzso foams and of zzso in lung zzso
