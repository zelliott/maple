We report zzso images of zzso following injection of a zzso of zzso zzso zzso in a live zzso The data were acquired on a clinical zzso using custom coils for volume transmission and array zzso zzso blocking of all carbon zzso enabled zzso zzso imaging with the system body zzso to allow for registration of zzso and zzso images, for which good correlation was zzso with some zzso features zzso and zzso clearly visible in a carbon image, without reference to the corresponding zzso zzso Parallel imaging with sensitivity zzso was used to increase the spatial resolution in the zzso direction of the zzso The signal to noise ratio in was in some instances unexpectedly high in the parallel zzso zzso of the polarization among different trials, plus partial volume effects, are noted as a possible cause of zzso
