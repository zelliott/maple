To perform a zzso characterization of the zzso zzso of patients in the zzso group using zzso in zzso zzso zzso A general consensus has not been reached with regard to the optimal therapy and follow-up of patients with zzso zzso at intermediate risk of zzso On the basis of the zzso pattern, we developed a new follow-up zzso for this group and report our preliminary zzso 

zzso urine samples of 51 consecutive patients zzso age zzso years, range 52 to zzso under follow-up after complete zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were evaluated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso From the residual material, zzso zzso was zzso Any zzso suspicious zzso was zzso or removed zzso The mean follow-up time was zzso months zzso 6 to 30, zzso zzso 

Two of the 51 patients were not evaluated because of the presence of intense zzso and insufficient zzso zzso Of the 49 remaining patients, the results of the zzso analysis were negative zzso zzso zzso in zzso 20 patients showed the loss of one or both zzso of zzso and/or an zzso of zzso 3, and 15 patients had zzso of zzso 7 and/or zzso Of the 14 zzso patients, 2 zzso had zzso verified zzso and 3 zzso of the 20 zzso patients had recurrence and 9 zzso of the 15 zzso patients had either recurrence or zzso 

Using the zzso test, it is possible to predict the zzso behavior of zzso cancer with a significant impact on the follow-up of zzso The zzso group of zzso cancer can be eliminated in the routine zzso by zzso these patients according to their zzso pattern and defining those patients who can follow the low-risk scheme and those who must be monitored according to the guidelines for high-risk superficial zzso
