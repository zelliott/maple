In many medical imaging applications, due to the limited field of view of imaging devices, acquired images often include only a part of a zzso In such situations, it is impossible to guarantee that the images will contain exactly the same physical extent of the structure at different scans, which leads to difficulties in registration and in many other tasks, such as the analysis of the zzso architecture, and zzso of the zzso To facilitate such analysis, we developed a general method, referred to as zzso that generates structures of the same shape from segmented image zzso The basis for this method is to automatically find a set of key points, called shape centers, in the segmented partial zzso structure such that these points are present in all images and that they represent the same physical location in the object, and then trim the structure using these points as zzso The application area considered here is the analysis of the zzso architecture, and zzso of the zzso of the foot from magnetic resonance images acquired at different joint positions and load zzso The accuracy of the method is analyzed by utilizing ten data sets for zzso the zzso and the fibula via four zzso zzso The analysis indicates that zzso produces results as predicted by the theoretical zzso
