The ability of systems of molecular reactions to be simultaneously zzso and sustained by some ambient 'food zzso of simple molecules may have been an essential step in the origin of zzso In this paper we first describe a zzso zzso that determines whether any given set of zzso reactions and zzso contains a zzso that is both zzso and able to be sustained from a given subset of the zzso We also describe some zzso properties of this algorithm, and show how it can be used to find zzso zzso and sustaining zzso In the second part of the paper we use the zzso to investigate random zzso zzso particular, a model described by zzso Using simulations and some zzso techniques we investigate the rate of zzso that is required for the emergence of zzso and sustaining zzso
