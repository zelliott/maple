The objective of this study was to compare the population biology of zzso resistant zzso zzso coli isolated from zzso reared in the conventional and zzso zzso zzso production systems at farm, slaughter and zzso A total of 200 zzso coli zzso selected from zzso zzso and carcass samples of zzso zzso zzso zzso and conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso production systems were typed by zzso sequence typing zzso zzso data from seven zzso genes was analyzed for the identification of zzso profiles, sequence types zzso and zzso complex zzso zzso trees were generated to establish the relationships between the zzso zzso A total of 51 zzso were detected including two novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and 14 novel zzso reported for the first zzso The majority of the zzso coli zzso belonged to zzso zzso 31, zzso 17), and were grouped in zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean genetic diversity zzso for the zzso zzso and conventional zzso systems were zzso The index of association zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso coli populations were close to linkage zzso indicative of a freely zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected between the pigs and their environment both at farm and zzso A minimum spanning tree revealed the close zzso of zzso coli zzso that originated from zzso and carcass with those from the zzso In conclusion, our study reveals a zzso diverse zzso coli population that shares a common ancestry in the conventional and zzso zzso production zzso This could potentially explain the high prevalence of zzso resistant zzso coli in the zzso system in the absence of zzso selection zzso
