An automatic procedure is proposed for adding side chains to a protein zzso it is based on zzso of a simplified energy function for zzso side zzso given its backbone and positions of zzso zzso The energy is expressed as a sum of the energies of interaction between side zzso and a harmonic penalty function accounting for the preservation of the positions of the zzso atoms and the zzso zzso The energy of zzso interactions is calculated with the zzso zzso zzso A zzso Carlo search is carried out to explore all possible zzso zzso within a fixed backbone and zzso zzso zzso The initial, usually extended, zzso zzso are taken directly from the zzso zzso The procedure was tested on six experimental zzso or zzso zzso zzso binding protein zzso code zzso an zzso zzso factor zzso zzso code zzso a zzso zzso of the ring finger domain, predominantly zzso bovine pancreatic zzso inhibitor zzso form zzso zzso code zzso an zzso the zzso of human zzso zzso code zzso an zzso zzso chain A of alcohol zzso from zzso zzso zzso code zzso as well as on the zzso portion of the B domain of zzso protein A zzso code zzso In all cases except zzso the data for the zzso zzso the backbone or zzso coordinates and the positions of zzso zzso were taken from the experimental zzso For protein A, the zzso coordinates and positions of zzso zzso were also taken from the zzso model predicted by the zzso force zzso In all comparisons with experimental structures, complete zzso geometry was reconstructed with a zzso zzso zzso of approximately zzso A from the heavy atoms when complete backbone and zzso coordinates were used in zzso or approximately zzso A when the zzso and zzso coordinates were zzso
