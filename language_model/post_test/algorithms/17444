A significant portion of new protein structures contain folds that are related to those seen zzso During the development of a computer program that can accurately position, in electron density zzso large protein zzso with large structural zzso it became apparent that the zzso in protein folds could be used in a non trivial manner during a protein structure zzso As a result a zzso zzso Database Assisted zzso zzso zzso was developed and tested to aid in the building of models in protein zzso and to assist in interpreting electron density zzso The initial tests of the zzso procedure using a small database of protein zzso are zzso The philosophy is to first work with entire zzso then with the secondary structure elements of these zzso and finally with individual zzso of the secondary structure elements via zzso zzso zzso and zzso procedures, zzso The first test case was a traceable zzso A multiple zzso replacement with anomalous scattering zzso electron density map of a human zzso zzso zzso The second test case uses poor electron density for the third domain of the diphtheria toxin zzso resulting from a molecular replacement solution with the first two zzso Despite the fact that a fairly small database was employed in these test cases, the zzso procedure was able to find a large portion of the protein backbone with very few zzso In the first case nearly zzso of the backbone and more than zzso of the secondary structure was placed zzso In the second test case nearly 50% of the third domain was automatically zzso A particular encouraging result was that in both cases more than zzso of the beta sheet secondary structure was found automatically by the zzso zzso Clearly, the procedures employed are promising avenues to exploit the current explosion of protein structures for the determination of future zzso zzso zzso
