The physical and chemical changes occurring in blood that has been zzso into a blood culture bottle can be used as means to detect the presence of zzso in blood zzso These changes include primarily the conversion of zzso to zzso within the red blood cells zzso and changes in the cell number zzso These changes in the physical and chemical properties of blood can be readily detected using zzso methods thus enabling the continuous monitoring of blood culture zzso to provide quantitative information on the growth behavior of the zzso zzso This paper reports on the application of zzso information obtained from diffuse zzso zzso of zzso blood cultures to detect microbial growth and compares the results to those obtained using the standard blood culture zzso
