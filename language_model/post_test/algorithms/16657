In this paper we present a probability generating function zzso approach for analyzing zzso reaction zzso The master equation of the network can be converted to a partial differential equation for zzso Using power series expansion of zzso and zzso zzso we develop zzso schemes for finding probability zzso as well as first and second zzso We show zzso accuracy of the method by simulating chemical reaction examples such as a zzso reaction, an zzso model, zzso zzso switch model, and zzso transition zzso
