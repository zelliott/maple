zzso of the number of zzso seeds zzso required for prostate zzso is an important tool to reduce the number of unused seeds for zzso This study was designed to investigate the relationship between the number of seeds implanted zzso prostate zzso This can produce a tool to accurately estimate the number of seeds required for a given target zzso In addition, total cost of treatment, personal radiation risks during storage and zzso and errors in accounting for seeds can be zzso 

Data from two groups of patients who had zzso seed prostate implants zzso zzso model zzso zzso have been separately zzso zzso The relationship between prostate volume zzso number of seeds implanted was based on 401 patients treated between 1999 and 2002 who were implanted with seeds of air zzso strength zzso of zzso zzso zzso @ 1 m per zzso zzso The relationship between prostate volume zzso total seed zzso was zzso This was based on 628 patients treated between 1999 and 2002 who were implanted with a range of seed strengths from zzso to zzso zzso Both patient groups were subdivided into zzso prostate volume zzso For each zzso the mean and zzso confidence intervals zzso for the implanted number of seeds or total zzso implanted were zzso The upper zzso zzso was used to investigate the relationship between the number of seeds implanted and total zzso implanted zzso prostate zzso 

The new method of predicting the number of seeds shows valid and accurate zzso The required number of seeds can be predicted, which helps to reduce the number of leftover seeds to zzso of the total number of seeds zzso 

The number of zzso seeds or the total activity that is required to deliver the prescribed dose for the target volume can be zzso This could reduce the overall treatment cost by accurate seed ordering before zzso
