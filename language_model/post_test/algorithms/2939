zzso structures can be solved via molecular replacement from powder zzso data collected not only on zzso zzso but also on image zzso zzso zzso recorded on image plates are generally broader than those collected using an array of crystal zzso zzso but the zzso data often allow the use of powder data to lower zzso zzso to the high zzso of zzso in powder patterns, which is especially evident for larger structures, a zzso zzso refinement is necessary in order to distinguish intensity zzso This work zzso various salt zzso to produce small lattice zzso which resulted in shifts of Bragg peak positions, in a suite of five powder zzso Using reflection structure factors obtained from this combined zzso the structure of zzso zzso zzso was determined by molecular replacement using the zzso identical human zzso zzso code zzso as the search zzso This work also expands upon previous work by presenting a zzso zzso analysis combined with an investigation of the sensitivity with regard to discrimination between incorrect fold zzso To test the limits of this technique, extension to higher zzso structures is zzso
