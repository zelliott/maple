One of the most essential difficulties in zzso zzso by means of zzso zzso zzso seen as a serious disadvantage of zzso zzso the changing zzso with increasing linear energy transfer zzso of the zzso This zzso leads to a falsification of absorbed dose that can be significant for many applications, zzso in space or zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso detectors can be exploited to obtain information about the LET of the zzso radiation field under zzso The zzso ratio zzso is used as a zzso to determine average zzso To correct the absorbed dose according to the zzso the detailed dependence of zzso and zzso on LET was zzso These investigations were accomplished at the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator zzso in zzso Japan, with a variety of zzso zzso beams zzso zzso zzso silicon and zzso ranging in LET from zzso to zzso zzso zzso The obtained relationships zzso zzso LET and zzso zzso LET were combined into a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This enables correction of the absorbed dose zzso zzso The methodology is demonstrated by means of zzso 700 zzso zzso in carbon beams of 290 and 400 zzso zzso available from zzso
