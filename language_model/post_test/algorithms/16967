We report a zzso of the zzso structures of bovine and zzso zzso corresponding to different stages of their zzso Using the resource zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Information server zzso zzso selected spatial structures were compared on the basis of zzso schemes zzso To compare the spatial structures of zzso zzso optimal consensus was developed from methods implemented in zzso zzso were also clustered using principal component analysis, resulting in good agreement with the zzso based on the zzso consensus zzso Analysis of the results revealed the basic movements of individual zzso zzso of these proteins that we were able to relate to different stages of the zzso of zzso A combination of methods identified in this study can be used as an up-to-date zzso tool to study the zzso dynamics of membrane zzso
