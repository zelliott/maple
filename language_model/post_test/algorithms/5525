zzso small breast zzso may be present in the neighboring areas and are difficult to accurately resolve and zzso in diffuse optical zzso In addition, larger zzso are often accompanied by clustered satellite zzso in the neighboring areas, which are also difficult to resolve and zzso To improve the light zzso of clustered zzso a new zzso reconstruction zzso guided by zzso ultrasound zzso was investigated using simulations, zzso and clinical zzso This method separated one larger zzso zzso into several zzso based on the location information provided by zzso zzso In general, the zzso method cannot resolve two smaller targets when their zzso were less than zzso zzso and the depth was greater than zzso zzso The zzso reconstruction method improved the resolving ability and reconstruction zzso As a result, two targets located at zzso zzso depth with separation greater than zzso zzso could be zzso and reconstruction improved by more than zzso as compared with that of the zzso zzso When two targets, one larger and one smaller, were located closer to each other, the location of the reconstructed zzso mass was shifted toward the larger target and the zzso of the smaller target was zzso
