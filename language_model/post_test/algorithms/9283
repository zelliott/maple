The purposes of this study were to combine a thorough understanding of the technical aspects of the zzso procedure with advanced rendering techniques by introducing a virtual zzso procedure and to evaluate the utility of this new rendering technique in prediction of the zzso zzso that cross the anticipated surgical zzso zzso 

The virtual zzso is a novel technique that follows the complex surgical steps in a zzso zzso zzso reconstructed zzso images are used to identify zzso zzso for the surgeon as part of the zzso zzso assessment of pancreatic and zzso zzso
