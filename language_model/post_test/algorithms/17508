In determining the zzso policy for an inventory system, some researchers advocated that the zzso method of Newton could be applied to the zzso of the total cost function in order to get the optimal zzso But this approach requires calculation of the second zzso of the zzso Avoiding this complex zzso we use another zzso method presented by the second zzso One of the goals of this paper is to present a unified convergence theory of this zzso Then we give a zzso example to show the application of our zzso
