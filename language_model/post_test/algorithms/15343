zzso in zzso perform many tasks more effectively than individual organisms and in addition grow more rapidly and in greater zzso In this work, experimental zzso were assembled consisting of all possible selected combinations of zzso reducing strains of zzso and their zzso degradation rates were zzso A genetic zzso zzso methodology was successfully applied to define sets of microbial strains to achieve maximum rates of zzso zzso Over the course of zzso generations of zzso using a zzso we saw a statistically significant zzso and zzso increase in average zzso degradation rates by zzso constructed using solely the zzso reducing bacteria zzso and by zzso consisting of zzso and accompanying organisms that did not degrade zzso zzso The comparison of kinetic rates constant in two types of microbial zzso additionally showed marked zzso
