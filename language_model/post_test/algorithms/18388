We determined the ability of combined zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso to detect prostate cancer zzso zzso in men with prior negative zzso ultrasound zzso prostate zzso 

zzso zzso with zzso was performed in 24 consecutive patients with 1 or more prior negative zzso zzso zzso for persistently increased prostate specific zzso and/or abnormal digital zzso zzso All studies were interpreted by a dedicated zzso who reported areas of interest in the peripheral zone as normal, zzso or suspicious on zzso and zzso zzso zzso and suspicious areas were then correlated with a zzso prostate zzso All patients underwent a standard zzso zzso peripheral zone biopsy with up to 4 additional zzso targeted at the zzso or suspected zzso 

zzso cancer was detected in 7 of 24 subjects zzso Considering the zzso category as test negative the sensitivity, zzso positive and negative zzso values, and the accuracy of zzso zzso and combined zzso for the detection of prostate cancer were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso The site of positive biopsy correlated correctly in 50% and zzso of zzso and zzso labeled suspicious cores, zzso 

zzso and zzso have the potential to identify cancer zzso and direct zzso in patients with a previous negative zzso zzso Further, larger studies are required to zzso the amount of zzso
