zzso a zzso zzso developed by us, has successfully completed Phase II efficacy study for treatment of abnormal zzso discharge due to zzso tract infections that act as zzso for zzso zzso In the present study we evaluated potential zzso activity of zzso in women infected with high risk zzso type zzso 

Twenty women zzso diagnosed positive for zzso infection without or with low grade zzso zzso zzso zzso or inflammation were assigned to receive zzso topical application of either zzso tablet or zzso for 30 days excluding the days of zzso period and were evaluated for persistence of zzso infection using zzso zzso consensus and zzso type zzso zzso as primary zzso 

One course of zzso treatment resulted in elimination of zzso in 6 out of 10 zzso zzso A repeat treatment of four patients with zzso zzso infection resulted in clearance of zzso in two additional cases resulting in an overall zzso clearance of zzso 16 as against a spontaneous clearance of zzso zzso seen in the zzso zzso The elimination of zzso DNA was found to be accompanied by marked improvement in clinical symptoms and zzso abnormalities of zzso zzso 

Our results showed for the first time that a 30-day zzso application of the zzso can result in elimination of zzso infection from the zzso zzso
