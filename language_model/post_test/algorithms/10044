The purpose of this study was to determine if our previously developed muscle model could be used to predict forces of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso muscles of children with zzso zzso cerebral zzso zzso 

Twenty-two children with zzso (12 zzso 10 zzso mean age zzso zzso zzso range zzso Gross Motor zzso zzso System levels II and zzso zzso A zzso based mathematical model with four free parameters is zzso 

For individuals with zzso the model predicted well the force profile throughout each contraction and both peak force and zzso integral responses to a wide range of stimulation zzso zzso and different stimulation patterns zzso zzso and zzso zzso both for zzso and fatigued zzso 

The significance of this work is the insight the model can provide into the physiology of muscle in zzso Additionally, the model can potentially be applied clinically to design optimal electrical stimulation patterns for interventions to address zzso in strength and function in individuals with zzso such as functional electrical zzso zzso
