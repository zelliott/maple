The structural and zzso properties of a hydrated zzso near the surface of zzso membrane were studied using a molecular dynamics zzso The zzso transport between water molecules was modeled using the second generation multistate empirical zzso bond zzso The zzso diffusion was found to be inhibited at the membrane zzso The potential of mean force for the zzso zzso to the membrane surface and its release back into the bulk water was also determined, yielding a small barrier in each zzso An efficient zzso for Ewald zzso calculations for the multistate empirical zzso bond model is also zzso
