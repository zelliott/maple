We consider the optimal rate of approximation by single hidden zzso neural networks on the unit zzso It is proved that there exists a neural network with zzso zzso and an zzso strictly zzso zzso zzso function such that the zzso of a zzso class zzso from the class of neural networks zzso behaves zzso as zzso zzso we prove that the essential rate of approximation by zzso neural networks is zzso
