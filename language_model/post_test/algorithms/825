zzso equations give a set of relationships that exist among the structure factors of an zzso zzso In order to obtain the correct zzso of the structure factors, a genetic zzso is used to minimize a zzso residual of zzso zzso In the genetic algorithm, a phase is treated as a gene and the whole set of zzso is considered as a zzso Every zzso is relaxed to a nearby local minimum by zzso after being produced from a previous zzso Trial calculations for a structure containing 92 zzso equal atoms with synthetic data and another structure containing 62 zzso equal atoms with real data are zzso Compared to simulated zzso a genetic zzso is a more efficient means of global zzso
