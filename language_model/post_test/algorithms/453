zzso secondary zzso zzso an indiscriminate resource of zzso compounds with both pharmaceutical and industrial zzso zzso of these compounds is tightly controlled through regulatory zzso These networks act in response to the environmental conditions in which the fungus zzso One class of zzso secondary zzso that have drawn increased attention, is the zzso produced by a high number of zzso and zzso The increasing number of publicly available zzso sequences of zzso zzso combined with new and highly efficient zzso techniques, has allowed the use of new efficient approaches to study the regulation and synthesis of these zzso With the availability of new molecular genetic tools, a new bottleneck has occurred in zzso molecular zzso the zzso chemical analysis of the generated transgenic zzso In this study, a method based on zzso data analysis of zzso data is presented and shown useful for gaining overview of complex and diverse zzso Further, the strain specific and zzso dependent regulation of zzso synthesis is zzso
