To develop computerized methods to monitor and recommend dosage changes for patients treated with excessive zzso of zzso zzso and to determine the zzso of zzso zzso in our patient zzso 

Prospective zzso and zzso study of all patients admitted to zzso Hospital and treated with zzso from May 1, 1987, through June 30, zzso 

zzso Hospital, Salt Lake City, zzso a zzso zzso care center associated with the University of Utah School of zzso 

Using a hospital information system we developed computerized zzso to identify and monitor patients receiving zzso These zzso screened the zzso medical records of all zzso admissions for zzso prescription zzso zzso support zzso estimated the zzso function of each zzso patient and provided suggestions when zzso were determined to be zzso Additional computer-generated alerts identified patients who were receiving zzso zzso with zzso or whose therapy reflected dosage changes in the previous 24 zzso A list of all zzso patients with alerts was reviewed daily by a clinical pharmacist and prescribing physicians were contacted if the computer-generated suggestions were clinically zzso 

The number and characterization of zzso zzso 

From May 1, 1987, through June 30, 1991, we zzso monitored zzso patients of whom 1951 were treated with zzso The following risk factors for zzso zzso were observed in the zzso population: zzso disease (6 percent), seizure disorders zzso percent), and abnormal zzso function zzso zzso The zzso and zzso methods employed in this study resulted in 79 percent of the patients receiving zzso zzso appropriate for their corresponding zzso zzso During the zzso study period, we detected four zzso zzso percent) in the zzso zzso All 4 patients were receiving zzso zzso that were excessive with respect to their zzso zzso 

Our rate of seizure zzso percent) was lower than the 1-2 percent rate reported in the literature despite the fact that more than 70 percent of the patients who received zzso had risk factors for zzso We believe that appropriate dosing of zzso results in a low rate of associated zzso zzso monitoring of zzso zzso in relation to zzso function resulted in a reduced zzso of zzso
