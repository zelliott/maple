The ability to predict the efficacy of zzso targeted therapies for zzso cell lung cancer zzso for an individual patient remains zzso The purpose of this study was to zzso using a refined zzso zzso zzso zzso with a continuous spectrum of drug activity, tumor zzso that predict drug sensitivity and therapeutic efficacy in zzso to zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso Using our refined zzso algorithm, zzso prediction models were discovered and trained for zzso and zzso based on the in zzso drug activity profiles of nine zzso cell lines zzso zzso a panel of 40 zzso cell lines zzso were treated with zzso or zzso to obtain 50% growth zzso zzso zzso expression profiles for both the zzso and zzso cell lines were determined using the zzso zzso zzso Modeling generated zzso expression signatures for zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso with one overlapping gene zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso revealed a zzso for cellular replication and death, whereas that of zzso suggested involvement in cellular development and zzso zzso zzso modeling of the refined zzso scores significantly predicted the activity of combination therapy in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso Through the refinement of the zzso algorithm, we provide an in zzso method to generate zzso that predict tumor sensitivity to zzso targeted zzso Use of this refined zzso method has significant implications for the a zzso examination of targeted therapies to more effectively streamline subsequent clinical trial design and zzso
