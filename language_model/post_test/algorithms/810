A new method for the zzso of zzso video sequences is zzso The method is based on the philosophy that zzso significant areas of the image should be allocated the greatest proportion of the total allocated bit zzso The approach uses a three-dimensional zzso based on the popular set zzso in zzso trees zzso zzso into this framework are a zzso zzso detection stage and a zzso zzso The combined result is an approach that models the zzso zzso zzso for some zzso zzso regions of the image in an extremely efficient zzso This allows additional bits to be used within the zzso to improve the quality of the zzso significant zzso zzso are compared for a number of real data sets and evaluated by trained zzso
