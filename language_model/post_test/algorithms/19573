Recently developed surface fitting technique is a natural replacement for the widely used glow curve zzso zzso zzso Surface fitting can be applied for advanced zzso resolved zzso zzso zzso It combines both kinetic and zzso zzso zzso to greater number of parameters and data points the zzso is more time-consuming than usual zzso However, it offers greater reliability in determination of trap zzso This is especially important for zzso resolved zzso that are usually performed at zzso level zzso This paper demonstrates an application of the surface fitting method to the analysis of zzso data from zzso zzso The zzso were zzso using two different zzso of surface zzso restricted and unrestricted peak zzso
