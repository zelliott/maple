The installation of offshore wind farms in the German Exclusive Economic Zone requires the deployment of zzso zzso to prevent zzso with zzso The general requirements for these systems have been previously worked out by the Research Department for Underwater zzso and Marine zzso of the zzso In this article, the major results of the research project zzso of zzso zzso for zzso Wind zzso are zzso For theoretical investigations a hybrid approach was implemented using the boundary element method to calculate the source zzso and a three-dimensional zzso zzso to estimate the transmission zzso The zzso of the sound field as well as the zzso of the transmission loss are compared to experimental results gathered at the offshore wind farm alpha zzso located zzso north of the island zzso While theoretical and experimental results are in general agreement, the implemented model slightly zzso scattering at the rough sea zzso It is found that the source level of zzso zzso zzso at zzso is adequate to satisfy the zzso of the warning sequence at distances up to 2 zzso zzso within a horizontal sector of zzso if realistic assumptions about zzso and noise are zzso An arrangement to enlarge the angular coverage is zzso
