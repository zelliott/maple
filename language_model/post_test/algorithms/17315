A new protocol for zzso of zzso beams was established by the zzso in report 59 on zzso zzso In this paper we report the results of an international zzso zzso zzso which was held at zzso Linda University Medical zzso The goals of the zzso were, first, to estimate the level of consistency in absorbed dose delivered to patients if zzso beams at various clinics were zzso with the new zzso zzso and second, to evaluate the differences in absorbed dose determination due to differences in zzso zzso chamber zzso zzso 

Eleven institutions participated in the zzso zzso were performed in a polystyrene phantom at a depth of zzso zzso water equivalent thickness in a zzso modulated zzso beam with an accelerator energy of 155 zzso and an incident energy of approximately 135 zzso Most participants used zzso chambers zzso in terms of exposure or air zzso Four zzso chambers had zzso zzso in terms of absorbed zzso Two chambers were zzso in a zzso beam at the zzso both in terms of air zzso and absorbed zzso to provide a comparison of zzso chambers with different zzso 

The zzso showed that use of the zzso report 59 protocol would result in absorbed doses being delivered to patients at their participating institutions to within zzso (one standard zzso The maximum difference between doses determined by the participants was found to be zzso zzso between zzso doses derived from the zzso with zzso chambers with zzso or zzso - zzso type depended on chamber zzso 

Using zzso chambers with zzso zzso factors traceable to standard laboratories and the zzso report 59 zzso a distribution of stated zzso absorbed dose is achieved with a difference less than zzso The zzso protocol should be adopted for clinical zzso beam zzso A comparison of zzso doses derived from zzso with different chambers indicates that the difference in results cannot be explained only by differences in zzso zzso zzso
