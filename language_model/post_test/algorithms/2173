A novel zzso to detect the zzso notch in zzso pressure signals is zzso Its performance is evaluated using both zzso and zzso artery pressure signals, and its zzso to variations in design parameters is zzso 

Most previously published zzso notch detection zzso scan the zzso pressure zzso for the characteristic pressure change that is associated with the zzso zzso zzso valves, however, are closed by the backwards motion of zzso blood zzso We developed an zzso that uses zzso flow to detect the zzso notch in zzso pressure zzso zzso flow is calculated from zzso pressure using simulation results with a zzso zzso zzso zzso valve closure is detected after the zzso zzso and at the minimum of the first negative dip in the calculated flow zzso 

In 7 dogs ejection times were derived from a calculated zzso flow signal and from simultaneously measured zzso flow probe zzso A total of 86 beats was zzso the difference in ejection times was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was further evaluated using 6 second epochs of zzso artery pressure data measured in 50 zzso Model simulations were carried out using both a linear zzso model and a pressure and age dependent zzso zzso zzso Visual inspection by an experienced zzso confirmed that the zzso correctly identified the zzso notch in zzso zzso of 50) of the patients using the linear model, and zzso zzso of 50) of the patients using the zzso zzso The position of the zzso notch appeared to be less sensitive to variations in zzso design parameters when a zzso zzso model was zzso 

The detection of the zzso notch in zzso pressure signals is facilitated by first calculating the zzso flow zzso from zzso pressure and a model of zzso zzso The method is robust and reduces the problem of detecting a dubious point in a decreasing pressure signal to the detection of a zzso minimum in a derived zzso
