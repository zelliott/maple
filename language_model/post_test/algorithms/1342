The increase of low back problems has zzso the development of different analysis and evaluation zzso Among these methods, the direct linear transformation zzso technique is commonly used to reconstruct the spine in three dimensions by means of its known image coordinates on zzso Despite its efficiency and precision, general reconstruction of some standard anatomical landmarks zzso does not give all the necessary data for a detailed analysis of the intrinsic geometrical characteristics of zzso zzso Thus, in order to obtain such geometrical information a three-dimensional zzso reconstruction zzso zzso zzso technique has been zzso This technique involves 1) zzso zzso and reconstruction processes of the zzso zzso zzso and 2) 3-D reconstruction of zzso zzso zzso zzso based on mathematical simulations demonstrated that two or three zzso are necessary to correct zzso 2 zzso the zzso zzso position for simulated error higher than 10 zzso Other zzso based on 3-D reconstructions of a zzso tube and a dry vertebra contours of known dimensions have given mean errors of 2 zzso Application on a healthy subject demonstrated the potential of this 3-D reconstruction zzso Finally, 3-D data obtained on zzso zzso would allow the development of new clinical zzso that could be used to evaluate the zzso spine geometrical behavior and zzso zzso zzso
