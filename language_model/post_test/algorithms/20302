A zzso based zzso model was developed for inhalation exposure of zzso zzso in zzso The model consists of six compartments for zzso and one compartment for the zzso zzso acid zzso Based on previous experimental findings from human zzso to zzso liver metabolism was divided in two zzso one of the first order and one of the zzso zzso Muscle tissue was split in two compartments to account for working and resting muscle zzso during bicycle zzso The model was used to investigate how various factors influence potential zzso of exposure, zzso zzso in blood and zzso air and zzso in zzso zzso the work load from rest to moderate exercise zzso zzso more than doubled all zzso levels end of zzso The effect on next morning levels was even more zzso illustrated by a fivefold increase in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of five daily zzso zzso suggest that zzso levels end of shift remain fairly constant whereas the levels prior to shift increase gradually during the zzso This suggests that end of shift levels reflect the exposure of the same day whereas levels Friday morning reflect exposure during the entire working zzso zzso with randomly generated zzso show that the zzso due to fluctuating exposure is lower next morning than end of zzso End of shift exhalation rate of zzso is more sensitive to fluctuation than zzso in zzso blood and zzso in zzso zzso levels for 25 zzso exposure at different sampling times are zzso
