This study focuses on the theoretical prediction and experimental evaluation of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Response components with different delay have been identified in several zzso The main generator of the transient response is assumed to be coherent reflection from cochlear zzso near the resonant zzso Additional components of different zzso can be generated by different zzso Experimental data are zzso in this study to evaluate the dependence of the zzso on stimulus level, for each component of the response, showing that previous estimates of the zzso zzso zzso were affected by systematic zzso The zzso of the zzso from each generator changes very little with stimulus level, whereas their different growth rate causes sharp changes of the zzso zzso estimated as the time of the absolute maximum of the zzso filtered zzso zzso of passive linear models, in which gain and bandwidth of the cochlear amplifier are strictly zzso are incompatible with the zzso Although active linear models including delayed zzso terms do predict much slower dependence of zzso on the stimulus level, a suitable zzso model should be zzso capable of decoupling more effectively the dependence on stimulus level of zzso and phase of the zzso zzso
