Fitting high resolution protein structures into low resolution zzso zzso zzso density maps is an important technique for modeling the atomic structures of very large zzso zzso This article presents zzso a highly parallel fast zzso transform zzso zzso density fitting program which can exploit the special hardware properties of modern graphics zzso units zzso to accelerate both the zzso and zzso parts of the correlation zzso In particular, by using the zzso special texture memory hardware to rotate zzso zzso grids, the cost of rotating large zzso density maps is almost completely zzso Compared to performing zzso correlations on one core of a contemporary central zzso unit zzso running zzso on a modern zzso gives up to zzso zzso Furthermore, using our parallel processing zzso this zzso increases zzso with the number of zzso or zzso zzso Thus, it is now possible to use routinely more robust but more expensive zzso correlation zzso When tested on low resolution experimental zzso data for the zzso complex, we demonstrate the satisfactory fitting results that may be achieved by using a locally zzso zzso with a zzso zzso while still being up to three orders of magnitude faster than the well-known zzso zzso
