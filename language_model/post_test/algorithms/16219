zzso zzso zzso zzso are widely used in zzso science and zzso The most commonly used method is zzso method, and recently the zzso method is shown to be faster than zzso method for computing the zzso However, these methods run on the CPU and are still too slow for many practical zzso We present techniques to implement these methods on the zzso for computing the zzso on zzso planes and on surfaces, and demonstrate significant zzso of these zzso methods over their CPU zzso For zzso zzso on a surface, we use a geometry image stored in the zzso to represent the surface for computing the zzso zzso on zzso In our zzso a new technique is proposed for parallel regional reduction on the zzso for evaluating zzso over zzso zzso
