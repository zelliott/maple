High resolution pulse zzso methods are usually applied to resolve weak magnetic zzso or zzso interactions that are otherwise unresolved in the zzso zzso Complete information regarding different magnetic zzso zzso principal components and orientation of principal axis system with respect to the molecular frame, can be derived from orientation selective zzso zzso zzso that are performed at different magnetic field positions within the zzso broadened zzso zzso These experiments are usually carried out zzso namely a particular field position is zzso data are accumulated until the signal to noise ratio is zzso and then the next field position is chosen and data are zzso Here we present a new approach for data acquisition of zzso zzso experiments referred to as parallel zzso It is zzso when the spectral zzso is much broader than the zzso bandwidth of the applied pulse sequence and it is particularly useful for orientation selective pulse zzso zzso In this approach several pulse zzso zzso are performed within the waiting zzso time between consecutive pulse sequences during which spin lattice relaxation takes zzso This is achieved by rapidly changing the main magnetic field, zzso to different values within the zzso spectrum, performing the same experiment on the otherwise zzso zzso This scheme represents an efficient zzso of the zzso and provides the same spectral information in a shorter zzso This approach is demonstrated on zzso orientation selective zzso double resonance zzso electron spin echo envelope zzso zzso zzso double resonance zzso zzso and double zzso resonance zzso zzso on frozen solutions of zzso We show that a factors of 3-6 reduction in total acquisition time can be zzso depending on the experiment zzso
