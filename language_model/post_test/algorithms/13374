In this work, we zzso evaluate the capability of various scoring functions of zzso networks for recovering true underlying zzso Similar investigations have been carried out before, but they typically relied on approximate learning zzso to learn the network zzso The zzso structures found by the approximation methods have unknown quality and may affect the reliability of their zzso Our study uses an optimal zzso to learn zzso network structures from zzso generated from a set of gold standard zzso zzso Because all optimal zzso always learn equivalent networks, this ensures that only the choice of scoring function affects the learned zzso Another shortcoming of the previous studies stems from their use of random synthetic networks as test zzso There is no guarantee that these networks reflect real-world zzso We use real-world data to generate our zzso structures, so our experimental design more closely zzso real-world zzso A major finding of our study suggests that, in contrast to results reported by several prior works, the Minimum zzso zzso zzso (or zzso zzso information criterion zzso consistently zzso other scoring functions such as zzso information criterion zzso zzso zzso zzso score zzso and zzso zzso maximum likelihood zzso in recovering the underlying zzso network zzso We believe this finding is a result of using both zzso generated from real-world applications rather than from random processes used in previous studies and learning zzso to select zzso structures rather than selecting random zzso Other findings of our study support existing work, zzso large sample sizes result in learning structures closer to the true underlying zzso the zzso score is sensitive to the zzso zzso and the zzso performs pretty well on small zzso We also tested a greedy hill climbing zzso and observed similar results as the optimal zzso
