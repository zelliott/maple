For most sequence comparison problems there is a corresponding map comparison zzso While map data may appear to be incompatible with dynamic programming, we show in this paper that the rigor and efficiency of dynamic programming zzso carry over to the map comparison zzso We present zzso for restriction map comparison that deal with two types of map zzso zzso closely spaced sites for different zzso can be ordered incorrectly, and zzso closely spaced sites for the same zzso can be mapped as a single zzso The new zzso are a natural extension of a previous map comparison zzso Dynamic programming zzso for computing optimal global and local alignments under the new model are zzso The new zzso take about the same order of time as previous map comparison zzso Programs implementing some of the new zzso are used to find similar regions within the zzso coli restriction map of zzso et zzso
