An zzso procedure to efficiently find approximate values of internal parameters in zzso zzso intended for broadband operation would be a valuable tool to discover internal construction zzso This information is necessary in the zzso and simulation of acoustic and electrical zzso related to zzso systems containing commercial zzso There is not a general solution for this generic problem of zzso zzso in the case of broadband zzso zzso In this paper, this general problem is briefly zzso for broadband zzso The viability of application in this field of an artificial intelligence technique supported on the zzso of the zzso internal components is zzso A genetic zzso zzso procedure is presented and applied to the zzso of different zzso related to two zzso which are working as zzso zzso The efficiency of this zzso technique is zzso considering the influence of the number and variation range of the estimated zzso zzso results are zzso zzso
