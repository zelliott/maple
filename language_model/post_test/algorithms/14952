A qualitative zzso analysis of a zzso procedure indicates that the resolution of the image used to plan the intervention is the major source of zzso zzso experimental zzso confirm this zzso They fail, however, to explain the relationship between the accuracy of the frame components involved in a zzso procedure and the overall application zzso This investigation shows that the novel zzso approach is a flexible framework for the calculation of the application accuracy of frame zzso zzso the zzso approach provides a detailed understanding of the interplay between the various factors affecting zzso The basic ideas and limitations of the zzso approach are briefly zzso The effect of zzso marker distribution and registration is investigated and shown to introduce a spatial dependence to the zzso The results of the zzso approach are compared with experimental data for three zzso frame zzso zzso G, zzso and zzso Although the zzso approach is an zzso it reproduces the accuracy measured in the experiment within the statistical error of that zzso
