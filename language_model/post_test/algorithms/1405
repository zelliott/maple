The authors performed a prospective trial to screen patients with chronic zzso B or C virus zzso zzso infections to zzso determine the zzso of zzso zzso cancer and zzso identify the zzso at highest risk to develop zzso zzso 

Four hundred zzso patients with chronic zzso of more than 5 years' duration were evaluated zzso zzso 69 zzso 7 zzso All underwent zzso ultrasound and measurement of serum zzso every 3 zzso Liver biopsy was performed on entry into the study to determine the severity of zzso liver zzso 

zzso screening identified zzso zzso cancer in 33 patients zzso Three additional liver zzso were detected during the 1st year of zzso bringing the overall zzso to zzso Treatment with zzso intent was possible in 22 of these patients zzso whereas 14 zzso had advanced zzso Thirty-five of these zzso zzso occurred in a subset of 140 patients zzso zzso with liver zzso showing severe chronic active zzso zzso or both, and one zzso cancer occurred among the 276 patients zzso with zzso less severe liver injury zzso zzso zzso zzso square zzso 

This screening study in patients with chronic zzso or zzso infection demonstrates zzso that the yield of zzso zzso cancer on initial screening is zzso and zzso that patients with severe chronic active zzso zzso or both are at extremely high risk to develop zzso cancer zzso On the basis of these results and the finding of a significant number of small; zzso zzso zzso zzso the authors recommend zzso cancer screening every 3 months for the subset of high-risk zzso
