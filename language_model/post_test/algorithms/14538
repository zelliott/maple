Experimental studies of zzso effects in high-intensity focused ultrasound zzso procedures are often performed with the aid of fine wire zzso positioned within tissue zzso zzso zzso are subject to several types of error which must be accounted for before reliable zzso can be made on the basis of the zzso zzso artifact due to viscous heating is one source of zzso A second is the uncertainty regarding the position of the beam relative to the target location or the zzso zzso due to the error in positioning the beam at the zzso This paper presents a method for determining the location of the beam relative to a fixed pair of zzso The zzso technique reduces the uncertainty introduced by positioning errors associated with very narrow zzso zzso The technique is presented in the context of an investigation into the effect of blood flow through large vessels on the efficacy of zzso procedures targeted near the zzso Application of the beam zzso method allowed conclusions regarding the effects of blood flow to be drawn from previously zzso (because of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso transient temperature profiles for flow rates of 0 and zzso showed that blood flow can reduce temperature zzso by more than zzso when the zzso focus is within a zzso distance from the vessel zzso At acoustic power levels of zzso and zzso there is a zzso to zzso decrease in zzso dose due to the zzso cooling effect of blood flow, zzso a shrinkage in zzso zzso The zzso technique also revealed the level of zzso artifact as a function of zzso time, providing investigators with an indication of the quality of zzso data for a given exposure zzso The maximum artifact was found to be double the measured temperature rise, during initial few seconds of zzso
