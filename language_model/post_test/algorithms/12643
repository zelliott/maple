zzso using the zzso Schmidt independence criterion zzso is a recent zzso zzso that zzso the dependence between cluster labels and data observations according to the zzso Schmidt independence criterion zzso It is unique in that structure information on the cluster zzso can be easily zzso in the zzso zzso However, while the choice of the loss function is known to be very important in supervised learning with structured zzso we will show in this paper that zzso is implicitly using the often inappropriate zzso zzso We propose an extension called zzso (which stands for zzso using zzso and zzso which explicitly considers both the output dependency and loss zzso Its zzso problem has the same form as zzso except that its partition zzso is constructed in a different zzso Experimental results on a number of zzso with structured zzso show that zzso often zzso zzso in terms of both structured loss and zzso zzso
