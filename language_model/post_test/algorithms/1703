The study enrolled 114 individuals with suspected PA who underwent two zzso zzso The patients were divided into two zzso In Group A, both tests were performed on the zzso therapy, zzso not interfering with the zzso zzso In Group B, the first test was performed on chronic therapy with the exclusion of zzso loop zzso and zzso zzso and the second test was performed on zzso zzso zzso infusion, preceded by oral sodium zzso was used to suppress zzso zzso 

zzso in the interpretation of the two zzso tests was observed in 84 and zzso of patients in Groups A and B zzso For all 20 individuals in Group A who ever had zzso serum zzso levels zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso during the other zzso Similarly, for all 16 individuals in Group B who had zzso serum zzso levels zzso zzso on modified chronic therapy, zzso remained zzso with zzso zzso 

zzso testing performed while the patient is on chronic therapy without zzso and zzso zzso can confirm the diagnosis of zzso provided serum zzso remains markedly elevated at the end of saline zzso
