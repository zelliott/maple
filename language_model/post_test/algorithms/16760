zzso of the zzso location of protein is integral to understanding its function and a necessity in the zzso zzso In this work, a new zzso data set is constructed, and an approach for predicting protein zzso locations is proposed by combining the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso properties, gene zzso evolutionary information, and zzso chemical zzso The overall prediction accuracy is zzso for the zzso location and zzso for the three membrane protein types in the zzso inner membrane using the zzso of the zzso of diversity combined with the support zzso zzso The performance of the zzso chemical shift is zzso For contrast, the method is also used to predict zzso locations in the data set constructed by zzso and zzso an accuracy of zzso is obtained by our method, which is better than that of other existing zzso
