zzso used to assess zzso demand during high-velocity tasks require zzso to aid zzso This paper zzso that, to date, zzso approaches to zzso have been ineffective and have limited the application of zzso zzso There is minimal investigation seeking alternative zzso methods, which must be corrected to improve zzso application in zzso It is recognized that differing zzso methods will prevent zzso zzso Users of zzso should aim to identify zzso methods that provide good reliability and a representative measure of muscle zzso The shortcomings of current zzso methods in high-velocity muscle actions assessment are zzso Advances in assessing alternate zzso methods have been done in cycling and zzso It is advised that when zzso high-intensity muscle actions, zzso methods are used with caution and a dynamic alternative, where the muscle action is similar to that of the task is zzso It is recognized that optimal zzso methods may be muscle and task zzso
