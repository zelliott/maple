We have developed an objective, zzso and general zzso to improve the zzso of three-dimensional reconstructions made from electron zzso while at the same time filtering much of the noise present in the recorded zzso The new technique is called constrained maximum zzso zzso zzso The essence of the method is that it will produce the most featureless reconstruction that fits the projection data within their zzso zzso In particular, the zzso procedure will zzso the zzso effects of errors in the measured data and zzso the effects of the contrast transfer zzso An objective test has been performed using zzso on a conventional image reconstruction obtained from zzso zzso of zzso The density for zzso the major coat protein of the virus, which is known to high resolution from X-ray zzso provided a known high-resolution zzso The zzso reconstruction is in considerably better agreement with the zzso electron density than the original zzso throughout the entire resolution zzso
