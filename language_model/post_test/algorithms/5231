The understanding of biological zzso binding processes is relevant for a variety of research topics and assists the rational design of novel drug zzso Computer simulation can help to advance this understanding, but, due to the high zzso of according systems, suffers from the severe zzso zzso Based on the framework provided by zzso dynamics and transition state theory, a novel zzso approach of simulating zzso binding processes is introduced, which is not dependent on calculating lengthy molecular dynamics zzso First, the relevant portion of zzso space is zzso with zzso zzso Then, each region is sampled zzso using hybrid zzso zzso Finally, the zzso binding process is reconstructed from the zzso zzso between the partial zzso obtained in the sampling zzso The method characterizes the zzso steps of the binding process and can yield the corresponding transition zzso
