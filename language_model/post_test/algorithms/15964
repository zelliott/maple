The zzso process for commercial production of zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso using zzso control based on artificial neural networks zzso The information required for process models was extracted from both historical data and zzso zzso After each zzso the process model was zzso zzso to include the most recent process zzso The control signal zzso zzso however, was zzso zzso at each sampling zzso An zzso simulated variations in the control signal and assessed the zzso model zzso according to an objective zzso The optimum feed profile for increasing the product yield zzso and the amount of zzso at the time of harvesting was adjusted continuously and applied to the zzso In contrast to the control by zzso profiles, the novel zzso is able to react zzso to variations in the process and also to incorporate the new process information zzso As a result, both the total amount of zzso produced and the product yield increased systematically by more than zzso and the zzso of seven subsequently zzso batches was zzso
