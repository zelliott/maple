The aim of our study was to compare four zzso for the measurement of respiratory resistance in adults using the zzso zzso Four methods to estimate zzso pressure from the mouth pressure during zzso were assessed in 122 normal adults zzso zzso 65 zzso aged zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso taking the mean zzso pressure zzso performing a linear back zzso zzso or a linear zzso for the whole curve zzso taking the zzso pressure zzso Mean values for zzso zzso and zzso in males were respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso s zzso not statistically zzso In females values were respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso s zzso not statistically zzso zzso was higher than the remainder and was the only measure zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso age zzso - zzso zzso height zzso r zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso age zzso + zzso zzso body mass index zzso zzso with r zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso We conclude that it is equivalent to estimate zzso pressure from or zzso it to the beginning of zzso in healthy adults but when taking the zzso pressure, resistance is higher and depends in part on zzso zzso
