A method for the analysis of vocal tract parameters is developed, aimed to perform quantitative analysis of rigidity from speech signals of zzso zzso The zzso area function of the vocal tract is calculated using pitch zzso zzso moving average zzso zzso The changes in zzso subjects of the zzso area during the zzso of sustained sounds are attributed to both zzso zzso and zzso In order to isolate the effects of the rigidity on the vocal tract from those of the zzso an zzso zzso cancellation zzso zzso is developed, based on the correlation of zzso signals extracted from different locations of the speech production zzso
