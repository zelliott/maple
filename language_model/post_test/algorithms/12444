The single tone extraction method zzso is a well developed zzso for zzso the frequency, zzso and phase of one periodic signal or a single tone in complex zzso zzso This method is useful in zzso research since it provides an efficient simple means to remove line frequency noise present in many types of signal zzso However, the method encounters problems when the signal contains zzso such as a stimulus artifact which distort the zzso of power line zzso Here we report a modification of zzso that overcomes this zzso In this new method we call zzso artifact windowed zzso the line frequency noise is removed for each single zzso by zzso the three parameters zzso zzso and zzso of each line frequency after zzso the time period containing an interfering transient and zzso applying the zzso In a simulation study we evaluated its performance for zzso data with a stimulus artifact and demonstrated advantages of the zzso over the classic zzso The zzso is able to efficiently extract the 60 zzso zzso requiring less than five zzso with a precision of zzso depending on the zzso It does not suffer from the problem of ringing following the stimulus artifact or distortion of zzso zzso It is fast enough to be used for single trial analyses in zzso zzso The zzso may be widely useful for the removal of periodic noise since it can be applied even when there are multiple interfering zzso in the zzso
