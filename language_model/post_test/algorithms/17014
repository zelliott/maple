To assess the prevalence and functional significance of zzso ambulatory zzso responses, we zzso performed ambulatory zzso monitoring in zzso patients zzso age 61 zzso 10 zzso referred for stress zzso zzso 201 zzso zzso zzso The prevalence of zzso depression during ambulatory zzso was zzso among patients with a positive exercise zzso but prevalence varied in selected patient zzso Among three groups with coronary artery disease zzso the group with ambulatory zzso zzso zzso 1) had a greater frequency of zzso zzso responses zzso zzso zzso a greater median number of zzso zzso defects zzso zzso zzso and a greater summed zzso zzso score zzso zzso zzso than did the group with a positive exercise zzso but negative ambulatory zzso response zzso 2) or that with negative exercise and ambulatory zzso responses zzso zzso Exercise ST depression in group 1 versus group 2 was significantly greater zzso zzso zzso occurred at a lower heart rate threshold zzso zzso zzso and lasted longer after exercise zzso zzso zzso zzso one third of group 1 patients also zzso evidence of transient zzso zzso of the left zzso after exercise zzso zzso zzso vs groups 2 and zzso a sign of severe zzso However, although functionally less zzso than group 1 patients, zzso of group 2 patients and 50% of group 3 patients still had an zzso zzso response, which was sometimes zzso Thus transient zzso during ambulatory zzso monitoring identifies a functionally sicker cohort of patients with zzso and occurs in approximately one third of zzso patients with positive results of exercise zzso A negative ambulatory zzso response, however, does not exclude functionally significant disease among zzso zzso These results imply that caution should be applied in the interpretation of a negative ambulatory zzso response for the purpose of patient risk zzso
