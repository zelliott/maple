In zzso zzso source zzso zzso is often formulated into a linear or zzso problem, depending on the choice of objective zzso However, the conventional approach for the resist image, involving a zzso transformation of the aerial image, results in an objective with a functional zzso The zzso of the zzso objective to SO or simultaneous source and mask zzso zzso is therefore zzso In this paper, we present a linear combination of two zzso zzso objectives to approximate the resist image effect for fast zzso The zzso objectives are based on the aerial image on drawn edges using a constant threshold resist model and that of zzso associated with an intensity minimum for zzso zzso A zzso zzso method is employed to assure the convergence to the global minimum within the number of zzso less than that of source zzso We further compare the zzso zzso with the proposed zzso objectives to that with a zzso zzso using a zzso decent zzso The results show a zzso zzso with comparable image zzso and a slightly improved process window for the two cases zzso
