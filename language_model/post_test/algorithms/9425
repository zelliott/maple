zzso zzso are rarely used in quantitative shotgun zzso due to potentially high false discovery zzso Yet, there are instances when application of a zzso zzso is desirable to obtain sufficient sequence coverage of otherwise poorly accessible proteins or structural zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso K, we analyzed zzso zzso preparations grown in zzso rich media and zzso minimal media and obtained relative zzso from the zzso using zzso spectral abundance factors zzso A critical step in using a spectral counting based approach for quantitative zzso is ensuring the inclusion of high quality zzso in the zzso One way to do this is to minimize the false discovery rate, which can be accomplished by applying different filters to a searched zzso Natural log transformation of zzso K derived zzso values followed a normal distribution and allowed for statistical analysis by the zzso Using this approach, we generated a zzso of zzso unique proteins found in each of the three independent biological zzso of which 84 showed a statistically significant difference in expression levels between the two growth zzso
