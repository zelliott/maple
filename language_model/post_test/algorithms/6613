Manual region tracing method for zzso of zzso zzso in images from diffusion zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is usually used in clinical works, but it is time zzso A new zzso method has been developed, which is a zzso zzso involving image zzso calculation of zzso field and measurement of diffusion zzso zzso of zzso volume based on zzso zzso statistical zzso zzso and partial volume zzso zzso zzso The method accounts for random noise, intensity zzso partial volume effect zzso and intensity zzso artifacts, which always appear in zzso zzso The proposed method was applied to 20 patients with clinically diagnosed brain zzso by zzso zzso The accuracy and zzso in terms of identifying the zzso zzso have been confirmed by clinical zzso This automatic zzso method is promising not only in detecting the location and the size of zzso zzso in stroke patient but also in zzso analyzing diffusion zzso of zzso to guide clinical diagnoses and zzso
