We evaluated our experience with zzso zzso zzso zzso of the small zzso vein zzso a less common procedure than great zzso vein zzso and developed a zzso system and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso based on modifications of our prior zzso of zzso following great zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was performed on symptomatic patients with incompetent zzso following a minimum of 3 months of zzso zzso zzso data, risk factors, zzso zzso procedure details, and follow-up data were zzso A zzso zzso system and treatment zzso was developed, based on zzso proximity to the zzso zzso 

Eighty limbs (in 76 zzso were treated with zzso of the zzso between January 2008 and August zzso Duplex ultrasound was performed between 24 and 72 hours zzso in all zzso zzso was successful in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso patients had level A zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso to zzso zzso and 10 patients zzso had level B zzso zzso with zzso zzso and were zzso Two limbs zzso had zzso extending into the zzso vein zzso zzso and were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the level of the zzso junction in both patients following a short course of zzso No patient developed an zzso deep vein zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean follow-up period was zzso zzso no patient had small zzso zzso zzso zzso or pulmonary zzso The presence or absence of the zzso vein was not zzso of level B and C zzso
