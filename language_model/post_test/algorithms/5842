We address the global stability issue for some discrete population models with zzso zzso zzso a new approach based on the concept of the generalized zzso conditions, we establish several criteria for the convergence of all solutions to the unique positive steady zzso Our results support the conjecture stated by Levin and May in 1976 affirming that the local zzso stability of the equilibrium of some delay difference equations (including zzso and zzso zzso implies its global zzso We also discuss the zzso of the obtained results with respect to zzso of the zzso
