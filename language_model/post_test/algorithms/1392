The accuracy of zzso lens zzso power calculation was evaluated in a zzso study of zzso zzso zzso using the zzso II, zzso zzso I, zzso II, zzso zzso and Olsen zzso All but the first of these were zzso in zzso with calculation of the zzso zzso the zzso surgeon factor, and the Olsen zzso anterior chamber depth zzso for each lens zzso The zzso prediction of the Olsen formula was based on a previously described zzso formula incorporating zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and lens zzso Among the optical zzso power calculation formulas, the highest zzso power prediction error was found with zzso and the lowest with zzso which was more accurate than the zzso and the zzso formulas zzso zzso zzso The zzso formula was significantly more accurate than the original zzso zzso formulas zzso zzso zzso When analyzed for zzso length zzso all formulas showed the least error in the normal zzso zzso of the Olsen formula was lower than that of the others in the zzso length zzso 20 zzso to 26 zzso No differences in accuracy were found between the optical zzso calculation formulas in eyes with an zzso length above 26 zzso zzso zzso zzso The accuracy of zzso power calculation can be improved with optical formulas using zzso zzso zzso
