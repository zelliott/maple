zzso interactions play an important role in all biological zzso However, the principles underlying these interactions are only beginning to be zzso zzso is a small zzso protein that is zzso attached to different proteins to mark them for degradation, regulate transport and other zzso As such, it interacts with and is zzso by a multitude of other zzso We have conducted molecular dynamics simulations of zzso in complex with 11 different binding partners on a zzso zzso and compared them with ensembles of zzso zzso to investigate the principles of their interaction and determine the influence of complex formation on the dynamic properties of this zzso Along the main mode of fluctuation of zzso binding in most cases reduces the zzso space available to zzso to a zzso of that covered by zzso zzso This zzso can be well explained using the model of zzso zzso For lower zzso collective zzso a spectrum of zero to almost complete coverage of bound by zzso ensembles was zzso The significant differences between bound and zzso structures are exclusively situated at the binding zzso Overall, the findings zzso neither to a complete zzso selection nor induced fit zzso Instead, we introduce a model of zzso zzso extension and shift, which describes the full range of observed zzso
