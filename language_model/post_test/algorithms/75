zzso zzso diffusion weighting is expected to represent a possibility to acquire information on cell size and zzso In zzso simulations, a theoretical description of the double wave zzso signal is tested in a situation where the zzso assumptions zzso short zzso zzso infinitely long diffusion time, infinitely long or zero delay between diffusion weightings, small zzso zzso are not strictly zzso It is shown how the dependence of the signal on the angle between the diffusion zzso directions changes upon varying the delay between the second and the third zzso pulse, and how the measures of pore geometry derived from signal differences between two angles depend on the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso The results indicate that a violation of the approximation conditions due to finite zzso pulse duration and separation generally leads to an zzso of pore size and pore zzso It is also concluded from the simulations that for pore sizes on the order of 10 zzso the investigated effects are in a range that is zzso even with zzso zzso zzso
