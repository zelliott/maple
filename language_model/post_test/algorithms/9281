zzso acid zzso levels have demonstrated a good correlation with clinical zzso but with great zzso zzso between zzso zzso drug monitoring zzso is recommended to include a 12-hour area under the zzso curve zzso Since full zzso estimates are not practical for routine monitoring, limited sampling strategies have been zzso We evaluated zzso zzso in 18 stable zzso transplant patients receiving zzso zzso zzso as part of their zzso zzso The correlation between measured and estimated zzso was assessed using 4 different sparse sampling zzso The mean values for zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso Regarding the single time points, zzso showed a low correlation with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the best correlation zzso zzso zzso and zzso the worst zzso zzso zzso zzso sample zzso used to estimate 12-hour zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso showed a good correlation with the calculated zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso that used zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed the best zzso but we also found a good correlation zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso Based on these results, we have suggested using the 3-point zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso in stable zzso transplant patients due to the good correlation with drug exposure and better functionality than an zzso using a zzso zzso zzso
