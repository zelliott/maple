This paper presents a flexible structure zzso zzso zzso zzso neural network zzso and its application to water quality zzso The zzso can vary its structure zzso in order to maintain the prediction zzso The hidden zzso in the zzso neural network can be added or removed online based on the zzso activity and mutual information zzso to achieve the appropriate network complexity and maintain overall zzso zzso The convergence of the zzso is analyzed in both the dynamic process phase and the phase following the modification of the zzso The proposed zzso has been tested and compared to other zzso by applying it to the problem of identifying a zzso dynamic zzso Experimental results show that the zzso can be used to design an zzso structure which has fewer hidden zzso the training time is also much zzso The zzso is applied for predicting water quality in the wastewater treatment zzso The results demonstrate its zzso
