The recent explosion in procurement and availability of zzso zzso and zzso profile zzso for cancer zzso has necessitated the development of sophisticated machine learning tools with which to analyze zzso A major limitation in the ability to accurate zzso these zzso zzso stems from the zzso of zzso occurring in situations where the number of genes or peptides significantly exceeds the total number of patient zzso Previous attempts at dealing with this issue have mostly centered on the use of a zzso reduction zzso zzso Principal zzso Analysis zzso to obtain a zzso projection of the zzso zzso However, linear zzso and other linear DR methods, which rely on zzso distances to estimate object zzso do not account for the inherent underlying zzso structure associated with most biomedical zzso The motivation behind this work is to identify the appropriate DR methods for analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso this end, we zzso and rigorously compare three zzso zzso zzso Linear zzso zzso zzso and three linear DR schemes zzso Linear zzso zzso zzso zzso with the intent of determining a reduced zzso representation in which the individual object classes are more easily zzso
