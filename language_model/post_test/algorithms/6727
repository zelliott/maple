The purposes of this study were to develop a method to measure brain and white matter zzso zzso volume that is based on the zzso of the intensity zzso of zzso inversion recovery zzso images and to assess the accuracy and zzso of the zzso zzso synthetic image zzso with manually introduced zzso zzso of varying severity were zzso These synthetic image phantom sets incorporated image contrast and zzso features that zzso zzso found in real zzso One set of synthetic image zzso was used to develop the zzso zzso zzso A second set was used to measure its zzso Test zzso zzso was assessed in 10 elderly volunteers who were zzso zzso The mean absolute error of the zzso method was zzso for measurement of zzso volume and zzso for brain zzso The mean test zzso zzso of variation was zzso for zzso volume and zzso for brain zzso We conclude that the zzso method is an accurate and zzso method for measuring zzso and zzso volume in elderly zzso
