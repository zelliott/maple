Early infant zzso diagnosis and treatment substantially improve zzso Where zzso zzso testing is zzso integrated management of childhood illness zzso clinical zzso may be used for infant zzso zzso We evaluated the performance of the 2008 WHO zzso zzso zzso in a cohort of zzso Kenyan zzso 

From 1999 to 2003, zzso infants had monthly clinical assessments and quarterly zzso zzso zzso Using zzso clinical data, zzso sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value zzso and negative zzso value zzso were calculated using zzso testing as a gold zzso Linear zzso and survival analyses were used to determine the effect of age on zzso performance and timing of zzso 

zzso zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso and zzso value were 58, 87, 52, and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were lowest at 1 month of age, when zzso of zzso infections already had zzso zzso increased with age zzso zzso zzso but remained low throughout infancy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was high at each time point and was not associated with zzso zzso percent of zzso infants zzso of zzso were eventually diagnosed by zzso and use of zzso was estimated to delay diagnosis in zzso infants by a median of zzso months zzso zzso zzso 

zzso had low sensitivity during the first month of life, when the majority of zzso infections had already occurred and initiation of treatment is most zzso Although sensitivity increased with age, the substantial delay in zzso diagnosis using zzso limits its utility in early infant zzso zzso
