Recent studies have attempted to predict the severity of zzso zzso from color zzso jet size, which is a function of orifice momentum for free zzso Jets of zzso and zzso zzso however, are opposed by flows entering the zzso Despite their low zzso these zzso may have considerable momentum that can limit jet zzso The purpose of this study was to address the hypothesis that such zzso fields influence zzso jet zzso Steady flow was driven through zzso and zzso circular zzso at 2 to 6 zzso At a constant orifice zzso and flow rate, the zzso of a uniform zzso field was varied from 5 to 30 zzso Jet dimensions were measured by both fluorescent dye zzso and zzso color flow zzso The results showed that despite its relatively low zzso zzso dramatically curtailed jet length and zzso Jet dimensions were functions of the ratio of jet to zzso zzso Thus, zzso inflow may participate in determining jet size and can alter the relation between jet size and zzso severity in zzso and zzso zzso
