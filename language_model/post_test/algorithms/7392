zzso zzso has been widely used for the diagnosis of various zzso zzso Although there have been advances in the number of zzso that can be analyzed simultaneously and technologies that enable fast performance, the diagnostic data are still interpreted by a manual gating zzso The process is zzso zzso and subject to human zzso 

We used 80 sets of flow zzso data from 44 healthy donors, 21 patients with chronic zzso leukemia zzso and 15 patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of data from each group were used to build the zzso Our approach was able to successfully identify zzso healthy donor cases, zzso zzso cases, and zzso FL zzso 

This zzso study demonstrated that an automated diagnosis of zzso and FL can be obtained by examining the cell capture rates of a test case using the zzso method based on the zzso detection zzso The testing phase of our system is efficient and can facilitate diagnosis of zzso zzso
