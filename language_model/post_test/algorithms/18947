The aim is to fill a water storage with zzso water of a given quality, for subsequent treatment and distribution to a water conveying zzso During a given period, a set of several pumping stations is working to deliver water from different sources at different zzso A zzso control process is considered zzso the total pumping time is divided into short sampling zzso The intensity of pumping as a function of time is the control zzso It is assumed that there exists a reliable forecast of every zzso as a function of time and water zzso The amount of the pollutants are constrained in the final mass of water in the zzso The mass of water at the end of the operation period should be zzso A linear programming zzso model of the problem is zzso and an zzso of the reduction of its zzso is zzso An illustrative example is zzso
