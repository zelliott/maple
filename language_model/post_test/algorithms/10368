We compared the effectiveness of the new WHO 2007 diagnostic zzso for pulmonary tuberculosis zzso for zzso prevalent settings zzso to the WHO 2003 guidelines used by the Ugandan National zzso Program zzso and most other countries for the diagnosis of zzso zzso 

A prospective zzso cohort design was employed under routine operational conditions at a District Hospital in zzso zzso diagnosed patients with zzso and enrolled to the zzso zzso clinic were assessed for possible zzso The study was in 2 zzso with evaluation of the zzso and zzso over the first and second zzso zzso 

One hundred zzso enrolled onto the zzso and 166 onto zzso There were significant reductions in the geometric mean days zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and number of health facility visits zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso from presentation to diagnosis of all zzso for the zzso compared with the zzso For zzso zzso the geometric mean days zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and number of health facility visits zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso from presentation to diagnosis were zzso zzso zzso sensitivity zzso confidence zzso for zzso zzso increased zzso from zzso zzso to zzso to zzso zzso to zzso for the zzso with specificity zzso confidence zzso remaining high at zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso 

zzso the new zzso is likely to reduce the number of days and increase sensitivity for diagnosis of zzso cases of zzso We identified many barriers to implementing both guidelines in zzso prevalent resource-poor zzso
