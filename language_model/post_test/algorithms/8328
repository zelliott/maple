A method is presented for the quantitative analysis of delayed zzso effects resulting from the treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso By using zzso zzso flow zzso we could observe the zzso of late zzso cells with zzso high green zzso zzso protein zzso indicative of unbalanced zzso The use of zzso cells from a zzso line zzso as external markers for both red and green zzso facilitated highly zzso measurement of the mean green zzso zzso of the arrested late zzso zzso We found that the dose dependence of the observed zzso values followed the same unusual zzso pattern as did zzso in this cell line, indicating that this zzso might be a suitable means of predicting zzso toxicity in zzso We propose that the low background expected for this kind of measurement would make it particularly appropriate for the analysis of clinical specimens zzso zzso bone zzso zzso from zzso patients receiving zzso to monitor (and, zzso zzso their response to zzso
