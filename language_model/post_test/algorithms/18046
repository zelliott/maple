Information extraction zzso efforts are widely acknowledged to be important in harnessing the rapid advance of biomedical knowledge, particularly in areas where important factual information is published in a diverse zzso Here we report on the design, zzso and several evaluations of zzso an zzso integrated concept analysis zzso It significantly advances the state of the art in information extraction by leveraging knowledge in zzso resources, zzso diverse text processing applications, and using an expanded pattern language that allows the mixing of zzso and semantic elements and variable zzso 

zzso information extraction systems were produced for zzso protein transport assertions zzso zzso interaction assertions zzso and assertions that a gene is expressed in a cell type zzso zzso were performed on each system, resulting in zzso ranging from zzso zzso zzso recall zzso Additionally, each of these systems was run over all abstracts in zzso producing a total of zzso transport instances, zzso interaction instances and zzso expression zzso 

zzso advances the performance standards for zzso zzso interaction zzso from the full texts of biomedical research zzso Furthermore, this level of performance appears to zzso to other information extraction tasks, including zzso information about zzso of more than two zzso The output of the information extraction system is always constructed from elements of an zzso ensuring that the knowledge representation is grounded with respect to a carefully constructed model of zzso The results of these efforts can be used to increase the efficiency of manual zzso efforts and to provide additional features in systems that integrate multiple sources for information zzso The open source zzso code library is freely available at zzso
