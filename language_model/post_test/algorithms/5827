The zzso of the surface zzso does not reach the level achieved during a zzso voluntary contraction force at the end of a zzso zzso contraction, despite zzso levels of voluntary zzso The depression of zzso zzso may be explained by several neural and muscular adjustments during fatiguing zzso including decreased net neural drive to the muscle, changes in the shape of the motor unit action zzso and zzso zzso zzso The changes in these parameters for the entire motor unit pool, however, cannot be measured zzso The present study used a zzso model to simulate the adjustments during sustained zzso zzso and thereby determine the relative importance of these factors in explaining the zzso levels of zzso zzso at task zzso The simulation results indicated that the amount of zzso cancellation in the simulated zzso zzso zzso exhibited a negligible change during the fatiguing zzso Instead, the main zzso of the zzso zzso zzso at task failure was a decrease in muscle zzso zzso of muscle fiber action zzso due to a reduction in the net synaptic input to motor zzso with a lesser contribution from changes in the shape of the motor unit action zzso Despite the association between the zzso zzso zzso and reduced muscle zzso the deficit in zzso zzso at task failure was not consistently associated with the decrease in neural drive zzso of motor unit action zzso to the zzso This indicates that the zzso zzso cannot be used as an index of neural zzso
