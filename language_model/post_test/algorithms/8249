Our ability to explore our surroundings requires a combination of high-resolution vision and frequent zzso of the visual axis toward objects of zzso Such gaze shifts are themselves a source of powerful retinal zzso and so the visual system appears to have evolved mechanisms to maintain zzso stability during movements of the eyes in zzso The mechanisms underlying this zzso stability can be zzso in the laboratory by briefly presenting a stimulus around the time of a zzso eye movement and asking subjects to report its zzso Under such conditions, there is a systematic zzso of the zzso toward the zzso end zzso This zzso zzso of visual space has been the subject of much research, but few studies have attempted to relate it to specific brain zzso Here, we show that the magnitude of zzso zzso for a wide variety of probe stimuli and zzso zzso is zzso predicted by a simple zzso model based on the geometry of zzso representations in the zzso zzso Specifically, we propose that zzso zzso is determined by the distance between the probe and zzso end point on a map that has a zzso representation of visual space, similar to those found in numerous cortical and zzso visual zzso Under this zzso the zzso data on zzso zzso can be appreciated intuitively by imagining that, around the time of a zzso the brain confounds nearby zzso and sensory signals while attempting to zzso the position of objects in visual zzso
