zzso disposal of municipal solid waste zzso requires assurance that contaminant release will be minimized or prevented within a reasonable time frame before the landfill is abandoned so that the risk of contamination release is not passed to future zzso This could be accomplished through waste acceptance criteria such as those established by the European Union zzso that prohibit land disposal of zzso organic zzso In the zzso zzso biological and/or zzso zzso of zzso is therefore necessary prior to zzso which is complicated and zzso In other parts of the world, treatment within highly engineered landfills is under development, known as zzso zzso However, the completed zzso landfill still contains material, largely zzso carbon and zzso that may be released to the environment over the zzso This paper provides a conceptual analysis of an approach to ensure landfill zzso by the rapid removal of these remaining materials, zzso treatment and zzso combined with zzso The analysis in this paper includes a preliminary experimental evaluation using real mature zzso and waste samples, a modeling effort using a simplified mass balance approach and input parameters from real typical zzso cases, and a cost estimate for the suggested treatment zzso
