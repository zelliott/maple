zzso analyses require sequence alignments that correctly represent evolutionary zzso zzso and structural zzso are not the same and sequence alignments generated with methods designed for structural matching can be seriously misleading in comparative and zzso zzso The zzso alignment zzso implemented in the program zzso has been shown to produce good alignments for evolutionary zzso Unlike other alignment programs, zzso makes use of zzso information to distinguish alignment gaps caused by insertions or deletions and, thereafter, handles the two types of events zzso As a zzso of the correct handling of insertions and zzso zzso can provide the zzso ancestral sequences as a part of the output and mark the alignment gaps differently depending on their origin in zzso or deletion zzso As the zzso zzso the evolutionary history of the zzso zzso can be sensitive to errors in the guide zzso and violations on the underlying assumptions about the origin and patterns of zzso These issues are discussed in detail and practical advice for the use of zzso in evolutionary analysis is zzso The zzso software and other methods discussed here can be found from the program home page at zzso
