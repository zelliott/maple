The zzso zzso Technologies zzso initiative of the US Food and Drug Administration zzso zzso has established a framework for the development of imaging techniques to determine the real-time distribution of mixture components during the production of solid dosage zzso This study, which is the first in a series of two parts, uses existing mixing zzso and a new criterion called the zzso of zzso zzso to assess image zzso Image analysis techniques use feature extraction procedures to extract information from images subjected to treatments including zzso zzso and zzso The surface distribution of components was determined by zzso analysis, which splits an image into zzso blocks of a zzso size and zzso several statistical parameters for the resulting divisional zzso Such parameters were used to zzso mixing zzso In this work, we explored the potential of image processing in combination with mixing zzso and zzso for assessing blending zzso and component distribution on zzso As a simplified test, an arrangement of zzso and zzso systems of zzso particles was mixed collecting zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso pictures at zzso zzso
