We analyze zzso propagation of light in an unknown hidden volume and demonstrate that the reflected light contains sufficient information to recover the zzso structure of the hidden zzso We formulate the forward and inverse theory of secondary scattering using ideas from energy front propagation and zzso We show that using zzso approximation greatly zzso this problem and the inversion can be achieved via a zzso zzso We study the zzso uniqueness and choices of zzso dimensions using synthetic zzso We show that a zzso streak camera can be used to discover and reconstruct hidden zzso Using a zzso high speed time of flight camera, we show that our method can be used recover zzso shapes of objects zzso the zzso
