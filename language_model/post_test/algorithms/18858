zzso of zzso performance is important for many biomedical zzso A zzso model which considers reliability in the development of the model such that unreliable segments are rejected would be useful, particularly, in large biomedical data zzso This approach is demonstrated in the development of a technique to reliably determine sleep and wake using only the zzso zzso of zzso Typically, sleep state scoring is a time consuming task in which sleep states are manually derived from many zzso zzso The method was tested with simultaneous zzso zzso and zzso zzso determined sleep scores from 190 infants enrolled in the collaborative home infant monitoring evaluation zzso zzso Learning zzso zzso zzso neural network, zzso zzso zzso neural network, and support zzso machines zzso are tested as the zzso After systematic rejection of difficult to zzso zzso the models can achieve zzso correct zzso while rejecting only zzso of the zzso This zzso to a Kappa statistic of zzso With zzso accuracy improves by about zzso over a model without zzso Additionally, the impact of the zzso scored indeterminate state epochs is zzso The advantages of a reliable zzso zzso based only on zzso include high zzso simplicity of use, and low zzso zzso of the zzso can be built directly in the model, such that unreliable segments are zzso
