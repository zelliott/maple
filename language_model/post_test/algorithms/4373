In cancer studies with zzso genetic and zzso zzso zzso analysis provides a way to effectively pool and analyze zzso raw data from multiple independent studies and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso When marker selection is of interest, the genetic basis of multiple zzso can be described using the zzso model or the zzso zzso In this study, we consider marker selection under the zzso model, which includes the zzso model as a special case and can be more zzso zzso methods have been developed in the literature for marker zzso This study advances from the published ones by introducing the contrast penalties, which can accommodate the zzso and zzso structures of zzso zzso and, by doing so, further improve marker selection zzso Specifically, we develop a zzso method that zzso the zzso structures by smoothing over zzso zzso An effective zzso algorithm, which calls an inner coordinate descent zzso is zzso zzso shows that the proposed method zzso the benchmark with more accurate marker zzso The analysis of breast cancer and lung cancer prognosis studies with gene expression zzso shows that the proposed method identifies genes different from those using the benchmark and has better prediction zzso
