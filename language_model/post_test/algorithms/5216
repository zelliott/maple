zzso resonance zzso zzso is an imaging zzso capable of visualizing the elastic properties of an object using magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso of zzso acoustic strain waves induced in the object by a zzso zzso mechanical zzso Various zzso have been designed to determine the mechanical properties of the object under the assumptions of linear zzso zzso and local zzso One of the challenging problems in zzso is to reduce the noise effects and to maintain contrast in the reconstructed zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we propose a new zzso designed to reduce the degree of noise amplification in the reconstructed zzso zzso images without the assumption of local zzso zzso the relation between the measured displacement data and the stress wave zzso the proposed zzso uses an zzso reconstruction formula based on a decomposition of the stress wave zzso zzso simulation experiments and real experiments with zzso gel zzso and human liver data demonstrate that the proposed zzso is more robust to noise compared to standard inversion zzso and zzso determines the zzso zzso
