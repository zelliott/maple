zzso zzso photographic patterns are zzso described and zzso zzso Forty normal color zzso photographs were zzso The green channel zzso data were filtered and contrast zzso then analyzed for zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso data for five images were fit with zzso zzso zzso in two zzso a central zzso and a surrounding zzso The ability of the model to reconstruct the entire zzso data from selected zzso values was zzso The zzso patterns were zzso sets of concentric zzso Gray levels increased zzso with retinal vessels changing the patterns to star shaped in the peripheral zzso The zzso zzso model could fit a high-resolution green channel zzso image with mean absolute errors of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso images were reconstructed from small numbers of selected zzso values with mean errors of zzso Digital analysis of normal zzso photographs shows finely resolved concentric elliptical zzso and zzso zzso patterns, which are consistent with anatomical zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso model can approximate zzso data, and can also reconstruct it from small subsets, allowing improved zzso image zzso
