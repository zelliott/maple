The role of zzso zzso in the detection and staging of benign and zzso brain tumors is being investigated in this study, with an additional aim of determining an optimum zzso wavelength for the zzso identification of brain zzso 

The present study involves zzso zzso monitoring of different human brain tumor samples to assess their zzso zzso The zzso measurement at four different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 470 zzso were carried out for five different brain tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

The zzso zzso of tumor zzso showed significant differences, both in intensity and in spectral profile, from those of adjacent normal brain zzso at all four zzso zzso The data were then subjected to zzso statistical analysis and the sensitivities and zzso were calculated for each zzso Of the four zzso zzso being considered, 470 zzso appeared to be the optimal wavelength for detecting tissue zzso of brain tumor zzso 

In conclusion, the zzso zzso zzso carried out in this study revealed significant differences between tumor tissue and adjacent normal tissue of human brains for all the tumor types tested, except for zzso zzso From the results of this study we conclude that zzso zzso ranging from zzso zzso are most suitable for the detection of brain tumor zzso Moreover, in this particular study, only zzso at 470 zzso indicated that samples we considered to be normal tissue were not normal, and that these were indeed zzso zzso zzso This distinction was not clear at other zzso zzso
