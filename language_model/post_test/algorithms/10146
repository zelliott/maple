Since no direct detection method for zzso blood zzso exists, the most promising attempt is the zzso Biological Passport zzso and its zzso model that enables a zzso monitoring of zzso measures to identify patterns of blood zzso The purpose therefore was to evaluate the performance of this zzso model for the detection of zzso blood zzso in a zzso blinded zzso 

zzso subjects were divided into a doped group (multiple zzso of 1-2 units of red blood cells, zzso and a control group zzso The time course of a cycling season zzso weeks) was simulated including three major competitions zzso Grand zzso World zzso Up to 10 zzso blood samples were ordered per subject by a blinded investigator mimicking the intelligent approach in obtaining zzso data for the zzso model zzso zzso zzso zzso percentage, zzso 

zzso analysis allowed identification of four zzso zzso or three zzso zzso abnormal samples for zzso and eight zzso zzso or five zzso zzso abnormal samples for zzso in doped zzso Four doped subjects zzso presented an abnormal zzso sequence and three doped subjects zzso an abnormal zzso zzso there were no zzso sequence zzso The best possible sensitivity was zzso when a combination of all tests was zzso 

This investigation provides evidence that the zzso model allows detection of zzso blood zzso with a good zzso An intelligent testing approach and the adherence to World Anti-Doping Agency's zzso operating guidelines are nevertheless zzso in the zzso
