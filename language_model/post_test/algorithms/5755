The prediction of protein zzso zzso is central for understanding protein zzso zzso packing is a zzso of protein folding and its zzso complexity has been shown to be zzso We investigated the capabilities of a hybrid zzso zzso zzso technique for zzso packing and for the generation of an ensemble of low energy zzso zzso Our method first relies on obtaining a zzso low energy protein zzso by zzso its zzso zzso Upon zzso the genetic zzso is allowed to undergo forward and zzso evolution by alternating selection pressures between minimal and higher energy zzso We show that this technique is very efficient for obtaining zzso of solutions centered at any desired energy from the zzso We outline the general concepts of our evolutionary sampling methodology using three different alternating selective pressure zzso Quality of the method was assessed by using it for protein zzso zzso
