zzso zzso liquids are known to improve gas exchange and pulmonary function in various models of acute respiratory zzso zzso has been recently reported as a new method of delivering zzso to the zzso Our aim was to study the effect of zzso vapor on the zzso zzso matching and relative pulmonary blood flow zzso zzso 

In nine zzso lung injury was induced using zzso zzso Four sheep were treated with zzso zzso zzso for 30 zzso whereas the remaining sheep served as control zzso zzso was achieved using a modified zzso zzso The animals were studied for 90 zzso after zzso zzso zzso were estimated using the multiple zzso gas elimination zzso Change in zzso distribution was assessed using zzso zzso 

Treatment with zzso vapor improved zzso significantly and led to significantly lower shunt values zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso Analysis of the multiple zzso gas elimination technique data showed that animals treated with zzso vapor demonstrated a higher zzso zzso than the control animals zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso data showed a zzso of zzso attributable to zzso acid zzso zzso shifted from areas that were initially zzso to areas that were initially zzso with no difference in zzso between the zzso After established injury, zzso was redistributed to the zzso lung areas in control animals, whereas zzso distribution did not change in treatment zzso 

In zzso acid lung injury, treatment with zzso vapor improves gas exchange by increasing zzso zzso in the whole lung without a significant change in zzso zzso
