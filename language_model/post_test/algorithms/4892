The zzso equations are frequently used to model the propagation of cardiac action zzso across cardiac zzso At the whole organ level, the size of the zzso mesh required makes their solution a significant zzso zzso As the accuracy of the zzso solution cannot be compromised, efficiency of the solution technique is important to ensure that the results of the simulation can be obtained in a reasonable time while still zzso the complexities of the zzso In an attempt to increase efficiency of the zzso the zzso equations are often zzso into one zzso equation that is zzso very cheap to solve and an zzso equation that is much more expensive to zzso In this study, the performance of this zzso solution method is compared with an alternative strategy in which the zzso equations are solved as a coupled zzso This seems counterintuitive as the alternative method requires the solution of a much larger linear system at each time zzso However, in tests on two 3-D rabbit zzso zzso it is shown that the coupled method is up to zzso faster than the conventional zzso zzso that parallel performance is better for the larger coupled zzso
