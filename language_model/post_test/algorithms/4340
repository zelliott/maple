For acquired mechanical prosthetic heart valve zzso obstruction and suspicion on zzso recently updated European Society of zzso guidelines advocate the confirmation of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, no evidence-based diagnostic zzso is available for correct zzso zzso although this is clinically important as zzso is zzso in zzso obstruction zzso zzso Here, we performed a review of the literature in order to propose a diagnostic zzso 

We performed a systematic search in zzso and zzso Included publications were assessed on zzso quality based on the validated Quality Assessment of zzso zzso Studies zzso II zzso Studies were scarce zzso zzso zzso and the majority were of moderate zzso zzso In total, zzso mechanical zzso with acquired obstruction and a reliable reference standard were included for the evaluation of the role of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso In acquired zzso obstruction caused by zzso mass detection by zzso and leaflet restriction detected by zzso were observed in the majority of cases zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, in acquired zzso obstruction free of zzso zzso leaflet restriction detected by zzso was absent in some cases zzso and mass detection by zzso was absent in the majority of cases zzso In case of mass detection by zzso zzso for zzso zzso masses zzso with zzso zzso were leaflet zzso soft echo density, and increased mass zzso In situations of zzso zzso zzso may correctly detect zzso based on the zzso aspects and zzso 

In acquired mechanical zzso obstruction without leaflet restriction and absent mass on zzso zzso zzso zzso cannot be confirmed and consequently, zzso is not zzso Based on the literature search and our opinion, a diagnostic zzso is provided to correctly identify zzso zzso zzso which is highly relevant in daily clinical zzso
