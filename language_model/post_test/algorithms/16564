Our objective was to investigate the nutritional requirements in ALS and to determine the feasibility of early intervention with zzso zzso were enrolled into one of two zzso In the nutrition arm, total daily energy expenditure zzso was determined zzso over 48 weeks using the zzso zzso Water zzso In the zzso arm, zzso was offered at zzso zzso 50% zzso Additional zzso were obtained in both arms to ultimately formulate equations to predict zzso and to estimate sample size for a phase III study of early zzso Eighty subjects were enrolled in the nutrition arm and 73 in the zzso zzso zzso characteristics of the participants are zzso zzso was available for 80 subjects in zzso independent zzso during disease zzso Other variables were measured simultaneously for future modeling of zzso equations to predict zzso In the zzso arm, rates of progression to the criteria for zzso intervention zzso or 50% predicted zzso were zzso Additional factors were obtained zzso to develop zzso of early zzso zzso The results of this study will allow us to model equations to predict the energy requirements in ALS and to plan a study of early intervention with zzso
