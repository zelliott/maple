A new approach to compensate zzso zzso is zzso Based on the idea of the response theory of a linear system, a formula is derived to obtain the required zzso zzso profile back from the intended target zzso zzso The zzso of the formula is zzso confirmed by monitoring the zzso created inside the sample zzso with a pickup zzso Since this approach realizes accurate zzso shapes without reducing the zzso of the tank circuit of the probe, it can be used not only to suppress the transient tail of the zzso but also as a general concept for accurate zzso
