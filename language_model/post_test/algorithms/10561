This paper presents a zzso neural network, which is trained by an improved genetic zzso zzso The zzso neural network consists of a zzso network and a modified neural zzso In the modified neural network, a zzso model with two zzso functions is used so that the degree of freedom of the network function can be zzso The zzso network zzso some of the parameters of the zzso zzso It will be shown that the performance of the proposed zzso neural network is better than that of the traditional neural network with a similar number of zzso An improved zzso is proposed to train the parameters of the proposed zzso zzso of improved genetic operations are zzso The performance of the improved zzso will be shown to be better than that of the traditional zzso Some application examples are given to illustrate the merits of the proposed neural network and the improved zzso
