To determine the proper method for the zzso of spinal zzso zzso 

A group of 34 multiple sclerosis zzso patients zzso zzso and 6 zzso and 15 healthy controls had whole spinal zzso zzso thick zzso zzso fast zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso images obtained at zzso For each zzso four volumes were measured zzso volume, cervical zzso volume, zzso zzso volume, and whole zzso zzso The volumes were zzso by the number of slices and three potential measures of body size zzso volume zzso body mass index, and body surface zzso using the zzso zzso 

All raw volumes and volumes zzso by number of slices or zzso were significantly lower in progressive zzso patients compared to zzso zzso zzso controls zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso volume and cervical zzso volume were significantly correlated with Expanded zzso zzso zzso score zzso zzso zzso All regional volumes showed high zzso and zzso by the number of slices significantly increased some zzso Regarding zzso whole zzso volume regardless of zzso technique had lower zzso of variation than zzso zzso 

Since zzso factor had limited impact on reliability and the ability to detect differences, zzso by the number of slices is zzso
