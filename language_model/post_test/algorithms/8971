For several of the proteins in the zzso larger than 200 zzso 60 % or fewer of the backbone zzso were zzso But how reliable are those zzso In contrast to complete assignments, where it is possible to check whether every zzso zzso Spin System zzso is assigned once and only once, with incomplete data one should compare all possible assignments and pick the best zzso But that is not zzso For example, for 200 zzso and an incomplete set of 100 zzso there are zzso zzso zzso possible zzso In zzso the protein sequence is divided in smaller unique zzso Combined with intelligent search approaches, an exhaustive comparison of all possible assignments is now feasible using a laptop zzso The program was tested with experimental data of a zzso domain of the zzso zzso protein zzso and for a zzso domain of a type III zzso zzso zzso reproduced the hand zzso It did slightly better than the computer program zzso zzso et zzso in PLoS zzso zzso zzso zzso and significantly outperformed zzso zzso et zzso in J zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso in J zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and Wagner in J zzso zzso zzso zzso Next, zzso was used to investigate how well zzso data of decreasing zzso can be zzso We found that the program could confidently assign fragments in very incomplete zzso Here, zzso dramatically outperformed all the other assignment programs zzso
