The zzso fractional zzso noise zzso has been proven to be a regular zzso According to zzso and zzso zzso this process can be described as an zzso zzso model of an infinite zzso An zzso for the zzso zzso based on zzso power spectrum zzso has been proposed, but without considering order zzso In this paper, six common order selection methods for the zzso model were used to select appropriate orders of the zzso model in order to raise the accuracy of zzso the zzso zzso Experimental results show that these six zzso methods with considering order selection are more accurate than the original zzso method without considering order zzso
