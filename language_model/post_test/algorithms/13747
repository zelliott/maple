This paper describes a system that has been developed for measuring two-dimensional zzso in real time using zzso The instrument tracks zzso zzso pattern motion using a zzso zzso zzso in order to produce a zzso map of zzso zzso The system's parallel architecture allows calculation of approximately 20,000 zzso per second using the current tracking zzso A zzso graphics zzso encodes individual zzso zzso with color and displays them superimposed on the zzso image in real zzso In zzso tests indicate that the system can track zzso well over the zzso zzso limit in any direction in the scan plane with greater than zzso zzso A color zzso image obtained from a flow phantom highlights the system's ability to display lateral motion with uniform zzso in contrast to the zzso display of current zzso zzso zzso
