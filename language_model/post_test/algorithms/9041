A recent technological breakthrough in electron zzso zzso is the development of direct electron detection cameras for data zzso By bypassing the traditional zzso zzso and fiber zzso zzso these cameras have greatly enhanced sensitivity and detective quantum efficiency zzso Of the three currently available commercial cameras, the zzso zzso Summit was designed specifically for counting individual electron zzso Counting further enhances the zzso allows for practical doubling of detector resolution and eliminates noise arising from the variable deposition of energy by each primary zzso While counting has many advantages, zzso of electrons happens when more than one electron strikes the same area of the detector within the analog zzso period zzso zzso which influences image zzso In this work, we characterized the zzso Summit in electron counting mode, and studied the relationship of dose rate and coincidence loss and its influence on the quality of counted zzso We found that coincidence loss reduces low frequency zzso but has no significant influence on the zzso ratio of the recorded zzso It also has little influence on high frequency zzso Images of frozen hydrated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso D7 zzso recorded at the optimal dose rate retained both high-resolution signal and zzso contrast and enabled calculating a zzso zzso three-dimensional reconstruction from only 10,000 zzso
