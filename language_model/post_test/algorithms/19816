zzso zzso have been developed to reconstruct likely zzso pathways in the brain from diffusion zzso imaging zzso zzso In this study, an elegant and simple means for improving existing zzso zzso is proposed by allowing tracts to zzso through diagonal zzso between zzso instead of only zzso to their zzso zzso A series of tests zzso both real and simulated data zzso are zzso to show several benefits of this new zzso First, the inclusion of diagonal tract propagation decreases the dependence of an zzso on the arbitrary orientation of coordinate axes and therefore reduces zzso errors associated with that bias (which are also demonstrated zzso Moreover, both zzso and zzso including zzso decreases overall noise sensitivity of results and leads to significantly greater efficiency in scanning zzso that is, the obtained tracts zzso much more quickly zzso in a smaller amount of scanning zzso to those of data sets with high zzso and spatial zzso zzso the inclusion of diagonal propagation adds essentially no appreciable time of calculation or zzso costs to standard zzso This study focuses on the zzso streamline tracking method, zzso zzso assessment by continuous zzso and the modified method is termed zzso zzso including zzso
