The extraction of zzso information from structurally diverse compound data sets is a challenging zzso One of the focal points of systematic zzso analysis is the search for activity cliffs, that is, structurally similar compounds having large potency differences, from which zzso zzso can be zzso The assessment of zzso information is usually based on zzso similarity and potency comparisons of data set zzso As a consequence, activity cliffs are mostly evaluated at a compound pair zzso Here, we present an extension of the activity cliff concept by introducing zzso zzso that are formed by overlapping zzso activity cliffs between participating compounds, giving rise to zzso structures in activity zzso zzso zzso are rich in zzso zzso In a systematic analysis of 242 compound data sets, we have identified zzso activity zzso in 71 different zzso In addition, an zzso approach has been devised to characterize the structural composition of activity zzso Taken together, our results show that activity zzso frequently occur in sets of active compounds and that different categories of zzso can be distinguished on the basis of their structural zzso The zzso identification of activity zzso provides access to compound zzso having high priority for zzso zzso
