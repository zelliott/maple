The present paper addresses the following question can a simple regulatory bone zzso model predict effects of zzso on the zzso zzso For that, we propose an extension of a previous bone zzso model by taking into account the zzso properties of the zzso zzso law is used to describe the mechanical behavior of the bone and a specific law of the apparent bone density rate is zzso Based on stability analysis, zzso simulations are then performed to investigate the zzso role on simulations of the bone zzso zzso We show that the viscous contribution affects the evolution of the apparent bone density, by slowing down the adaptation process, which seems to be confirmed by simulations with real data obtained from rat zzso
