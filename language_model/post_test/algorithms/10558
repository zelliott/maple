The zzso of alcoholic zzso zzso remains unclear and the prognosis of severe alcoholic zzso zzso is very zzso zzso of von zzso factor zzso zzso zzso results in an increase of the plasma unusually large zzso zzso and leads to zzso zzso which causes zzso zzso and finally zzso zzso The aim of this study was to explore the potential role of zzso on the development of liver zzso and zzso failure in zzso 

The activity of plasma zzso and its clinical correlation were determined in 14 patients with zzso 4 with zzso zzso score, mean zzso and 10 with alcoholic liver zzso zzso 

The activity of the plasma zzso significantly decreased in patients with zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso p zzso zzso as compared with the healthy subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso The activity was markedly lower in zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In three zzso with zzso who had zzso failure, it was extremely low zzso zzso and zzso respectively), but in a zzso with zzso it remained mild decrease zzso In zzso the zzso activity increased at the recovery stage zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In the zzso analysis, the activity correlated with 10 clinical variables including functional liver capacity, inflammation signs, zzso function, and zzso count in patients with zzso and zzso Among these, zzso analysis showed that serum total zzso and zzso protein independently correlated with the zzso zzso 

The activity of plasma zzso markedly decreased in zzso in addition to zzso The activity was closely related to zzso and inflammation signs, and was extremely low in zzso with zzso and zzso zzso The marked decrease of plasma zzso may, in part, contribute to not only the progression of liver zzso in zzso but also the development of zzso failure in zzso through zzso zzso
