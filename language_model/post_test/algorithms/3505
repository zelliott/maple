Reliable monitoring of zzso plays an important role in a broad spectrum of zzso Today, there are several methods for monitoring zzso but none of them has proved to be satisfactory in all zzso We have recently developed a zzso method that can accurately time zzso from zzso zzso The aim of this study is to tailor this zzso method for monitoring purposes by introducing dedicated signal zzso The method was developed on a material of ten patients and then tested in another ten patients treated in an intensive care zzso By studying the differences in the variation of the spectral content between the different zzso of zzso the described method can distinguish between inspiration and expiration and can extract zzso frequency, and zzso pause zzso The system detected zzso of the zzso and zzso of the zzso This method for zzso monitoring has the advantage of being simple, robust and the sensor does not need to be placed closed to the zzso A commercial heart microphone was used and we anticipate that further improvement in performance can be achieved trough zzso of sensor zzso
