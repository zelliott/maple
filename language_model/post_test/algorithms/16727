zzso three-dimensional zzso coronary zzso is a zzso alternative to X-ray coronary zzso However, the existing zzso approaches do not meet the requirements of clinical practice, as they perform with zzso accuracy and require prolonged acquisition zzso zzso techniques, applied to zzso imaging zzso promise to detect the position of the blood pool directly in the zzso acquired for zzso zzso the respiratory displacement of the heart can be calculated and used for motion correction with high accuracy and zzso scan zzso However, additional bright signal from the chest wall, spine, arms, and liver can render the isolation of the blood pool zzso In this work, an innovative method based on a targeted combination of the output signals of an anterior zzso surface zzso is implemented to efficiently suppress such additional bright zzso Furthermore, an zzso for the automatic zzso of the blood pool is zzso zzso zzso is achieved by zzso These improvements were integrated into a three-dimensional zzso zzso coronary zzso sequence and were compared with zzso imaging in zzso zzso was successful in all cases and the acquisition time was reduced up to zzso zzso or slightly superior image quality, vessel zzso and sharpness were zzso
