True zzso zzso of tumor volume are time-consuming and subject to errors that are particularly pronounced in cases of small zzso These problems complicate the routine clinical assessment of tumor growth zzso We examined the accuracy of currently available methods of size and growth measurement of zzso zzso compared with that of a novel fast partial volume tissue zzso zzso 

zzso patients with unilateral sporadic zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso of these patients underwent imaging two or more times at approximately 12-month zzso zzso zzso zzso images were used for all zzso An experienced zzso performed standard size zzso including zzso diameter, elliptical area, zzso manually segmented area, intensity zzso seeding volume, and manually segmented zzso A method for calculating volume was also used, incorporating zzso probability statistics to estimate partial volume zzso zzso segmented volume was obtained as a baseline standard zzso A computer-generated phantom exhibiting the intensity and partial volume characteristics of brain zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso tissue was used to measure absolute accuracy of the standard technique and zzso partial volume zzso 

The zzso partial volume zzso method showed the highest correlation zzso zzso zzso with the standard method, whereas the commonly used method of zzso diameter measurement showed poor correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was shown to be more than twice that of manual zzso with an absolute accuracy of zzso zzso zzso and a zzso accuracy of 70 zzso zzso 150 zzso For the 38 patients who underwent imaging twice, zzso tumor growth was shown for 12, potential growth for seven, no growth for 17, and zzso shrinkage for zzso 

zzso used methods such as zzso diameter zzso do not provide adequate statistical accuracy with which to monitor tumor growth in patients with small zzso zzso zzso partial volume zzso provides a more accurate and rapid method of volume and growth zzso These differences in measurement accuracy translated into a significant improvement in clinical assessment, allowing identification of tumor growth in 10 of 12 cases that appeared to be zzso in size when manual zzso techniques are zzso The technique is quick to perform and suitable for use in routine clinical zzso
