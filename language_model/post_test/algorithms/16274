The objectives of this study were to zzso determine the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso in rats and in zzso to permit a calculation of the ratio of in zzso to in zzso values, and zzso test a method of zzso in zzso human zzso zzso labeled zzso in ethanol solution was applied to the clipped skin of rats in zzso at doses of zzso 20, or 200 zzso As a reference compound, zzso zzso in zzso solution was applied to rat skin in zzso at a dose of 100 zzso All applications were washed at 24 h zzso and rats were sacrificed either at 24 h for zzso or 5 d for both zzso The zzso recovered from zzso urine including cage zzso and feces was summed to determine percent zzso For the zzso time point, at doses of zzso 20, and 200 zzso of zzso values of 22, 22, and zzso respectively, were obtained for in zzso rat zzso zzso zzso per zzso For the zzso time point, at doses of zzso 20, and 200 zzso of zzso values of 38, 38, and zzso respectively, were obtained for in zzso rat zzso zzso zzso per zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso at 100 zzso was determined to be zzso zzso zzso and test duration did not exert a statistically significant effect on zzso zzso of zzso in the rat in zzso For in zzso zzso determination, zzso in ethanol solution was applied to freshly excised human skin in an in zzso test system zzso of skin zzso in zzso zzso hours after application, the zzso recovered from zzso and zzso fluid was summed to determine percent zzso At doses of approximately zzso 20, and 200 zzso zzso values of 1, 3, and zzso respectively, were obtained for zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso human skin zzso of zzso at 100 zzso was determined to be zzso zzso zzso rat skin zzso of zzso at zzso 20, and 200 zzso were found to be 20, 18, and zzso respectively zzso per zzso approximately zzso higher than human skin zzso zzso rat skin zzso of zzso was also higher zzso than the value obtained for human skin by a factor of about zzso
