zzso chronic tears of both zzso zzso rarely are zzso We present our experience in treating these injuries and suggest an zzso for surgical treatment, determined by the presence of a functioning zzso or zzso mobility of the remaining zzso musculature, ankle stability, and position of the zzso 

zzso consecutive patients (29 zzso were followed zzso for a mean of zzso zzso zzso to 8) zzso The mean age was 36 zzso 19 to zzso years, and all patients had chronic ankle pain with or without instability and with combinations of complete, zzso or zzso tears of both zzso Of the 28 patients, six had zzso zzso and three had zzso Eight patients had mechanical ankle instability, but there was no correlation between instability and the presence of zzso zzso 

The mean zzso American zzso Foot and zzso Society ankle score was 82 zzso 20 to zzso points, and zzso of patients achieved normal or moderate zzso muscle zzso zzso instability was successfully corrected in all patients and progressive worsening of zzso zzso was zzso 

The presence of chronic zzso zzso zzso or dislocation, chronic ankle instability, or zzso zzso zzso in association with zzso pain and zzso should alert the surgeon to the possibility of a tear of the zzso zzso and is an indication for surgical zzso At the time of zzso repair, every effort should be made to treat the primary or contributing causes of the zzso Our results suggest that patients with symptomatic zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso tears are likely to experience substantial improvement in function if operative treatment is zzso
