We zzso studied a zzso liquid crystal whose molecules form twisted head-to-head zzso zzso We observed that when the material transformed from the zzso to zzso phase, it formed droplets with zzso zzso zzso We carried out a computer simulation to investigate the liquid crystal director zzso inside the droplets and to study the effects of elastic zzso and zzso on the zzso zzso zzso of our study show it is likely that the material in the droplets had zzso zzso due to spontaneous zzso phase zzso
