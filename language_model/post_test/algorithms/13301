Ocean bottom zzso zzso networks represent a tool of opportunity to study fin and blue zzso A small zzso network on the Juan de zzso Ridge in the northeast Pacific Ocean in zzso zzso of water recorded an extensive data set of zzso fin whale zzso An automated method has been developed to identify arrival times based on instantaneous frequency and zzso and to locate calls using a grid search even in the presence of a few bad arrival zzso When only one whale is calling near the network, tracks can generally be obtained up to distances of zzso zzso from the zzso When the calls from multiple zzso zzso user supervision is required to identify zzso The absolute and relative zzso of arrivals and their zzso particle motions provide additional constraints on call location but are not useful for extending the distance to which calls can be zzso The zzso method zzso for changes in relative call locations using differences in zzso for pairs of nearby calls recorded on a common zzso The method significantly reduces the zzso component of the location error, especially when inconsistencies in arrival time observations are minimized by zzso
