In zzso coli zzso organizes into a zzso ring structure, the Z ring, which effects cell zzso zzso is a zzso but the free energy of zzso zzso does not appear to be used for generation of the zzso force, leaving open the question of the function of the zzso activity of zzso Here we study the mechanism by which zzso an inhibitor of zzso induced during the zzso response, zzso zzso zzso We studied the effects of zzso on the in zzso activities of zzso on Z rings in zzso and on a kinetic model for zzso zzso in zzso We found that the binding of zzso to zzso is necessary but not sufficient for zzso of zzso since the assembly of zzso zzso in the absence of the zzso activity was not inhibited by zzso We developed a new model for zzso zzso that accounts for the zzso of zzso and could account for zzso observed in other linear zzso When zzso was included in the kinetic zzso simulations revealed that zzso with strong affinity for zzso delayed, but did not zzso the assembly of zzso when they were not zzso zzso Furthermore, the simulations indicated that zzso controls the assembly of zzso by binding to a zzso form of the zzso zzso and preventing it from participating in zzso In zzso zzso of the disruption of Z rings by zzso suggests that zzso may undergo two cooperative transitions in forming the Z zzso
