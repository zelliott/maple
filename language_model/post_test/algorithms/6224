zzso clearance is one of the major functions of the zzso zzso Limited information on the physiology or malfunction could up to now only be obtained by experimental investigations in zzso with zzso zzso of zzso beat frequency or with extensive, time-consuming zzso 

We developed a new technique, which measures the transport capacity at various locations at the zzso in the nose of a sitting patient with a short (30 zzso zzso zzso The zzso of a 500 zzso zzso as zzso marker, which is placed on the zzso region of interest, is measured by a zzso calculation in zzso 

: We validated this technique in 20 subjects with zzso on the floor of the zzso The zzso zzso and variable transport speed at different locations as known from the literature could be zzso 

This technique allows for the first time to measure the zzso clearance at various locations inside the nose of a patient in a short and easy to perform zzso which up to now necessitated extensive or experimental zzso Besides the establishment of a register of zzso clearance at various anatomical zzso inside the nose zzso zzso zzso surrounding of the zzso zzso we intend to verify if this technique can be used as a new diagnostic tool to obtain a deeper insight into some zzso zzso or zzso symptoms zzso or zzso in the nose and in the zzso zzso
