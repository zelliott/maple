A computer simulation has been used to calculate the effects of J zzso on the zzso of echoes produced by zzso zzso The program zzso the evolution of the density zzso for different pulse intervals and can predict the signals zzso from spin systems of any size and zzso zzso from the simulation confirm the prediction that a decrease in the effects of J zzso is largely responsible for the bright fat signal seen in fast spin echo imaging at high pulse zzso The effects of J zzso on zzso zzso are examined for zzso and zzso spin systems over a wide range of J zzso and chemical shift values and pulse zzso The effects of J zzso on the point spread function obtained with fast spin echo imaging are also zzso
