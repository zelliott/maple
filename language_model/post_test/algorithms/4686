We have identified new lead candidates that possess zzso activity against zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso zzso by a zzso virtual screening zzso for lead evaluation in combination with in zzso zzso zzso The initial virtual screening using a zzso zzso model identified 95 compounds from an in-house small zzso database of zzso zzso The obtained hits were further evaluated by molecular zzso and 15 compounds were short listed based on zzso scores and the other scoring functions and subjected to biological zzso zzso zzso activity zzso identified four compounds as zzso of zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso zzso with low zzso zzso The structural models for these zzso in the zzso zzso binding site will facilitate medicinal chemistry efforts for lead zzso against this zzso
