This study was conducted to compare adherence and persistence of patients initiating zzso insulin therapy with zzso zzso versus those initiating zzso insulin therapy with zzso via vial and zzso 

Data were gathered from a large US retrospective claims database, and included patients with type 2 diabetes that initiated zzso insulin therapy with either zzso zzso or zzso in zzso Patients were defined as adherent to therapy if they had a medication possession ratio zzso of zzso in the 12-month follow-up period and were defined as persistent with therapy if they had no gaps in insulin therapy in the follow-up zzso 

After controlling for zzso using zzso regression, patients initiating therapy with zzso zzso had zzso higher adjusted odds of achieving an zzso zzso versus patients initiating therapy with zzso vial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of persistence using a Cox zzso hazards model indicated that patients initiating zzso zzso had a 38% lower hazard of zzso compared to zzso vial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso studies are limited to the extent that they accurately capture medical and pharmacy zzso Also, relying on zzso data limits the zzso of the findings to similar populations and zzso 

These results suggest that persistence and adherence with insulin may be improved for patients initiating zzso insulin therapy with zzso zzso versus zzso zzso
