There has been a considerable effort in several medical fields, for objective color analysis and characterization of biological zzso Conventional zzso have proved inadequate for this purpose, since they do not provide spatial color information and because the measuring procedure randomly affects the color of the zzso In this paper an imaging zzso is zzso where the zzso optical zzso of zzso is replaced with the zzso device zzso sensor of a color video camera, enabling the independent capturing of the color information for any spatial point within its zzso Combining imaging and zzso methods, the acquired image is zzso and corrected, under several ambient light conditions, providing zzso zzso color zzso and zzso free of the errors and the limitations present in conventional zzso This system was used for monitoring of blood supply changes of zzso zzso that have undergone zzso and zzso radiation zzso therapy, where zzso and reliable zzso were zzso These features highlight the potential of the imaging zzso as clinical and research tools for the zzso of clinical diagnosis and for the objective evaluation of treatment zzso
