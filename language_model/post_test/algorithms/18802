zzso zzso regions and zzso evolutionary zzso between zzso by interrogating zzso zzso events is one of the central goals of comparative zzso However, identification of zzso blocks and the resulting assessment of zzso zzso are dependent on the choice of zzso zzso the definition of zzso zzso and the choice of various parameters that are used to construct such segments for two zzso In this work, we performed an extended sensitivity analysis of zzso block generation using alternative sets of markers in multiple zzso A simple approach to zzso block zzso is used, which depends on two principle zzso the maximum gap zzso zzso between adjacent blocks to be zzso and the minimum length zzso zzso of zzso zzso In particular, the dependence on the choice of zzso markers and max zzso zzso zzso parameters is assessed for two important quantities that can be used to characterize evolutionary relationships between zzso namely the reversal distance and zzso zzso We observe that the number of zzso blocks depends on both zzso while the reversal distance depends mostly on zzso zzso On the other hand, we observe that relative reversal distances between zzso zzso which are defined as ratios of distances between different pairs of zzso are nearly constant for both zzso Similarly, the zzso zzso rate was found to be almost constant for different data sets and a wide range of zzso zzso zzso is also strongly correlated with evolutionary zzso increasing for pairs of more divergent zzso Finally, we demonstrate that the role of parameters may be further reduced by using a zzso analysis that involves markers zzso in multiple zzso which opens a way to guide the choice of a correct zzso
