A zzso zzso approach is introduced for action zzso The approach represents an action as a sequence of prototypes for efficient and flexible action matching in long video zzso During training, an action zzso tree is learned in a joint shape and motion space via zzso zzso zzso and each training sequence is represented as a labeled zzso zzso then a zzso table of zzso distances is zzso During testing, based on a joint probability model of the actor location and action prototype, the actor is tracked while a zzso correspondence is established by maximizing the joint zzso which is efficiently performed by searching the learned zzso zzso then actions are recognized using dynamic zzso sequence zzso zzso measures used for sequence matching are rapidly obtained by zzso table indexing, which is an order of magnitude faster than zzso zzso of zzso zzso Our approach enables robust action matching in challenging situations (such as moving cameras, dynamic zzso and allows automatic alignment of action zzso Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves recognition rates of zzso percent on a large gesture data set (with dynamic zzso 100 percent on the Weizmann action data set, zzso percent on the zzso action data set, 88 percent on the zzso sports data set, and zzso percent on the zzso action data zzso
