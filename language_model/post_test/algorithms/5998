Men with prostate cancer are at risk for bone loss and skeletal complications throughout the course of their zzso Bone loss is prevalent in many men with prostate cancer at initial diagnosis, and initiating zzso deprivation therapy results in accelerated bone zzso leading to bone loss and an increased risk of zzso These men are also at high risk for disease progression and bone zzso that can result in significant skeletal zzso including zzso zzso spinal zzso zzso and debilitating bone pain requiring additional zzso zzso zzso activity plays a central role in the zzso of bone disease at each stage of prostate cancer disease zzso zzso acid, a highly potent inhibitor of zzso bone zzso has increased bone mineral density in men receiving zzso deprivation therapy and is the only zzso that has shown statistically significant reductions in skeletal morbidity in patients with bone zzso from prostate zzso Furthermore, zzso evidence suggests that zzso acid has zzso activity in prostate cancer zzso Recently, a treatment zzso was developed by the 3rd International zzso on zzso Cancer recommending the use of zzso acid for the prevention of skeletal complications in patients with bone zzso from prostate cancer, regardless of their hormone status, and for the prevention of zzso bone loss in patients without evidence of bone zzso According to this algorithm, zzso acid should be considered for the prevention of skeletal morbidity in patients with prostate cancer throughout their treatment zzso
