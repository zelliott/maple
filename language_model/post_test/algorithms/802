zzso zzso has developed into an imaging zzso suitable for detection and diagnosis of zzso in the breast, zzso and zzso and for monitoring zzso therapies in the liver, zzso and other zzso In this article, a new approach is described that enables the reduction of noise artifacts in zzso without a significant reduction in either the contrast or spatial zzso The technique uses zzso compounding of local angular strains estimated from echo signals scanned at different zzso zzso zzso estimated along angular zzso directions can be separated into strain zzso components along the zzso zzso of zzso and lateral zzso The mechanical stimulus is applied only along one zzso zzso factors are derived from the relationship between the zzso and lateral strains under the assumption of tissue zzso Experimental results using a zzso elastic, zzso phantom demonstrate the improvement in the zzso ratio obtained with zzso zzso Variation in the zzso ratio obtained using different angular increments also is zzso zzso obtained from an inclusion phantom also demonstrate the improvement in contrast detail resolution obtained using zzso zzso
