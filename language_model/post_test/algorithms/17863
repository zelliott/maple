By using specially designed zzso zzso a zzso zzso generator for sensing 3-D shapes has been zzso The square or zzso zzso fringe pattern formed by the fiber-optic zzso grid generator is projected onto an zzso zzso The zzso grid pattern containing information of the zzso surface topography is captured by a zzso camera and is analyzed using zzso zzso transforming zzso The use of the fiber-optic zzso technique greatly zzso the holographic zzso system, and the carrier grid zzso can be zzso generated without the use of excessive auxiliary components or sophisticated experimental zzso moreover, the zzso fiber can be used in very narrow places, zzso to its small zzso Finally, the square or zzso zzso fringe pattern provides a zzso ability that could further improve the accuracy of the 3-D zzso zzso
