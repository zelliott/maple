An zzso zzso protein structure prediction zzso zzso was applied to all 85 small proteins of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is based on a zzso Carlo refinement of a lattice model of zzso which uses zzso zzso zzso Such restraints are derived by zzso consensus contacts and local secondary structure from at least zzso scoring structures that, in some cases, can lack any global similarity to the sequence of zzso zzso of the native fold was done by using the convergence of the simulation from two different zzso search schemes and the lowest energy structure by a zzso zzso zzso Among the 85 zzso for 34 proteins with significant zzso hits, the template structures were reasonably well zzso Of the remaining 51 zzso 29 proteins zzso to five or fewer zzso In the test set, zzso of the proteins that zzso to five or fewer clusters had a correct fold among the zzso If this statistic is simply applied, 24 proteins zzso of the 29 zzso may have correct zzso Thus, the zzso of a total of 58 proteins probably has been correctly zzso Based on these results, zzso zzso protein structure prediction is becoming a practical zzso
