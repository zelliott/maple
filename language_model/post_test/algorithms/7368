zzso analyses involving zzso or zzso data often entail dealing with zzso gene zzso In this paper, we consider two causes of such zzso zzso incomplete lineage sorting zzso and zzso and consider both zzso and zzso criteria for dealing with zzso 

Under the assumption of zzso computing the probability of a gene tree given a species tree is a very hard zzso We present a zzso for speeding up the computation, and demonstrate how it scales up zzso to data sizes that are not feasible to analyze using current techniques, while achieving very good zzso Further, under the assumption of both zzso and zzso computing the probability of a gene tree and zzso reconciling it with a zzso network are both very hard zzso We present two exact zzso for these two problems that speed up existing techniques significantly and enable analyses of much larger data sets than is currently zzso 

Our zzso and zzso enable zzso analyses of larger (in terms of numbers of zzso data sets than is currently zzso Further, our methods account for zzso and zzso thus allowing analyses of zzso evolutionary zzso
