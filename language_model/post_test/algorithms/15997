zzso zzso therapy requires frequent laboratory controls of its intensity to assure therapeutic efficacy and to prevent potentially life threatening adverse zzso It is generally zzso that increasing the frequency of testing would lead to a better control of zzso We tested this hypothesis in a prospective controlled trial comparing weekly zzso and zzso zzso zzso with the zzso of these patients in an zzso zzso Only patients with stable zzso were included into the zzso We recorded zzso weekly zzso of the intensity of zzso zzso in 49 patients on zzso and zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso in 53 patients on zzso Two zzso of zzso were used in each group: a target zzso of zzso for patients with artificial heart valves (target zzso zzso and a target zzso zzso (target zzso zzso for patients with zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso from the target zzso the fraction of zzso zzso within the zzso therapeutic range and the difference between the target zzso and the actually achieved mean zzso were the three major zzso of the zzso The mean zzso from the target zzso was smaller in the groups of patients on zzso compared to the patients on zzso Individual zzso were significantly zzso zzso dependent on the type of management in interaction with the treatment intensity in a general linear zzso Patients on weekly zzso and zzso had more zzso values within the therapeutic range than patients on zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso range zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso range zzso The achieved mean zzso was almost identical with the target zzso in the patients on zzso but was significantly zzso zzso below the target zzso in the high intensity zzso group on zzso (target zzso achieved mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data show, that weekly zzso and zzso leads to a better control of zzso than standard treatment in an zzso zzso
