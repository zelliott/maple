In this paper, the authors introduce a zzso zzso model to describe bone zzso Indeed, experimental data of stress relaxation or creep functions obtained by zzso tests have been proved to be fit by power law with real zzso 0 zzso zzso zzso The zzso behavior of the material has therefore been zzso using the zzso zzso principle, in terms of real order zzso and derivatives zzso zzso It is shown that the power laws describing zzso of bone tissue may be obtained by introducing a zzso description of bone zzso and the zzso dimension of the zzso geometry is then related to the zzso of the power zzso
