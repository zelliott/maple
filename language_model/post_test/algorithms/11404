zzso detection of zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated by using zzso zzso technique with zzso difference frequency generation in zzso Thanks to the low zzso of the gas media, the bandwidth of the phase matching condition of the zzso process becomes very broad and the entire zzso spectrum spanning from 200 to zzso zzso was zzso by using a 10 zzso chirped pulse to visible wavelength radiation, which was detected with a conventional visible zzso zzso This method was demonstrated by the successful measurement of infrared zzso zzso of organic zzso zzso
