We present a zzso solution of the parquet zzso a zzso diagrammatic approach which is zzso at both the zzso and the zzso zzso The fully zzso zzso is zzso by the bare interaction thus producing the simplest approximation that one can perform with the set of equations involved in the zzso The method is applied to the Hubbard model on a half-filled zzso zzso zzso are compared to those obtained from zzso quantum zzso Carlo zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso approximation zzso This comparison shows a satisfactory agreement with zzso and a significant improvement over the zzso or the zzso zzso zzso
