We propose the zzso scale zzso feature transform zzso method for zzso and matching salient features from zzso images of arbitrary zzso and compare this zzso performance to other related zzso The proposed features extend the concepts used for zzso zzso images in the computer vision zzso technique for zzso and matching distinctive scale zzso zzso We apply the features to images of arbitrary zzso through the use of zzso coordinates for zzso and zzso zzso to create the feature zzso We analyze the performance of a fully automated zzso medical image matching technique based on these features, and successfully apply the technique to determine accurate feature point correspondence between pairs of 3-D zzso images and dynamic zzso + time CT zzso
