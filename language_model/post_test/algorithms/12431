A linear quantitative zzso relationship zzso model is presented for modeling and predicting induction of zzso by zzso The model was produced by using the multiple linear zzso zzso technique on a database that consists of 43 recently discovered zzso Among the 61 different zzso zzso and structural zzso that were considered as zzso to the model, seven variables were selected using the elimination zzso zzso method zzso The physical meaning of each zzso is zzso The accuracy of the proposed zzso model is illustrated using the following evaluation zzso zzso validation through an external test set, and zzso Furthermore, the domain of zzso which indicates the area of reliable predictions is zzso
