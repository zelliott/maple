Since zzso events occur, all genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were lost or transferred from ancestral zzso zzso into the zzso The zzso pattern is that both zzso and zzso zzso coexist in the nuclear zzso In the present scenario all zzso zzso are zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso imported from the zzso into the zzso in zzso zzso The zzso discrimination between similar types of zzso is very challenging because they have almost same zzso zzso It is very important to predict the zzso location of zzso to understand the zzso protein zzso We have analyzed and zzso the distinguishable patterns between zzso and zzso zzso zzso support zzso machines zzso zzso have been developed using zzso acid and zzso compositions and achieved zzso correlation zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso we have developed zzso zzso using zzso scoring zzso and achieved the maximum zzso of zzso zzso we developed zzso zzso using zzso intermediate zzso zzso and split zzso acid composition zzso and achieved zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Finally, a zzso module was developed using selected attributes of split zzso acid composition zzso approach and achieved zzso of zzso with an accuracy of zzso All zzso were trained and tested on a zzso data set and evaluated using fivefold zzso zzso On the independent data sets, zzso based prediction model achieved zzso of zzso with an accuracy of zzso The zzso zzso based on above study is available at zzso
