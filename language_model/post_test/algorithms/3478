zzso zzso zzso are becoming more widely used to assist in visualizing the convoluted cortical gray matter sheet of the zzso zzso approaches are the most common but suffer from high zzso zzso or zzso zzso are supported by a comprehensive mathematical zzso The zzso approach that uses circle zzso is versatile in the manipulation and display of zzso In addition, it offers some new and interesting metrics that may be useful in zzso analysis and are not available through zzso partial differential equation zzso zzso In this paper, we begin with a brief description of cortical zzso zzso from data acquisition to map displays, including a brief review of past flat mapping zzso We then describe the mathematics of zzso geometry and key elements of zzso zzso We introduce the mechanics of circle packing and discuss its connections with zzso zzso Using a zzso surface representing a cortical hemisphere, we illustrate several zzso available using circle packing methods and describe the associated zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude by discussing current and potential uses of zzso methods in zzso and zzso zzso
