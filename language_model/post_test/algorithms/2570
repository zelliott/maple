We have recently shown that we can zzso zzso models of zzso zzso channels by combining a zzso search zzso with zzso currents measured using multiple zzso zzso Although zzso successful, this approach is highly demanding zzso with zzso on a high performance Linux cluster typically lasting several zzso To solve this zzso bottleneck we converted our zzso zzso for work on a zzso processing unit zzso using zzso zzso zzso the process on a Fermi graphic computing engine from zzso increased the speed zzso times over an application running on an 80 zzso Linux zzso considerably reducing simulation zzso This application allows users to zzso models for zzso channel zzso on a single, zzso zzso zzso zzso greatly reducing the time and cost of building models relevant to zzso zzso We also demonstrate that the point of zzso zzso is crucial to its zzso We substantially reduced computing time by solving the zzso zzso zzso zzso so as to zzso reduce memory transfers to and from the zzso This approach may be applied to speed up other data intensive applications requiring zzso solutions of zzso
