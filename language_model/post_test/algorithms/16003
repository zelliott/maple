An zzso methodology in zzso liquid zzso zzso is presented for the selection of two or more mobile zzso having an optimal complementary zzso The complementary mobile zzso zzso are selected in such a way that each one resolves zzso only some compounds in the mixture, while the zzso resolved by the other mobile zzso can overlap among zzso The methodology is based on the zzso of a peak purity measurement for each zzso using an zzso peak model for peak zzso Two global resolution criteria zzso of elementary resolutions and worst elementary zzso and two methods for solving the problem (a systematic examination of all possible zzso arrangements, and the use of genetic zzso to zzso the calculation zzso were used to find the optimal zzso The zzso zzso methodology was applied to the resolution of a mixture of 10 zzso and zzso which could not be resolved using a single mobile zzso virtual baseline resolution was zzso however, with two zzso
