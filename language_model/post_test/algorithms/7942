The measurement of the Mueller zzso when the probing beam is placed on the boundary between two (or more) regions of the sample with different optical properties may lead to a zzso in the Mueller zzso The zzso is due to the incoherent zzso of the optical responses of different sample regions in the probe zzso Despite of the zzso the measured Mueller zzso has information enough to subtract a Mueller zzso corresponding to one of the regions of sample provided that this zzso zzso is zzso For clarity, we will call these zzso Mueller zzso of one individual region of the sample simply as the zzso zzso In the framework of the theory of Mueller zzso algebra, we have implemented a procedure allowing the retrieval of a zzso component from a zzso Mueller zzso constituted by the sum of several zzso zzso In order to apply the zzso the Mueller zzso of the rest of the zzso components have to be zzso Here we present a zzso and zzso approaches to implement the zzso zzso To illustrate our method as well as the performance of the two approaches, we present two practical zzso In both cases we have measured zzso Mueller zzso by positioning an zzso beam on the boundary between two and three different regions of a sample, zzso The goal was to retrieve the zzso Mueller zzso of one of those regions from the measured zzso Mueller zzso In order to evaluate the performance of the method we compared the zzso zzso with the Mueller zzso of the selected region measured zzso
