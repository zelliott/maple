Physical zzso measurement is plagued by many zzso which result in zzso zzso zzso zzso can reduce the number of zzso values, the measurement error, and the zzso of zzso zzso This study aimed to reduce the zzso of zzso zzso by using a new clinical zzso (the zzso zzso for an automated disk zzso A single zzso recorded zzso relative attachment levels zzso at one visit in 32 patients zzso age zzso zzso with moderately advanced chronic adult zzso zzso was recorded over two passes at six sites per tooth zzso zzso The zzso accepted the first and second pass zzso zzso and zzso if their difference was zzso or zzso 1 zzso otherwise a maximum of two further zzso zzso and zzso were recorded until the difference between any two zzso was zzso or zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso sites zzso required two recordings, 580 sites zzso required three recordings and 47 sites zzso required four zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso were both zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were calculated for zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso The mean of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso whilst the mean of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso the respective medians were zzso zzso and zzso zzso The study demonstrated high zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso produced an zzso reduction in the mean zzso zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso reduction in the median zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso
