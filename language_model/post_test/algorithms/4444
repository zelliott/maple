The proteins structure can be mainly classified into four zzso zzso zzso zzso and alpha + beta protein according to their chain fold zzso For the purpose of predicting the protein structural class, a new predicting algorithm, in which the zzso of diversity combines with zzso zzso analysis, is presented to study and predict protein structural zzso On the basis of the concept of the zzso zzso acid composition zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2001, 43, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2001, 44, zzso 400 zzso components and 20 zzso acid composition are, respectively, selected as parameters of diversity zzso Total of 204 zzso proteins constructed by zzso zzso zzso zzso Res zzso 1999, zzso zzso are used for training and testing the zzso zzso The predicted results by using the zzso zzso acids approach as proposed in this paper can remarkably improve the success rates, and hence the current method may play a complementary role to other existing methods for predicting protein structural zzso
