This study describes a new technique for zzso zzso Imaging zzso that acquires zzso zzso images of the cervical spinal zzso The zzso images depict zzso fiber orientation, enable zzso of diffusion characteristics along the spinal cord, and have the potential to demonstrate the connectivity of zzso white matter zzso Because of the high sensitivity to motion of zzso magnetic resonance imaging and the small size of the spinal cord, a fast imaging method with high zzso resolution was zzso Images were acquired with a zzso zzso technique, named zzso zzso magnified zzso zzso echo zzso zzso which selects localized areas and reduces zzso caused by zzso changes between soft tissue and the adjacent zzso zzso gating was used to reduce zzso flow zzso from the surrounding zzso zzso zzso resolution was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso slice zzso Both the mean zzso zzso and the fractional zzso zzso zzso of the cervical spinal zzso were zzso The zzso index demonstrated high zzso of the spinal zzso with an average value of zzso zzso zzso zzso value of zzso zzso zzso at zzso comparable to white matter tracts in the zzso The zzso components parallel and zzso to the zzso axes of the zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The high zzso resolution allowed preliminary evaluation of fiber connectivity using the zzso zzso algorithm, which generated traces of fiber paths consistent with the well-known zzso zzso
