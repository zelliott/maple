zzso experiments generate vast amounts of zzso The functional context of zzso expressed genes can be assessed by zzso the Gene zzso zzso database via zzso Directed zzso graph zzso which are used to depict GO categories enriched with zzso expressed zzso are difficult to interpret and, depending on the particular analysis, may not be well suited for zzso new zzso Additional zzso methods are therefore needed to augment the GO zzso zzso 

We present an alternative zzso approach, zzso zzso zzso showing set relationships with zzso size information in a single zzso to support biological hypothesis zzso The zzso of sets and intersection sets are represented by zzso zzso zzso and their corresponding zzso zzso or zzso intersection zzso zzso zzso representations are obtained using swarm and evolutionary zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso effectively structure and zzso the results of a GO analysis by indicating to what extent flagged genes are shared by different zzso In addition to reducing the complexity of the zzso the zzso facilitate generation of novel hypotheses from the analysis of seemingly unrelated categories that share zzso expressed zzso
