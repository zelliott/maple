This study introduces two-dimensional zzso zzso analysis to the zzso of gas zzso differential mobility zzso zzso data which are composed of retention time, compensation zzso and corresponding zzso One reported method to process such large data sets is to convert zzso signals to zzso signals by summing zzso either across retention time or compensation zzso but it can lose important signal information in one data zzso A zzso zzso analysis approach keeps the zzso structure of original signals, while significantly reducing data zzso We applied this feature extraction method to zzso zzso signals measured from control and zzso fruit and then employed two typical zzso zzso to testify the effects of the zzso features on chemical pattern zzso zzso a zzso accuracy of separating data from control and zzso fruit samples, zzso zzso analysis not only proves its feasibility to extract feature from original zzso signals but also shows its superiority over the conventional feature extraction methods including converting zzso to zzso and selecting distinguishable zzso from training zzso Furthermore, this process does not require zzso with specific pattern recognition methods, which may help ensure wide applications of this method to zzso zzso zzso
