We investigate the zzso complexity of zzso a smallest possible zzso zzso tree zzso zzso which is consistent with each of the rooted triplets in a given zzso This problem has not been studied previously in the zzso We prove that even the very restricted case of determining if there exists a zzso tree consistent with the input and having just one leaf zzso is an zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that the general zzso problem is difficult to zzso although a simple zzso approximation zzso achieves an approximation ratio close to our derived zzso zzso Finally, we provide an exact zzso for the problem running in exponential time and zzso As a zzso we also obtain new, strong zzso results for two zzso problems on directed zzso called zzso zzso and zzso zzso
