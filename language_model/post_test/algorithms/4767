zzso zzso using early photons can improve resolution and reduce the zzso nature of the inversion zzso In this work we use 360 degrees projection experimental data to investigate the inversion performance of three commonly used zzso inversion zzso the random zzso reconstruction technique zzso singular value decomposition zzso and the zzso method zzso zzso are contrasted to each other and the effects of different zzso propagation models are also zzso We find that all methods perform adequately given appropriate zzso zzso and that an zzso measured zzso weight function yields superior results over two approximate weights that have been previously zzso
