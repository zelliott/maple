The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has recently been shown to form fluctuating channels in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Chung, zzso Gross, zzso Thomas, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 29 zzso zzso To explore this phenomenon further, we have zzso the zzso zzso release of sodium and calcium zzso from zzso zzso zzso to calcium increases zzso with zzso concentration and zzso with decreasing zzso zzso of zzso charged zzso zzso zzso occurs to a similar extent and with a similar pH dependence to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that a charge neutral species is responsible for the zzso The pH dependence of leakage shows that the cooperative zzso of from three to five zzso zzso is required for zzso Such zzso could result in a neutral segment of zzso chain of sufficient length to span the zzso
