The emergence and prevalence of resistance to zzso agents is a pressing threaten for human zzso zzso for novel zzso agents targeting not only zzso but also zzso bacteria using appropriate approach is in great zzso In this study, the zzso method was used to measure the zzso zzso of zzso coli growth affected by zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso By analyzing the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso activities of zzso and zzso on zzso and zzso bacteria of zzso coli zzso zzso were zzso The results illustrated that, for the zzso metabolism of zzso coli, the two compounds controlled the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso respectively, but had no effective action on zzso metabolism of the zzso The action of the two compounds on the zzso metabolism was studied by taking the heat output of zzso coli in the stationary phase as the additive zzso of the zzso The values of zzso were zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso concentration 50) were zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso So, zzso had more powerful zzso activity on zzso coli than zzso either for zzso bacteria or zzso zzso and they both showed stronger activities on zzso metabolism than on zzso metabolism of the zzso The zzso method should be strongly suggested in screening novel zzso agents for fighting against zzso zzso
