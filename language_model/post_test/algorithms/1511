zzso the structure inherent in a set of patterns is a fundamental aim of statistical zzso or zzso One fruitful approach is to build a zzso zzso zzso model, independent draws from which are likely to produce the zzso For all but the simplest zzso models, each pattern can be generated in zzso many zzso It is thus intractable to adjust the parameters to maximize the probability of the observed zzso We describe a way of zzso this zzso explosion by maximizing an easily zzso lower bound on the probability of the zzso Our method can be viewed as a form of zzso zzso learning that may relate to the function of bottom-up and zzso cortical processing zzso
