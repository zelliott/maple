The zzso interaction energies for the zzso and stacked structures of the zzso zzso are determined at the zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of these calculations we can construct the zzso interaction energies at the complete basis set zzso zzso The most accurate zzso based either on direct zzso of the zzso correlation energies obtained with the zzso and zzso basis sets or on the sum of zzso zzso interaction energies (from zzso and zzso basis zzso and zzso zzso correction terms zzso between zzso and zzso interaction zzso differ only slightly, which demonstrates the reliability and zzso of both zzso The latter values, which represent new standards for the zzso and stacking structures of the zzso zzso differ from the previously published data for the zzso set by a small zzso This suggests that interaction energies of the zzso set are generated with chemical zzso The most accurate zzso interaction energies are compared with interaction energies obtained from various zzso procedures, namely the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Among these techniques, the best results are obtained with the zzso zzso Remarkably good binding energies are also obtained with the zzso zzso Both zzso techniques tested yield similarly good interaction zzso The large magnitude of the stacking energy for the zzso zzso compared to that of the zzso zzso is explained by attractive zzso interactions present in the stacked zzso zzso These interactions force both zzso to approach each other and the zzso energy benefits from a shorter zzso zzso
