This study is aimed at assessing the usefulness of different feature selection and zzso zzso in the context of sleep zzso zzso syndrome zzso zzso Feature zzso selection and zzso stages were applied to analyze blood oxygen zzso zzso recordings in order to simplify zzso zzso the gold standard diagnostic methodology for zzso zzso spectral and zzso measures were zzso to compose the initial feature zzso Principal component analysis zzso forward zzso feature selection zzso and genetic zzso zzso were applied to select feature zzso zzso linear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and support zzso machines zzso were applied in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from each combination of these feature selection and zzso approaches were zzso validated on zzso from two independent sleep zzso zzso + zzso achieved the highest diagnostic performance using a small feature subset (4 zzso reaching zzso accuracy in the validation set and zzso accuracy in the test zzso Similarly, zzso + zzso also achieved high zzso capability using a small number of input features (7 zzso with zzso accuracy on the validation set and zzso accuracy in the test zzso Our results suggest that reduced zzso of complementary features zzso to 50% of total zzso and zzso with high zzso ability could provide zzso screening tools in the context of zzso
