Due to the fact that there exist only a small number of complex systems in artificial immune systems zzso that solve zzso problems, there is a need to develop zzso zzso approaches that would be among the well-known solution zzso In this study, we developed a zzso zzso to compensate for this zzso by providing a zzso structure via transformation of distance calculations in the zzso selection models of classical zzso to kernel zzso zzso of the developed system were conducted on zzso heart disease zzso which was taken from the University of California, Irvine zzso zzso and on zzso zzso to diagnose zzso zzso The system obtained a zzso accuracy of zzso for the zzso heart disease zzso while it achieved a zzso zzso success for the zzso zzso With these results, our system seems to be a potential solution method, and it may be considered as a suitable method for hard zzso zzso zzso
