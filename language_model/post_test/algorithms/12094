To determine the relationship between the zzso of zzso intensity in zzso images of the liver and diffuse liver disease in order to assess the usefulness of this method in providing quantitative objective characterization of diffuse liver diseases in general and in fatty liver in zzso 

zzso healthy volunteers and 28 patients with elevated liver zzso levels who underwent liver biopsy were included in this zzso An automatic zzso slope zzso zzso that estimates the decrease in zzso of the zzso echo as a function of beam depth was implemented on the zzso image that was acquired on a commercial zzso ultrasound system fitted to a zzso interface zzso The images were processed at a zzso All scans were acquired zzso read, and graded blindly by experienced ultrasound zzso zzso obtained via needle biopsy was reviewed without knowledge of the ultrasound zzso 

Analysis of the zzso data for fatty zzso in all patient groups yielded a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso a positive zzso value zzso of zzso negative zzso value zzso of zzso and an accuracy of zzso The mean score of the ultrasound zzso showed a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso a zzso of zzso an zzso of zzso and an accuracy of zzso zzso zzso values zzso were found in five patients with proved fatty zzso All of these patients had zzso moderate to severe zzso zzso However, zzso data in patients with uncomplicated zzso fatty zzso revealed a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso a zzso of zzso an zzso of zzso and an accuracy of zzso The best ultrasound score yielded a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso a zzso of zzso an zzso of zzso and an accuracy of zzso in the same zzso 

The data demonstrate an excellent sensitivity zzso of the zzso values in patients with uncomplicated fatty zzso This was also the only group of patients in whom the zzso score was superior to the zzso best zzso The zzso method can be used as a tool to follow up the response to a clinical or research treatment and to obtain zzso of pattern interpretation independently of the individual zzso
