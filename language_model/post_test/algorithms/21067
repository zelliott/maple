The importance of measuring zzso pressure zzso has increased since the negative effects of sustained increased zzso also known as zzso hypertension zzso have become zzso The relation between zzso and abdominal wall tension has been included in several zzso We have developed a device to measure abdominal wall tension by measuring force and zzso This device enables us to investigate the correlation between the abdominal wall tension and zzso The zzso of two corpses (one female, one zzso were zzso with zzso zzso was increased and measured at intervals by means of a zzso zzso zzso tension was measured at seven points on the abdominal wall at each zzso zzso correlation zzso were used to determine the relationship between zzso and tension for each point zzso zzso was used to assess relations between measured tensions versus applied pressure, locations and zzso In both zzso all points showed significant zzso zzso zzso correlations between zzso and abdominal wall zzso The points along the mid zzso plane appear to be more similar compared to more zzso and zzso zzso We have assessed the feasibility of a device that zzso can track changes in zzso zzso performed with the device are preliminary results, and further investigation is zzso
