zzso force fields play an important role in protein structure prediction and de zzso protein design by requiring less zzso effort than detailed zzso zzso A side chain zzso based, distance dependent zzso interaction potential has been zzso A linear programming based zzso was used in which non-native zzso zzso are forced to take a higher energy compared with the corresponding native zzso This model was trained on an enhanced and diverse protein zzso High quality decoy structures were generated for approximately zzso zzso proteins using zzso angle dynamics along with restricted variations of the zzso zzso of the native zzso The resulting decoy set was used to train the model yielding two different side chain zzso based force fields that differ in the way distance dependence has been used to calculate energy zzso These force fields were tested on an independent set of 148 test proteins with 500 decoy structures for each zzso The side chain zzso force fields were successful in correctly identifying approximately zzso native zzso The zzso produced by the proposed zzso distance dependent force fields improved compared with other distance dependent zzso or side chain based force zzso
