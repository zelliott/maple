The Shannon zzso is a standard measure for the order state of symbol zzso such as, for example, DNA zzso In order to incorporate correlations between zzso the zzso of zzso zzso strands of zzso zzso has to be zzso Here, an zzso is presented to estimate such higher order zzso zzso zzso for DNA sequences when the actual number of observations is small compared with the number of possible zzso The zzso probability distribution underlying the zzso process is reconstructed using elementary statistical zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso are set to force the constructed zzso to adopt features which are characteristic for the real probability zzso From the many solutions compatible with these constraints the one with the highest zzso is the most likely one according to the zzso zzso zzso An zzso performing this procedure is zzso It is tested by applying it to various DNA model sequences whose exact zzso are zzso Finally, results for a real DNA zzso the complete zzso of the Epstein zzso virus, are presented and compared with those of other information carriers zzso computer source code, zzso It seems as if DNA sequences possess much more freedom in the combination of the symbols of their alphabet than written language or computer source zzso
