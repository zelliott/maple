zzso resolved zzso zzso of zzso and relaxation time have been performed on a series of sandstone and zzso rock zzso in order to assess spatial zzso in these zzso zzso techniques such as the construction of experimental zzso provide a quantitative measure of zzso although the interpretation of standard techniques is at times zzso Here, we attempt to resolve some of that ambiguity by addressing the influence of zzso zzso averaging over the volume of a zzso on the zzso Modeling the influence of zzso allows measured zzso to be zzso yielding a zzso spectrum that shows the extent of spatial zzso as a function of length zzso The current experiment is sensitive to zzso on the zzso length scale, and zzso zzso of zzso are shown to vary widely from sample to sample over this zzso Thus, this analysis is shown to provide a more detailed description of these porous media than the zzso or the first two moments of the zzso distribution zzso The magnetic resonance aspects of this technique are described here, while details of the zzso methodology are presented in a companion paper zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso submitted for zzso
