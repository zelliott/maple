Images of a tissue simulating phantom are obtained by zzso a limited number of zzso relative transmission zzso The diffusion approximation to the zzso transfer equation is used as a light propagation zzso The inversion procedure is based on a zzso method and the zzso method, and the imaging zzso is the zzso zzso of the zzso It is shown that the resolution of the images can be improved using the zooming zzso The image indicates the presence of an zzso in approximately the correct location, but the shape and size of the zzso in the reconstructed image differs from the shape and size of the actual zzso zzso methods for further enhancement of the images are zzso
