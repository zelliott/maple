zzso large zzso zzso zzso forms a zzso collection of aggressive zzso zzso in which three principle classes of zzso have been defined according to gene expression and zzso zzso The present investigation sought to examine the zzso of proposed zzso and relate these to patient zzso A series of 155 zzso treated zzso with zzso therapy in clinical trials, were zzso upon the basis of common zzso expression with combination zzso being related to patient overall zzso zzso of zzso with respect to combined expression profiles of the three biological markers zzso zzso and zzso revealed six groups showing significant differences in survival zzso The greatest difference resided between distinct populations of zzso zzso zzso cell zzso the first being zzso zzso zzso and the second zzso zzso zzso zzso The former group displayed median survival time of 143 months, the latter only 11 zzso A third population of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso also displayed a relative short median survival (32 zzso Of the three groups presenting a zzso or activated B cell zzso zzso only one zzso zzso and zzso presented short-term median survival (27 zzso comparable with poor prognosis zzso zzso Within the remaining ABC zzso groups zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso patients presented intermediate median survival times of 54 and 58 months, zzso Thus, the zzso zzso did not act as a universal indicator of good clinical zzso but rather multiple groups of zzso zzso were associated with distinct overall survival zzso Ultimately, the data allowed definition of a zzso zzso defining three groups predicting poor, intermediate and good clinical zzso The first of these comprised two patient zzso with zzso zzso together with one zzso of zzso the second two zzso of zzso zzso and the final a single group of zzso zzso associated with optimal long-term zzso
