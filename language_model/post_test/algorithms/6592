zzso are zzso processes and so can be zzso by zzso of zzso zzso each articulation has geometric zzso the set of the coordinates of the relevant zzso build a zzso zzso These zzso zzso reason for zzso movements by means of neural zzso The zzso Feature zzso zzso is a special type of neural network, which (after having been coined by training with appropriate pattern zzso is able to recognize single patterns as members of pattern zzso This way, for example, the particular zzso of a given movement can be identified as belonging to respective zzso zzso where the sequence of clusters to which the zzso zzso zzso characterizes the process as a zzso zzso The advantages of this method are that: the high zzso of the original processes is reduced to two zzso zzso the clusters are automatically determined by the network, and all data for further analyses can automatically be transferred into a data zzso Thus, the processes can either be zzso and zzso by an expert or again processed by further automatic zzso tools, as has been done with similarity zzso The disadvantage is that a zzso needs a huge amount of information, which normally is not available from zzso However, the zzso Controlled Network zzso (a special type of zzso makes it possible to reduce the amount of original training data zzso by adding zzso generated zzso Currently, zzso is used in several projects in order to generally support analyses of processes in zzso It should be emphasized that the presented approach is not meant to improve the understanding or to develop models of human movement but to give a survey of the advantages and zzso aspects of zzso movement zzso
