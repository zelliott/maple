In a pioneer experiment, zzso et zzso realized the controlled sliding of two-dimensional zzso zzso over zzso periodic or zzso zzso Here we present realistic simulations and arguments that besides zzso the main zzso observed features give a first theoretical demonstration of the potential impact of zzso sliding in zzso The free motion of zzso and zzso in the sliding of hard zzso zzso is contrasted with the zzso pair nucleation at the large zzso friction threshold zzso when the two zzso are commensurate and zzso The zzso work directly extracted from zzso zzso can be analyzed as a function of classic zzso zzso including speed, zzso and zzso of the periodic potential zzso respectively, the mismatch of the sliding interface and the zzso or zzso These and other features suggestive of further experiments and insights promote zzso sliding to a unique friction study zzso
