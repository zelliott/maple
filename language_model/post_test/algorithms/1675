A ring of N identical phase zzso with interactions between zzso neighbors is considered, where L ranges from 1 zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso The zzso function is a simple zzso as in the zzso model, but with a minus sign which has a profound influence on its zzso Without the limitation of the zzso the frequency of the zzso zzso can be set to zzso The resulting system is of zzso type, and therefore, all its solutions zzso to an equilibrium zzso All so-called zzso states, where the phase difference between neighboring zzso on the ring is zzso are equilibrium points, where zzso is an zzso Their stability in the limit N zzso zzso is discussed along the line of zzso et zzso zzso 16, zzso zzso In addition, we prove that when a twisted state is zzso stable for the infinite system, it is also zzso stable for sufficiently large zzso Note that for smaller zzso the same zzso states may become unstable and other zzso states may become zzso Finally, the existence of additional equilibrium states, called here zzso states, is shown by zzso zzso The phase difference between neighboring zzso is approximately zzso in one sector of the ring, zzso in another sector, and it has intermediate values between the two zzso Our zzso investigation suggests that the number of different stable zzso states grows zzso as N zzso zzso It is possible to interpret the equilibrium points of the coupled phase zzso network as zzso of a zzso zzso zzso system where the zzso zzso on the zzso plays the role of zzso The zzso states are then fixed points, and the zzso states are periodic solutions of period N that are close to a zzso zzso Due to the apparently zzso fast growing number of such stable periodic solutions, the system shows spatial chaos as N zzso zzso
