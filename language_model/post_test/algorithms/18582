We describe zzso a new computer program for creating multiple alignments of protein zzso zzso of the zzso include fast distance zzso using zzso zzso progressive alignment using a new profile function we call the zzso score, and refinement using zzso restricted zzso The speed and accuracy of zzso are compared with zzso zzso and zzso on four test sets of reference zzso zzso zzso SMART and a new zzso zzso zzso achieves the zzso or joint zzso rank in accuracy on each of these zzso Without zzso zzso achieves average accuracy statistically indistinguishable from zzso and zzso and is the fastest of the tested methods for large numbers of zzso aligning zzso sequences of average length 350 in 7 zzso on a current zzso zzso The zzso program, source code and zzso test data are freely available at zzso zzso
