zzso proteins bind to specific DNA sequences to regulate gene expression in zzso zzso sites are often identified using weight zzso calculated from multiple known binding zzso However, in many cases the number of examples is zzso Here, we report on an zzso method that starts from an zzso zzso structure of the protein bound to one particular DNA zzso and zzso other binding sites, which are used to construct a weight zzso The emphasis of the paper is on using the zzso zzso Carlo zzso to efficiently sample zzso binding sites, which demonstrates that sampling can produce accurate weight zzso in zzso to zzso zzso For cases of low complexity, we compare to the exhaustive (but zzso dead-end elimination zzso To recover crystal binding sites, it is important to include bound water in the zzso zzso Our approach can, in principle, even be applied when no native zzso zzso structure is available, only the structure of a closely related zzso protein whose zzso sequence is changed to the protein of zzso
