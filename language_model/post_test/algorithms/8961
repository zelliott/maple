Driver zzso are zzso zzso that provide growth advantage to tumor cells, while passenger zzso are those not functionally related to zzso zzso drivers from passengers is challenging because drivers occur much less frequently than zzso they tend to have low zzso their functions are zzso and not intuitively zzso zzso zzso are excellent candidates as drivers, as they occur more frequently and are potentially easier to identify than other types of zzso Although several methods have been developed for predicting the functional impact of zzso zzso only a few have been specifically designed for identifying driver zzso As more zzso are being discovered, more accurate zzso models can be developed using machine learning approaches that systematically characterize the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso under the background of specific cancer zzso Here, we present a cancer driver zzso zzso tool that predicts zzso driver zzso based on a set of 95 structural and evolutionary features zzso by over 10 functional prediction zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso Through feature zzso and supervised training, zzso zzso existing tools in analyzing the zzso zzso and zzso zzso data sets in The Cancer Genome zzso and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia zzso
