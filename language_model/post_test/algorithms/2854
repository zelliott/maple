Recognizing lines of zzso handwritten text is a challenging zzso The difficulty of zzso cursive or overlapping characters, combined with the need to exploit surrounding context, has led to low recognition rates for even the best current zzso Most recent progress in the field has been made either through improved zzso or through advances in language zzso Relatively little work has been done on the basic recognition zzso Indeed, most systems rely on the same hidden zzso models that have been used for decades in speech and handwriting recognition, despite their well-known zzso This paper proposes an alternative approach based on a novel type of zzso neural network, specifically designed for sequence labeling tasks where the data is hard to segment and contains long-range zzso zzso In experiments on two large zzso handwriting databases, our approach achieves word recognition zzso of zzso percent on online data and zzso percent on zzso data, significantly outperforming a state-of-the-art zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrate the network's zzso to lexicon size, measure the individual influence of its hidden zzso and analyze its use of zzso zzso we provide an in-depth discussion of the differences between the network and zzso suggesting reasons for the network's superior zzso
