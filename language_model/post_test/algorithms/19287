We study in this paper the statistics of the radio frequency zzso signal in the case of partially developed zzso Using the K distribution zzso we give the probability density function of the associated distribution, the corresponding moments, and zzso for the parameters of the zzso The consistency of the proposed zzso is evaluated in terms of their bias and zzso through zzso zzso The ability of the proposed distribution to model zzso zzso signals from cardiac zzso is evaluated from data acquired in zzso
