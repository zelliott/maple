Live fish zzso returning empty from mainland Europe may mechanically introduce exotic pathogens and zzso to the zzso A qualitative risk assessment approach was adopted to investigate the likelihood of introduction and establishment in rainbow trout farms of viral zzso zzso zzso infectious zzso necrosis zzso and zzso zzso via this zzso A scenario tree was developed and estimates made for the likelihood of each step based on a review of the available zzso The level of uncertainty associated with each step was zzso zzso The likelihood of a zzso becoming contaminated with any of the 3 hazards was only greater than negligible if the zzso made movements between farms in mainland zzso In these circumstances, the overall likelihood of introduction and establishment was extremely low zzso occur very zzso extremely low to negligible and very low zzso occur zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A high level of uncertainty existed due to the lack of data on zzso zzso minimum infectious dose (of the viral zzso and the large zzso in duration and conditions of zzso A telephone survey of live fish zzso found that cleaning and zzso practices after return to the UK were zzso Currently, no zzso zzso make movements between farms in mainland zzso Thus, the likelihood that zzso zzso may become infected is zzso Changes in the way in which zzso live fish zzso operate in mainland Europe need to be monitored and development of a code of practice to zzso the risk of disease introduction zzso
