The usefulness of zzso zzso zzso to evaluate zzso support and adjacent anatomical structures for dental implant placement is limited by the inherent blurring in these zzso The goal of this study was to develop a method to remove blurring while permitting accurate zzso analysis of the potential implant zzso zzso regions zzso zzso zzso zzso on two preserved human zzso were zzso using zzso linear zzso zzso were developed as a personal computer application to remove the blur and to aid in identification of the cortical plate borders and the zzso zzso The data set of eight zzso was digitized and the blur reduced with the developed zzso An operator measured the height and zzso of the zzso on each original zzso and each zzso zzso in zzso zzso error was calculated as the difference between direct zzso zzso of the respective skull regions and image zzso of height and zzso for both the original digitized zzso and the zzso zzso zzso error using the original images zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly greater for both height zzso level of significance, P zzso zzso and zzso zzso level of significance, P zzso zzso These findings suggest that the method developed may greatly improve the ability of clinicians to accurately assess the implant site using zzso zzso linear zzso
