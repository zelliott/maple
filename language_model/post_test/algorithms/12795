zzso zzso has made much progress in recent years, but challenges still zzso Here we present the application of our zzso approach zzso in zzso In this approach, a binding site prediction is implemented to reduce zzso sampling space and filter out unreasonable zzso structures, and a network-based enhanced zzso scoring function zzso is used to evaluate the zzso The experimental information was combined with the predicted binding site to pick out the most likely key binding site zzso We applied the zzso method in the recent rounds of the zzso experiments, and got good results as zzso on targets 39, 40, and zzso We also got good results as scorers on targets 35, 37, 40, and zzso This indicates that our zzso approach can contribute to the progress of zzso zzso methods and to the understanding of the mechanism of zzso zzso
