The recently proposed concept of molecular connectivity maps enables researchers to integrate experimental zzso of zzso zzso zzso and drug compounds under similar biological zzso The study of these maps provides opportunities for future zzso and drug discovery zzso We developed a zzso framework to build zzso zzso connectivity zzso We integrated zzso and drug connectivity information based on protein interaction networks and literature mining, without requiring gene expression profile information derived from drug zzso experiments on disease zzso We described the development and application of this zzso framework using Alzheimer's Disease zzso as a primary example in three zzso First, molecular interaction networks were incorporated to reduce bias and improve relevance of zzso seed zzso Second, zzso abstracts were used to retrieve enriched drug terms that are indirectly associated with zzso through molecular zzso zzso Third and zzso a comprehensive zzso connectivity map was created by relating enriched drugs and related proteins in zzso We showed that this molecular connectivity map development approach outperformed both curated drug target databases and conventional information retrieval zzso Our initial explorations of the zzso connectivity map yielded a new hypothesis that zzso and zzso may be investigated as candidate drugs for zzso zzso zzso connectivity maps derived zzso can help study molecular signature differences between different classes of drugs in specific disease zzso To achieve overall good data coverage and quality, a series of statistical methods have been developed to overcome high levels of data noise in biological networks and literature mining zzso Further development of zzso molecular connectivity maps to cover major disease areas will likely set up a new model for drug development, in which zzso profiles of candidate drugs can be checked zzso before costly clinical trials zzso
