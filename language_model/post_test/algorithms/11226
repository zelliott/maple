Recent advances in zzso zzso sequencing zzso have enabled tremendous leaps forward in our understanding of bacterial zzso However, zzso methods for analysis of bacterial zzso data have not kept pace with the large and growing data sets generated by zzso zzso Here, we present new zzso specific to bacterial gene structures and zzso for analysis of zzso zzso The zzso are implemented in an open source software system called zzso that supports various stages of bacterial zzso data analysis, including aligning sequencing reads to a zzso constructing zzso zzso zzso transcript zzso testing for differential gene zzso determining zzso structures and visualizing zzso We demonstrate the performance of zzso using zzso billion zzso reads from 75 zzso experiments conducted with zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We find that the zzso maps generated by our zzso are highly accurate when compared with focused experimental data from zzso coli and zzso zzso and we validate our system's ability to identify novel small zzso zzso and zzso start zzso Our results suggest that zzso can be used for efficient and accurate analysis of bacterial zzso data, and that it can aid with zzso of bacterial zzso
