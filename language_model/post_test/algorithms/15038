Various methods for automatic zzso zzso detection and zzso zzso assessment have been zzso Most of them use threshold level zzso Comparisons with observer detection were performed due to the lack of objective measurement zzso This study followed the same zzso Observer assessments were performed on 43 various zzso shapes recorded: zzso with 100 zzso zzso equivalent paper speed and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with 160 zzso zzso paper speed and vertical zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso zzso depending on the zzso zzso An automatic detection zzso was developed by adequate selection of the zzso search zzso improved zzso peak detection and zzso of the angle between two 10 zzso long adjacent segments along the search zzso The zzso avoids the use of baseline crossing and direct signal zzso It performs well in cases of zzso and/or complex zzso zzso Mean differences with respect to observer data are zzso zzso for the higher zzso records and zzso zzso for the lower zzso zzso The zzso was tested with 254 various zzso zzso Comparisons with two other zzso are zzso The lack of a zzso zzso for the zzso zzso especially if small waves occur around it, zzso adequate zzso assessment and evaluation of automatic zzso It is speculated that a simultaneous presentation of normal and zzso records might turn more attention to this zzso Automatic detection methods are in fact faced with zzso data, as high-resolution zzso conversion is already widely zzso
