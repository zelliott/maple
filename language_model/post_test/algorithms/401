zzso of zzso light scattering and zzso zzso effect are carried out at room temperature for 100 zzso zzso solutions of zzso loaded with 0, 90, 100, 500, zzso and 1500 zzso zzso Because of the zzso shape, zzso zzso should not manifest magnetic zzso however, in solution it shows the induced magnetic zzso zzso zzso and changes in intensity of the scattered light zzso The newly obtained data support the previously reported conclusions indicating that the deformation of linear optical zzso induced in the zzso by a magnetic field and the orientation of the induced magnetic zzso moment by this field are the main sources of the zzso phenomena zzso Nevertheless, it is also found that the orientation of the permanent magnetic zzso moment contributes to both zzso The magnetic field induced changes in the light scattering and the CM effect theoretically depend on the linear zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso and square of the permanent magnetic zzso moment value of the zzso zzso On the basis of the theory describing both effects as well as the experimental data, the values of the zzso of linear zzso zzso zzso the values of the linear optical zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso are zzso Also the magnetic zzso moment of the zzso zzso is zzso Interestingly, not all iron atoms in the zzso are indicated to be in the zzso state, some of them occur in the zzso zzso
