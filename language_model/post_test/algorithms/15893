When measuring zzso disease, various types of equipment for making objective zzso of tooth mobility have been zzso However, these devices and methodology are insufficient in terms of zzso An innovative method using zzso theories to assess the zzso attachment level of natural teeth is presented in this zzso 

zzso testing technique, a zzso and zzso method, was used for zzso and quantitative measurement of the natural zzso of the upper central zzso in zzso and in zzso A finite element model was established, and modal testing experiments were simulated to assess the relationship between bone level and zzso 

The first dominant natural frequency of healthy human upper central zzso ranges from zzso zzso to zzso zzso with an average of zzso zzso Both in zzso experiment and finite element simulation showed that lowering of the attachment level causes a significant decrease in the natural zzso and a strong relationship zzso zzso zzso P zzso was observed between the frequency and the bone level zzso 

Our results suggested that natural frequency is an important zzso for assessing the zzso condition and that the modal testing technique is a useful supplemental method for assessing the attachment conditions of the zzso
