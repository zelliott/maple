The identification of interactions between drugs and proteins plays key roles in understanding mechanisms underlying drug actions and can lead to new drug design zzso Here, we present a novel statistical approach, namely zzso zzso Drug zzso with zzso to predict potential target proteins of new drugs based on derived interactions between drugs and protein zzso The known target proteins of those drugs that have similar therapeutic effects allow us to zzso interactions between drugs and protein zzso which in turn leads to identification of potential zzso zzso zzso with known zzso interactions shows that our proposed methodology zzso previous methods that exploit either protein sequences or compound structures to predict drug targets, which demonstrates the zzso power of our proposed zzso zzso
