Recently, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Vision Research, 35, zzso found that human efficiency for object recognition was less than zzso indicating that humans fail to use much of the information available to an ideal zzso We examine two explanations for these low zzso zzso humans are inefficient in using high zzso zzso and zzso humans are inefficient in detecting image zzso We tested the first possibility by measuring human efficiency for recognizing zzso filtered objects, rendered as line drawings and zzso in zzso zzso Efficiency did not improve when high zzso were removed, and the first explanation was zzso We tested the second explanation by comparing efficiencies for object detection and zzso zzso efficiency was higher than detection efficiency for zzso but not line drawings, showing that detection efficiency does not place a ceiling on recognition zzso The results indicate that human vision is designed to extract image features, such as zzso that enhance zzso A computer simulation suggests that this can occur if the observer views the world through a zzso zzso zzso
