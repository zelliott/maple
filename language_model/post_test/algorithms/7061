In order to establish a total artificial heart zzso control method during exercise, a zzso control method was developed to increase the cardiac output zzso during exercise in a profile similar to that of a natural zzso this was achieved by predicting changes in CO as a time function at various treadmill zzso During exercise, the CO of the zzso was controlled to follow the time function by changing operating parameters such as the positive and negative pressures, zzso ratio, and pulse rate of both artificial heart pumps under a computerized control zzso To evaluate this control method, four zzso zzso were exercised on a zzso The zzso were recorded before, zzso and after zzso the blood zzso blood zzso zzso oxygen difference, and blood zzso were measured before and immediately after zzso The zzso control method was then compared with both the natural heart and also the fixed control method, in which the operating parameters remained unchanged during zzso It was concluded that 1) with the zzso control method, changes in the CO of the zzso were almost the same as in the natural zzso On the other hand, no increase in CO occurred with the fixed control zzso 2) with the zzso control method, changes in the blood zzso blood zzso and zzso oxygen difference were significantly lower than with the fixed control zzso This study showed that the zzso goat with the zzso control method resulted in being subjected to less stress than with the fixed control method, and that this method can be zzso employed until such time as an ideal feedback control method for the zzso can be zzso
