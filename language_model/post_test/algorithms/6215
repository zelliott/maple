Most models of positive directional selection assume zzso of the beneficial zzso We examine the importance of this assumption by implementing a zzso model of positive directional selection with arbitrary zzso We find that, for a given mean fixation time, a beneficial zzso has a much weaker effect on diversity at linked neutral sites when the zzso is zzso
