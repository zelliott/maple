zzso zzso designs frequently support higher order zzso zzso usually as a consequence of process limitations such as zzso In these systems, it is important to minimize zzso to zzso modes so that the system nonetheless behaves single zzso We propose a zzso approach to design zzso zzso connections with minimal zzso zzso An application of this zzso in designing the zzso of a zzso spiral zzso is demonstrated with approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared to other approaches, our zzso requires less fabrication resolution and is able to minimize the transition loss over a broadband zzso The method can be applied to a wide range of turns and connections and has the advantage of handling connections with arbitrary boundary zzso
