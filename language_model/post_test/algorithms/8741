zzso or drug-resistant zzso occurs in up to zzso of zzso patients, with many of these patients undergoing surgical zzso of the affected brain region to achieve seizure zzso Recent magnetic resonance imaging zzso sequences and analysis techniques have the potential to detect abnormalities not identified with diagnostic zzso zzso Prospective studies involving zzso imaging and collection of zzso tissue provide a unique opportunity for zzso and tuning of these image analysis techniques, since direct comparison can be made against zzso and can lead to better prediction of surgical outcomes and potentially less invasive zzso To carry out zzso and zzso comparison, spatial correspondence between the MR images and the zzso images must be zzso zzso this goal, a novel pipeline is presented here for bringing zzso zzso of zzso zzso lobe specimens and digital zzso into spatial zzso The zzso zzso images represent a challenge for zzso reconstruction which we address with a combined zzso and zzso registration zzso that zzso between zzso and zzso registration with the zzso zzso We evaluated our registration method on specimens zzso from patients undergoing anterior zzso zzso zzso and found our method to have a mean target registration error of zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso specimens zzso This work allows for the zzso comparison of zzso with zzso zzso and zzso the way for eventual correlation with zzso zzso image analysis zzso
