A model of the zzso behavior of an zzso zzso a finger, is zzso The model includes the effects of heat zzso zzso heat generation, heat transport by blood zzso heat exchange between the tissue and the large blood vessels, and zzso heat zzso Heat exchange with the environment through a layer of zzso zzso depicting zzso zzso is also zzso The tissue is subdivided into four concentric layers zzso from the center outward, core, muscle, fat, and zzso zzso heat balance equations are formulated for the tissue and for the major artery and the major vein zzso the zzso These coupled equations are solved zzso by a zzso alternating direction method employing a Thomas zzso The zzso scheme was extensively tested for its stability and zzso This paper presents the model equations and results of the convergence tests, and shows plots of blood and tissue temperatures along the axis of the model for combinations of parameters including the effect of zzso heat exchange between the artery and the zzso
