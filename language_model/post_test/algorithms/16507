zzso therapy in zzso cell transplantation is initiated by a diagnostic technique at first detection of zzso zzso The aim of this study was to use the viral dynamics of zzso DNA viral to start zzso therapy, and to zzso compare the zzso viral load zzso to zzso zzso Two hundred zzso blood samples were collected zzso from 93 zzso All clinical decisions regarding use of zzso therapy were based on zzso zzso Based on the zzso of the zzso zzso and clinical zzso outcome in zzso patients, an optimal threshold of zzso log 10 zzso zzso was found to discriminate patients who required zzso therapy and those who did not zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso level increase of zzso log 10 zzso zzso per day was the optimal threshold to discriminate between patients who required zzso therapy and those who did not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso compared with zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A standardized real-time zzso zzso is more appropriate than the zzso zzso for detecting zzso It allowed earlier diagnosis of active zzso infection and monitoring of the response to zzso zzso
