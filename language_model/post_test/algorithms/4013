zzso zzso blood oxygen zzso zzso signal changes can be zzso motivating the use of imaging parameters and processing strategies that maximize the zzso zzso ratio zzso and thus the detection power of zzso zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that acquiring data at higher spatial resolutions results in greater percent zzso signal changes, and zzso that zzso smoothing higher resolution zzso data improves zzso beyond that of data originally acquired at a lower zzso However, higher resolution images come at the cost of increased acquisition time, and the number of image volumes also influences zzso The goal of our study is to determine how the detection power of zzso induced zzso fluctuations acquired at higher spatial resolutions and then zzso smoothed compares to data acquired at the lower resolutions with the same imaging zzso The number of time points acquired during a given amount of imaging time is a practical consideration given the limited ability of certain populations to lie still in the zzso zzso We compare acquisitions at three different zzso spatial resolutions zzso zzso zzso in terms of their zzso zzso ratio, and the power to detect both zzso zzso and zzso functional zzso The impact of zzso zzso which speeds up acquisition time increasing the number of images collected, is also zzso Our results show that after zzso smoothing the data to the same intrinsic resolution, lower resolution acquisitions have a slightly higher detection power of zzso in some, but not all, brain zzso There were no significant differences in functional connectivity as a function of resolution after zzso Similarly, the reduced zzso of zzso data acquired with a zzso factor of 2 is offset by the greater number of images acquired, resulting in few significant differences in detection power of either functional zzso or connectivity after spatial zzso
