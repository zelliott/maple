In this paper, we present a novel zzso texture model and a related zzso for the zzso zzso of color zzso Elementary textures are characterized by their spatial interactions with neighboring regions along selected zzso Such interactions are zzso in turn, by means of a set of zzso zzso one for each direction, whose parameters are collected in a feature zzso that zzso describes the zzso Based on the feature zzso the texture are then zzso zzso giving rise to larger and more complex zzso which appear at different scales of zzso zzso the model is named zzso Multiple zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and Reconstruction zzso algorithm, addresses the zzso zzso problem based on the zzso zzso The zzso step allows one to find the elementary textures of the model, while the zzso step defines the zzso image zzso based on a zzso measure zzso zzso which takes into account both region scale and zzso zzso The performance of the proposed method was assessed through the Prague zzso zzso based on mosaics of real natural zzso and also tested on real-world natural and remote sensing zzso
