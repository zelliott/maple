In this article, we present methodology for making zzso about projected zzso in the presence of zzso The approach is motivated by a clinical trial that investigates a treatment for disability among individuals who sustain severe head zzso Although most studies attempt to make zzso about the entire study population, our application poses important scientific questions targeting individuals who are likely to complete the study or to remain on protocol for a specified time zzso We propose using measures of each zzso dropout inclination to identify projected zzso and then building a zzso response model based on projected completion zzso We present several prediction measures along with procedures for evaluating accuracy with respect to observed zzso zzso of model parameters proceeds using maximum likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood zzso We illustrate the utility of our proposed analysis by using the motivating disability data zzso
