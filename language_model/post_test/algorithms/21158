There is a need for an imaging sequence that can provide high-resolution diffusion zzso images at zzso near zzso zzso By employing a zzso fast zzso zzso collection in conjunction with magnitude filtered zzso zzso high-resolution zzso images can be produced without zzso zzso However, violation of the zzso zzso condition of diffusion prepared zzso is a prominent problem for zzso trains that is magnified at higher zzso The unique aspect of violating the zzso condition in zzso that zzso the center of zzso and the implications for choosing the solution are zzso For collecting zzso zzso data at zzso we propose zzso phase cycling of zzso zzso zzso combined with a zzso wider zzso than zzso zzso It is shown that this approach produces accurate diffusion values in a zzso and can be used to collect zzso high-resolution diffusion zzso images of the human zzso
