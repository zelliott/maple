To evaluate the accuracy of the apparent diffusion zzso zzso provided by zzso imaging zzso in predicting the response to zzso chemotherapy zzso at baseline in patients according to their breast zzso zzso 

This retrospective study was approved by our institutional review zzso One hundred zzso consecutive women with locally advanced breast cancer who had undergone zzso followed by breast surgery were zzso zzso was performed at zzso less than zzso before zzso We studied the correlation between zzso zzso and response in pathology after surgery according to zzso features and intrinsic zzso zzso A, zzso B, zzso and zzso zzso 

After surgery, the pathologist recognized 24 complete zzso zzso and 94 zzso zzso zzso No difference was identified between the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso There were differences in zzso zzso among the zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso zzso was higher in zzso zzso zzso zzso than in zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso can predict the response of breast cancer to zzso if zzso zzso are zzso Key Points zzso zzso diffusion zzso helps clinicians to assess patients with breast zzso zzso zzso zzso is related to zzso grade and hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is lower in zzso A and B than in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is higher in complete than in zzso zzso to zzso zzso
