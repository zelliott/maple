Though zzso zzso is essential in the evaluation of heart zzso properties, it has never been zzso measured in zzso By the zzso measurement of the zzso motion, we have already found that some zzso waves are spontaneously excited by zzso closure zzso at zzso zzso These waves may serve as an ideal source of the intrinsic heart sound caused by zzso In this study, using a sparse sector zzso in which the beam directions are restricted to about 16, the zzso waves were measured almost simultaneously at about 160 points set along the heart wall at a sufficiently high frame zzso The consecutive spatial phase zzso obtained by the zzso transform of the measured waves, clearly revealed wave propagation along the heart wall for the first zzso The propagation time of the wave along the heart wall is very small zzso several zzso and cannot be measured by conventional zzso Based on this phenomenon, we developed a means to measure the zzso zzso in zzso In this zzso the phase zzso of the wave is determined for each frequency zzso By comparing the zzso of the phase zzso with the theoretical one of the Lamb wave (the plate zzso zzso which zzso along the zzso plate zzso wall) immersed in blood, the instantaneous zzso is determined zzso This is the first report of such zzso zzso In in zzso experiments applied to five healthy subjects, propagation of the zzso wave was clearly visible in all zzso For the zzso zzso the typical propagation speed rapidly decreased from 5 zzso just before the time of zzso zzso zzso zzso - 8 zzso to 3 zzso at zzso zzso zzso + 10 zzso In the experiments, it was possible to determine the zzso more precisely than the zzso The typical value of elasticity was about zzso zzso and did not change around the time of zzso The typical transient values of zzso decreased rapidly from 400 Pa zzso s at zzso zzso zzso - 8 zzso to 70 Pa zzso s at zzso zzso zzso + 10 zzso The measured zzso elasticity and zzso in this study are comparable to those obtained for the human zzso using audio frequency in in zzso experiments reported in the zzso
