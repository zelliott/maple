The zzso zzso zzso of small zzso zzso have been zzso to mechanically zzso adjacent collagen zzso and contribute to zzso zzso zzso depletion of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso has emerged as a preferred method to zzso assess this zzso However, zzso removal is typically incomplete and the possibility remains that extant zzso may remain mechanically zzso The current study specifically investigated the potential mechanical effect of the remaining zzso after partial zzso zzso A three-dimensional finite element model of zzso was created based upon the concept of zzso zzso zzso load zzso zzso 250 zzso zzso collagen zzso were modeled as having a length of 400 zzso being composed of rod elements of length 67 zzso and zzso 1 zzso connected in zzso zzso distribution and diameters of these idealized zzso were derived from a representative zzso electron zzso of zzso Rod element lengths corresponded to the collagen zzso zzso widely accepted to act as a binding site for zzso and zzso the most abundant zzso in zzso Each element zzso was connected to zzso of any neighboring zzso within a radius of 100 zzso the slack length of zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso were the sole mechanism for lateral load sharing among the zzso zzso and were modeled as zzso spring zzso zzso of zzso testing of zzso with complete zzso closely reproduced corresponding experiments on rat tail zzso Random reduction of zzso of zzso zzso zzso to a conservative estimate of zzso depletion zzso predicted a drop of zzso in zzso zzso zzso mechanical properties derived from experiments on rat tail zzso treated in buffer with and without zzso ABC were apparently zzso regardless of zzso zzso Further tests for zzso conservatively based on effect size limits predicted by the model, confirmed equivalent zzso between zzso depleted zzso and their native zzso Although the model predicts that relatively small quantities of zzso acting as primary collagen zzso elements could provide mechanical integrity to the tendon, partial zzso depletion of zzso should result in mechanical changes that are not reflected in analogous experimental zzso We thus conclude that zzso side chains of small zzso zzso are not a primary zzso of zzso mechanical behavior in mature rat tail zzso
