The surface zzso zzso signal can be used for force prediction and control in prosthetic zzso Because of technological advances on zzso sensors, the use of intramuscular zzso zzso is becoming a potential alternative to zzso for the control of multiple zzso zzso An invasive system is not affected by zzso typical of zzso and provides more stable and independent control zzso However, intramuscular recordings provide more local information because of their high zzso and may thus be less representative of the global muscle activity with respect to zzso This study investigates the capacity of selective single-channel zzso recordings to represent the grasping force with respect to the use of zzso with the aim of assessing if zzso can be an effective method for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were recorded zzso from 10 subjects who exerted six grasping force profiles from 0 to zzso The linear correlation zzso between features extracted from zzso and force was approximately zzso and was not significantly different from the degree of correlation between zzso and zzso This result indicates that a selective zzso recording is representative of the applied grasping force and can be used for zzso zzso
