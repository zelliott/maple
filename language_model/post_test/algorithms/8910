zzso mediate portions of their activity via zzso of the zzso acid zzso zzso Although its molecular structure remains unknown, significant progress has been made toward understanding its interactions with zzso via molecular zzso 

The structure of the torpedo zzso zzso zzso the structures of the zzso and zzso zzso of the human zzso the structures of the zzso zzso zzso channel zzso and the zzso zzso channels, from zzso zzso and zzso zzso were aligned with the zzso and zzso zzso A multiple sequence alignment from these structures and those of the zzso was performed with zzso The zzso and zzso zzso independently created three-dimensional zzso of the zzso from the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso a zzso series of zzso derivatives into the binding pocket and scored calculated binding affinities for correlation with known zzso zzso zzso 

Multiple structure alignments of templates revealed a clear consensus of zzso locations relevant to zzso effects except for torpedo zzso Within the zzso models generated from zzso the zzso notable for modulating zzso action within zzso segments 1, 2, and 3 zzso on the zzso interface between zzso and zzso zzso zzso scores of a zzso zzso series into this binding site showed strong linear correlation with zzso zzso zzso 

Consensus structural alignment based on zzso templates revealed an zzso zzso binding cavity within the zzso domain of the zzso which showed a correlation of zzso zzso scores with zzso measured zzso zzso
