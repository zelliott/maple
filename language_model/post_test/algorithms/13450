zzso zzso zzso is the most common zzso zzso in clinical practice, thus, being the subject of intensive research both in medicine and zzso zzso zzso zzso is a measure of the disorder degree of a specific phenomena in both time and frequency zzso allowing to reveal underlying zzso processes out of sight for other zzso The present work introduces two different WE applications to the zzso zzso of patients in zzso The first application predicts the spontaneous termination of zzso zzso zzso whereas the second one deals with the electrical zzso zzso outcome in persistent zzso zzso In both applications, WE was used with the objective of assessing the zzso zzso zzso waves zzso zzso changes into the f waves reflect the zzso activity organization variation, and this fact can be used to predict zzso zzso To this respect, results in the prediction of zzso termination regarding sensitivity, zzso and accuracy were zzso zzso and zzso zzso On the other hand, for zzso outcome zzso zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso and zzso accuracy were zzso These results turn WE as the highest single predictor of spontaneous zzso termination and zzso outcome, thus being a promising tool to characterize zzso zzso zzso
