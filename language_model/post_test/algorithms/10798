In this study, a hidden zzso Model was constructed and conditions were investigated that would provide improved performance for a zzso speech zzso zzso recognition zzso The speaker zzso system was intended to act as an zzso zzso A small size vocabulary spoken by three cerebral zzso subjects was zzso Fast zzso zzso linear zzso and Mel frequency zzso zzso extracted from data provided training input to several zzso hidden zzso model zzso The effect of model structure, number of states, and frame rates were also zzso It was noted that a zzso zzso model using 15 zzso frames was better than other zzso Furthermore, it was found that a Mel zzso based model outperformed a fast zzso transform and linear prediction based zzso The system offers effective and robust application as a rehabilitation and/or control tool to assist zzso motor impaired zzso
