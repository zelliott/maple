zzso zzso release zzso zzso are probably the most accurate tests for the detection of zzso zzso tuberculosis infection, but zzso are zzso intensive and the transport of samples over longer distances is zzso zzso protein zzso is expressed at zzso higher levels than zzso and zzso release zzso have comparable performance to zzso The aim of this study was to explore the diagnostic potential of a novel zzso release zzso based on dried plasma spots zzso The presence of zzso and zzso was determined in plasma and in zzso by zzso zzso zzso for plasma and zzso tests for zzso were developed on a training cohort zzso 60 tuberculosis zzso patients and 59 healthy zzso zzso accuracy was assessed in a validation cohort zzso 78 zzso patients and 98 healthy zzso Plasma was measured in Spain and zzso samples were sent to Denmark using the conventional postal service for zzso zzso was readily zzso in both plasma and zzso and correlation was excellent zzso zzso zzso zzso Gold zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and plasma rendered comparable sensitivity zzso zzso and zzso respectively), specificity zzso zzso and zzso zzso and indeterminate rates zzso The zzso zzso test has comparable diagnostic accuracy to the zzso and samples can be sent via conventional mail over long distances for analysis without affecting the zzso
