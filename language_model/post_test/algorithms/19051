Since the completion of human zzso sequencing, cataloging of all zzso functional elements has been one of the challenging problems in zzso Deciphering zzso elements in the human zzso still remains elusive although much effort has been zzso This paper reviews a suite of methods for zzso motif discovery including mathematical zzso de zzso zzso based on multiple local zzso and zzso sequence scanning method for putative zzso We formulate a general method to address this challenge and compare two major existing zzso zzso greedy local search and Gibbs zzso implemented to solve the popular zzso structured motif discovery zzso We demonstrate how to use this suite of methods and apply them to human nuclear zzso response elements zzso protein binding sites of several relevant nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso
