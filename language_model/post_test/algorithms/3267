In this paper, we consider the pinning control problem of zzso weighted complex zzso zzso The well-studied zzso complex networks are the special cases of the zzso zzso The network model considered can represent both directed and zzso weighted zzso First, based on the zzso analysis and zzso stability theory, some local stability properties of such pinned zzso networks are derived and the valid stability regions are zzso A surprising finding is that the zzso complex networks can stabilize itself by reducing the zzso zzso without pinning any zzso Second, zzso zzso for zzso complex networks are introduced in zzso Finally, zzso simulations in zzso complex networks are provided to show that the smaller zzso zzso the larger control gain zzso D, the larger zzso weight zzso zzso the larger overall zzso strength zzso the more capacity that the pinning scheme may possess to enhance the control performance of zzso complex zzso
