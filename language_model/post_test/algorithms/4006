State of the art magnetic resonance imaging zzso scanners are generally equipped with zzso receive zzso 16 or 32 channel coils are zzso Their development has been zzso for parallel imaging to enable faster zzso Less consideration has been given to localized magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso studies, for example zzso or zzso zzso are often conducted with a single element zzso located over the region of zzso zzso MRS studies have generally employed the same zzso coils used for zzso but little consideration has been given as to how the zzso data from the different channels are zzso In many cases it is simply zzso with zzso effect on the signal to noise zzso In this study, we derive the optimum method for combining zzso data, namely weighting with the ratio of signal to the square of the zzso We show that provided that the noise is zzso this is the theoretical optimal zzso The method is demonstrated for in zzso zzso MRS data acquired using a 32 channel receive zzso at zzso in four different brain zzso left motor and right zzso zzso zzso and zzso frontal zzso
