Pulmonary ventilation and circulation dynamics are reflected on dynamic chest zzso as changes in X-ray zzso zzso zzso The present study was performed to develop a pulmonary functional evaluation method based on the changes in zzso value, and to investigate the clinical usefulness of our zzso zzso chest zzso of 20 subjects zzso zzso during zzso were obtained with a dynamic flat-panel detector zzso zzso The average zzso value in each local area was measured tracking the same zzso To facilitate visual zzso the results were mapped on the original image using a zzso in which small changes were shown in black and large changes were shown in zzso In our clinical evaluation in comparison with a pulmonary zzso pulmonary ventilation disorder was indicated as a reduction of changes in zzso zzso In many patients, there was a correlation between our result and a pulmonary zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso 1 zzso The present method with real-time computer analysis is expected to be a rapid and simple method for evaluating pulmonary function and as an additional examination in conventional chest zzso
