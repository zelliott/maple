Although zzso identity between donor and recipient is no longer an absolute requirement for bone zzso zzso knowledge of the degree of zzso zzso is necessary for determining the induction and zzso regimen to be zzso In cases of related donor zzso zzso zzso may be assessed by defining the zzso zzso at the zzso level using zzso zzso typing methods or by determining the zzso of the patient and potential donor from the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso of their family zzso 

We developed an zzso that can be used to assess the relative costs of these two zzso We applied population zzso for zzso zzso to this zzso to determine at what cost per test ratio for zzso testing the costs of the two approaches are zzso 

In transplants involving a sibling pair who have the same zzso zzso and zzso zzso these values are zzso for African-Americans and zzso for zzso depending on the relatives available for zzso With a slight increase in the resolution level achieved with DR zzso testing, the range of values becomes zzso We also estimated that the probability that two zzso identical siblings have identical zzso zzso is zzso for both African-Americans and zzso A review of zzso cases from our transplant program showed that all of 192 pairs of zzso identical patients and sibling donors were zzso or zzso zzso indicating that this estimate is zzso 

zzso programs can apply these zzso to determine the most cost-effective scheme for zzso zzso
