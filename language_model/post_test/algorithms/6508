The purpose of this study is to develop a new method for assessment of the zzso of zzso detection zzso schemes for digitized zzso and to evaluate the possibility of using the implemented approach for improving zzso zzso Two thousand digitized zzso (representing 500 zzso with 300 depicted verified masses were selected in the zzso Series of images were generated for each digitized image by zzso after a series of slight image zzso A zzso scheme developed in our laboratory was applied to all images to detect suspicious mass zzso We evaluated the zzso of the scheme using the detection sensitivity and zzso rates for the original and zzso zzso We also explored the possibility of improving zzso performance using three methods of combining results from the original and zzso images, including simple zzso averaging output scores, and averaging output scores after zzso The zzso scheme generated a detection score (from 0 to 1) for each identified suspicious zzso A region with a detection score zzso was considered as zzso The zzso scheme detected zzso masses zzso zzso zzso and identified zzso zzso regions zzso zzso per zzso in the original image zzso In zzso repeated tests using original and ten sets of rotated and zzso images, the scheme detected a maximum of zzso masses and identified as many as zzso zzso zzso Two hundred and zzso masses zzso and zzso zzso regions zzso were detected in all 11 sets of zzso Combining detection results improved zzso and the overall zzso zzso In the range of an average zzso detection rate between zzso and 1 per image, the sensitivity of the scheme could be increased approximately zzso after averaging the scores of the regions detected in at least four zzso At low zzso rate zzso zzso or zzso zzso per zzso the grouping method alone could increase zzso sensitivity by zzso The study demonstrated that zzso of a zzso scheme can be tested using a set of slightly rotated and zzso zzso Because the zzso of zzso zzso is generally higher than that of zzso zzso combining detection results generated from zzso of rotated and zzso images could improve both zzso and overall performance of zzso zzso
