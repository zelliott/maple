This article aims at the gas flow into the zzso of conventional zzso the prolonged cyclone zzso a vertical tube at the bottom of the dust zzso is proposed by some researchers, which can make flow with dust enter into the tube and separate zzso The Reynolds stress transport model zzso has been employed to predict the gas flow fields of the conventional and prolonged zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso profiles and turbulent kinetic energy profiles are zzso and the downward flow rates into the zzso of the three zzso are zzso The separation performances of these three zzso are zzso The result indicates that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and turbulent kinetic energy in the zzso reduce greatly when the prolonged vertical tube attaching into the dust outlet, which can avoid the zzso of already separated dust zzso Furthermore, the prolonged vertical tube increases the separation space of zzso The downward flow rate into the zzso of the prolonged cyclone decreases compared with the conventional zzso The experimental results show that the prolonged vertical tube can improve the separation efficiency by a slightly increased pressure zzso However, for an even longer tube, the separation efficiency is slightly zzso Thus, there is an optimal tube length for a given zzso
