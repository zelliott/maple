Recent studies show that along with single zzso zzso and small zzso larger structural zzso among human individuals are zzso The Human Genome zzso Variation Project aims to identify and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in a small number of normal individuals with a zzso zzso sequencing approach using traditional sequencing zzso The realization of new zzso sequencing platforms now makes it feasible to detect the full spectrum of zzso variation among many individual zzso including cancer patients and others suffering from diseases of zzso zzso Unfortunately, existing zzso for identifying structural variation zzso among individuals have not been designed to handle the short read lengths and the errors implied by the zzso sequencing zzso zzso In this paper, we give zzso zzso for the zzso detection between a reference zzso sequence and a zzso zzso whole zzso zzso zzso We describe efficient zzso for each of the zzso we zzso which all turn out to be fast and quite zzso they are also zzso to all zzso sequencing methods zzso zzso Life Sciences zzso zzso zzso zzso and traditional zzso sequencing zzso We apply our zzso to identify zzso among individual zzso very recently zzso by zzso zzso
