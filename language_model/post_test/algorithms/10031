A dynamic model for plant cell metabolism was used as a basis for a rational analysis of plant production potential in in zzso zzso The model was zzso with data from zzso zzso zzso A dynamic sensitivity analysis framework was developed to zzso the response zzso of secondary zzso production to zzso and medium zzso zzso results suggest that a straightforward engineering of cell metabolism or medium composition might only have a limited effect on zzso To circumvent the problem of the dynamic allocation of resources between growth and production zzso the sensitivity analysis framework was used to assess the effect of stabilizing zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that a stabilization of zzso zzso and nitrogen reserves could lead to a zzso increase in the specific production of secondary zzso compared with standard culture zzso This culture strategy was implemented zzso using a zzso zzso To stabilize zzso zzso zzso medium feeding was performed using model mass balances and zzso This allowed for a completely automated culture, with controlled conditions and zzso decision making zzso The proposed culture strategy leads to a zzso increase in specific production and a zzso increase in total production, as compared with a standard batch culture zzso The sensitivity analysis on a mathematical model of plant metabolism thus allowed producing new insights on the links between zzso nutritional management and cell zzso The experimental zzso was also a significant improvement on current plant zzso zzso
