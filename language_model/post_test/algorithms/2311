The zzso of the zzso zzso rate from zzso of hormone concentration in plasma can be formulated as a zzso zzso In particular, the paper addresses the analysis of frequently sampled data collected in order to study spontaneous zzso zzso Standard zzso methods do not allow for the zzso constraint and the presence of zzso components in the zzso zzso In order to overcome the intrinsic zzso of the problem, the maximum zzso method is used to obtain a zzso representation of the prior knowledge concerning the unknown zzso zzso thus leading to a White zzso Noise zzso zzso The zzso problem is then posed within a zzso framework and solved by means of zzso zzso The program that zzso the zzso handles zzso constraints, provides confidence zzso and is zzso and memory zzso
