Analysis of the fetal zzso zzso allows physicians to detect changes in the well-being state of the zzso But when assessing the zzso through the abdominal signals zzso its very low zzso causes a problem, as the zzso representation in the zzso is buried in a mixture of other signals with stronger zzso Different methods have been proposed in the past to extract the zzso zzso for instantaneous fetal heart rate zzso zzso four representatives of them are selected for an accurate comparison of their performance in zzso extraction and in zzso zzso A model for the zzso including all the possible disturbances is developed within this study to generate simulated data as they are required for the quantitative comparison of the zzso Their performances and limits considering both the enhancement of the zzso and the ability to preserve zzso zzso are analyzed using the simulated zzso The results clearly show that linear methods for maternal zzso removal provide better results with respect to the extraction of the zzso zzso The zzso are then tested on real zzso data recorded during zzso Finally, the advantage of considering linear methods for zzso processing is zzso
