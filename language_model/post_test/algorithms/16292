The empirical mode decomposition zzso method can zzso decompose a zzso time series into a number of zzso or frequency modulated functions known as intrinsic mode zzso This paper combines the zzso method with information analysis and presents a framework of zzso zzso The enhanced zzso method has been exploited in the analysis of neural zzso It zzso a signal and extracts only the most zzso zzso contained in the zzso zzso Information analysis has shown that the extracted components retain the information content of the zzso More importantly, a limited number of components reveal the main zzso presented in the signal and their instantaneous zzso which are not often obvious from the original zzso This zzso zzso method has been tested on several field potential zzso for the analysis of stimulus coding in visual cortex, from single and multiple channels, and for finding information connectivity among zzso The results demonstrate the usefulness of the method in zzso relevant responses from the recorded zzso An investigation is also conducted on utilizing the zzso phase for cases where phase information can further improve information analysis and stimulus zzso The components of the proposed method have been integrated into a zzso and the initial zzso is also zzso
