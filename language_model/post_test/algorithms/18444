zzso identification of the zzso zzso zzso and accurate evaluation of this zzso tumor status constitute the most precise technique for staging clinically localized zzso zzso However, even if tumor is present in the zzso (as in approximately zzso of zzso the remaining zzso in the basin are often zzso We have found that the zzso thickness of the primary, the relative area of tumor in the zzso (with respect to the area of the zzso and the density of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso not only can predict the likelihood of zzso zzso zzso but also are correlated with likelihood of tumor recurrence and zzso zzso The most robust of these zzso is relative tumor area, and this may be used as the basis of practical zzso zzso
