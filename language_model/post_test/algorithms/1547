In visual zzso research, zzso evoked zzso zzso can be zzso by one or more zzso current zzso delivered to the zzso nerve zzso through penetrating zzso zzso zzso recorded from the visual zzso usually contain large stimulus artifacts caused by instantaneous zzso current spread through the brain zzso These stimulus artifacts contaminate the zzso zzso and often make subsequent analysis of the underlying neural responses zzso This is particularly serious when investigating zzso in response to electrical stimulation with long duration and zzso We applied independent component analysis zzso to remove these electrical zzso artifacts during the development of a visual zzso zzso signals were recorded from visual zzso of five rabbits in response to ON electrical stimulation with various stimulus zzso ON action zzso were then blocked by zzso in order to acquire cortical zzso only including stimulus zzso zzso analysis of reconstructed artifacts by zzso and artifacts recorded after blocking the ON indicates successful removal of artifacts from electrical stimulation by the zzso zzso This technique has potential applications in studies designed to zzso the electrical stimulation parameters used by visual zzso
