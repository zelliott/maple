A new method for acquiring MR data in two dimensions is zzso This is achieved by combining coils into an array so as to produce a unique local magnetic field within each zzso when placed within the zzso field of a standard zzso zzso In this way each known location of a zzso is associated with a unique resonant zzso Each zzso now represents a location of a zzso in the plane, and after zzso transformation of the signal the resulting frequency spectrum gives immediately the spin distribution in the plane of the zzso In effect, the two-dimensional spatial distribution is frequency zzso without the use of switched zzso or phase zzso As only zzso fields are used, this technique offers the potential of fast zzso Furthermore, signals from different locations would also be inherently zzso zzso experiments to demonstrate the principle are zzso using a square array of 5 by 5 zzso The currents in the coils were determined by using a genetic zzso zzso from zzso zzso placed in the array were acquired using standard zzso sequences with zzso switched zzso The results are promising, with the zzso showing generally good resolution between peaks, enabling zzso in up to half the zzso Technical difficulties are discussed and possible applications are zzso
