To examine characteristics of pregnant women associated with cervical infection, and to evaluate the accuracy of zzso and risk assessment systems which have been developed for identifying cervical infection in zzso zzso 

Interviews were conducted and physical examinations performed on zzso consecutive zzso clinic zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso urine and blood specimens were also obtained for zzso 

The following disease zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bacterial zzso zzso any zzso infection zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso any cervical infection zzso The only statistically significant association with zzso and/or CT cervical infection was the presence of cervical zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There were trends towards associations with the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso reporting a new sex partner in the past 3 months zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and reporting that a sex partner had an zzso symptom zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There were no associations with other zzso zzso or medical zzso zzso scores previously developed for detecting zzso zzso in developing country zzso populations generally performed zzso 

The zzso of zzso and cervical infection observed were extremely high among these zzso zzso zzso zzso probably to high levels of zzso infection and to zzso characteristics of this urban population, factors which elsewhere have been associated with cervical infection were not found to be so in this zzso Further work on zzso approaches and risk assessment for zzso case detection in pregnant women is required before zzso management recommendations can be zzso
