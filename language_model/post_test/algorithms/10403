zzso and zzso of time series stemming from visual zzso is a very challenging problem due to the inherent complexity of the activity patterns involved and the difficulty in tracking moving zzso In this paper, we propose a framework for zzso of visual tasks in industrial zzso We propose a novel method to automatically segment the input stream and to zzso the resulting segments using prior knowledge and hidden zzso models zzso combined through a genetic zzso We compare this method to an echo state network zzso approach, which is appropriate for zzso zzso zzso In addition, we explore the zzso of several fusion schemes for zzso zzso in order to mitigate the problem of limited visibility and zzso The performance of the suggested approaches is evaluated on real-world visual zzso zzso
