zzso and experimental studies of restricted diffusion have been conducted for decades using single zzso field zzso zzso diffusion zzso In zzso samples, the zzso phenomenon arising from a single population of zzso species has been observed zzso and predicted zzso In this study, we introduce a composite zzso model which zzso restricted diffusion in zzso with free diffusion in an zzso zzso leading to fast and slow zzso components in the zzso signal zzso Although simplified (no zzso the zzso diffusion modes in this model may exhibit features seen in more complex porous materials and biological zzso We find that at low zzso the freely zzso component masks the restricted diffusion zzso and that zzso of the diffusion time shifts the transition from free to restricted profiles to lower zzso The effect of increasing the volume fraction of freely zzso water was also zzso we find that the transition in the signal zzso from the free mode to the restricted mode occurs at higher zzso when the volume fraction of the freely zzso water is zzso These findings were then applied to a phantom consisting of crossing zzso which demonstrated the same qualitative trends in the signal zzso The angular zzso experiment, which has been recently shown to be able to measure small zzso dimensions even at low zzso revealed that microscopic zzso is lost at low zzso where the fast zzso component is zzso Our findings may be of importance in studying realistic systems which exhibit zzso
