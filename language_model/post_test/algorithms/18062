zzso factors zzso have multiple zzso forms to regulate the zzso of a target zzso For example, one zzso can help another zzso to stabilize onto regulatory DNA sequence and the other zzso may attract zzso zzso zzso to start zzso zzso two zzso may both interact with both the DNA sequence and the zzso The different forms of zzso interaction have different effects on the probability of zzso binding onto the promoter sequence and therefore zzso different zzso zzso 

We have developed an zzso method to identify the zzso model that best describes the form of zzso interaction among a set of zzso interactions for every target zzso In this method, zzso zzso data are used to estimate the steady state concentration of the transcript of a target zzso as well as the relative changes of the active concentration for each zzso These estimated zzso and changes of zzso are fed into an zzso scheme to identify the most compatible zzso zzso Such a model represents a particular way of zzso control by multiple zzso on a target zzso 

zzso this approach to a zzso zzso zzso of embryonic stem cells, we have zzso five interaction patterns among three regulators, zzso zzso and zzso on ten target zzso
