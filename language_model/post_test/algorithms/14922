It is commonly thought that lethal zzso such as zzso zzso zzso are zzso by functional zzso which occurs when an zzso wave blocks and zzso around tissue that is excitable zzso functional zzso zzso recorded near these regions typically contain two sequential zzso representing zzso on either side of the zzso By detecting these zzso zzso we zzso that functional block can be detected by a single zzso 

zzso zzso were recorded from a 24 zzso 21 mapping array on the intact zzso zzso of five pigs during zzso zzso The short time zzso zzso zzso of each zzso was analyzed to identify double zzso To evaluate the performance of the zzso algorithm, zzso block was located in zzso maps using a minimum zzso zzso criterion (10 zzso and then compared to the results of the zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso detected zzso block with a sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso and a specificity of zzso zzso zzso 

We have developed an automated zzso that can detect functional block during zzso from a single zzso zzso zzso applications include fast, objective identification of block in mapping data and zzso zzso of zzso zzso using mapping zzso
