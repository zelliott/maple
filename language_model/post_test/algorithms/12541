In addition to evoked responses, which are zzso to the zzso the stimulation may also change the ongoing zzso in a zzso zzso This change has been investigated in zzso zzso zzso studies by comparing the zzso before and during stimulation or alternatively by using the zzso zzso method zzso In the present work, a technique based on the zzso estimate zzso between the stimulation signal and the zzso is proposed for separating the ongoing zzso activity spectrum from that of the evoked zzso Furthermore, a statistical criterion is applied to reduce zzso spectral zzso The performance of this procedure was assessed through simulation and illustrated with zzso during zzso zzso For simulated data zzso of zzso within zzso zzso zzso led to a zzso spectrum estimate with an average zzso error of zzso which is reduced to only zzso after applying the statistical zzso The methodology proposed is zzso equivalent to the zzso but it does not require previous filtering the zzso zzso zzso together with the statistical correction criterion allows investigating the zzso within a zzso range, particularly in zzso close to that of the alpha zzso Hence it is useful in zzso zzso Moreover, it can be also used for characterizing zzso within the gamma zzso
