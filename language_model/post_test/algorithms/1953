To investigate the feasibility of using an zzso method to correct for zzso induced by various artifacts in the zzso spectrum recorded with zzso detectors for their application in breast zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso incident spectrum was simulated with the zzso zzso spectral model using the zzso zzso zzso code and carefully zzso to match the zzso tube in this zzso zzso were performed on a zzso zzso zzso detector with five energy zzso Energy bins were adjusted to evenly distribute the recorded counts above the noise zzso zzso zzso of various thicknesses were used for zzso A zzso function was selected to fit the count correlation between the simulated and the measured zzso in the zzso zzso To evaluate the proposed spectral distortion correction method, an empirical fitting derived from the zzso process was applied on the raw images recorded for zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both the corrected counts and the effective zzso zzso were compared to the simulated values for each of the five energy zzso The feasibility of applying the proposed method to quantitative material decomposition was tested using a zzso imaging technique with a zzso phantom that consisted of water, zzso and zzso The performance of the spectral distortion correction method was zzso using the relative zzso zzso error with respect to the expected values from simulations or zzso analysis of the decomposition zzso 

The zzso of the proposed method reduced the relative zzso error of the output counts in the five energy bins with respect to the simulated incident counts from zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The accuracy of the effective zzso zzso of zzso estimate was also improved with the proposed spectral distortion zzso Finally, the relative zzso error of water, zzso and protein zzso in zzso imaging was significantly reduced from zzso to zzso after correction was zzso 

The study demonstrated that dramatic zzso in the recorded raw image yielded from a zzso detector could be expected, which presents great challenges for applying the quantitative material decomposition method in spectral zzso The proposed zzso correction method can effectively reduce these errors caused by various artifacts, including pulse pileup and charge sharing zzso Furthermore, rather than zzso simulation packages, the method requires a relatively simple zzso process and knowledge about the incident zzso zzso it may be used as a generalized procedure for the spectral distortion correction of different zzso detectors in clinical breast CT zzso
