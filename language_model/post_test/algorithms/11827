zzso technology has provided a way to zzso the simultaneous expression of a large number of zzso This approach is dependent on zzso accurate identification and zzso of spot zzso In this paper, zzso image zzso is described to extract the target intensity of the zzso zzso While the technique is zzso its effectiveness on zzso spot zzso on zzso obtained from a zzso zzso experiment is zzso The approximate boundaries of the spots are determined initially by manual alignment of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the image zzso inside a grid, is mapped onto a one-dimensional zzso zzso The zzso zzso technique is applied to generate a zzso partition of zzso The median value of the zzso zzso inside each of the clusters for a given spot determines its foreground and the local background zzso The difference in the median value of the foreground and the background intensity is the desired target intensity of the zzso The results are compared against those obtained using a region growing zzso
