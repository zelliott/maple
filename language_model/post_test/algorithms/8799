Although there has been increasing recognition of the importance of reducing radiation dose when performing zzso CT zzso the increasing complexity of CT scanner technology, as well as confusion about the importance of many different CT scan zzso has served as an impediment to zzso seeking to create lower dose zzso The authors seek to guide zzso through the manipulation of 8 fundamental CT scan parameters that can be altered or zzso to reduce patient radiation dose, including detector zzso tube zzso tube potential, reconstruction algorithm, patient zzso scan range, reconstructed slice zzso and zzso Although there is always an inherent zzso between image quality or noise and patient radiation dose, in many cases, a reasoned manipulation of these 8 parameters can allow the safer imaging of patients (with lower zzso while preserving diagnostic image zzso
