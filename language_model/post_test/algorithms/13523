Recent zzso of sequencing technology have opened up unprecedented opportunities in many application zzso zzso samples can now be zzso efficiently with very deep coverage to zzso the genetic diversity of the underlying virus zzso Several sequencing platforms with different underlying technologies and performance characteristics are available for viral diversity zzso Here, we investigate how the differences between two common platforms provided by zzso and zzso affect viral diversity zzso and the reconstruction of viral zzso Using a mixture of ten zzso clones zzso with both platforms and additional simulation experiments, we assessed the zzso between sequencing coverage, read zzso and error zzso For fixed costs, short zzso reads can be generated at higher coverage and allow for detecting zzso at lower zzso They can also be sufficient to assess the diversity of the sample if sequences are dissimilar enough, but, in general, assembly of full-length zzso is feasible only with the longer zzso zzso The quantitative comparison highlights the advantages and disadvantages of both platforms and provides guidance for the design of viral diversity zzso
