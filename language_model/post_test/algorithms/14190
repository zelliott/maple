This article describes a surgical technique for achieving implant placement zzso and presents an equation concept to predict the bone depth available for implant placement by measuring the zzso of the panoramic zzso compared with a clinical situation in cases in which a wide zzso area is zzso 

A surgical template with tube technique in combination with measurement of the vertical dimension of the zzso bone available for implant placement was used to treat 2 patients in whom 7 and 3 zzso respectively, were inserted in the lower and upper zzso 

All implants were successfully implanted into their reliable zzso In regard to the position of an important area such as the inferior zzso nerve and zzso zzso this zzso equation can provide an extra margin of zzso 

A partial zzso surgical template technique with tube technique using a zzso drill guide in combination with a mathematical equation to find the zzso zzso can be used as an alternative method in placement guidance of dental implant insertions and its fixed prosthetic treatment planning in a wide zzso zzso
