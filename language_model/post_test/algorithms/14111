zzso zzso ratio zzso is evaluated in zzso images of zzso in breast zzso zzso is calculated for zzso zzso combining beams available in a zzso zzso assuming single breast zzso zzso were obtained from Boone et al zzso zzso zzso 24 zzso and the study was limited to lowest 25 zzso zzso and highest 40 zzso zzso beams, for zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso total zzso For a standard case combining 25 zzso zzso and 40 zzso zzso beams, predicted maximum zzso for 300 zzso zzso in 5 zzso thick, 50% zzso breast is about zzso below zzso criterion for zzso Total mean zzso doses are about zzso zzso for a standard zzso The effect that input factors might have on predictions has been zzso Choice between alternative zzso can affect zzso by zzso zzso zzso composition leads to differences of zzso in calculated zzso and assumed breast tissue composition can alter zzso by zzso these results are zzso dependent on zzso or breast zzso or on the assumed fraction of zzso zzso zzso values are related to detected zzso effective zzso zzso predict that above 37 zzso zzso beams are more energetic than zzso at the same zzso due to beam zzso
