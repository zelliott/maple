No guidelines exist for the planning of zzso repatriation after acute zzso zzso zzso In 2004, we employed a risk zzso decision-making system for repatriation of patients after zzso The objective was to evaluate the safety of zzso during 2005 managed by this zzso 

A total of 116 patients were transported according to the algorithm, 64 zzso and 52 zzso The decision-making system was based on the recommendations given by the European Society of zzso Whenever possible, patients were evaluated by coronary zzso or exercise zzso Patients at high risk were treated locally if appropriate facilities were available or evacuated to the nearest heart zzso Patients at low risk were allowed to fly zzso home if no other zzso diseases needed the attention of a zzso The composite end point of death of any cause during transport or departure from the planned repatriation due to worsening of the condition was zzso 

No patients reached the end zzso Patients who were not risk evaluated more often needed escort zzso zzso zzso zzso patients were older zzso zzso zzso and had more zzso complications zzso zzso zzso 

Patients can safely travel zzso after zzso if their risk of zzso is low as determined by risk zzso examination prior to zzso
