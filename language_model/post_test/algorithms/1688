zzso dynamics resulting from the interplay between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso traveling fronts are analyzed zzso for various values of the relevant zzso These are the zzso numbers of the zzso A and zzso product B solutions as well as the ratio zzso between the diffusion zzso of the two key chemical zzso The interplay between the zzso dynamics characteristic of the zzso instability and the constant short wavelength zzso of the zzso instability can lead in some regimes to complex dynamics dominated by irregular succession of birth and death of zzso By using spectral zzso zzso we characterize the transition between order and spatial disorder in this zzso The analysis of the power spectrum and zzso function, moreover, identifies similarities between the various spatial zzso The contribution of the zzso instability to the complex dynamics is zzso
