A purely bottom-up model of visual attention is proposed and compared to five state-of-the-art zzso The role of the low-level visual features is examined in two zzso Two zzso are zzso one containing data coming from an eye tracking experiment obtained in a zzso task and a second containing zzso zzso pictures zzso had to zzso the most visually interesting objects in a zzso The zzso of the bottom-up models, zzso the ability of a model to predict where the salient areas are located, is zzso Whatever the metrics and the zzso the degree of similarity between predictions and ground truth is significantly above zzso The proposed model, resting on a small number of features, is shown to be a good predictor of the human visual zzso but also a good predictor of the objects chosen as interesting by zzso This study suggests that the low-level of visual features have a significant role in a zzso task but also in a high-level visual task, such as the choice of the object of interest in a complex visual zzso Another outcome concerns the viewing duration used in eye tracking zzso zzso suggest that this zzso is finally not as critical as one would zzso
