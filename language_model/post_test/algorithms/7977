Because of its central position in the ascending auditory pathway, its large number of zzso auditory zzso zzso and its fundamental role as a relay to auditory zzso and zzso superior zzso the zzso inferior zzso zzso is regarded pivotal for the integration of acoustic zzso cues to mediate zzso zzso However, detailed quantitative analyses of zzso neural responses are zzso Moreover, most studies have been performed in zzso zzso and it is unclear how to extrapolate findings to awake and behaving zzso Here, we characterize zzso receptive fields zzso of single units in alert monkey zzso by using a variety of broadband sounds with rippled zzso zzso We measured the response sensitivity to the ripple parameters density, zzso zzso zzso w zzso and direction zzso zzso We observed a variety of dynamic zzso with a strong preference for low ripple zzso and a generally weak direction zzso Most cells preferred dynamic rippled stimuli above pure zzso modulated noise zzso zzso zzso zzso Half of the cells could be characterized by good zzso zzso in which the ripple transfer function can be written as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could be attributed to a difference in responses to up and downward direction with respect to both zzso and zzso zzso We tested zzso of zzso zzso by using the zzso to predict neural responses to natural stimuli and broadband noise and discuss our results in the light of findings obtained from auditory zzso
