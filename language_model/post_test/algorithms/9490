Recently we introduced a zzso pulse scheme for zzso zzso decoupling in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance under zzso spinning zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso phase zzso for zzso zzso decoupling in solid-state zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso zzso zzso employing frequency zzso of different types have been further tested to improve the efficiency of zzso zzso zzso Among these, certain sequences that were found to perform well at lower spinning speeds are demonstrated here on a zzso sample of zzso for application in zzso zzso The new sequences are compared with the standard zzso and zzso schemes and are shown to perform better than zzso These modulated schemes perform well at low zzso zzso power levels and are easy to implement on standard zzso
