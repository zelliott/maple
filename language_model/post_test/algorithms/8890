The recent advances in zzso sequencing technologies bring the potential of a better characterization of the genetic variation in humans and other zzso In many occasions, either by design or by necessity, the sequencing procedure is performed on a pool of DNA samples with different zzso where the abundance of each sample is zzso Such a scenario is naturally occurring in the case of zzso analysis where a pool of bacteria is zzso or in the case of population studies involving DNA pools by zzso zzso various pooling designs were recently suggested that can identify carriers of rare zzso in large zzso dramatically reducing the cost of such large-scale sequencing zzso A fundamental problem with such approaches for population studies is that the uncertainty of DNA proportions from different individuals in the pools might lead to zzso zzso Fortunately, it is often the case that the zzso data of at least some of the individuals in the pool is zzso Here, we propose a method zzso that uses the zzso data in conjunction with the pooled sequence data in order to accurately estimate the proportions of the samples in the pool, even in cases where not all individuals in the pool were zzso zzso Using real data from a sequencing pooling study of zzso lymphoma, we demonstrate that the zzso of the proportions is zzso since otherwise there is a risk for false zzso Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach is also zzso to the problem of zzso of species in zzso samples zzso and is particularly suitable for zzso zzso of closely related zzso
