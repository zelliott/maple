The behavior of moist zzso zzso is investigated using a zzso model with a simplified thermodynamics for phase zzso This idealized zzso makes the problem accessible to high-resolution three-dimensional direct zzso simulations without small-scale zzso of the turbulence for extended layers with aspect ratios up to zzso Our study is focused on the frequently observed zzso unstable environment that is zzso zzso for zzso air, but is unstable for cloudy zzso We find that no sharp threshold for the transition to zzso turbulence exists, a situation similar to zzso zzso zzso Rather, the transition depends on the zzso of the initial zzso of the zzso equilibrium and on the aspect ratio of the zzso zzso In contrast to the classical dry zzso case, zzso is highly zzso with respect to the vertical zzso zzso zzso air inside turbulent cloud zzso is surrounded by ambient regions of slowly descending zzso zzso It is also found that zzso unstable moist zzso is inefficient at transporting zzso Our study suggests that there is an upper bound on the zzso number in moist zzso that is lower than that of the classical dry zzso
