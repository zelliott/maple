zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso comprise a set of clinically and genetically distinct inherited zzso zzso zzso in four zzso membrane proteins involved in zzso zzso have been identified in these zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso channel zzso the zzso channel zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical features associated with each zzso in a large cohort of genetically defined zzso 

The zzso characteristics of 65 patients with molecular defects in zzso zzso zzso or zzso were collected zzso 

zzso and zzso patients presented with zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso was less severe in the zzso patients compared with the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso patients had zzso zzso and marked zzso While this zzso of zzso calcium and zzso handling was also observed in some zzso patients, a few zzso patients presented with zzso and zzso or zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso usually have uniform clinical presentations, whereas zzso in zzso occasionally lead to zzso zzso with the zzso or, less commonly, with the zzso zzso Based on these results, we propose an zzso for the molecular diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso
