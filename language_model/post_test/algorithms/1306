zzso syndrome due to adrenal zzso or zzso zzso is zzso To understand better the clinical and zzso presentation of this disorder, as well as therapy efficacy and patient survival, we conducted a retrospective zzso 

Between August 1971 and April 1994, 40 patients presented to our institution with adrenal zzso syndrome (27 zzso and 13 zzso These groups were analyzed with respect to clinical signs and symptoms preoperatively and zzso zzso analysis, length of zzso steroid replacement therapy, disease recurrence and patient zzso zzso was obtained by chart review and telephone interviews and averaged zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso months for zzso and zzso patients, zzso 

Women predominated in both groups zzso of 27 zzso 11 of 13 zzso and tumors affected the left adrenal zzso more frequently (19 of 27 zzso 9 of 13 zzso zzso patients were younger than zzso patients zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso years, p zzso zzso and presented with smaller tumors zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso There was a trend toward increased zzso of zzso intolerance among zzso patients but no significant differences in clinical signs or symptoms between zzso and zzso patients could be zzso Similarly, while there was no significant difference in zzso evaluation of zzso versus zzso patients, 24-hour urinary free cortisol and serum zzso zzso levels tended to be higher among zzso zzso In addition zzso and zzso zzso levels were more elevated in zzso than in zzso patients, and several zzso patients actually had zzso zzso Among zzso patients mean length of steroid replacement therapy was zzso zzso zzso zzso However, 7 zzso patients zzso required greater than 24 months of zzso steroids, and only 1 of these patients was subsequently weaned off steroid zzso There were no zzso among zzso patients, although there was 1 zzso death due to zzso Ten zzso zzso patients had zzso at a mean followup of 33 zzso The 3 and zzso survival rates were zzso and zzso zzso 

While presenting signs and symptoms and hormonal analysis may suggest benign or zzso disease, only tumor size and patient age are reliable zzso indicators of adrenal zzso versus zzso zzso among patients with adrenal zzso zzso Surgery is zzso for zzso patients, but lifelong steroid replacement may be zzso Survival remains poor among zzso zzso
