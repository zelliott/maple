The zzso zzso correlation analysis has been used to study skin temperature fluctuations caused by periodic changes in blood flow resulting from zzso in zzso smooth muscle zzso We considered two cases, one in which temperature zzso and blood flow recordings by laser zzso zzso are made simultaneously and another in which two temperature signals are measured zzso Twelve healthy subjects participated in our zzso The gapped zzso technique was used to suppress artifacts caused by boundary zzso zzso recordings of skin temperature fluctuations and the signal of the laser zzso zzso provided correlation zzso essentially exceeding the values obtained for noise signals within three spectral ranges corresponding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso regulation zzso Within the frequency range from zzso to 2 zzso the values of the correlation function are compatible with the values of noise zzso The same results were obtained for two zzso measured temperature zzso Reduction in the zzso of temperature fluctuations and in the level of correlations with the frequency arises because the skin has the properties of a zzso zzso As temperature fluctuations zzso their zzso zzso as an exponential function of zzso Hence small zzso in the spectral range reflecting the influence of heartbeat and zzso cannot be distinguished from external zzso zzso
