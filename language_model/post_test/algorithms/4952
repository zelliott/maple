We consider the problems of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso data when no straightforward zzso representation zzso In this paper, we propose using the properties of information geometry and statistical zzso in order to define similarities between data sets using the Fisher information zzso We will show that this metric can be zzso using entirely zzso methods, as the zzso and geometry of the zzso is generally zzso Furthermore, by using zzso zzso methods, we are able to reconstruct the statistical zzso in a zzso zzso space; enabling effective learning on the zzso As a whole, we refer to our framework as Fisher Information zzso zzso zzso and illustrate its uses on practical problems, including a biomedical application and document zzso
