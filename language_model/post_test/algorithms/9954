We developed a tissue discrimination zzso of polarization sensitive optical zzso zzso zzso based on the optical properties of zzso We calculated the three-dimensional zzso feature zzso from the parameters intensity, extinction zzso zzso which were obtained by zzso The tissue type of each zzso was determined according to the position of the feature zzso in the zzso feature zzso The zzso was applied for discriminating zzso of the human anterior eye zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were well separated in the zzso feature space, and we observed them with good zzso The TM line can be observed in the zzso zzso volume, as observed by zzso validated our method by applying our zzso and zzso data to zzso zzso A marker was injected into zzso space and the zzso that were anterior to the marker and zzso to the marker were successfully segmented by our zzso
