zzso a stable zzso with high zzso of a poorly zzso drug often presents a challenge to the zzso zzso Transformation of the drug into its more soluble zzso zzso form is one method used for improving the dissolution rate of such zzso The present study uses the zzso technique for preparation of solid zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso in the form of a zzso powder were initially characterized and compared with a physical mixture and starting zzso zzso of the zzso was monitored over 12 weeks at 25 degrees C and zzso zzso zzso studies revealed changes in solid state during the formation of the zzso and indicated the presence of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso together with zzso suggested molecular interactions zzso in the zzso zzso studies proved an increase in the dissolution rate of zzso from all zzso The zzso with higher content of zzso retained zzso in the zzso state throughout the stability zzso However, zzso with lower content showed zzso of zzso after 1 zzso Thus, this study reveals the possibility of preparing stable zzso of zzso zzso in zzso with improved dissolution zzso
