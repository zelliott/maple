We propose an zzso that allows predicting zzso important for the formation of the structure of zzso zzso It relies on a simulation that detects the zzso acids presenting a maximum number of zzso during the early steps of the folding zzso They have been called zzso (Most zzso zzso zzso description of the protein structures in fragments with closed ends shows the correlation between these zzso and the core of the zzso These fragments are of rather constant zzso typically between 20 and 25 zzso zzso and we have previously shown that their zzso are zzso occupied by zzso Introduction of rules derived from this zzso analysis of zzso structures allows to smooth the distribution of zzso for a better match between zzso ends and zzso In order to assess this prediction of the folding core, a large family of structures has been used, with sequences as different as zzso A zzso of 56 zzso structures of various functions but common fold has been used in this zzso This fold was chosen because it is one of the most populated with a large amount of data available on its zzso In the zzso domain, zzso and structural load is clearly zzso zzso are responsible for binding and recognition while interactions between several zzso of the buried core provide stability and fast zzso We then determined the positions susceptible of high importance for the folding process to occur and compared them to published data, either to High zzso Out Order zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso value zzso It results a reasonable agreement between the positions that we predict and experimental zzso Besides, our prediction goes beyond the simple use of a zzso zzso accessibility of zzso acids as a criterion to predict the zzso We find the same quality of our prediction on the zzso like zzso
