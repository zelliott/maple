zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer is an important step for the effective diagnosis and treatment of cancer zzso With the huge volume of data from the large-scale cancer zzso projects, an open challenge is to distinguish driver zzso zzso and gene sets (or core zzso that contribute to cancer formation and progression from random passengers which accumulate in zzso cells but do not contribute to zzso Due to zzso zzso current analyses are often restricted to known pathways and functional zzso for enrichment of zzso zzso zzso discovery of new pathways and functional zzso is a pressing zzso 

In this study, we propose a novel method to identify zzso Core zzso in Cancer zzso without any prior information other than cancer zzso data from patients with zzso This is a network-based approach in which three kinds of data are zzso zzso zzso copy number variations zzso and gene zzso zzso the first two zzso are merged to obtain a zzso zzso based on which a weighted zzso network is constructed where the zzso weight zzso to gene coverage and the edge weight zzso to the mutual zzso between gene zzso Similarly, a weighted expression network is generated from the expression zzso where the zzso and edge weights zzso to the influence of a gene zzso on other genes and the zzso correlation of gene zzso expressions, zzso Then an zzso network is obtained by further combining these two networks, and the most coherent zzso are identified by using an zzso zzso Finally, we obtained the core zzso for tumors by filtering with significance and zzso zzso We applied zzso to the Cancer Genome zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso data, and identified several zzso core zzso some of which are involved in known zzso Most of the implicated genes are zzso or tumor zzso previously reported to be related to zzso As a comparison, we also performed zzso on two of the three kinds of data, zzso the zzso combining zzso zzso with zzso and zzso the zzso combining zzso zzso with gene zzso The results indicate that gene expressions or zzso indeed provide extra useful information to the original data for the identification of core zzso in zzso 

This study demonstrates the utility of our zzso by zzso multiple data sources to identify zzso core zzso in zzso In addition to presenting a generally zzso methodology, our findings provide several candidate pathways or core zzso zzso zzso in zzso or zzso zzso for further zzso
