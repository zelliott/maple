Identification and counting of cells is necessary to test biological zzso for instance of nervous system formation, disease, zzso injury and zzso but manual counting is time zzso zzso and subject to zzso The fruit fly zzso is a widely used model zzso to zzso gene function, and most research is carried out in the intact animal or in whole zzso rather than in cell zzso zzso on gene function require that cell counts are known from these sample zzso Image processing and pattern recognition techniques are appropriate tools to automate cell zzso However, counting cells in zzso is a complex zzso variations in zzso markers and zzso stages result in images of very different properties, rendering it challenging to identify true zzso Here, we present a technique for counting automatically zzso zzso cells in three dimensions, from zzso zzso serial optical zzso Local zzso zzso and domes are combined to find the zzso Shape zzso extracted from a data set are used to characterize cells and avoid zzso zzso operators are employed to divide cells that could otherwise be zzso The method is accurate and very fast, and treats all samples equally and zzso rendering all data comparable across zzso Our method is also zzso to identify cells zzso with other nuclear markers and in sections of mouse zzso
