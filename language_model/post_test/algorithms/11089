zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso offers zzso of the airways and zzso of regional pulmonary ventilation using a single breath of zzso xenon zzso In this study, we sought to zzso scanning protocols for zzso xenon gas ventilation imaging of the airways and lung zzso and to characterize the quantitative nature of the developed protocols through a series of zzso and animal zzso 

The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal studies reported zzso A range of zzso gas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso balance zzso were scanned in zzso and balloon zzso to zzso the delivered gas mixture for assessment of regional ventilation while allowing for the development of improved zzso decomposition zzso zzso In addition, to alleviate zzso effects on xenon gas distribution, we replaced a portion of the oxygen in the zzso gas mixture with zzso and compared gas zzso in a zzso human zzso zzso Additional syringe tests were performed to determine if the introduction of zzso had any effect on xenon zzso zzso gas zzso were delivered to zzso zzso to assess airway and lung zzso zzso while evaluating various zzso scan acquisition zzso 

zzso zzso for xenon were obtained from the syringe zzso and were used to develop improved zzso decomposition parameters zzso unit enhancement per percentage zzso within the chest zzso zzso at 80 zzso zzso at 100 zzso and zzso at 140 zzso with tin zzso in open air, zzso at 80 zzso zzso at 100 zzso and zzso at 140 zzso with tin zzso The addition of zzso improved the distribution of xenon gas to the zzso zzso portion of the airway tree zzso while not affecting the zzso of xenon in the zzso decomposition zzso The mixture zzso zzso zzso zzso provided good zzso ratio zzso greater than the Rose criterion zzso zzso zzso while avoiding zzso effects of similar zzso of xenon in a zzso zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tin zzso provided improved zzso in a zzso with an equivalent zzso zzso density to a human subject with a body mass index of 33 zzso Airways were brighter in the zzso zzso zzso scan zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with considerably lower noise zzso zzso zzso of variation of zzso zzso zzso zzso of variation of zzso 

To provide a truly quantitative measure of regional lung function with zzso the basic protocols and zzso zzso need to be better understood and zzso It is critically important to understand the fundamentals of new techniques to allow for proper zzso and interpretation of their results before widespread zzso With the use of an in-house derived xenon zzso curve for zzso decomposition rather than the scanner supplied zzso and a zzso mixture, we demonstrate highly accurate zzso of xenon gas volumes and avoid zzso effects on gas zzso This study provides a foundation for other researchers to use and test these methods with the goal of clinical zzso
