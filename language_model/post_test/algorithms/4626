This paper presents a novel approach for creation of topographical function and object markers used within watershed zzso Typically, zzso watershed zzso extracts seeds indicating the presence of objects or background at specific image zzso The marker locations are then set to be regional zzso within the zzso surface zzso the zzso of the original input zzso and the watershed zzso is zzso In contrast, our approach uses two zzso one trained to produce zzso the other trained to produce object zzso As a result of using zzso zzso zzso the proposed zzso is directly zzso to both single channel and zzso image zzso Additionally, rather than flooding the zzso image, we use the zzso probability map produced by the second aforementioned zzso as input to the watershed zzso Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the zzso watershed zzso zzso for the tasks of 1) zzso zzso and 2) remote zzso
