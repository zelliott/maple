We have proposed an extension to the zzso zzso that incorporates the existing clinical expertise into the zzso process of acquiring an appropriate administration strategy of zzso to patients with anemia due to zzso The specific modification lies in multiple updates of the zzso for several zzso combinations during a single learning zzso This in turn decreases the risk of administering doses that are inadequate in certain situations and thus increases the speed of the learning zzso We have evaluated the proposed method using a simulation zzso involving an zzso zzso and compared the outcomes to those obtained by a classical zzso and a zzso zzso of a clinically used administration protocol for anemia zzso The outcomes of the simulated treatments demonstrate that the proposed method is a more effective tool than the traditional zzso Furthermore, we have observed that it has a potential to provide even more stable anemia management than the zzso
