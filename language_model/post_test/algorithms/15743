The zzso inactive zzso zzso was used to study the interaction of zzso with zzso under equilibrium zzso By monitoring changes in intrinsic fluorescence, we measured zzso zzso for a variety of synthetic zzso zzso peptides and the inhibitor zzso The zzso zzso retains the zzso properties of the wild type, and zzso binding to the zzso is enhanced by the presence of zzso zzso dependence studies allowed calculation of the zzso parameters of zzso binding at the active site and showed a negligible zzso zzso of synthetic zzso carrying zzso at the zzso positions revealed zzso consistent with the specificity hierarchy identified in zzso by the wild zzso zzso with zzso zzso which interact with both the active site and zzso I of zzso also showed consistency with the results obtained with the wild type at steady zzso These findings demonstrate that inactive zzso of zzso make it possible to dissect the equilibrium components linked to zzso binding and complement information on the kinetic properties of the wild zzso
