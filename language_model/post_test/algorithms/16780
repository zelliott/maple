zzso for molecular zzso have historically focused on zzso the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso complex to measure geometric pose prediction zzso and measurement of virtual screening performance has been focused on increasingly large and diverse sets of target protein structures, zzso zzso and various types of decoy zzso Here, pose prediction is reported on the zzso zzso set of 85 protein zzso complexes, and virtual screening performance is reported on the zzso set of 40 protein zzso In both cases, prepared structures of targets and zzso were provided by symposium zzso The zzso data sets yielded results not significantly different than previous reports of zzso on the two zzso Minor changes to protein coordinates resulting from complex zzso had large effects on observed performance, highlighting the limitations of zzso zzso zzso for pose prediction zzso zzso protocols developed for zzso which address protein flexibility and produce discrete families of predicted poses, produced substantially better performance for pose zzso Performance on virtual screening performance was shown to benefit by employing and combining multiple screening zzso zzso zzso molecular zzso and zzso molecular zzso In addition, use of multiple protein zzso significantly improved screening zzso
