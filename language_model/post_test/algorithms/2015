zzso analysis of zzso functional cardiac magnetic resonance images can be performed using automatic zzso detection zzso The resulting zzso contours must be reviewed and possibly corrected, which can be zzso particularly when performed across all cardiac zzso We zzso the impact of manual zzso corrections on both analysis time and quantitative zzso obtained from left zzso zzso zzso images acquired from zzso participants of the zzso Heart Study zzso cohort using zzso zzso detection zzso The total analysis time for a single case was zzso zzso zzso zzso for an average of 221 zzso 36 zzso contours per zzso This included zzso zzso zzso zzso for manual zzso correction of zzso of all automatically detected zzso contours and zzso of all automatically detected zzso zzso However, the impact of these corrections on global left zzso parameters was zzso introducing differences of zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso volume, zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso volume, zzso zzso zzso zzso for stroke volume, and zzso zzso zzso for ejection zzso We conclude that left zzso functional parameters can be obtained under 5 zzso from zzso functional cardiac magnetic resonance images using automatic zzso detection zzso Manual correction more than doubles analysis time, with minimal impact on left zzso volumes and ejection zzso
