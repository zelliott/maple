We investigate the possibility that atomic zzso as measured by their distances from the structural geometrical center, contain sufficient information to determine the zzso structure of zzso zzso We report zzso Carlo simulated zzso results of zzso zzso models in continuous space for four small zzso the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the alpha + beta engineered zzso form of the zzso protein zzso We used as energy function the sum over all zzso labeled by zzso of zzso - zzso zzso where zzso is the atomic distance from the center of zzso or central distance, and zzso (*) is the zzso central distance obtained from the native zzso zzso bonds were taken into consideration by the assignment of two ideal distances for backbone atoms forming hydrogen bonds in the native structure depending on the formation of a zzso defined bond, independently of bond zzso zzso energy final zzso turned out to be very similar to the native structure for the four proteins under investigation and a strong correlation was observed between energy and distance root mean square zzso zzso from the native in the case of zzso zzso and zzso zzso For all alpha zzso and alpha + beta zzso the overall correlation between energy and zzso among final zzso was not as high because some zzso resulted in high zzso but low energy final zzso in which zzso adopted a non-native mutual zzso zzso between central distances and actual accessible surface areas zzso the implicit assumption of correlation between these two zzso The zzso obtained with this zzso potential in the discrimination of native zzso from a set of random compact structures confirmed that it contains a much smaller amount of native information when compared to a traditional contact Go potential but indicated that simple zzso burial zzso still need some improvement in order to attain a similar zzso Taken together, our results suggest that central zzso in conjunction to physically motivated hydrogen bond constraints, contain sufficient information to determine the native zzso of these small proteins and that a solution to the folding problem for zzso proteins could arise from sufficiently accurate burial predictions from sequence followed by zzso of a zzso energy zzso
