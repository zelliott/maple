A zzso zzso is introduced that is used for real-time zzso of digital hearing aid zzso that operate on zzso zzso zzso input signals and perform signal processing in the frequency zzso A zzso dynamic zzso zzso was implemented which operates in 24 critical band filter channels, allows for interaction between frequency bands and stereo channels, and is fitted to the hearing of the individual patient by a zzso zzso zzso In addition, a zzso noise reduction zzso was implemented that zzso sound emanating from the front and suppresses lateral noise sources as well as zzso These zzso were zzso with respect to their processing parameters and by minimizing the processing zzso Different versions of the zzso were tested in six listeners with zzso hearing impairment using both zzso quality assessment methods and speech zzso zzso in different zzso zzso For most subjects, linear frequency shaping was zzso assessed to be negative, although it improved speech zzso in zzso Additional zzso was assessed to be positive and did not deteriorate speech zzso as long as the processing parameters were fitted zzso All noise reduction strategies employed here were zzso assessed to be zzso Although the suppression of zzso only slightly improved speech zzso a combination of directional filtering and zzso provided a substantial improvement in speech zzso for most subjects and for a certain range of zzso zzso The real-time zzso was very helpful in zzso and testing the zzso and the overall results indicate that carefully designed and fitted zzso hearing aids might be very beneficial for a large number of zzso
