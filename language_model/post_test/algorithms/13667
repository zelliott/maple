Dynamic clamp is a powerful approach for zzso investigations allowing researchers to introduce artificial electrical components into target zzso to simulate zzso zzso chemical or zzso zzso or connections to other zzso Due to the rapidly changing and potentially large current injections during dynamic zzso problematic zzso artifacts appear on the zzso used to inject dynamic clamp currents into a target zzso Dynamic clamp experiments, therefore, typically use two separate zzso in the same cell, one for recording membrane potential and one for injecting zzso The requirement for two independent zzso has been a limiting factor for the use of dynamic clamp in applications where dual recordings of this kind are difficult or impossible to zzso The recent development of an active zzso compensation zzso method has overcome some of these prior limitations, permitting zzso dynamic clamp zzso with a single zzso Here we describe an zzso method for the free dynamic clamp software zzso The zzso component of zzso is the first such system implemented for the use of zzso users and comes with a set of zzso zzso and zzso procedures that facilitate its zzso We briefly introduce the zzso method and its zzso in zzso and then validate it with an electronic model cell and in two different biological zzso
