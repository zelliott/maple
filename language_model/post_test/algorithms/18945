This paper describes image processing, geometric modeling and data management techniques for the development of a virtual bone surgery zzso Image zzso is used to divide CT scan data into different segments representing various regions of the zzso A zzso zzso is used to extract cortical bone and zzso bone structures systematically and zzso Volume modeling is then used to represent the bone geometry based on the CT scan zzso zzso removal simulation is achieved by continuously performing zzso zzso of the surgical tool model from the bone zzso A zzso zzso subdivision technique is developed to handle the large set of data in order to achieve the real-time simulation and zzso required for virtual bone zzso A Marching zzso zzso is used to generate zzso faces from the zzso zzso zzso of the generated polygons is performed with the publicly available zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Implementation of the developed techniques consists of developing a virtual zzso software program, which allows the user to manipulate a virtual drill to make holes with the use of a zzso device on a bone model derived from real CT scan zzso
