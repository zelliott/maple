zzso equations are used in common approaches to describe cross polarization zzso dynamics of zzso The zzso behavior may be modulated by several zzso interactions and zzso sample zzso At high magnetic fields and spinning speeds, these zzso can obscure the zzso To zzso their impact on the zzso behavior of natural organic materials variable contact time zzso experiments were acquired with a high zzso resolution for two coal zzso The zzso were distinctly influenced by interfering zzso Conventional approaches showed insufficient flexibility in terms of degrees of freedom to calculate the zzso zzso The use of an original fundamental equation as model resulted in sufficient flexibility for such zzso zzso The best results were obtained assuming a two component zzso On these conditions a differentiation between zzso and zzso zzso within the coal samples was zzso
