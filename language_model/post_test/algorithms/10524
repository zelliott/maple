Genome comparison is now a crucial step for zzso zzso and identification of regulatory zzso Genome comparison aims for instance at finding zzso regions either specific to or in zzso correspondence between zzso It serves zzso to zzso a new zzso by automatically transferring zzso from a known zzso However, efficiency, flexibility and objectives of current methods do not suit the whole spectrum of applications, zzso sizes and zzso Innovative approaches are still zzso zzso we propose an alternative way of comparing multiple zzso based on zzso by zzso In this zzso rather than being formulated as a complex zzso problem, zzso comparison is seen as a zzso question for which a single optimal solution can be found in almost linear zzso We apply our method to zzso three strains of a virulent zzso bacteria, zzso zzso and identify 92 new zzso We also find out that a substantial number of genes thought to be strain specific have potential zzso in the other zzso Our solution is implemented in an efficient program, zzso equipped with a zzso zzso and enables the automatic transfer of zzso between compared zzso or zzso zzso in zzso zzso Because it somehow zzso the relative order of zzso blocks, zzso can handle unfinished zzso which due to the difficulty of sequencing completion may become an interesting characteristic for the zzso zzso zzso
