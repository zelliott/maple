Recent advances in zzso imaging permit studies of zzso dynamics in large numbers of cells, in zzso and awake behaving zzso However, unlike for zzso signals, standardized zzso for assigning zzso recorded signals to individual cells have not yet zzso Here, we describe an automated sorting procedure that combines independent component analysis and image zzso for zzso zzso locations and their dynamics with minimal human zzso In validation studies using simulated data, automated sorting significantly improved zzso of cellular signals compared to conventional analysis based on image regions of zzso We used automated procedures to analyze data recorded by zzso zzso imaging in the zzso zzso of awake behaving zzso Our analysis yielded simultaneous zzso activity traces for up to zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso from single zzso Using this approach, we found zzso of zzso cells that were stable across behavioral states and in which zzso zzso zzso rose significantly during zzso
