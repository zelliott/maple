With the proliferation of zzso methods, zzso now have to confront the daunting task of method zzso Such decisions might be made based on theoretical considerations zzso However, the zzso of real data means that theoretical ideals may not hold in practice zzso with convergence of complicated zzso zzso and zzso times that limit analyses to small data zzso On the other hand, simplifying assumptions made by some approaches may compromise the accuracy of zzso zzso Here we examine the zzso zzso between accuracy and zzso simplicity for zzso analysis, focusing on the different ways the approaches treat zzso zzso By considering a diversity of species trees, as well as different sampling designs and total sampling efforts, we not only compare the accuracy of zzso estimates across methods, but we also partition the variation in accuracy across factors to identify their relative zzso This analysis shows that although the method of analysis affects zzso other factors - zzso the history of species divergence and aspects of the sampling design - have a larger zzso Despite a full modeling of gene tree uncertainty zzso using a zzso zzso zzso estimates may not be accurate, particularly for recent diversification zzso Nevertheless, we demonstrate how factors within the control of the empirical investigator zzso decisions about zzso improve the accuracy of species tree estimates, and more so than the method of zzso Lastly, with much of the attention on zzso analyses focused on the discord among zzso arising from the zzso this work also highlights a previously overlooked key zzso of zzso accuracy for recent zzso - the level of genetic variation at a zzso which has important implications for improving zzso estimates in zzso
