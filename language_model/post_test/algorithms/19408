We used the registry for rare diseases in pediatrics in Germany to ascertain cases and asked reporting institutions for information on zzso laboratory tests, imaging results, diagnosis, initial management and sex zzso 

We identified 80 cases within a zzso study period and calculated an zzso of 2 per 10,000 zzso with ambiguous zzso per year in zzso zzso was higher in infants from zzso family zzso In more than 50% of all infants a zzso diagnosis was lacking even at the age of 6 zzso In those cases where the zzso was confirmed, the most common diagnosis was zzso adrenal zzso followed by zzso zzso syndrome and mixed zzso zzso Associated zzso were very common, affecting zzso of all zzso Sex assignment was female in zzso infants with predominately female zzso and all zzso zzso Early surgery was performed in many cases irrespective whether a zzso diagnosis had been established or zzso Integrated zzso care was the exception rather than the zzso
