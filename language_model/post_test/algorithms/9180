zzso zzso is a rare complication after zzso of dual chamber zzso or zzso zzso Its zzso and optimal management are not currently well zzso 

Three cases of cardiac zzso following successful zzso of zzso dual chamber zzso with zzso zzso leads were zzso 

All three patients with zzso cardiac zzso were suspected to have the same zzso of bleeding into the zzso zzso This was due to zzso of the zzso of the zzso zzso pacing lead through the zzso wall with subsequent abrasion of visceral zzso layer and bleeding from the atrium through the zzso In two patients, the zzso sites were zzso and repaired during open zzso in the operating zzso The third patient underwent lead repositioning under zzso guidance in the zzso zzso 

Based on the reviewed cases, we describe the zzso of, and recommend a safe conservative zzso for, the management of cardiac zzso after successful zzso lead zzso zzso zzso with placement of the zzso drain followed by lead repositioning under zzso guidance with surgical backup appears to be safe and zzso
