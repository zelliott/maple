To investigate the feasibility of implementing quantitative zzso in the routine zzso and to obtain a first experience in zzso and zzso 

For zzso imaging, zzso zzso (one 4 zzso slice at zzso level, zzso zzso zzso TE zzso zzso zzso 180 zzso zzso 50 degrees , zzso 128 zzso zzso bandwidth per zzso zzso 400 zzso zzso resolution zzso zzso total measurement time 2 zzso was applied during the injection of 10 zzso of standard zzso zzso zzso solution at 2 zzso followed by zzso with zzso tracking zzso zzso TE zzso zzso 40 degrees , zzso 192 zzso zzso zzso 1, slice thickness zzso zzso using a second dose of zzso zzso zzso per zzso body weight with a maximum of 20 zzso The zzso signals zzso zzso were converted to tissue zzso zzso and zzso with an inflow corrected zzso blood flow, distribution volume, mean transit time and blood flow zzso were zzso 

zzso quality was uncompromised by the first zzso administered for zzso zzso In the zzso average cortical zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These zzso values are lower than those found in the literature, probably due to residual zzso inflow zzso The sensitivity of the technique was sufficient to demonstrate altered zzso in the examples of zzso 

Combined quantitative zzso and zzso have a potential for zzso zzso screening and may provide an anatomical and zzso evaluation of zzso zzso
