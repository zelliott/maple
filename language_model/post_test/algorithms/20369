zzso an zzso map from X-ray zzso data can be difficult and time-consuming even after the data have been collected, largely because zzso and MAD structure zzso currently require many zzso evaluations of the qualities of trial zzso partial structures before a correct zzso solution is zzso A set of criteria for evaluating the quality of zzso partial solutions in zzso zzso have been zzso These have allowed the conversion of the crystal zzso process into an zzso problem and have allowed its zzso The zzso software has been used to solve MAD data sets with as many as 52 zzso sites in the zzso zzso The automated zzso process developed is a major step towards the fully automated zzso zzso and refinement procedure which is needed for zzso scale structure zzso
