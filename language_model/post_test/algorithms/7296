We present a spectral phase zzso approach for zzso differential zzso data where the zzso zzso phase shift is estimated from energy zzso zzso using maximum likelihood zzso We demonstrate the method on zzso data sets of a test zzso taken at different zzso energies using zzso zzso The proposed zzso technique was demonstrated to successfully correct the data set for phase zzso
