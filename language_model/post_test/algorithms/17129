The aim of this study was to find an zzso of better fit for early eye growth than the linear zzso usually zzso 

The analysis is based on previously published around term data, the main material being zzso ultrasound zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and full term infants zzso zzso zzso The zzso age of the infants ranged between 36 and 54 zzso Previously published Danish data from eyes of aborted fetuses were also used, as were averaged values from the literature regarding eye size at age 1 year (20 zzso 3 years zzso zzso and a presumed 13 year zzso of 23 zzso 

A second order exponential function fitted with the basic data within a standard zzso of zzso 

A simple symbolic expression and tabulated values for eye growth in infancy and childhood were zzso This is clearly of practical value, for example, when following the development of eyes treated for zzso glaucoma or assessing other zzso anomalies and early eye zzso
