The recently developed zzso zzso method is applied to predict the zzso structures of all zzso zzso zzso is a zzso approach that consists of template identification by the zzso program zzso followed by zzso structure assembly via rearranging continuous template zzso Assembly occurs using parallel zzso zzso Carlo sampling under the guide of an zzso reduced force field that includes zzso statistical zzso and spatial restraints extracted from zzso zzso Models are automatically selected from the zzso Carlo zzso in the zzso zzso using the zzso program zzso For all 90 zzso zzso zzso generates initial alignments with an average zzso zzso zzso to native of zzso A with zzso zzso After zzso zzso the average zzso decreases to zzso A over the same aligned zzso the overall cumulative zzso increases from zzso to zzso Despite significant improvements over the zzso template alignment observed in all target categories, the overall quality of the final models is essentially dictated by the quality of zzso zzso The average zzso of zzso models in the three categories are, respectively, zzso zzso modeling zzso 43 zzso zzso zzso recognition zzso 37 zzso and zzso zzso fold zzso 10 zzso This highlights the need to develop novel (or zzso approaches to identify very distant targets as well as better zzso zzso
