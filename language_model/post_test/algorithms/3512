zzso systems zzso are, nowadays, an important research area within zzso and artificial intelligence and a growing number of systems have recently been presented in the zzso Since application zzso and tasks that are faced by MRS are of increasing complexity, the ability of the robots to cooperate can be regarded as a fundamental zzso In this paper, we present a survey of the recent work in the area by specifically examining the forms of cooperation and coordination realized in the zzso In particular, we propose a new zzso for zzso of the approaches to coordination in MRS and we describe some systems, which we consider representative in our zzso We finally discuss the outcomes of our analysis and try to highlight future trends of the research on zzso
