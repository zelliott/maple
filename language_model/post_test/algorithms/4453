Treatment plans zzso for intensity modulated zzso therapy zzso may be sensitive to range zzso The dose distribution may deteriorate substantially when the actual range of a pencil beam does not match the assumed zzso We present two treatment planning concepts for zzso which incorporate range uncertainties into the zzso The first method is a zzso zzso The range of a pencil beam is assumed to be a random zzso which makes the delivered dose and the value of the objective function a random variable zzso We then propose to zzso the expectation value of the objective zzso The second approach is a robust zzso that applies methods developed in the field of robust linear zzso This approach zzso the worst case dose distribution that may occur, assuming that the ranges of the pencil beams may vary within some zzso Both methods yield treatment plans that are considerably less sensitive to range variations compared to conventional treatment plans zzso without accounting for range zzso In addition, both zzso zzso zzso very similar results on a qualitative zzso
