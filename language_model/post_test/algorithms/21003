Phase space analysis is a powerful approximate scheme for the analysis of complex optical zzso The zzso zzso introduced makes it possible to determine all important beam characteristics as a function of the distance from the zzso An zzso approach zzso zzso transformations and zzso was consistently employed rather than zzso phase space zzso While the primary application is zzso and zzso zzso the approach can be used more generally for characterizing zzso beams near the optical zzso
