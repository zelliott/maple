An upper limb electrical stimulation technique has been developed which features a novel zzso approach, to obtain an ideal wrist response from the zzso The system uses an analogue zzso in conjunction with an zzso zzso so that different zzso sites can be tested using only one channel of zzso A twin axis zzso is attached to the patient's wrist and flex sensors are attached to the patient's fingers so that the control zzso can assess the wrist zzso A data acquisition unit logs the data for further zzso A clinical investigation on healthy subjects was conducted to test the proposed zzso The results show a high variation in hand response across different zzso In addition, for all subjects tested an ideal response was found which shows some justification for the use of the proposed zzso
