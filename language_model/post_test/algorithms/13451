zzso engineering scaffold is a biological substitute that aims to zzso to zzso or to improve tissue zzso Currently available manufacturing technology, that is, additive manufacturing is essentially applied to zzso the scaffold according to the zzso computer aided design zzso zzso To develop scaffold zzso libraries, the zzso could be used in the scaffold libraries zzso In this present study, one hundred and zzso zzso models were evaluated according to the established zzso The proposed criteria included considerations on zzso manufacturing zzso and mechanical strength of these zzso zzso and finite element zzso method were employed as tools in zzso The result of evaluation revealed that the zzso scaffold included truncated zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the suitable zzso for using as zzso scaffold libraries included zzso truncated zzso truncated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, not all pore size to beam thickness ratios zzso were good for making the zzso zzso The zzso ratio of each library, generating the enclosed pore inside the scaffold, was excluded to avoid the impossibility of material removal after the zzso The zzso libraries presented the constant zzso which is irrespective to the different pore zzso The relationship between zzso ratio and zzso of zzso scaffold libraries was displayed in the form of zzso Power zzso The possibility of merging two different types of libraries to produce the composite structure was zzso evaluated in terms of the intersection index and was mechanically evaluated by means of zzso analysis to observe the stress zzso The couples of zzso presenting low intersection index and high stress level were zzso Good couples for producing the reinforced scaffold were zzso zzso and zzso zzso
