zzso and variable selection are two classical strategies to deal with zzso data sets in zzso We propose an alternative strategy, called zzso which consists of a zzso step of redundant variables and a zzso step within each zzso We develop a statistical framework to define tailored zzso methods that can be combined with selection methods to build reliable zzso that benefit from the information contained in redundant zzso Two zzso are proposed for ordered and zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso and zzso zzso are zzso
