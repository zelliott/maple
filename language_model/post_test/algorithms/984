To assess the zzso zzso and zzso of a refined system zzso of requests by patients zzso for characterizing patient requests and physician responses in office zzso STUDY zzso Data were obtained from visits to six general zzso practicing in zzso California in 1994 and eight zzso practicing in the same region in zzso 

This was an zzso study of patient requests and physician responses in two practice zzso Patients were surveyed before and after the zzso Physicians were surveyed immediately after the visit, and all visits were audio recorded for future zzso 

zzso was refined using input from a multidisciplinary zzso zzso recordings of 131 visits (71 in internal medicine and 60 in zzso were rated independently by two zzso Estimates of zzso reliability zzso agreement on the sorting of requests into zzso and zzso reliability zzso agreement on the labeling of elements of discourse as zzso and subsequent zzso into zzso were zzso zzso was assessed by testing three specific hypotheses concerning the zzso and consequences of patient requests and request zzso 

The overall zzso zzso for identifying patients' requests was zzso and the zzso zzso was zzso indicating substantial agreement beyond zzso The average patient made zzso requests for information and zzso requests for physician zzso there were few differences in the spectrum of requests between internal medicine and zzso zzso 15 percent of visits included a direct request for completion of zzso Patients who were very or extremely worried about their health made more requests than those who were not zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso involving more patient requests took longer zzso zzso zzso and were perceived as more demanding by the treating physician zzso zzso zzso The vast majority of requests were zzso 

The refined zzso shows evidence of both zzso and zzso reliability and should be a useful tool for understanding the clinical zzso In addition, the system appears zzso to both zzso and specialist zzso More experience with the system is necessary to appraise zzso ability to predict important clinical zzso
