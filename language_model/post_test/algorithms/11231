The zzso model has enjoyed much success as a prior model for image zzso Given the individual classes in the model, the data are typically modeled as zzso random zzso or as random zzso from some other zzso zzso In this article, we present a zzso zzso model and apply it to a functional magnetic resonance imaging study for the zzso assessment of zzso brain zzso In our model, we assume that the zzso image from a patient can be segmented into zzso zzso and zzso classes, or zzso zzso on the class, or state, the zzso are assumed to come from some generic distribution which we model zzso using a mixture of zzso process zzso within the zzso zzso The zzso distribution of the model parameters is estimated with a zzso chain zzso Carlo algorithm, and zzso decision theory is used to make the final zzso Our zzso prior model includes two zzso the standard spatial zzso zzso and a zzso that can be interpreted as the a zzso probability that each zzso belongs to the zzso or background state, conditional on the lack of spatial zzso We assume that both of these parameters are unknown, and jointly estimate them along with other model zzso We show through simulation studies that our model performs on zzso in terms of zzso expected loss, with zzso zzso models when the zzso model is correctly specified and zzso zzso models when the zzso model in zzso
