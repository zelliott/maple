We sought to zzso the contribution of cardiac output zzso and total vascular zzso zzso to carotid zzso changes in mean zzso pressure zzso in the upright seated and zzso zzso Acute changes in carotid zzso zzso pressure were evoked using brief 5 s zzso of neck pressure and neck zzso zzso via a simplified paired neck chamber that was developed to enable zzso zzso of stroke volume using zzso zzso Percentage contributions of Q and zzso were achieved by calculating the predicted change in zzso during carotid zzso stimulation if only the individual changes in Q or zzso occurred and all other parameters remained at control zzso All zzso and zzso stimuli from zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso induced significant changes in Q and zzso in both the upright seated and zzso positions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso loading with the zzso position appeared to cause a greater reliance on carotid zzso changes in zzso Nevertheless, in both the seated and zzso positions the changes in zzso were primarily zzso by zzso in zzso zzso contribution of zzso at the zzso zzso seated 95 zzso 13, zzso 76 zzso 17 zzso These data indicate that zzso in zzso activity are the primary means by which the carotid zzso regulates blood pressure during acute changes in carotid zzso zzso zzso
