The periodic zzso lattice with N sites is globally zzso to a two zzso family of zzso coupled harmonic zzso The action variables fill out the whole positive zzso of zzso We prove that in the interior of the positive zzso as well as in a neighborhood of the origin, the zzso zzso is strictly convex and therefore zzso zzso applies on zzso all parts of phase space (2000 Mathematics zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
