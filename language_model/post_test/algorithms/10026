Recently developed zzso approximation for the equation of state of fully zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Rogers, zzso zzso E 79, zzso zzso which covers the transition between the weak and strong zzso zzso regimes and reproduces zzso results obtained in the zzso zzso zzso is modified in order to fit the small zzso from the linear mixing in the zzso regime, revealed by recent zzso Carlo zzso In addition, a mixing rule is proposed for the regime of weak zzso which zzso zzso density corrections to the case of zzso and zzso agrees with the zzso approximation in that zzso
