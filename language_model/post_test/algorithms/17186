The Southeastern zzso zzso Foundation zzso data base from October 1987 to September 1995 included zzso first zzso kidney transplants, of which zzso were placed into zzso recipients zzso zzso the zzso data offered an excellent sample in which to examine the effect of a number of conventional zzso B versus public zzso group, zzso matching schemes on access and graft survival zzso The standard applied was that zzso zzso had to be greater than that of the mean zzso of the racial zzso Because of the excellent zzso and zzso zzso of 0 A, B, DR mismatched zzso in both white recipients zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso these transplants were excluded from further zzso zzso the mean zzso and zzso zzso of the remaining zzso WR and zzso zzso transplants used for all subsequent comparisons were zzso and zzso for WR versus zzso and zzso for zzso Four different matching schemes were zzso 1) Class I A, B versus zzso zzso effect zzso zzso 2) 0, 1, zzso DR versus 0-2 zzso DR zzso 3) DR zzso zzso Class I A, B or zzso zzso and 4) Class I A, B versus zzso zzso zzso for zzso Two and possibly three zzso DR mismatched groups were identified in which improved access and zzso occurred in comparison with the 0, 1, and zzso DR mismatched transplants currently receiving 7, 3 and 1 point in the zzso sharing zzso The zzso and zzso zzso in WR and zzso of these groups were as zzso 0 zzso 0 DR zzso zzso and zzso in WR zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso 1-3 zzso 0 DR zzso zzso and zzso in WR zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on this analysis, there may be a significant potential advantage of prospective Class I zzso over A, B matching for first zzso kidney zzso
