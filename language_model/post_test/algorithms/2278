In the audit of zzso studies it is not common to assess the contribution of spot films to the total zzso This study investigates the accuracy with which the number of spot films and associated zzso product zzso may be zzso The study was undertaken for zzso zzso the swallow part of zzso swallow studies, and the abdominal part of zzso meal studies on X-ray sets with zzso zzso digital zzso and 100 zzso camera zzso zzso readings from a zzso were input to a computer at a rate of three per second and the difference in successive zzso values zzso These data were used to assess the number and total zzso from spot zzso For zzso based systems which sample the zzso values at three times per second the threshold zzso works well for zzso zzso of zzso meals and zzso However, the estimated number of spot films is generally in zzso For the zzso zzso it is unlikely that the sample rate can be increased to a high enough value to provide sufficient accuracy for all zzso studies obtained using all spot film zzso although use of the modified threshold zzso has the potential to provide some increase in zzso
