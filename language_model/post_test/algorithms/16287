Although an apparent diffusion zzso zzso value is often used for differential diagnosis of zzso it varies with scanning zzso The present study was performed to investigate the influence of imaging zzso zzso b value, repetition time zzso and echo time zzso on zzso zzso 

The zzso were scanned using diffusion weighted imaging zzso with changing b values zzso zzso zzso and TE to determine the influence on zzso Moreover, zzso of the brain in normal volunteers was determined with varying b values zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were obtained by zzso fitting in all zzso The points where fast and slow components of the zzso zzso crossed were called turning zzso The b values of turning points that crossed from the zzso curve were different in each zzso The b values of turning points depended on zzso of fast diffusion zzso When zzso is calculated using two b values of front and back for the turning point, the zzso value may be zzso zzso it was necessary to perform calculations by b value until the turning point to obtain the zzso value of the fast zzso In addition, zzso was recommended to avoid the influence of zzso by zzso Furthermore, the choice of long zzso and short TE was effective for accurate measurement of zzso 

It is important to determine the turning point for measuring zzso
