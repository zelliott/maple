Complex diseases have affected zzso health throughout the zzso Hundreds of studies show that complex diseases are caused by multiple zzso Currently, zzso association zzso only focus on the single locus that contributes to the zzso of a certain zzso However, the interaction between genes could be one of the main factors that lead to complex zzso This fact has initiated scientists to propose some zzso to detect these zzso such as the penalized zzso zzso model, zzso zzso reduction method, set association analysis method, zzso networks analysis method and random zzso However, these zzso are of high complexity, zzso causing over fitting of data, or not sensible of data at low zzso In this paper, we reviewed these zzso and then demonstrated a new zzso based on zzso to provide a powerful strategy to analyze zzso interaction in zzso association zzso This zzso is of low computing complexity, free of hypothesis, not affected by single locus marginal effect, and also of high stability and zzso
