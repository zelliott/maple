We study methods for reducing chemical master equations using the zzso mechanism as an zzso The master equation consists of a set of linear ordinary differential equations whose variables are probabilities that the zzso states zzso For a master equation with zzso initial zzso molecules and zzso initial zzso zzso the zzso can be zzso by zzso of the probability zzso zzso functional iteration method is found to be difficult to use for master equations of high zzso Building on the insights gained from zzso method, techniques are developed to produce zzso zzso of larger systems directly from the zzso We also develop a simple, but surprisingly effective way to generate initial conditions for the reduced zzso
