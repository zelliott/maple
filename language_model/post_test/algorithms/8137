A zzso zzso system is presented that allows sequential selection and processing of objects from a visual zzso The system is comprised of three zzso The selective attention module is designed as a network of zzso zzso of the zzso type with zzso connections between the central unit and peripheral zzso The attention focus is represented by those peripheral zzso that generate spikes zzso with the central zzso while the activity of other peripheral zzso is zzso Such dynamics zzso to the partial synchronization zzso It is shown that peripheral zzso with higher firing rates are zzso drawn into partial zzso We show that local zzso connections facilitate zzso while local zzso connections help distinguishing between two groups of peripheral zzso with similar intrinsic zzso The module automatically scans a visual scene and zzso selects regions of interest for detailed processing and object zzso The zzso extraction module zzso standard image processing zzso for zzso zzso The module zzso raw contours of objects accompanied by noise and some zzso zzso At the next stage, the object zzso module designed as a network of phase zzso is used for precise determination of object boundaries and noise zzso This module has a zzso architecture of zzso The segmented object is represented by a group of peripheral zzso working in the regime of partial synchronization with the central zzso The functioning of each module is illustrated by an example of processing of the visual scene taken from a visual stream of a robot zzso
