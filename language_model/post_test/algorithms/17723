A novel array of zzso zzso sensors for remote zzso zzso imaging is zzso This device was zzso by chemical zzso of a coherent optical fiber bundle to produce a zzso zzso The surface of the etched bundle was zzso with a thin layer of zzso tin oxide in order to create a transparent and zzso zzso surface that is insulated eventually by a new zzso paint except for the zzso of the zzso These fabrication steps produced an ordered array of zzso sensors with zzso dimensions that retains the optical fiber bundle zzso The zzso behavior of the sensor array was independently characterized by zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso current indicates that the sensors are zzso zzso This sensor array was further studied with a zzso zzso model system, such as zzso We clearly observed an ordered array of individual zzso zzso spots, which zzso to the sensor array zzso While the sensors of the array are not individually zzso zzso we could establish that the sensors are zzso independent and individually zzso Finally, we show that remote zzso imaging is performed zzso through the zzso sensor array zzso
