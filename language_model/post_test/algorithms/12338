zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis involves fitting of measured PET data to a PET zzso zzso The fitted parameters may, however, suffer from bias or be zzso especially in the case of noisy zzso There are many zzso zzso each having different zzso The purpose of the present study was to evaluate zzso the performance of different zzso zzso and zzso the effects of using incorrect weighting factors during zzso in terms of both accuracy and zzso of fitted PET zzso zzso In this study, the performance of commonly used zzso zzso zzso zzso Newton zzso and a simulated zzso zzso method was zzso This zzso algorithm, known as basin zzso was modified for the present zzso In addition, zzso was performed using various weighting zzso zzso and effects of using incorrect weighting factors were studied using both simulated and clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso data, taken from zzso zzso and zzso studies, were used to simulate zzso zzso at various zzso levels zzso zzso Clinical evaluation was based on studies with the same three zzso zzso was able to produce accurate results without the need for selecting appropriate starting values for zzso zzso in contrast to the zzso Newton zzso The latter gave biased results unless it was modified to allow for a range of starting values for the different zzso For patient studies, where large zzso is expected, both zzso and the extended Newton method provided accurate zzso zzso and clinical assessment showed similar results for the evaluation of different weighting models in that small to intermediate zzso between data zzso and weighting factors did not significantly affect the outcome of the zzso Large errors were observed only when the mismatch between weighting model and data zzso was zzso It is concluded that selection of specific zzso zzso and weighting factors can have a large effect on the accuracy and precision of PET zzso zzso Apart from carefully selecting appropriate zzso and zzso models, further improvement in accuracy might be obtained by using noise reducing strategies, such as zzso zzso provided that these methods do not introduce significant zzso
