To develop and evaluate a zzso method of zzso zzso elasticity scoring system based on ultrasound real-time zzso zzso for zzso benign and zzso breast zzso with zzso results as the reference zzso 

Conventional zzso zzso and zzso images of 145 breast zzso zzso zzso 78 zzso were performed in this zzso Each zzso was automatically contoured on the zzso image by the level set method and mapped on the zzso zzso The relative elasticity value of each zzso was reconstructed and classified into hard or soft by the fuzzy zzso zzso zzso According to the zzso degree inside zzso and its surrounding zzso the elasticity score of the zzso image was zzso in an automatic zzso Visual assessments of the zzso were used for comparing the diagnostic zzso zzso examination was used as the reference zzso The zzso zzso test and receiver operating characteristic zzso curve analysis were performed for statistical zzso 

Considering score 4 or higher as test positive for zzso the diagnostic zzso sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value zzso and negative zzso value zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for manual zzso Area under zzso curve zzso zzso for the proposed method was higher than the zzso value for visual assessment zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of classical zzso scoring system can significantly eliminate the zzso zzso and thereby improve the diagnostic confidence of zzso the breast zzso to avoid unnecessary zzso
