This paper presents a method for local zzso motion zzso from a conventional zzso free zzso zzso sequence using a modified zzso optical flow zzso zzso Initially, the technique was tested on synthetic images to evaluate its zzso with regards to zzso noise and to brightness zzso The method was then applied to cardiac images acquired on 11 healthy zzso zzso zzso is measured in zzso per second in each studied zzso and zzso as colored zzso superimposed on zzso zzso The estimated zzso OF results were compared with a reference OF method and gave similar results on synthetic images, zzso without a significant difference of the mean angular zzso zzso on zzso of normal hearts, the calculated zzso from zzso images zzso with values obtained in the zzso The advantage of the presented method is its zzso with respect to zzso noise and to brightness changes often observed in zzso zzso and especially with the zzso movement of the zzso Motion assessment using our method on zzso images gives promising results on motion zzso on a zzso basis, leading to a regional measurement of the zzso course of zzso displacement in different segments of the heart zzso
