The zzso of organ volumes from zzso images suffers from two major problems: image zzso and imperfect system transfer zzso Image zzso defines the borders of an organ and allows volume zzso by counting the zzso inside this zzso in all slices containing parts of this zzso A review of the literature, showed that several investigators use a fixed threshold zzso to determine the organ zzso It is our aim to demonstrate that the threshold has to be adapted to every single case because its value is dependent upon several factors, such as size and zzso Therefore a threshold selection algorithm, based on the gray level zzso zzso is zzso It is nearly impossible to calculate and eliminate errors induced by the complex system response zzso A correction method based on linear zzso is zzso By minimizing the relative error zzso a linear correlation zzso zzso zzso + zzso between the true volume zzso and the measured volume zzso is established for three fixed thresholds zzso zzso zzso and for the zzso zzso The methods are evaluated on a series of zzso zzso with a volume range between zzso and zzso zzso The relative error is minimal for the zzso zzso The whole procedure is zzso and virtually operator zzso
