We propose a completely automated methodology to investigate the relationship between magnetic resonance image zzso features and changes in cognitive estimates, applied to the study of zzso State zzso zzso changes in mild cognitive impairment zzso 

A reference group composed of 75 patients with clinically probable Alzheimer's Disease zzso and 75 zzso zzso and a study group composed of 49 zzso 20 having progressed to clinically probable zzso and 29 having remained stable after a 48 month zzso 

We created a zzso reference space using principal component analysis of zzso features zzso local volume zzso within the zzso zzso lobe of zzso baseline images for the reference zzso We projected similar data from the study group and identified a restricted set of image features highly correlated with one-year change in zzso using a zzso sampling zzso We used robust linear zzso models to predict one-year zzso changes from baseline zzso baseline zzso age, zzso and years of zzso 

All experiments were performed using a zzso zzso We found multiple zzso features highly correlated with one-year zzso changes zzso The model for all zzso zzso subjects had a correlation of zzso between actual and predicted one-year zzso change zzso A second model only for zzso subjects with zzso loss larger than 1 U had a zzso correlation zzso with an adjusted zzso of determination zzso 

Our automated zzso technique revealed a strong relationship between baseline zzso features and one-year cognitive changes in a zzso of zzso zzso This technique should be generalized to other aspects of cognitive evaluation and to a wider scope of zzso
