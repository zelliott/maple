zzso information about the outside world is zzso by zzso in sequences of zzso identical zzso termed action zzso or zzso There is persistent controversy about the extent to which the precise timing of these spikes is relevant to the function of the zzso We revisit this issue, using the zzso zzso of the fly visual system as a test zzso Our experimental methods allow us to deliver more nearly natural visual zzso comparable to those which flies encounter in free, acrobatic zzso New mathematical methods allow us to draw more reliable conclusions about the information content of neural responses even when the set of possible responses is very zzso We find that significant amounts of visual information are represented by details of the spike train at zzso and zzso precision, even though the sensory input has a correlation time of approximately 55 zzso different patterns of spike timing represent distinct motion zzso and the absolute timing of spikes points to particular features of these zzso with high zzso Finally, the efficiency of our zzso zzso makes it possible to uncover features of neural coding relevant for natural visual zzso first, the system's information transmission rate varies with natural fluctuations in light intensity, resulting from varying cloud cover, such that marginal increases in information rate thus occur even when the individual zzso are counting on the order of one million photons per zzso zzso we see that the system exploits the relatively slow dynamics of the stimulus to remove coding zzso and so generate a more efficient neural zzso
