This paper proposes a zzso zzso zzso control zzso system for a class of zzso zzso zzso The zzso comprises a neural zzso controller and a robust zzso The neural zzso controller containing a zzso neural network zzso zzso is the principal zzso and the robust controller is designed to achieve zzso tracking performance with desired zzso zzso Since the zzso uses zzso functions, its learning capability is superior to the conventional neural network for system zzso Moreover, the adaptation laws of the control system are derived in the sense of zzso function and zzso zzso thus the system can be guaranteed to be zzso zzso The proposed zzso is applied to two zzso systems, a chaotic system and a zzso motion system to illustrate its zzso zzso results verify that the proposed zzso can achieve favorable tracking performance by incorporating of zzso zzso zzso zzso control, and zzso robust control zzso
