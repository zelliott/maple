In this paper, four new features for the analysis of breast masses are zzso These features were designed to be insensitive to the exact shape of the zzso of the masses, so that an approximate zzso such as the one extracted via an automated zzso algorithm, can be employed in their zzso Two of the features, zzso and zzso measure the degree of zzso of a mass and its likelihood of being zzso One of these features, zzso is a measure of the relative zzso orientation of zzso that zzso to possible zzso The other feature, zzso is based on a comparison of mutual information measures between selected components of the zzso zzso The last two features, zzso and zzso measure the local fuzziness of the mass margins based on points defined zzso The features were tested for characterization zzso discrimination between circumscribed and zzso zzso and diagnosis zzso discrimination between benign and zzso zzso of breast masses using a set of 319 masses and three different zzso In the characterization experiments the features produced a result of approximately zzso correct zzso In the diagnosis experiments, the performance achieved was approximately zzso of correct zzso
