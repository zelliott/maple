zzso zzso investigations rely on the zzso assignment of mass zzso to zzso The quality of these matches is therefore a cornerstone in the analysis and has been the subject of numerous recent zzso In order to establish the benefits of novel zzso they are applied to reference samples of known zzso However, these were recently shown to be either too simple to resemble typical real-life samples or as leading to results of lower accuracy as the method zzso Here, we describe how to use the zzso of zzso zzso , a zzso as a standard to evaluate zzso identification zzso Indeed, we prove that the zzso zzso zzso provides a valid method for detecting random hits, comparable to the decoy databases currently in popular use, but we also prove that the zzso zzso zzso goes squarely beyond the decoy approach by also providing many hundreds of highly reliable true positive zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso can thus be used as a unique test that provides the ability to reliably detect both false zzso as well as zzso true zzso allowing the rigorous testing of identification zzso at the zzso and protein zzso
