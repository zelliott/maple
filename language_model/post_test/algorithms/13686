A zzso test for assessing recovery from pulmonary tuberculosis zzso would be extremely beneficial in regions of the world where laboratory facilities are zzso Our hypothesis is that analysis of cough sound recordings may provide such a zzso In the current paper, we present validation of a cough analysis zzso 

zzso data was collected from a cohort of zzso patients in zzso Peru and zzso hours of recordings were manually zzso by clinical zzso Analysis software was developed and validated by comparison to manual zzso Because many patients cough in zzso coughing was characterized in terms of cough zzso Our software correctly detects zzso of cough episodes with a specificity of zzso zzso to past results using the same zzso and a median false positive rate of 4 false zzso due to the zzso real-world nature of our zzso We then manually review detected zzso to eliminate false zzso in effect using the zzso as a zzso tool that reduces reviewing time to roughly zzso of the recording zzso This cough analysis approach provides a foundation to support zzso studies of coughing rates over time for zzso patients undergoing zzso
