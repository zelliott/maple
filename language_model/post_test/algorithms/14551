This paper considers a class of online zzso learning methods for zzso zzso neural networks with a single hidden zzso We assume that in each training cycle, each sample in the training set is supplied in a zzso order to the network exactly zzso It is interesting that these zzso learning methods can be shown to be zzso zzso This paper presents some weak and strong convergence results for the learning methods, indicating that the zzso of the error function goes to zero and the weight sequence goes to a fixed point, zzso The conditions on the zzso function and the learning rate to guarantee the convergence are relaxed compared with the existing zzso Our convergence results are valid for not only zzso type neural networks (both the output and hidden zzso are zzso zzso but also for zzso zzso and zzso type neural networks, where S and P represent zzso and zzso functions, zzso
