A partial zzso method of molecular dynamics simulations for proteins and zzso is zzso In this method, the zzso zzso for rigid bodies is combined with the equations of motion for the zzso zzso The standard zzso ensemble is extended to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso normal pressure and lateral surface area of zzso and constant zzso and zzso zzso normal pressure and lateral surface tension of zzso and constant zzso zzso By more than zzso simulations of zzso proteins and hydrated zzso zzso the results of the partial zzso method demonstrated excellent conservation of total energy and consistent behavior with the traditional constraint method in terms of structural distribution and fluctuation of proteins and zzso The efficient zzso of the partial zzso method in parallel zzso is zzso which is shown to work well in large-scale molecular dynamics zzso
