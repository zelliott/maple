zzso zzso of novel drug exposure and zzso data from the dog is tempered by our limited molecular and functional knowledge of dog zzso zzso zzso The aim was to study the zzso and protein expression of zzso dog zzso in relation to the metabolism of zzso of human zzso particularly those of the zzso zzso zzso The rate of zzso of zzso zzso in zzso by dog liver zzso zzso zzso zzso from 12 (six male and six zzso dogs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was zzso orders of magnitude lower than that in zzso zzso The rate of zzso of zzso zzso in humans by zzso was also low in dog liver zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso compared with human zzso In contrast, the rate of zzso of the zzso of zzso by dog liver was much zzso The zzso of this reaction zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso M, zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso were consistent with the involvement of a single zzso zzso In contrast to our findings for zzso dog liver zzso zzso zzso (also zzso by zzso in zzso at considerably higher rates zzso of zzso zzso zzso M, zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso For all the zzso except zzso a sex difference in their metabolism was observed in the dog zzso zzso female range zzso zzso male zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso female zzso zzso male zzso 8-12 zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso female zzso zzso male zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso female zzso zzso male zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All dog zzso expressed zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with no sex differences being zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso in the zzso of six of 11 zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso in humans by zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso in humans by zzso in the dog, and that this zzso and zzso contribute to zzso zzso zzso in humans by zzso zzso In conclusion, we have identified a distinct pattern of zzso expression of the zzso gene in the zzso Park beagle zzso Furthermore, marked differences in the metabolism of human zzso zzso were observed in this dog strain compared with humans with respect to rate of reaction, zzso and zzso zzso zzso
