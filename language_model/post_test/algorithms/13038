The progress of modern imaging studies has improved the diagnostic approach of benign liver zzso leading to a tailored approach with increased conservative zzso 

One hundred and zzso patients suffering from benign zzso zzso were enrolled in this study, including an operative zzso I, 49 zzso and a conservative zzso II, 83 zzso zzso zzso zzso and treatment features were zzso 

The mean patients' age was 39 zzso zzso for zzso based on diagnosis of zzso nature zzso cell zzso or uncertain zzso and significant zzso abdominal pain was zzso out of 33 patients with zzso zzso zzso out of 60 patients with focal zzso zzso and zzso out of 37 patients with zzso zzso zzso was zzso in group zzso zzso and zzso rates were related to the performance of major zzso when required for huge zzso With a zzso of complete patients' follow-up during a mean of 92 months in group I and 87 months in group II, no zzso or evolution towards zzso was zzso Interestingly, zzso of all observed benign liver zzso remained stable, decreased in size or zzso None of the remaining zzso required zzso 

A restrictive policy of surgical management of benign liver zzso based on clinical symptoms, zzso size and nature on imaging studies (including dubious zzso and zzso zzso in selected cases is safe and reliable with a zzso mortality in zzso patients and satisfactory zzso in the vast majority of observed benign liver zzso
