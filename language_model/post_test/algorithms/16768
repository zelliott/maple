Geometric flux maximizing flow zzso is an active zzso based method which zzso an initial surface to maximize the flux of a zzso field on the zzso For blood vessel zzso the zzso field is defined as the zzso specified by vascular edge strengths and zzso zzso the zzso performance depends on the quality of the detected edge zzso zzso In this paper, we propose a new method for level set based zzso of blood vessels by zzso the zzso on a zzso zzso zzso We consider a zzso zzso image zzso as a zzso embedded in the zzso space zzso zzso and zzso the image metric by zzso from the zzso space, whose metric zzso depends on the vessel enhancing diffusion zzso zzso This allows us to devise a zzso filter which both projects and zzso the original image zzso zzso under the inverse of local zzso zzso The filtered zzso zzso pertaining to the vessels are less sensitive to the local image contrast and more coherent with the local vessel zzso The method has been applied to both synthetic and real zzso zzso data zzso Comparisons are made with the zzso and zzso response based zzso indicating that the zzso zzso both methods in terms of leakage zzso and zzso vessel zzso
