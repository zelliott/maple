The zzso distribution of DNA breakage in zzso gel zzso zzso experiments poses a problem of proper zzso of the background damage to obtain a zzso distribution due to radiation zzso As been pointed out by various authors, a zzso zzso zzso of the background signal will not result in the right DNA mass distribution zzso and may even result in negative zzso Previous more systematic zzso methods have been based mainly on random zzso appropriate for zzso radiation but problematic for high zzso Moreover, an investigation is needed whether the background breakage itself is random or zzso Previously a new generalized zzso based on zzso processes for the zzso of the background damage in zzso experiments for any LET and any background was proposed, and as now applied it to a set of zzso data for zzso zzso We developed a zzso Carlo zzso to compare the zzso zzso procedure in artificial data sets to the result produced by the new zzso The simulated data corresponded to various cases, involving zzso zzso or random radiation breakage and random or zzso background zzso The zzso systematically gives better results than zzso zzso zzso in all these artificial data zzso
