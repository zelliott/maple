To evaluate segmented reconstruction zzso for spiral zzso zzso zzso zzso that use data from two cardiac cycles to improve zzso resolution zzso for imaging of the zzso 

An initial group of 78 cardiac patients zzso rates zzso zzso zzso beats per minute zzso were zzso on a zzso 500 zzso zzso rotation time scanner zzso zzso Images were reconstructed with a zzso zzso using data from one cardiac cycle with a reconstruction window of fixed length zzso zzso 250 zzso Images were also reconstructed with two zzso of a zzso zzso using data from two cardiac cycles where only one end of the reconstruction window was fixed and the other end was freely zzso to allow adjustment of zzso according to zzso zzso zzso fixed zzso with fixed start of zzso zzso zzso fixed zzso with fixed end of reconstruction (for both, zzso zzso zzso zzso The resulting image sets were ranked from best to worst zzso zzso in a zzso blinded comparison by two independent zzso A second group of 26 patients zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso on a zzso zzso zzso zzso rotation time scanner zzso zzso Data were reconstructed with a zzso zzso zzso zzso 210 zzso and a zzso fixed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and image sets were ranked from best to worst zzso zzso 

There was no clear evidence that any one technique is superior for imaging on scanner zzso Reader 1 ranked zzso images the highest for all zzso but statistically significant differences among the three zzso were only found for the lowest zzso zzso 80 zzso where reader 1 preferred zzso over zzso fixed zzso techniques zzso zzso zzso The highest rankings given by reader 2 varied according to zzso zzso images were superior for lowest zzso while zzso fixed zzso images were superior for zzso zzso 80 zzso none of these comparisons reached statistical zzso zzso performance of zzso reconstruction was found with scanner zzso Both readers ranked zzso fixed zzso images the highest zzso zzso zzso 

The added value of zzso cardiac reconstruction zzso for spiral zzso was not demonstrated for a zzso 500 zzso zzso rotation time scanner but shown to be beneficial for a zzso zzso zzso zzso rotation time scanner in the crucial zzso range of zzso zzso
