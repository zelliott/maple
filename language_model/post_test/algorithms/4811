We evaluate the capability of reconstructing zzso equations for an improved characterization of zzso zzso recordings from zzso zzso We derive zzso zzso of brain dynamics that are based on specific characteristics of the zzso zzso estimated from the zzso zzso long-lasting zzso zzso recordings from eight patients suffering from focal zzso we show that particularly the zzso part of the dynamics can yield valuable information for diagnostic zzso
