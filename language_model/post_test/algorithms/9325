A zzso theory of selection by consequences zzso zzso zzso A zzso model of selection by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 81, zzso was tested by studying the responding of virtual organisms that were animated by the theory on random zzso schedules of zzso The theory generated responding by applying principles of selection, zzso and zzso to a population of potential behaviors that evolved in response to the selection pressure exerted by zzso The zzso equilibrium response rates were well described by the modern version of the zzso zzso which includes an zzso on reinforcement zzso Under strong selection pressure this zzso decreased with increasing zzso rate from a value near zzso at zzso zzso to an zzso value of zzso at zzso rates of zzso and zzso This zzso value is consistent with values obtained by fitting the equation to data from live organisms responding on single schedules, and with the value of about zzso that is expected on the basis of extensive research with live organisms responding on concurrent zzso These results show that the zzso theory is consistent with the modern theory of matching zzso zzso zzso On the classic and modern theories of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 84, zzso and that it is a viable candidate for a mathematical dynamics of zzso
