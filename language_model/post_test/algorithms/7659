We present a new framework for predicting cognitive or other zzso data from medical zzso Current methods of probing the connection between medical images and other clinical data typically use zzso mass zzso zzso These approaches do not take into account the zzso network-based interactions between the various areas of the brain and do not give readily zzso metrics that describe how strongly cognitive function is related to zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso machine learning techniques do not typically provide a direct method for discovering which parts of the brain are used for making zzso We present a zzso based on recent work in sparse linear regression, that addresses both drawbacks of mass zzso approaches, while preserving the direct spatial zzso that they zzso In addition, we present a novel zzso zzso that adapts the zzso zzso method for sparse zzso on medical imaging zzso This zzso produces zzso that are more zzso than existing sparse zzso zzso
