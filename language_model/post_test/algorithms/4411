Using extensive zzso simulations, several distributed sensor imaging zzso for localized damage in a structure are zzso Given a zzso of zzso zzso a full response zzso for the healthy structure is assumed zzso It is used as a basis for comparison with the response zzso that is recorded when there is zzso zzso simulations are done with the wave equation in two zzso The healthy structure contains many zzso The aim is to image zzso defects with several regularly distributed zzso Because of the complexity of the environment, the recorded traces have a lot of delay spread and travel time migration does not work so zzso Instead, the traces are back zzso zzso assuming that there is some knowledge of the zzso Since the time at which the back zzso field will focus on the defects is unknown, the Shannon zzso or the bounded variation norm of the image is zzso and the time where it is minimal is zzso This imaging method performs well because it produces a tight image near the location of the defects at the time of zzso When there are several zzso the singular value decomposition of the response zzso is also carried zzso
