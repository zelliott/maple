In this paper, we propose an zzso for the design of lead generation libraries required in zzso drug zzso This zzso addresses simultaneously the two key criteria of diversity and zzso of compounds in the resulting library and is zzso efficient when applied to a large class of lead generation design zzso At the same time, additional constraints on experimental resources are also incorporated in the framework presented in this zzso A zzso efficient zzso zzso is developed, where the ability of the deterministic zzso zzso to identify clusters is exploited to zzso zzso over the entire data set to zzso over individual zzso An analysis of this zzso zzso the zzso between the error due to zzso and zzso zzso zzso applied on test data sets corroborate the analysis and show improvement by factors as large as 10 or more, depending on the data zzso
