A pilot study was undertaken with the objective of developing a simple, zzso and efficient zzso through which to zzso zzso in a large zzso cohort study in zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso employing both zzso and zzso regions and a zzso mobility zzso zzso were evaluated in comparison with DNA zzso Of 146 samples selected, 115 zzso were successfully zzso Taking sequence data as the zzso zzso other zzso were compared with these zzso The zzso correctly identified 95 zzso of the samples, and only 1 sample was wrongly zzso The zzso zzso alone and in combination with zzso peptides correctly identified 76 and zzso of the samples, zzso however, the number of wrongly identified samples was four times less with the combination compared with zzso peptides alone (4 versus zzso The sensitivity, zzso and positive and negative zzso values for zzso A and D samples were greater for the combination than zzso peptides zzso We have described a new zzso to segregate zzso A and zzso This zzso uses the two zzso zzso followed by zzso and then DNA sequencing for zzso samples, giving an accuracy of zzso at a cost of 37 and zzso for zzso compared with zzso all the samples by zzso or DNA sequencing, zzso This proposed approach is suitable for zzso studies in Uganda and other regions with a predominance of A and D zzso
