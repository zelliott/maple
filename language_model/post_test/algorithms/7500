zzso fiber architecture plays an important role in zzso and mechanical functions of the zzso Yet, its zzso zzso and more particularly, its relationship to the shape of the zzso is not fully zzso In this paper, we extend the statistical analysis of cardiac fiber architecture beyond its description with a fixed average zzso We study the zzso of fiber architecture with either shape or zzso information by exploring their principal modes of joint zzso We apply our general framework to a zzso of 8 ex zzso canine hearts, and find that zzso information appears to correlate best with the fiber zzso Furthermore, compared to current approaches that zzso an average zzso to the patient zzso our preliminary results show that joint statistics improves fiber synthesis from shape by zzso with cases up to zzso Our experiments also reveal evidence on a possible relation between architectural zzso and zzso zzso
