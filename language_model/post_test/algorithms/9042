Here, we employed the collective motions extracted from zzso zzso Analysis zzso in internal coordinates zzso zzso for the flexible fitting of zzso structures into electron zzso zzso density zzso The proposed methodology was validated using a benchmark of simulated cases, highlighting its zzso over the full range of zzso resolutions and even over zzso zzso A systematic comparison with other methods further showcased the advantages of this proposed methodology, especially at medium to lower zzso Using this method, zzso costs and potential zzso problems are naturally reduced by constraining the search in zzso zzso space, where zzso geometry is implicitly zzso This method also effectively captures the zzso changes of a representative set of experimental test zzso We believe that this novel approach will extend the currently available zzso hybrid methods to the zzso interpretation of large zzso changes and their functional zzso
