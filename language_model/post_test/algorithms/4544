People with zzso have poor respiratory function leading to limited tidal volume zzso and reduced cough peak flow zzso These problems may cause respiratory failure during the initial admission or subsequent zzso zzso zzso stimulation of the abdominal muscles during expiration can improve respiratory function by increasing zzso and zzso We developed a novel control system to automatically trigger muscle zzso zzso with the zzso voluntary respiratory zzso The system was tested in four subjects with a functionally complete zzso at level C4 to zzso aged between 16 and 46 years, 3 months to 5 years post injury, who were breathing zzso The zzso delivered automatic stimulation patterns, detecting cough and quiet breathing while suppressing stimulation during other activities such as zzso zzso increases in zzso (between zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso (between zzso and zzso of zzso were observed, suggesting that the technique may have potential use in both acute and established zzso to increase minute ventilation and to improve cough clearance of zzso
