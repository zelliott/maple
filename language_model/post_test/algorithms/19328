A method for determination of drug binding to plasma zzso which is based on the comparison of drug affinities to plasma proteins and zzso zzso is zzso The method is free of zzso binding zzso The zzso zzso obtained by the charcoal method are in good agreement with values from a traditional zzso method for various low and highly bound zzso The method presently requires drug zzso much less than that of plasma zzso A possibility of using the method to determine protein binding at an arbitrary drug concentration is zzso A mechanism of zzso binding of drug to zzso zzso which yields a good agreement with experimental zzso is zzso
