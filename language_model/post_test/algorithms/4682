Analysis of zzso experiments is complicated by the huge amount of data zzso zzso for groups of zzso genes is akin to searching for protein families in a database as, in both cases, small zzso of genes with similar features are to be found within vast quantities of zzso zzso was originally developed to find protein families in large sets of zzso acid sequences where the amount of data involved made zzso approaches overly zzso We present a number of improvements that greatly extend the previous version of zzso and show its application to zzso data as well as its ability of incorporating additional information to facilitate interactive zzso
