During gap zzso zzso are placed on a metal zzso which is separated from the shelf surface with a small air gap that eliminates significant zzso heat transfer from the shelf to the bottom of the zzso The purpose of this freezing approach is to reduce the zzso cycle time of various zzso zzso by nearly zzso zzso Such zzso freezing promotes the formation of large ice zzso and thus large pores throughout the cake, which subsequently zzso the primary drying zzso The nucleation temperature using gap zzso for the experimental conditions tested, was in the range of zzso to zzso much higher than the range of zzso to zzso found using conventional shelf zzso zzso freezing becomes effective when the gap is greater than zzso The pore sizes and cake resistance during primary drying for various zzso were determined using the pore diffusion model developed by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 2011, zzso zzso zzso in primary drying time were zzso (for zzso zzso zzso (for zzso zzso and zzso (for zzso zzso
