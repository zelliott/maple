This study presents a new approach based on artificial neural networks for generating one zzso feature zzso from another zzso zzso An automatic and intelligent system was designed and developed to analyze the relationships among fingerprints and faces and also to model and to improve the existence of the zzso The new proposed system is the first study that generates all parts of the face including eyebrows, eyes, nose, mouth, ears and face border from only zzso It is also unique and different from similar studies recently presented in the literature with some superior zzso The zzso settings of the system were achieved with the help of zzso experimental design zzso The performance and accuracy of the system have been evaluated with zzso cross validation technique using qualitative evaluation metrics in addition to the expanded quantitative evaluation zzso zzso the results were presented on the basis of the combination of these objective and zzso metrics for illustrating the qualitative properties of the proposed methods as well as a quantitative evaluation of their zzso Experimental results have shown that one zzso feature can be determined from zzso These results have once more indicated that there is a strong relationship between fingerprints and zzso
