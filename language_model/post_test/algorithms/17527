We developed a method to measure relative distances with zzso accuracy of fluorescent particles of different color in a zzso scanning zzso zzso with zzso zzso counting zzso The method can be used in the zzso zzso range, for distances below the resolution limit of standard far field zzso The proposed technique is more efficient than the methods using zzso zzso To achieve maximum sensitivity in the zzso direction, the zzso beam is moved periodically in a circular orbit with a radius of the size of the point spread zzso The phase and the zzso of the periodic zzso zzso calculated by fast zzso zzso gives the phase and the zzso distance of the particle from the center of zzso The coordinates of particles are recovered simultaneously in the two channels and the relative distance is calculated in real zzso zzso can be tracked by moving the center of scanning to the recovered position, while measuring the distance from the second zzso zzso data are saved and fitted later by a model accounting for light leakage between the zzso The total number of detected photons limited the accuracy of the position and distance zzso zzso demonstrating the advantages of the method were performed on fluorescent spheres and single dye molecules immobilized on zzso zzso
