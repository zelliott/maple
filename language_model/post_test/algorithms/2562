Reconstruction zzso for imaging zzso in near infrared ranges usually zzso zzso light with respect to zzso zzso Using this approach, we investigated the influence of zzso and scattering zzso on zzso accuracy when assuming a homogeneous model and explored possible reconstruction improvements by using a zzso zzso To do so, we created several zzso zzso a homogeneous slab phantom zzso slab zzso including a region with a two- to zzso increase in scattering zzso and in zzso zzso and an zzso mouse phantom that modeled different liver and lung scattering zzso For zzso reconstruction with the wrong optical properties yielded zzso errors that increased almost zzso with the scattering zzso while they were mostly negligible regarding the zzso zzso This observation agreed with the theoretical zzso Taking the zzso of a homogeneous phantom as a reference, relative zzso errors obtained when wrongly assuming homogeneous media were in the range zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso Using a zzso model, the overall error ranged from zzso to zzso In conclusion, this work demonstrates that assuming homogeneous media leads to noticeable zzso errors that can be improved by adopting zzso zzso
