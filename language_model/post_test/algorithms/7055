A triangular zzso approach to build up surfaces has been adapted to the study of zzso By using a zzso generic zzso each atom is assigned a particular sphere whose zzso are chosen according to any suitable zzso Different types of surfaces have been adapted to this method: van der zzso surface accessible, and Richard's molecular zzso A simple method is used to eliminate all zzso found at the intersection volume of the atomic spheres and a fast zzso is employed to calculate the area of the envelope surface and the volume zzso The data about the surface are given by the coordinates of the center of each triangle, elementary surface value, and zzso coordinates of the normal to the zzso Color coding of standard properties such as charge zzso potential energy, or any zzso property can be easily done with standard graphics zzso Fairly detailed information on zzso properties, such as electric field and atom zzso can also be zzso represented by using projections along the zzso with adequate color zzso
