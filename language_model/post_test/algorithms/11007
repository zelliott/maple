zzso is required to ensure automated zzso zzso are suitable for zzso target zzso In the absence of true zzso zzso zzso is validated against expert outlining of the region of zzso Multiple experts are used to overcome zzso zzso Several approaches have been studied in the literature, but the most appropriate approach to combine the information from multiple expert zzso to give a single metric for zzso is zzso None consider a metric that can be tailored to zzso requirements in zzso zzso zzso index zzso a new validation metric which uses zzso level of agreement was zzso A control zzso was introduced for the validation of zzso required for different zzso zzso for targets close to zzso and for difficult to discern targets, where large variation between experts is zzso VI was evaluated using two simulated idealized cases and data from two clinical zzso VI was compared with the commonly used zzso similarity zzso zzso - zzso and found to be more sensitive than the zzso - wise to the changes in agreement between zzso VI was shown to be adaptable to specific zzso planning zzso
