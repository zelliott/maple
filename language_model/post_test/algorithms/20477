zzso techniques, such as the signal averaged zzso have been used to assess risk of zzso zzso zzso However, these methods produce false positive and negative zzso The purpose of this study was to develop body surface map zzso which would enhance prediction of zzso to zzso zzso patients referred for programmed electrical stimulation were enrolled in this zzso All patients underwent signal averaged zzso body surface map, programmed electrical zzso Group I patients had no sustained zzso VT and group II patients had either zzso sustained VT at zzso study or previously documented spontaneous, sustained zzso For body surface map analysis, the difference between zzso on zzso maps was calculated and defined as the zzso zzso An abnormal body surface map was defined as a zzso zzso range zzso or zzso 109 zzso The mean zzso zzso range in group II was significantly zzso that in group I zzso zzso zzso By zzso zzso analysis, the presence of coronary artery disease, a zzso zzso range zzso or zzso 109 zzso an zzso zzso zzso and a signal averaged zzso zzso duration zzso 114 zzso predicted zzso The sensitivity, zzso positive and negative zzso values for predicting VT zzso of an zzso which combines the signal averaged zzso zzso duration and the zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, while those for the signal averaged zzso alone were zzso zzso zzso and zzso for VT zzso A combined body surface zzso averaged zzso zzso was more sensitive in detecting zzso to VT than the signal averaged zzso zzso
