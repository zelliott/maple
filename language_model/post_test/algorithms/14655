zzso acute zzso clinically is still zzso We developed random forests, support zzso machines, and artificial neural network models to diagnose acute zzso 

Between January 2006 and December 2008, patients who had a consultation session with surgeons for suspected acute zzso were zzso Seventy-five percent of the data set was used to construct models including random forest, support zzso machines, artificial neural networks, and zzso zzso Twenty-five percent of the data set was withheld to evaluate model zzso The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso was used to evaluate performance, which was compared with that of the zzso zzso 

Data from a total of 180 patients were collected, 135 used for training and 45 for zzso The mean age of patients was zzso years zzso zzso Final diagnosis revealed 115 patients with and 65 without zzso The zzso of random forest, support zzso machines, artificial neural networks, zzso regression, and zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The sensitivity, zzso positive, and negative zzso values of random forest were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Random forest performed better than artificial neural networks, zzso regression, and zzso 

We demonstrated that random forest can predict acute zzso with good accuracy and, deployed appropriately, can be an effective tool in clinical decision zzso
