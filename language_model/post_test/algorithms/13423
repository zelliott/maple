The combined simulated zzso zzso zzso was developed for the discrete facility location problem zzso in the zzso The method is a zzso algorithm, in which the external zzso zzso the decision of the facility location decision while the internal zzso zzso the decision of the allocation of customer's demand under the determined location zzso The performance of the zzso is tested by 30 instances with different zzso The zzso results show that zzso works much better than the previous zzso on zzso and offers a new reasonable alternative solution method to zzso
