We examined zzso methods of zzso of MR images of the brain for measuring tumor volume in response to zzso Two zzso methods were zzso fuzzy zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared with volume zzso by two supervised methods, zzso neighbors and region growing, and all results were compared with manual zzso zzso of individual zzso are presented as well as comparisons on the application of the different methods with 10 data sets of patients with brain zzso zzso zzso is preferred for measuring tumor volumes in response to treatment, as it eliminates operator dependency and may be adequate for zzso of the target volume in radiation zzso Some obstacles need to be zzso in particular regarding the detection of zzso relevant tissue zzso This study shows that these improvements are zzso
