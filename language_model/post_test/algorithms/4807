We study the link between three zzso cases of zzso zzso strongly overlapping multiple chains in dilute solution, chains under zzso zzso and the onset of zzso zzso Our main result is that the free energy for overlapping zzso chains is independent of chain length and scales as zzso slowly crossing over to zzso as zzso zzso For strongly confined zzso inside a zzso zzso we show that rearranging the chains does not cost an additional free zzso Our results imply that, during cell cycle, global reorganization of zzso zzso in a large cell nucleus could be readily zzso
