An zzso for the automated zzso model building of zzso zzso is zzso The procedure is zzso In the initial zzso many overlapping zzso fragments are zzso In subsequent zzso the fragments are extended and then zzso Identification of the locations of zzso and zzso regions is carried out by zzso template zzso zzso libraries of zzso and zzso from refined protein structures are then positioned at the potential locations of zzso and strands and the longest segments that fit the zzso map are zzso The zzso and strands are then extended using zzso libraries consisting of sequences three zzso acids long derived from refined protein zzso The resulting segments of zzso chain are then connected by choosing those which overlap at two or more zzso zzso The fully automated procedure has been implemented in zzso and is capable of model building at resolutions as low as zzso zzso The zzso is useful for building a preliminary zzso model that can serve as a basis for refinement and zzso zzso
