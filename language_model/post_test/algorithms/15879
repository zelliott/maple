The purpose of this work was to gain clinical experience with and to identify the optimal conditions for the use of zzso human zzso zzso commercially available as zzso in the management of patients with differentiated zzso cancer zzso The study involved 22 patients for a total of 27 administration cycles of zzso for either diagnostic (in 19 zzso and/or therapeutic purposes (in 8 zzso There were 19 patients with zzso cancer zzso zzso in 4, zzso zzso in 1) and 3 patients with zzso cancer (1 zzso cell zzso All patients had previously undergone total zzso and zzso cycles of zzso zzso was administered zzso according to the suggested zzso zzso zzso zzso on days 1 and 2, zzso on day zzso Peak serum zzso levels between zzso zzso were observed after zzso zzso these were on average zzso higher, on a zzso basis, than peak serum zzso observed after conventional withdrawal of zzso treatment in 19 patients, while in 3 patients they were zzso lower, but still in the potent stimulation range zzso zzso There was general agreement between imaging results obtained under zzso stimulation and those obtained on prior occasions during zzso withdrawal, although zzso zzso was interpreted as less intense following zzso zzso Of 18 patients undergoing zzso administration for diagnostic purposes, 11 patients had a negative zzso zzso scan zzso and 7 had a positive zzso Three of the zzso patients were shown to be actually affected by tumor zzso respectively by PET with zzso (in 2 zzso and by zzso therapy zzso zzso zzso zzso increased to abnormal levels following zzso stimulation in zzso of the zzso patients as well as in zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso as well as in zzso zzso patients, serum zzso progressively rose under zzso zzso yet still remaining below 3 zzso zzso therapy scans following zzso administration showed good zzso zzso in zzso patients, the single unsuccessful case being most likely due to expansion of the zzso pool because of recent use of an zzso contrast zzso The overall results show the feasibility and practical advantages of employing zzso stimulation in the general clinical setting rather than zzso withdrawal in the management of DTC zzso zzso should be raised on the interpretation of the serum zzso response to such potent but short-lived zzso zzso
