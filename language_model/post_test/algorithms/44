In zzso zzso concentration changes in zzso and zzso zzso are calculated from the changes in the zzso of the measurement zzso This is done by solving a linear equation based on the modified zzso zzso To solve this zzso we need to know the partial optical zzso in the activated region in the zzso Because they are difficult to know, a zzso constant or a zzso total optical zzso has been zzso for these values in actual zzso This kind of substitution inevitably produces zzso called zzso when calculating concentration zzso In this paper, we propose a new zzso measure for dual and triple wavelength zzso and analyze it over various wavelength zzso The results indicate that constant substitution is not inferior to total zzso substitution in dual wavelength zzso and that total zzso substitution is very effective for triple wavelength zzso
