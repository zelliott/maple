A zzso barrier concept of disposal is adopted for both low and intermediate level radioactive waste disposal to prevent the spread of zzso into the human zzso zzso engineered barrier is a part of zzso barrier system for radioactive waste zzso As long as the concrete barrier is intact, the zzso of radioactive waste within the disposal facility is zzso However, every concrete structure has a finite zzso zzso barriers degrade with time with lifetime dependent on type of concrete, external and internal environmental zzso This degradation allows the free moment of the zzso out of the concrete zzso Hence an attempt was made to model the zzso zzso leaching from side wall of a concrete engineered barrier in a Near Surface zzso Facility zzso and its influence on zzso migration across the concrete barrier, limited to conditions specified in the zzso The conceptual model assumes that rain water zzso into the engineered barrier through the top cover and zzso zzso from the nuclear waste zzso The zzso was attempted with zzso zzso analysis and validated with the results available in zzso The influence of zzso leaching on zzso migration in concrete barrier has been discussed for eight different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
