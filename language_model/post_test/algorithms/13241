We describe a method to simultaneously measure thickness variation and zzso index zzso of 300 zzso diameter silicon wafers using a zzso zzso zzso operating at zzso zzso Only three zzso are required, corresponding to three different cavity zzso A customized phase shifting zzso is used to suppress several high order zzso and minimize intensity sampling zzso The new method was tested with both silicon and fused zzso wafers and measurement results proved to be highly zzso The reliability of the method was further verified by comparing the measured thickness variation of a 150 zzso diameter zzso to a measurement of the zzso zzso after bonding the zzso to an optical zzso
