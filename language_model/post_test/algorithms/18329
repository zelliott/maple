Computer vision techniques have been developed for quantitative analysis of size and shape changes in cells frozen on a zzso The analysis is based on zzso of standard serial edge detection zzso in conjunction with a shape transform to isolate individual cells in complex scenes which may include adjacent and zzso ice zzso In the present study the sensitivity of the automated analysis procedure is evaluated for images obtained by various microscope optical systems for progressive degrees of subject blurring by zzso zzso zzso in zzso trials for freezing latex spheres with zzso ice in the field of view were least sensitive for bright field images, although the most consistent data was obtained by differential interference contrast zzso In all cases phase contrast images produced the least accurate zzso An example analysis is presented for the freezing of zzso zzso
