The parent zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were generated in a novel source and their zzso zzso recorded with zzso zzso zzso zzso detachment energy zzso and the zzso electron affinity zzso values were extracted from each of the two zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso conducted calculations which explored electron attachment to zzso Based on the agreement between their calculated and our measured zzso and zzso values, we conclude that the zzso zzso studied in these experiments were formed by zzso zzso zzso zzso as predicted by the zzso Given the similarities between the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso it is likely that zzso can be described in the same zzso
