This paper presents a new approach to divide large Water Distribution Networks zzso into suitable District zzso Areas zzso It uses a zzso simulator and two operational models to identify the optimal number of zzso their entry points and boundary valves, and the network zzso needs throughout the project zzso The first model divides the zzso into suitable zzso based on graph theory concepts and some zzso zzso The second model uses a simulated zzso zzso to identify the optimal number and location of entry points and boundary valves, and the pipes zzso necessary to meet the zzso and pressure zzso The objective function is the difference between the economic benefits in terms of water loss reduction zzso from the average pressure zzso and the cost of implementing the zzso To illustrate the proposed methodology, the results from a hypothetical case study are presented and zzso
