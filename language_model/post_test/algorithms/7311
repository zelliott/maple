zzso zzso routines deployed widely to locate and track the positions of particles in microscope images include several steps where images are zzso with kernels to remove zzso In many common zzso some kernels are zzso zzso Here we show that the use of these zzso kernels creates significant artifacts, zzso apparent particle positions in a way that gives the artificial appearance of zzso zzso order, even in such zzso zzso systems as simple zzso of zzso zzso We rectify this problem by replacing all zzso kernels with zzso zzso which does not impact code zzso We show that these corrected codes locate particle positions properly, restoring measured zzso to zzso zzso We also investigate zzso zzso zzso and with the corrected codes show that these zzso often thought to be zzso may exhibit strong zzso correlations among bonds between neighboring zzso zzso
