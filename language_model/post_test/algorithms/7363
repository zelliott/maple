Next generation sequencing technologies have greatly advanced many research areas of the biomedical sciences through their capability to generate massive amounts of genetic information at unprecedented zzso The advent of next generation sequencing has led to the development of numerous zzso tools to analyze and assemble the millions to billions of short sequencing reads produced by these zzso While these tools filled an important zzso current approaches for zzso processing, and analyzing short read zzso generally have remained simple and lack the complexity needed to efficiently model the produced reads and assemble them zzso 

Previously, we presented an overlap graph zzso scheme for modeling read overlap relationships on multiple zzso Most current read assembly and analysis approaches use a single graph or set of clusters to represent the relationships among a read zzso Instead, we use a series of zzso to represent the reads and their overlap relationships across a spectrum of information zzso At each information level our zzso is capable of generating clusters of reads from the reduced zzso forming an integrated graph modeling and zzso approach for read analysis and zzso Previously we applied our zzso to simulated and real zzso zzso to assess its ability to efficiently model and cluster next generation sequencing zzso In this paper we extend our zzso to large simulated and real zzso zzso to demonstrate that our zzso is practical for both sequencing zzso 

Our overlap graph zzso zzso is able to model next generation sequencing reads at various levels of zzso through the process of graph zzso Additionally, our model allows for efficient representation of the read overlap zzso is zzso for large zzso and is practical for both zzso and zzso sequencing zzso
