zzso logic programming zzso has been applied to automatically discover protein fold zzso This paper investigates the use of zzso information to circumvent problems encountered during previous experiments, namely zzso matching of zzso related secondary structures and zzso zzso zzso zzso tests were carried out for 20 zzso The overall estimated accuracy is zzso The new representation allows us to process the complete set of examples, while previously it was necessary to sample the negative zzso zzso information is used in approximately zzso of the rules presented zzso Information about the zzso of a sheet is present in zzso of the zzso This set of rules presents characteristics of the overall architecture of the zzso In contrast, zzso of the rules contain zzso information which is limited to the packing of a restricted number of secondary structures, as such, the later set resembles those found in our previous zzso
