zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that preserve neighborhood relationships by zzso similar signals with similar zzso are advantageous in an environment where signals are corrupted by noise and zzso meaning zzso are rewarded as zzso The evolution of these zzso however, cannot be explained within a traditional language evolutionary game scenario in which individuals meet randomly because the evolutionary dynamics is trapped in local zzso that do not reflect the structure of the meaning and signal zzso Here we use a simple game theoretical model to show zzso that when individuals adopting the same communication code meet more frequently than individuals using different zzso result of the spatial organization of the zzso advantageous linguistic innovations can spread and take over the zzso In addition, we report results of simulations in which an individual can communicate only with its K nearest neighbors and show that the probability that the lineage of a zzso that uses a more efficient communication code becomes fixed decreases zzso with increasing zzso These findings support the mother tongue hypothesis that human language evolved as a communication system used among zzso especially between mothers and zzso
