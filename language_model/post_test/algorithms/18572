zzso fitting has been applied to data analysis and zzso determination of complex experimental systems in many areas of chemistry and zzso However, this method is limited because of the time costs of the zzso In this paper it is proposed to approximate and substitute a simulation model by an artificial neural network during the fitting zzso Such a substitution significantly speeds up the zzso zzso This approach is tested on a model of zzso resonance energy transfer zzso within a system of zzso zzso labeled zzso major coat protein zzso incorporated into a zzso zzso It is demonstrated that in our case the application of a trained artificial neural network for the substitution of the simulation model results in a significant gain in computing time by a factor of 5 zzso zzso Moreover, an artificial neural network produces a smooth approximation of the noisy results of a zzso zzso
