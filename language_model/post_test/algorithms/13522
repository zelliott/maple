Human and many other animals can zzso zzso and zzso natural actions in a very short zzso How this is achieved by the visual system and how to make machines understand natural actions have been the focus of zzso studies and zzso modeling in the last several zzso A key issue is what zzso features should be zzso and what the characteristics of their zzso are in natural zzso Current global zzso schemes depend heavily on zzso while local zzso schemes lack descriptive zzso Here, we propose natural action structures, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of local features, as the basic features for representing natural zzso In this concept, any action is a zzso zzso of a set of natural action structures, which convey a full range of information about natural zzso We took several steps to extract these zzso First, we sampled a large number of sequences of patches at multiple zzso zzso Second, we performed independent component analysis on the patch sequences and classified the independent components into zzso Finally, we compiled a large set of natural action structures, with each corresponding to a unique combination of the clusters at the selected zzso zzso To zzso human actions, we used a set of zzso natural action structures as zzso to two widely used zzso We found that the natural action structures obtained here achieved a significantly better recognition performance than low-level features and that the performance was better than or comparable to the best current zzso We also found that the zzso performance with natural action structures as features was slightly affected by changes of scale and artificially added zzso We concluded that the natural action structures proposed here can be used as the basic zzso units of actions and may hold the key to natural action zzso
