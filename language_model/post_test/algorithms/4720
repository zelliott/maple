This paper describes the first use of a Network zzso Unit zzso to perform zzso image composition in a distributed rendering zzso The image composition step is a notorious bottleneck in a clustered rendering zzso Furthermore, image zzso zzso do not necessarily scale as data size and number of zzso zzso Previous researchers have addressed the composition problem via software and/or zzso zzso We used the zzso zzso zzso architecture of the Intel zzso zzso a fully zzso commercial zzso zzso technology, to perform the image composition zzso With this design, we have attained a nearly zzso performance increase over traditional software-based zzso methods, achieving sustained zzso rates of zzso zzso on a zzso zzso zzso zzso This system is fully zzso with a negligible penalty in frame rate, is entirely zzso and is flexible with regard to operating system, rendering software, graphics cards, and zzso zzso The zzso zzso has the additional advantage of being a modular zzso component that is eminently suitable for integration into existing distributed software zzso zzso
