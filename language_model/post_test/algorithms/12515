To evaluate and compare the screening performance for fetal zzso 21 in the first zzso of pregnancy either with or without inclusion of fetal zzso bone using two separate zzso of the Fetal Medicine Foundation London zzso 

This study included zzso patients zzso to our zzso level prenatal zzso for first zzso screening at zzso weeks of gestation between December 1, 2002 and November 30, zzso Fetal risk for zzso 21 was calculated using either the old zzso including maternal age, zzso zzso zzso free zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso or the new zzso using additionally the presence or absence of fetal zzso bone zzso All zzso were certified for measurement of zzso zzso and zzso bone by the Fetal Medicine Foundation zzso The detection rate for a fixed risk zzso zzso and a fixed zzso rate (5 zzso was calculated for ultrasound zzso zzso or zzso and zzso serum zzso maternal age and the combination of these zzso 

zzso outcome was obtained in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bone was absent in 5 of 18 zzso zzso cases with fetal zzso 21 and in 2 of zzso zzso zzso normal zzso The estimated risks for zzso 21 based on maternal age, fetal ultrasound and maternal serum free zzso and zzso was 1 in 300 or greater in zzso zzso without zzso zzso including zzso zzso % zzso of zzso and zzso % zzso of zzso normal zzso and in zzso % (17 of zzso and zzso % zzso of zzso of those with zzso zzso For a fixed zzso rate of 5 % the respective detection rates of screening for fetal zzso syndrome by maternal age and serum free zzso and zzso maternal age and fetal ultrasound and by maternal age, fetal ultrasound and maternal serum zzso were zzso zzso without zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso % and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our data show no additional performance of including presence or absence of fetal zzso bone in calculation of risk for fetal zzso syndrome between 11 and 14 weeks of zzso Individual zzso zzso screening could be an alternative approach for integration of additional ultrasound markers in first zzso zzso
