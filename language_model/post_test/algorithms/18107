This study aimed to identify neural mechanisms that zzso zzso learning in a zzso zzso We trained two monkeys zzso zzso to determine the direction of visual motion while we recorded from their middle zzso area zzso which in trained monkeys represents motion information that is used to solve the task, and lateral zzso area zzso which represents the transformation of motion information into a zzso zzso During training, improved behavioral sensitivity to weak motion signals was accompanied by changes in zzso responses of zzso in zzso but not in zzso The time course and magnitude of the changes in zzso correlated with the changes in behavioral sensitivity throughout zzso Thus, for this task, zzso learning does not appear to involve improvements in how sensory information is represented in the brain, but rather how the sensory representation is interpreted to form the decision that guides zzso
