The problem of detecting symmetry has been studied by using digitally generated images with random zzso zzso The statistical efficiency of humans and a computerized observer, the cross zzso of the image halves, has been zzso The efficiency of humans is approximately zzso when the image comprises only a few zzso and is notably better than that of the cross zzso When the number of zzso in the image is increased, the zzso of symmetry gets zzso For human observers zzso zzso however, on a level corresponding to a modest number of zzso Human efficiency in detecting symmetry is thus low when the image zzso size is zzso
