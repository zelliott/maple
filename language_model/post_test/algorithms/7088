The quality of zzso zzso imaging systems has improved to the point that the motion is the most important limitation in many zzso Gross movements of the patient cause a ghost artifact in the image which can interfere with the zzso In this paper a new method is presented to suppress the zzso motion artifact caused by gross zzso The method uses zzso on a standard two-dimensional zzso transform zzso It is shown that zzso motion causes an additional phase factor in the detected signal and that this phase error can be removed using an zzso zzso of zzso zzso The method has been tested using computer simulations and successfully removed most of the artifact, even in the presence of zzso
