There are considerable differences in published prediction zzso for resting energy expenditure zzso based on zzso mass zzso The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of the methodology of body composition analysis on the prediction of zzso from zzso 

In a zzso design zzso of zzso and body composition were zzso 

The study population consisted of 50 men (age zzso years, body mass index zzso zzso zzso and 54 women (age zzso years, zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was measured by indirect zzso and predicted by either zzso or body zzso zzso of zzso was performed by methods based on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso zzso X-ray zzso zzso air displacement zzso zzso and zzso oxide dilution zzso A zzso zzso was used as a zzso 

When compared with the zzso zzso prediction from zzso obtained from the zzso methods were not significantly zzso zzso of the zzso equations of zzso prediction by zzso differed from zzso zzso to zzso zzso h zzso and the slopes ranged between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In a normal range of zzso zzso predicted from zzso by different methods showed only small zzso The zzso in zzso explained by zzso varied from zzso zzso to zzso zzso and was only zzso for body zzso 

zzso in slopes and zzso of the zzso lines between zzso and zzso depended on the methods used for body composition zzso However, the differences in prediction of zzso are small and do not explain the large differences in the results obtained from published zzso zzso prediction equations and therefore imply a zzso and/or investigator specificity of zzso for zzso zzso
