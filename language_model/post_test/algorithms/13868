zzso proposal for the functioning of the zzso zzso 1970) is the least known of his various theories for specific neural zzso He suggested that the zzso learns by zzso to extract the structure from the patterns of activity incident upon zzso He proposed a zzso neural network in which the connections to the output cells zzso with the zzso cells of the zzso are modified by a mechanism of competitive zzso It was intended that each output cell comes to be selective for the input patterns from a different class and is able to respond to new patterns from the same class that have not been seen zzso The learning rule that zzso proposed was zzso but a logical extension of the basic idea results in a synaptic learning rule in which the total amount of synaptic strength of the connections from each input zzso cell is kept at a constant zzso In contrast, conventional competitive learning involves rules of the zzso zzso The network learns by exploiting the structure that zzso assumed to exist within the ensemble of input zzso For this case, analysis is possible that extends that carried out by zzso which was restricted to the zzso zzso zzso This analysis is presented here, together with results from computer simulations of different types of competitive learning zzso The zzso mechanism is best known in the zzso zzso zzso In neural network applications, it may be a more suitable mechanism of competitive learning than those normally zzso
