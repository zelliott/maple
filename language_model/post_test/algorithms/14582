In this paper, we study the benefits of the availability of a specific form of additional zzso vertical direction zzso and the height of the camera, both of which can be zzso measured using zzso sensors and a zzso video sequence for zzso urban zzso We show that in the presence of this information, the zzso equations can be zzso in a zzso zzso This allows us to derive a fast, zzso and zzso zzso zzso for large scale zzso The zzso zzso developed in this paper is zzso demonstrated to have favorable properties compared to the sparse bundle adjustment zzso We provide experimental evidence indicating that the proposed zzso zzso in many cases to solutions with lower error than zzso zzso of bundle zzso We also demonstrate that for the case of large reconstruction problems, the proposed zzso takes lesser time to reach its solution compared to bundle zzso We also present zzso results using our zzso on the Google zzso research data zzso
