In a zzso zzso task with humans, the observer is required to decide whether a probe duration zzso is more similar to the short zzso zzso an zzso response, or to the long zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso yields a zzso function relating the proportion of long responses, zzso to probe duration zzso The value of zzso at which zzso and zzso occur with equal frequency, zzso zzso zzso is referred to as the zzso point, zzso zzso models usually interpret zzso as identifying the value of zzso that is equally zzso with S and zzso but they differ in their predictions for the location of zzso The present paper presents new data relevant to the location and interpretation of zzso The data indicate that the empirical values usually are zzso the biases being influenced by duration range, zzso ratio, and probe zzso Moreover, the biases often are not consistent across zzso It is concluded that empirical values of zzso should not be interpreted as indicating the value of zzso that is equally zzso with S and zzso
