Progress towards structure determination that is both zzso and high-value is dependent on the development of integrated and automatic tools for zzso map interpretation and for the analysis of the resulting atomic zzso Advances in zzso zzso are extending the resolution regime in which fully automatic tools can work zzso but at present human intervention is required to interpret poor regions of zzso electron density, particularly where zzso data is only available to modest resolution zzso example, zzso zzso zzso for minimum resolution zzso zzso In such cases, a set of manual and zzso zzso zzso tools is zzso At the same time, converting the knowledge zzso in a molecular structure into understanding is dependent upon zzso tools, which must be able to communicate that understanding to others by means of both zzso and dynamic zzso zzso zzso is a program designed to meet these needs in a way that is closely integrated with the ongoing development of zzso as a program suite suitable for both low- and zzso zzso structural zzso As well as providing a carefully designed user interface to advanced zzso of model building and analysis, zzso zzso is intended to present a zzso zzso to developers of novel zzso in these zzso
