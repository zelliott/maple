The influence of the column zzso time measurement accuracy on the determination of equilibrium zzso by classical frontal analysis and the prediction of overloaded zzso band profiles were zzso The ideal model of zzso in combination with a zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso and overloaded zzso profiles were computer generated with a known zzso time value zzso zzso zzso Then these data were evaluated the same way as it is done with experimental zzso data where the true zzso time is unknown, zzso to determine the equilibrium zzso by the frontal analysis zzso to fit the zzso data to the zzso model and then to predict zzso band profiles zzso zzso the ideal model of zzso A comparison of overloaded zzso profiles obtained with different zzso of the zzso time from its true value shows that the effect of its measurement error is significant in zzso liquid zzso because the zzso is usually strongly zzso in this zzso
