Several zzso studies in the last decade revealed that many proteins are either completely zzso or possess long structurally flexible zzso Many such regions were shown to be of functional importance, often allowing a protein to interact with a large number of diverse zzso Parallel to these findings, during the last five years structural zzso has produced an explosion of results regarding zzso interactions and their importance for cell zzso We studied the occurrence of relatively short zzso zzso loosely structured protein regions within longer, largely zzso sequences that were characterized as bound to larger zzso We call these regions molecular recognition features zzso also known as molecular recognition zzso zzso Interestingly, upon binding to their zzso zzso undergo zzso zzso Thus, in our zzso zzso represent a class of zzso region that exhibits molecular recognition and binding zzso This work extends previous research showing the importance of flexibility and disorder for molecular zzso We describe the development of a database of zzso derived from the zzso zzso Data Bank and present preliminary results of zzso analyses of these zzso Based on the structure adopted upon zzso at least three basic types of zzso are zzso zzso zzso and zzso which form zzso zzso and irregular secondary structure when bound, zzso Our data suggest that functionally significant residual structure can exist in zzso regions prior to the actual binding zzso The contribution of intrinsic protein disorder to the nature and function of zzso has also been zzso The results of this study will advance the understanding of zzso interactions and help towards the future development of useful zzso binding site zzso
