Due to the complex nature of zzso zzso zzso models can be difficult to zzso For example, zzso transport can be zzso by zzso flow, and can be further complicated by zzso zzso and degradation occurring at different rates in different soil zzso We have used the Root Zone Water Quality Model zzso to investigate these phenomena with field data that included two management conditions zzso and zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso degradation and transport were simulated using three zzso zzso models available in zzso zzso instantaneous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso includes sites with slow zzso and no zzso zzso zzso zzso includes zzso bound sites with relatively slow zzso zzso zzso input included water retention zzso from four soil zzso saturated zzso zzso from four soil depths and the zzso partition zzso The zzso parameters were zzso zzso surface crust saturated zzso zzso kinetic zzso irreversible binding parameters and zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso simulated zzso persistence was more accurate using the zzso zzso mean square error, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso models compared to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso model because of slowing zzso degradation rate with time and zzso simulating zzso flow resulted in prediction of zzso transport in zzso over the simulation period within a factor of two of that observed using all three zzso zzso zzso Moreover, little difference in simulated daily transport was observed between the three zzso zzso models, except that the zzso model substantially zzso zzso transport in zzso and zzso zzso days after application when transported zzso were relatively zzso This suggests that when zzso flow and hydrology are accurately zzso zzso transport in the field may be adequately simulated using a relatively simple, zzso zzso zzso
