A normal zzso zzso concentration for the exclusion of deep zzso zzso zzso has a low specificity in older patients and zzso zzso is often zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are evaluated in symptomatic zzso suspected for zzso with emphasis on its performance in older patients by using different zzso zzso This study includes zzso zzso suspected for having zzso The diagnostic zzso measured as sensitivity and area under the curve of the receiver operation characteristic curve is good for all zzso zzso The specificity of the zzso zzso combined with a low zzso probability varies from zzso to zzso The specificity of the three zzso zzso in patients zzso or zzso 60 years varies, however, between zzso and zzso Several zzso values in different zzso are zzso For patients zzso 60 years, the most accurate zzso value is 500 zzso for all zzso zzso For patients zzso or zzso 60 years, a threshold of 750 zzso has the best results with zzso of zzso for all zzso and specificity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso For the three zzso the number needed to test zzso decreases in both zzso of patients compared to the standard zzso A zzso level of 750 zzso for patients zzso or zzso 60 years improves the clinical performance of zzso zzso in combination with the zzso score without the loss of zzso The zzso improves substantially with an zzso zzso
