zzso can have serious consequences for patients with urgent zzso We therefore reviewed the assessment of zzso and propose an alternative weighted zzso that accounts for severity of zzso 

A systematic literature search was performed in three online databases and a search zzso An alternative zzso weighting scheme was developed zzso zzso and zzso of previous conducted reliability studies were zzso 

Kappa is the most frequently used statistic in zzso studies zzso More than half of the studies did not report the type of zzso that was zzso Linear and zzso weighted zzso values do not reflect the seriousness of zzso Several studies reported almost perfect agreement, whereas percentages of zzso ranged between zzso and zzso In all studies, zzso zzso was lower than reported zzso with a mean difference of zzso zzso zzso 

No existing studies on reliability of zzso systems account for zzso Using zzso zzso which reflects severity of zzso shows that the reliability of zzso systems is lower than zzso
