We propose a zzso method of interpreting zzso images observed in zzso zzso with the use of Oregon zzso as a fluorescent zzso We use a detailed modeling zzso based on zzso simulations that incorporate physical barriers for local zzso and, by assuming a zzso distribution of release zzso we derive the zzso of release zzso amounts and zzso zzso zzso and puff zzso We analyze a wide set of available data collected from zzso and 281 events observed in the animal and the vegetal zzso of the zzso zzso A relatively small fraction of events appear to involve zzso of two or three adjacent clusters of zzso releasing zzso In the animal hemisphere, the distribution of release currents with a mean of zzso zzso presents a maximum at zzso zzso and a rather long tail extending up to 5 zzso The overall distribution of liberated zzso amounts exhibits a dominant peak at 120 zzso a smaller peak at 375 zzso and an average of 166 zzso zzso amounts and release zzso in the vegetal zzso appear to be zzso and zzso times smaller than in the animal hemisphere, zzso zzso diameters of zzso release sites are approximately zzso zzso in the animal and approximately zzso zzso in the vegetal hemisphere, but the zzso separation between adjacent sites appears to be identical zzso zzso zzso By fitting the model to individual zzso we can estimate the quantity of liberated zzso the release zzso the orientation of the scan line, and the dimension of the corresponding release zzso
