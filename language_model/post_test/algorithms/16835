In survival analysis individuals are followed over some period and the time until the transition from an initial to a final state is of particular zzso An important tool for analyzing potential risk factors of this transition is the Cox zzso hazards zzso This model requires zzso in the study population and independence between the zzso An extension of the Cox model to deal with both, zzso zzso and clustered survival data, are frailty models zzso Different software are available for the analysis of shared frailty models such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso This makes it difficult for the user to find the appropriate tool for the specific problem under zzso To compare the performance of the aforementioned software a large simulation study was zzso zzso and limitations of the software are discussed in zzso
