The role of the primary binding zzso zzso in complexes between three different zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and their zzso protein inhibitor zzso c have been studied by free energy zzso Based on the crystal structures of zzso c in complex with zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso model of the zzso zzso K complex, a total of 57 zzso have been constructed and zzso into their host zzso The binding free energy was then calculated using molecular dynamics zzso simulations combined with the linear interaction energy zzso method for all complexes differing only in the nature of the zzso acid at the zzso zzso zzso calculations for 19 different complexes for each zzso were thus carried out excluding zzso The effects of zzso at the zzso position on the binding free energies are found to be very large, and positively charged zzso zzso zzso and zzso are particularly deleterious for all three zzso The charged zzso of the zzso side chains are found to bind more favorably as compared to their zzso states in all three zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso acids are zzso most favorably at the zzso in all three zzso zzso of the three series of binding free energies shows only minor differences in the 19 zzso relative binding free energies among these zzso This is further reflected in the correlation zzso between the 23 relative binding free energies zzso including the possible zzso states of zzso side zzso but excluding the zzso zzso for zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso versus zzso K zzso and zzso versus zzso K zzso
