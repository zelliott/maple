The shapes of zzso zzso are fascinating and important, yet the principles underlying these complex and diverse structures remain zzso Here, we analyzed zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso sampled from zzso brains and discovered 3 statistical zzso the zzso zzso size scales with the total zzso zzso the spatial correlation of zzso branches within an zzso has a universal functional form, and small parts of an zzso are zzso We proposed that these properties result from maximizing the repertoire of possible connectivity patterns between zzso and surrounding zzso while keeping the cost of zzso zzso We solved this zzso problem by drawing an zzso with zzso of the zzso for a given energy in statistical zzso The solution is consistent with the above observations and predicts zzso relations that can be tested zzso In addition, our theory explains why zzso branches of zzso cells are distributed more sparsely than those of zzso zzso Our results represent a step toward a unifying view of the relationship between zzso zzso and zzso
