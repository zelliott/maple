Conventional detection of zzso zzso is often based on frequency zzso of zzso zzso under the assumption that energy zzso of the zzso zzso is the appropriate zzso zzso detectors allow for a higher power of the zzso zzso appropriate when the signal occupies a limited but unknown subset of these zzso Shipping noise is zzso and colored and problematic for many marine zzso detection zzso zzso to the standard zzso form are introduced to minimize the effects of this zzso These same modifications also allow for a fixed detection zzso zzso to broadly varying ocean acoustic zzso The detection zzso is general enough to detect all types of zzso zzso Tests presented in this paper show this zzso matches human detection performance with an zzso small probability of false alarms zzso zzso zzso for even the zzso zzso The detector zzso energy detection techniques, providing a probability of detection zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for three acoustic zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso for two zzso zzso The generalized zzso detector also can be used for basic zzso zzso and can be adapted for other types of transient zzso
