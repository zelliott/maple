A steady increase in knowledge of the molecular and zzso structure of the zzso and zzso zzso envelope zzso zzso is yielding important new insights for vaccine design, but it has been difficult to translate this information to an zzso that elicits broadly zzso zzso To help bridge this zzso we used zzso corrected statistical methods to identify zzso acid signature patterns in zzso derived from people who have made zzso zzso zzso with the hypothesis that these zzso may share common features that would be useful for incorporation in a vaccine zzso Before attempting this, essentially as a control, we explored the utility of our zzso methods for defining signatures of complex zzso zzso by analyzing zzso sequences from 251 zzso viruses that were zzso sensitive to zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We identified ten zzso signatures, including seven either in the zzso surface of zzso or in the V2 region of zzso that have been previously shown to impact zzso zzso A simple zzso based on the zzso signature pattern was zzso of zzso zzso in an additional blinded panel of 57 zzso Upon obtaining these reassuring zzso we went on to apply these same zzso methods to define signature patterns in zzso from zzso infected individuals who had zzso broadly zzso zzso We analyzed a zzso zzso zzso with zzso from 69 zzso individuals tested against a panel of 25 different zzso zzso clusters of zzso with high and low zzso zzso were zzso Six signature positions in zzso sequences obtained from the 69 samples were found to be strongly associated with either the high or low potency zzso Five sites were in the zzso zzso binding site of zzso suggesting an important role for this region in the zzso of broadly zzso zzso responses against zzso
