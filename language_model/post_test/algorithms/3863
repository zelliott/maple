A method for quantitative analysis of zzso color to estimate the oxygen zzso was zzso The method uses an zzso and zzso system composed of a zzso video camera and a digital image zzso When the system is connected to a zzso the facilitated diffusion of oxygen in zzso solutions can be observed and analyzed in a zzso zzso The results led to a new transport model expressed zzso J zzso zzso where J is the oxygen zzso C is the zzso zzso Y is the oxygen zzso of zzso d is the distance between the entrance of oxygen and the diffusion front, and zzso is a zzso
