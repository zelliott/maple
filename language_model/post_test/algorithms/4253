zzso cardiac death is often caused by cardiac zzso Recently, special attention has been given to a certain zzso condition, the zzso syndrome, which occurs as a result of genetic zzso or drug zzso The underlying mechanisms of zzso caused by the zzso syndrome, are not fully zzso However, zzso are often connected to special zzso of cardiac cells, called early zzso zzso which are zzso during the zzso phase of the action zzso So far, zzso have been studied mainly in isolated cardiac zzso However, the question on how zzso at the zzso level can result in zzso at the tissue level, especially in human cell models, has not been widely studied zzso In this paper, we study wave patterns that result from zzso zzso dynamics in a mathematical model for human zzso cardiac zzso We induce zzso by modeling experimental conditions which have been shown to evoke zzso at a zzso zzso by an increase of zzso zzso currents and a decrease of the delayed zzso zzso zzso We show that, at the tissue level and depending on these zzso three types of abnormal wave patterns zzso We zzso them into two types of spiral zzso and one type of zzso zzso Moreover, we find that the emergent wave patterns can be driven by calcium or sodium currents and we find phase waves in the zzso zzso zzso From our simulations we predict that zzso caused by zzso can occur during normal wave propagation and do not require tissue zzso Experimental zzso of our results is possible for experiments at the zzso level, where zzso can be induced by an increase of the zzso calcium zzso and by the application of zzso see zzso blockers, and the properties of the emergent patterns can be studied by optical mapping of the zzso and zzso
