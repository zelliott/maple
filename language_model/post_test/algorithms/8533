New methods for determining chemical structures from residual zzso zzso are zzso The fundamental zzso zzso equation is converted to an elliptical equation in the principal alignment zzso This elliptical equation is then combined with other angular or zzso zzso constraints to form simple zzso equations that define discrete solutions for the unit zzso The methods are illustrated with residual zzso zzso data on zzso taken in a single zzso zzso The protein backbone is divided into its rigid groups zzso its zzso planes and zzso zzso which may be solved for zzso A simple procedure for zzso these independent solutions results in backbone zzso angles zzso and zzso that resemble those of the known native zzso zzso refinement of these zzso angles by the zzso program produces a structure of zzso that agrees with the known native structure to zzso A zzso zzso
