Using a shape analysis technique, a zzso of 79 (19 zzso and 60 zzso zzso zzso crystal structures was analyzed for the shape changes in their binding zzso The structures are reported with different bound zzso and consist of a variety of zzso Several zzso zzso based on the zzso shape function are zzso in addition to the zzso potential zzso zzso A cluster analysis is performed using the calculated zzso of the binding pocket of the proteins to investigate the effect of zzso or bound zzso on the shape of the binding pocket of zzso We observed that zzso and/or bound zzso influence the zzso shape of the binding pocket of these zzso zzso This study shows that the shape changes in the binding pocket caused by zzso or bound zzso can be zzso captured using zzso zzso and zzso zzso
