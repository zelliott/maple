To explore the diagnostic zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso alone, expressed as a ratio zzso zzso zzso and combined with the zzso In zzso zzso zzso score for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to create a new diagnostic zzso - the Clinical zzso zzso zzso score - for the diagnosis of zzso and subsequent cardiac zzso I zzso zzso in patients with acute chest pain zzso 

In this zzso prospective study, 138 patients presented at the emergency department with zzso without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were assessed by zzso zzso zzso on zzso Post hoc determination of the zzso score zzso was performed by receiver operating characteristics zzso 

The adjudicated final diagnosis was zzso in zzso zzso of zzso Both zzso alone were found to be significant zzso of zzso diagnosis, but the zzso score had the best diagnostic accuracy zzso under the curve zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso At the optimal zzso of zzso the zzso score negative zzso value zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that a zzso score zzso increased the risk of subsequent zzso diagnosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For subsequent zzso zzso only zzso zzso and zzso score displayed adequate zzso zzso with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso score, derived from adding the zzso zzso zzso ratio to the zzso score, could be a useful measure to rule out zzso in patients presenting with zzso at the emergency department without zzso zzso
