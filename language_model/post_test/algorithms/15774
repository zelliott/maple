In this study, we evaluated the action of two buffer solutions on zzso equilibrium in cases of zzso zzso zzso patients undergoing major zzso zzso surgery received 40 zzso zzso zzso of zzso saline per zzso During surgery, in every patient, zzso zzso zzso At a standard base excess of zzso zzso the patients were randomly assigned to receive within 20 zzso either a mean of 130 zzso 26 zzso of sodium zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso or a mean of 128 zzso 18 zzso of zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso serum zzso zzso standard base zzso and serum zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso total zzso and zzso were determined before and 0, 10, and 20 zzso after zzso The apparent strong zzso difference was calculated zzso serum sodium plus serum zzso minus serum zzso minus serum zzso The effective strong zzso difference and the amount of weak plasma acid were calculated by using a computer zzso Immediately after zzso standard base excess increased by zzso zzso in the zzso group and by zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In both groups, zzso and the amount of weak plasma acid remained zzso zzso because of zzso the apparent and effective strong zzso difference increased in the zzso group by zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the zzso group, the apparent strong zzso difference remained zzso however, the effective strong zzso difference increased by zzso zzso and the zzso gap decreased by zzso zzso because of the occurrence of an zzso zzso In conclusion, in case of zzso with zzso or zzso the changes in pH were accompanied by, and probably caused by, an increase in strong zzso zzso 

By comparing two groups of patients with zzso zzso zzso receiving equal doses of either sodium zzso or zzso zzso we assessed the action of both drugs on zzso zzso In case of zzso the changes in pH were accompanied by, and probably caused by, an increase in strong zzso zzso
