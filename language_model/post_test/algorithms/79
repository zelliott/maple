zzso resonance zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in a zzso phantom experiencing both zzso and zzso pressure variations were compared to those derived from an established zzso zzso zzso A zzso phantom was constructed using a silicone rubber composite of 10 zzso inner diameter and zzso zzso zzso A zzso echo zzso sequence was used to determine zzso within the phantom at zzso and zzso pressures ranging from 55 to 90 zzso Average values of zzso using zzso were obtained within a region of interest and were compared to the zzso zzso Under both zzso and zzso pressure conditions, the zzso and zzso estimates of zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso between the zzso and zzso estimates of zzso zzso zzso were zzso For both zzso and zzso pressures, zzso measures of zzso agree with those derived from a zzso model, suggesting that zzso can be used as a new, zzso method of assessing zzso in zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso
