zzso in the zzso zzso coli zzso gene are found in most zzso zzso They cause zzso zzso of zzso pathways when both zzso of the gene are zzso However studies on individuals with familial zzso zzso zzso have shown that a single zzso zzso zzso can also create changes in the zzso colon zzso like increased number of stem cells, increased zzso zzso greater zzso of DNA zzso patterns, and higher zzso zzso zzso In this paper, using a zzso model of colon zzso zzso we evolve and investigate a hypothesis on the effect of zzso zzso zzso that explains these different zzso Based on previous reports and the results from the zzso model we propose the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso has the effect of increasing the chances for a stem cell to divide zzso producing two stem cell zzso We incorporate this hypothesis into the model and perform simulation experiments to investigate the consequences of the zzso zzso show that this hypothesis links together the changes in zzso zzso observed in previous zzso The simulations also show that an zzso stem cell gets selective advantages for dominating the zzso and progressing to zzso This explains why most colon zzso are initiated by zzso zzso The results could have implications for preventing or zzso the onset of colon cancer in people with inherited or acquired zzso of one zzso zzso Experimental validation of the hypothesis as well as investigation into the molecular mechanisms of this effect may therefore be worth zzso
