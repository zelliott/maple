The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the underlying mechanism of zzso zzso influences the reliability of the zzso flow zzso zzso method to assess the zzso zzso Furthermore, the mode of imaging the flow convergence region and different correction zzso for calculation of the zzso volume were zzso 

zzso volume was assessed in 45 patients (age zzso zzso with organic zzso and functional zzso zzso zzso by the zzso flow convergence method for zzso zzso between 14 and 64 zzso using two-dimensional color zzso zzso Different correction and calculation zzso were zzso In addition, zzso volume was determined using color zzso zzso for an zzso zzso of 28 zzso The quantitative zzso method was used as zzso 

In organic zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso between the zzso flow convergence method and the reference method were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso geometric correction of the zzso volume for the zzso zzso zzso The correlation zzso zzso zzso using color zzso zzso imaging was zzso (85 zzso The corresponding values in functional zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso for two-dimensional color zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso 

The zzso volume was overestimated by the zzso flow convergence method in organic zzso zzso irrespective of the application of different correction zzso or the use of color zzso zzso A sufficiently reliable determination of the zzso volume by the zzso flow convergence method was possible in functional zzso zzso In that case a simplified calculation of the zzso volume based on the zzso flow convergence method was zzso
