zzso waves traveling throughout the zzso elicit muscle zzso responsible for pumping blood throughout the zzso The shape and direction of these waves depend on the spatial arrangement of zzso zzso termed fiber zzso In zzso studies simulating electrical wave propagation or mechanical contraction in the heart, accurately representing fiber orientation is critical so that model predictions corroborate with experimental zzso Typically, fiber orientation is assigned to heart models based on zzso zzso Imaging zzso data, yet few alternative zzso exist if zzso data is noisy or zzso Here we present a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso to perform this task with speed, precision, and high zzso We demonstrate the application of the zzso zzso in an zzso zzso model of the canine zzso zzso of electrical zzso in this model are compared to those in the same geometrical model but with zzso fiber zzso The results demonstrate that zzso patterns from simulations with zzso and zzso fiber zzso are nearly zzso with relative differences zzso absolute mean differences in zzso times zzso zzso and positive correlations zzso These results convincingly show that the zzso zzso is a robust alternative to zzso for assigning fiber orientation to zzso heart zzso
