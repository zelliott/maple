Prospective zzso 

The zzso Department and Emergency Room of a medical college zzso 

129 infants presenting to zzso Department zzso or Emergency Room zzso were assessed and classified as per zzso zzso and treatment required was zzso A detailed evaluation with all relevant investigations was also done for these zzso The final diagnoses made and therapies instituted on this basis served as zzso zzso The diagnostic and therapeutic agreement between zzso standard and the zzso was zzso 

More than one illness was present in zzso of subjects as per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso having any referral criteria as per zzso zzso had a greater zzso zzso of illnesses zzso zzso zzso zzso illnesses per child, zzso zzso zzso covered majority zzso of the recorded diagnoses either partly zzso or fully zzso The referral criteria proved quite sensitive zzso in predicting hospitalization but had a lower specificity zzso a total agreement with zzso was found in zzso zzso The mismatch zzso was more commonly of overdiagnosis zzso rather than zzso zzso The sensitivity of the zzso to identify serious bacterial infection was high zzso while the specificity was relatively low zzso zzso Upper respiratory infection zzso as an important cause resulting in unnecessary referrals (13 out of 21 zzso Of the 43 cases identified as zzso by the algorithm, 6 had breast fed stools, which do not require any zzso The zzso zzso had a provision for preventive services of zzso and zzso counseling zzso possibility of zzso missed opportunities in zzso 

There is a sound scientific basis for adopting zzso approach even in young infants as there is a need to improve the specificity of referral zzso Two important conditions identified for possible refinement are zzso and breast fed stools
