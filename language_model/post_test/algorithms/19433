The paper reports a zzso based approach for predicting the zzso structures of full length zzso protein zzso We have created a database of templates that includes structures of zzso zzso complexes as well as zzso structures zzso which allowed us to expand the template pool up to zzso zzso entries (at zzso sequence zzso Two protocols were zzso protocol based on position specific zzso search zzso and a protocol based on structural similarity of zzso zzso All possible combinations of two zzso zzso zzso in the zzso database were subjected to both protocols to predict if they form zzso The predictions were zzso against the zzso database resulting to zzso zzso ratios of approximately zzso and approximately zzso and recovery of zzso and zzso respectively for protocols I and zzso From zzso trials zzso made only approximately 500 wrong predictions resulting to zzso zzso In addition, though it was shown that artificially created zzso structures can in principle be good templates for modeling full length protein complexes, more sensitive methods are needed to detect zzso zzso The quality of the models was assessed using two different criteria such as zzso zzso and overall zzso It was found that there is no correlation between these two zzso In many cases the interface zzso were predicted correctly, but the overall zzso was over 6 A and vice zzso
