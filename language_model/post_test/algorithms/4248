Health care quality is frequently described with measures representing the overall performance of a health care zzso Despite the growing attention to overuse of health care resources, there is little experience with zzso measures of zzso 

To identify a set of possible indicators of overuse that can be zzso with claims data and to describe variation in these indicators across the hospital referral regions zzso 

Using an environmental zzso we identified published descriptions of overused zzso We assessed each zzso feasibility for measurement with claims and developed zzso for zzso of procedures in patients unlikely to zzso Using a zzso sample of Medicare claims from 2008, we calculated summary statistics to illustrate zzso in the use across zzso 

A total of zzso procedures were identified as zzso 20 had abundant frequency and zzso to be possible measures of systematic zzso These included 13 diagnostic tests, 2 tests for zzso 1 for monitoring, and 4 therapeutic zzso The usage varied markedly across zzso For zzso 1 zzso used zzso zzso for zzso diagnosis in 80 of 1000 beneficiaries zzso usage across zzso was zzso Among zzso beneficiaries, zzso had at least one overuse event zzso zzso 

We identified a set of overused procedures that may be used as measures of overuse and that demonstrate significant zzso in their zzso The implication is that an index of overuse might be built from these indicators that would reveal systematic patterns of overuse within zzso zzso these indicators may be valuable in the quality improvement zzso
