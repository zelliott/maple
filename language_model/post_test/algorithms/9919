zzso is a human zzso stimulating factor zzso The biological activity of zzso is identical to that of zzso zzso It controls zzso production within the bone zzso by stimulating the zzso differentiation and survival of zzso zzso cells and some zzso function zzso The purpose of this work is to propose a zzso drug disposition zzso model of zzso 

A zzso population zzso model was developed to account for zzso zzso as a mechanism for zzso disposition of zzso Time profiles of serum zzso zzso following subcutaneous doses of zzso 5 and 10 zzso and intravenous infusion of 5 zzso over zzso hour were zzso The zzso model included zzso elimination from the serum, zzso zzso turnover of free receptors and zzso of zzso zzso The proposed zzso drug disposition models served as a tool to study drug zzso and the impact of zzso binding on zzso zzso 

zzso was found to exhibit parallel zzso with zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of zzso The majority of the drug zzso was absorbed by zzso zzso presumably through the zzso zzso The equilibrium zzso constant zzso was estimated as zzso zzso 

The proposed model predicts that clearance is initially mostly governed by the binding of zzso to zzso zzso zzso the clearance slows down because of the zzso of binding sites, and occurs mostly via the linear zzso zzso Finally, for zzso zzso lower than the zzso zzso clearance zzso The presented zzso model adequately describes zzso serum zzso and zzso the role of zzso binding in zzso zzso
