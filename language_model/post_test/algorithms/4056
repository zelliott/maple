Image zzso is, in general, an zzso problem and additional constraints need to be imposed in order to achieve the desired zzso zzso While zzso zzso in medical images, which is the topic of this paper, a significant amount of prior knowledge about the shape, appearance, and location of the zzso is available that can be used to zzso the solution space of the zzso zzso Among the various types of prior information, the incorporation of prior information about shape, in particular, is very zzso In this paper, we present an explicit zzso zzso zzso evolution method for the zzso of zzso in zzso medical zzso Specifically, we represent the zzso zzso explicitly as a chain of control zzso We then cast the zzso problem as a zzso evolution problem, wherein the evolution of the zzso is performed by zzso solving a zzso labeling zzso The evolution of the zzso is governed by three types of prior information, zzso zzso appearance zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso shape zzso each of which is incorporated as zzso zzso into the zzso zzso We use the zzso dual decomposition framework to solve the zzso labeling problem in each zzso In our experiments, we demonstrate the application of the proposed method to the challenging problem of heart zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso
