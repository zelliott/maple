To date, no tool exists to predict zzso at radical zzso zzso in patients with zzso prostate cancer zzso after surgery for benign zzso zzso zzso We aimed to fill this gap by developing a zzso zzso to assist zzso when incidental zzso is diagnosed and a clinical decision is zzso 

We analyzed 158 zzso prostate zzso patients who underwent zzso between 1996 and zzso A risk zzso tool was developed applying the tree modeling technique of zzso and zzso tree analysis zzso and relying on all the available zzso characteristics zzso zzso zzso zzso before zzso zzso after zzso zzso stage, prostate volume and zzso sum at zzso Then, the accuracy of the proposed model using 200 zzso zzso for internal validation was zzso 

A total of 95 patients zzso were stage zzso and 63 zzso were stage zzso The median values of zzso before and after zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso A total of 22 patients zzso showed no residual tumor zzso at zzso The zzso analyses identified three groups at risk of having residual disease at zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso before zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso before zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The accuracy of the proposed model was zzso Clinical stage zzso vs zzso was not associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Clinical stage zzso vs zzso assessment does not help in predicting zzso zzso An accurate and clinically useful zzso to predict zzso at zzso after incidental prostate cancer diagnosis is provided zzso
