zzso zzso is a feared complication to insulin treated zzso zzso awareness of zzso zzso increases the risk of severe zzso zzso changes are demonstrated during daytime zzso In this zzso study, we test the hypothesis that specific zzso zzso occur during sleep and are zzso in time for the patient to take zzso 

Ten patients with type 1 diabetes zzso zzso zzso with zzso were exposed to zzso zzso during the daytime and during zzso zzso was recorded and analyzed real-time by an automated zzso zzso Participants received an auditory alarm when zzso changes met a zzso zzso and were instructed to consume a zzso 

Seven out of eight participants developed zzso zzso changes during zzso During sleep, nine out of ten developed zzso changes zzso zzso zzso zzso Eight were awakened by the zzso Four corrected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while four zzso zzso zzso zzso received zzso zzso Two had false zzso zzso occurred irrespective of sleep zzso Post hoc improvement indicates the possibility of earlier detection of zzso 

Continuous zzso monitoring and automated real-time analysis may constitute a novel technique for a zzso alarm in patients with zzso
