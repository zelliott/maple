zzso models describe the linear correlation structure of data and have been used to establish zzso relationships among zzso in genetic mapping zzso Data are typically collected at a single point in zzso Biological processes on the other hand are often zzso and display time varying zzso The extent to which zzso models can zzso the architecture of an underlying biological processes is not well zzso We consider zzso networks with known zzso to address the fundamental question: zzso can zzso networks tell us about zzso zzso Using data from an zzso zzso see zzso population and simulated data from dynamic models of zzso zzso we assess our ability to reconstruct zzso pathways using zzso zzso Our results highlight the necessity of zzso residual biological variation for reliable zzso Recovery of the ordering within a zzso is possible, but should not be zzso zzso zzso is sensitive to subtle patterns in the correlation structure that may be driven by a variety of factors, which may not emphasize the zzso zzso We illustrate the effects of zzso zzso architecture, zzso and zzso variation on correlation structure and zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso models should be interpreted cautiously, especially if the implied zzso relationships are to be used in the design of intervention zzso
