zzso technology and society are full of complexity arising from the intricate web of the interactions among the units of the related systems zzso zzso computers, zzso zzso one of the most successful recent approaches to capturing the fundamental features of the structure and dynamics of complex systems has been the investigation of the networks associated with the above units zzso together with their relations zzso Most complex systems have an inherently zzso organization and, zzso the networks behind them also exhibit zzso zzso Indeed, several papers have been devoted to describing this essential aspect of networks, however, without resulting in a widely accepted, zzso concept concerning the quantitative characterization of the level of their zzso Here we develop an approach and propose a quantity zzso which is simple enough to be widely zzso reveals a number of universal features of the organization of real-world networks and, as we zzso is capable of capturing the essential features of the structure and the degree of hierarchy in a complex zzso The measure we introduce is based on a zzso of the zzso zzso which we first extend to zzso directed zzso Then, we define the global reaching zzso zzso which is the difference between the maximum and the average value of the generalized reach zzso over the zzso We investigate the behavior of the zzso considering both a synthetic model with an adjustable level of hierarchy and real zzso zzso for real networks show that our hierarchy measure is related to the zzso of the given zzso We also propose a zzso procedure for large complex networks that can be used to obtain an overall qualitative picture about the nature of their zzso zzso
