Fluorescence lifetime imaging zzso zzso is a method for measuring zzso lifetimes with microscopic spatial resolution, providing a useful tool for cell biologists to zzso zzso and investigate structure and function of biological zzso In this chapter, we begin by introducing the basic theory of zzso zzso including the characteristics of zzso zzso followed by a discussion of factors affecting zzso lifetimes and the potential advantages of zzso lifetime as a source of image zzso Experimental methods for creating lifetime zzso including both zzso and zzso experimental approaches, are then zzso Then, zzso data analysis methods are discussed, including rapid lifetime determination, zzso fitting, zzso zzso fitting, and zzso plot zzso zzso data analysis methods are introduced that improve lifetime precision of zzso maps based upon optimal virtual gating and total variation zzso The chapter concludes by highlighting several recent zzso applications for quantitative biological imaging, including zzso resonance energy zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso and zzso
