zzso animal abundance in industrial scale batches of ground meat is important for mapping meat products through the manufacturing process and for effectively tracing the finished product during a food safety zzso The processing of ground beef involves a potentially large number of animals from diverse sources in a single product zzso which produces a high zzso in capture zzso In order to estimate animal abundance through DNA profiling of ground beef constituents, two zzso statistical models were developed for zzso zzso zzso were applied to evaluate the maximum likelihood estimate zzso of a joint likelihood function from multiple surveys, showing superiority in the presence of high capture zzso with small sample sizes, or comparable zzso in the presence of low capture zzso with a large sample size when compared to other existing zzso Our model employs the full information on the pattern of the zzso zzso from multiple zzso We applied the proposed models to estimate animal abundance in six manufacturing beef zzso zzso using 30 single zzso zzso zzso zzso from a large scale beef grinding zzso zzso show that between zzso animals were present in six manufacturing beef zzso These estimates are zzso as a reference for improving recall processes and tracing finished meat products back to zzso
