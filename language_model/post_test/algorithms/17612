This paper presents and proves an zzso to calculate the zzso composition of individual zzso zzso zzso From this information one can calculate the accurate masses of zzso zzso This opens the way to use accurate mass zzso to determine chemical compositions of compounds using zzso zzso The zzso is zzso efficient and rigorously correct in the absence of zzso zzso zzso effective error correction strategies are described to detect and correct zzso errors arising in practical zzso zzso from theoretical calculations of zzso masses for a krypton inclusion complex agreed well with experimental zzso
