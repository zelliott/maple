zzso alignment is useful in identifying members of zzso zzso tools are all based on the secondary structures of the zzso There is evidence showing that zzso interactions (the interaction between a zzso zzso and a zzso in triple zzso structures are critical in some functions of zzso In this article, we address the problem of structural alignment of zzso with the triple zzso We provide a formal definition to capture a simplified model of a triple zzso structure, then develop an zzso of zzso time to align a query sequence (of length zzso with known triple zzso structure with a target sequence (of length zzso with an unknown zzso The resulting zzso is shown to be useful in identifying zzso members in a simulated zzso
