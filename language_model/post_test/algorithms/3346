zzso of evaluating and comparing the performance of diagnostic tests are of increasing importance as new tests are developed and zzso When a test is based on an observed variable that lies on a continuous or graded scale, an assessment of the overall value of the test can be made through the use of a receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso The curve is constructed by varying the zzso used to determine which values of the observed variable will be considered abnormal and then plotting the resulting sensitivities against the corresponding false positive zzso When two or more empirical zzso are constructed based on tests performed on the same individuals, statistical analysis on differences between zzso must take into account the correlated nature of the zzso This paper presents a zzso approach to the analysis of areas under correlated zzso curves, by using the theory on generalized zzso to generate an estimated zzso zzso
