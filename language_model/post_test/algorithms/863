We developed a network model in an attempt to characterize zzso of tissue elasticity of the zzso The model includes a parallel set of zzso each consisting of an airway resistance, an airway zzso and a tissue element connected in zzso The airway resistance, airway zzso and the zzso of the tissue elements were the same in each pathway, whereas the tissue zzso zzso followed a zzso distribution between a minimum and zzso To test the model, we measured the input zzso of the respiratory system of zzso normal and zzso zzso mice in closed chest condition at four levels of positive zzso zzso zzso zzso was developed by zzso zzso pancreatic zzso zzso (30 zzso zzso 6 zzso Respiratory mechanics were studied 3 zzso following the initial zzso The model significantly improved the fitting error compared with a zzso zzso The zzso treatment was associated with an increase in mean zzso diameter and a decrease in zzso zzso and mean zzso The zzso of variation of H was significantly larger in zzso zzso than that in control zzso These results indicate that zzso treatment resulted in increased zzso zzso associated with a wider distribution of zzso The zzso of zzso size zzso and zzso was also larger in zzso suggesting that the zzso tissue zzso zzso may reflect the underlying zzso of the zzso zzso
