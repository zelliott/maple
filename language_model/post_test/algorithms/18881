The effect of the molecular environment and the temperature dependence of zzso parameters in first principles calculations in zzso and zzso crystal zzso have been zzso More specifically, we show how zzso zzso zzso cluster in zzso zzso calculations, commonly used today, zzso from more advanced molecular dynamics calculations at the experimental temperature using periodic boundary zzso From the latter approach, more useful information can be zzso allowing us to ascertain the zzso of proposed molecular zzso
