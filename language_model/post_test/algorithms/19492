A method is presented for reconstruction of the optical zzso zzso from transmission zzso data with a zzso zzso As it is distinct from other available schemes such as zzso or Newton's zzso method, this method resolves the inverse problem by solving a boundary value problem for a zzso zzso zzso It is demonstrated in zzso studies that this technique has a better than average stability with respect to the zzso between the initial guess and the actual unknown zzso zzso The method is particularly useful for reconstruction from a large data set obtained from a zzso zzso Several zzso reconstruction examples are zzso
