Reliable cardiac output monitoring is particularly useful in the zzso patient undergoing liver transplant surgery, because zzso of the liver is associated with a zzso and high output state, known as zzso zzso that challenges the reliability of pulse zzso cardiac output zzso The zzso of the zzso in zzso is impaired, which is tolerated even though the ejection fraction and cardiac output are elevated because of the low peripheral zzso However, during surgery the zzso patient can zzso because of the zzso changes and stress of zzso Recently, we showed that the zzso failed to perform in zzso patients undergoing transplant zzso In response, the company upgraded their zzso zzso we have assessed the accuracy and reliability of this new third-generation zzso zzso zzso zzso software in the same zzso 

The cardiac index was measured simultaneously by zzso zzso zzso using a pulmonary artery zzso and pulse zzso analysis, using the zzso zzso Readings were made at 10 time points during and after liver transplant surgery in 21 zzso Comparisons with data from our 2009 study, which used second-generation zzso zzso software, were also zzso 

Our new data show that version zzso software significantly reduced the adverse effect on pulse zzso cardiac output reading bias in low peripheral resistance states, and thus improves the overall precision and zzso ability of the zzso zzso analysis between zzso and zzso showed that the correlation was moderate zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso The zzso and Altman analysis showed that bias was zzso zzso zzso zzso and the percentage error was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso zzso ability of the new software also was improved but was still well below the current zzso 

The new software zzso zzso provided substantial improvements over the previous versions with better overall precision and zzso zzso Further zzso refinements will increase this zzso reliability to be extensively used in the highly complex setting of zzso patients undergoing liver zzso
