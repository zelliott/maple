We study the problem of finding a path that joins a given initial state with a final one, where the evolution is governed by classical zzso zzso A new zzso for the zzso of long time transition zzso connecting two zzso is zzso In particular, a strategy for finding transition paths between two stable zzso is zzso The starting point is the zzso of the equation of motion of classical mechanics in the framework of zzso zzso a zzso procedure inspired by zzso method is then applied to find zzso zzso zzso examples are given for zzso potential and the zzso reaction zzso + H zzso H + zzso
