The majority of existing real-time zzso shape measurement systems only generate zzso texture zzso having zzso other than ambient zzso that zzso shadow related zzso This paper presents a method that can simultaneously capture natural zzso color texture and zzso shape in real zzso Specifically, we use an infrared fringe projection system to acquire zzso shapes, and a secondary color camera to simultaneously capture zzso color images of the zzso Finally, we develop a flexible and simple zzso technique to determine the mapping between the zzso color image and the zzso zzso Experimental results demonstrate the success of the proposed zzso
