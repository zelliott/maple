Recent discovery in tumor development indicates that the tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in cancer zzso To understand how the tumor zzso zzso interacts with the zzso we explore the correlation of the gene expressions between tumor and zzso The tumor and zzso gene expression data are modeled as a weighted zzso network zzso zzso zzso where the weight of an edge indicates the correlation between the expression profiles of the corresponding tumor gene and zzso zzso In order to efficiently mine this weighted zzso network, we developed the zzso zzso zzso Mining zzso zzso and we show that the zzso zzso can efficiently mine weighted zzso networks for dense zzso zzso zzso with density zzso 

We applied zzso to the zzso zzso network and find zzso zzso that demonstrate statistical significance in survival zzso A good number of these zzso demonstrate strong prognosis powers on at least one breast cancer patient zzso which suggests that these zzso are potential zzso for breast cancer zzso Further study on these zzso zzso by the network merging approach reveals that they form 10 zzso zzso networks which show orchestrated key biological processes in both tumor and zzso In addition, by further examining the zzso that are significant in zzso breast cancer patient zzso we discovered a zzso C zzso gene network that demonstrates strong prognosis power in nearly all types of breast cancer zzso we used in this zzso 

The results support our hypothesis that the zzso gene network plays an important role in breast cancer prognosis and therapy and it is a potential zzso zzso for multiple breast cancer zzso
