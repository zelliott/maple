Block coding based on the discrete zzso transform zzso is very popular in image and video zzso zzso can be attached to a zzso block coding system to improve coding efficiency as well as to mitigate blocking zzso Previously designed zzso are zzso to maximize coding efficiency zzso For image and video communication over unreliable channels, those zzso are sensitive to transmission zzso This paper addresses the problem of designing zzso which are more error zzso Reconstruction performance is measured by how low the average reconstruction error is, and how zzso the reconstruction error is zzso A family of zzso is designed to provide desired tradeoffs between coding efficiency and zzso to transmission zzso zzso show that these filtering operators can achieve superior reconstruction performance without sacrificing much coding zzso
