A method for modeling large-scale zzso of protein zzso connected by a zzso or a zzso zzso is zzso zzso proteins may undergo substantial domain zzso while their zzso structure remains essentially zzso The method allows automatic identification of an zzso zzso and builds an zzso model of a protein structure in internal zzso zzso angles belonging to the zzso zzso and side chains potentially able to form domain zzso are set free while remaining zzso bond zzso and bond angles are zzso zzso sampling of the reduced zzso zzso zzso is zzso with the zzso probability zzso zzso method zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso contributions are added to the energy zzso A special procedure has been developed to generate concerted zzso of a zzso zzso zzso in such a way that the zzso chain continuity is zzso The method was tested on zzso protein with a zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein with a zzso zzso For each zzso structurally diverse low-energy zzso with ideal zzso geometry were generated, and an overlap between two sets of zzso generated starting from the zzso determined zzso and zzso forms was zzso One of the low-energy zzso generated in a run starting from the zzso zzso form was only zzso A away from the structure of the zzso zzso The method can be useful in predicting the scope of possible domain zzso of a zzso zzso
