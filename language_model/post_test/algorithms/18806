Despite many zzso traditional sequencing technologies have proven to be invaluable in modern medical research, even when the targeted zzso are highly zzso While it is often known in such cases that multiple slightly different sequences are present in the analyzed sample in zzso that vary dramatically, the traditional techniques typically allow only the most dominant strain to be extracted from a single zzso These limitations made some research directions rather difficult to zzso For example, the analysis of zzso evolution (including the emergence of drug zzso in a single patient is expected to benefit from a comprehensive catalog of the patient's zzso zzso In this paper, we show how the new generation of sequencing technologies, based on high zzso of short reads, can be used to link site zzso and reconstruct multiple full strains of the targeted zzso including those of low concentration in the zzso Our zzso is based on a zzso model of the sequencing process, and uses a tailored zzso zzso and learning procedure to fit the model to the obtained zzso
