The results of recent studies concerning statistical bone zzso and automated shape analysis are promising with a view to widening the use of surface models in orthopedic clinical practice, both in zzso planning and in the zzso zzso In this domain, automatic shape analysis is strongly advocated because it offers the opportunity to detect zzso and clinical landmarks with superior zzso in comparison to human zzso Surface zzso have been proposed extensively for zzso and labeling of image and surface regions based on their appearance and zzso The surface zzso is an zzso that can be exploited for reliable detection of geometric zzso In this paper, we investigate the zzso of the zzso termed zzso zzso as applied to a zzso combination of the minimum and maximum zzso of a zzso We exploited a sensitivity analysis of the zzso parameters across increasing surface zzso zzso obtained with zzso and pelvic bone surface data, reconstructed from zzso CT scans, demonstrated that the information content derived by the zzso zzso zzso overcomes both the mean and the zzso zzso and the original zzso zzso By applying a zzso zzso zzso to the zzso distribution, we found that the number of clusters yielded by the zzso zzso zzso is significantly lower (by a factor of up to 6) than that obtained by using the original zzso zzso In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the use of surface zzso for automatic shape zzso
