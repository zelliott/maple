zzso radiation can damage cells by breaking both strands of DNA in multiple locations, essentially cutting zzso into zzso The cell has zzso mechanisms to repair such breaks; however, these mechanisms are imperfect and, in an exchange process, may produce a large-scale zzso of the zzso called a zzso zzso zzso aberrations are important in killing cells, during zzso in characterizing zzso zzso in retrospective radiation zzso and in a number of other zzso DNA zzso techniques such as zzso zzso fluorescent in zzso zzso provide a means for analyzing aberration zzso by examining observed final zzso Unfortunately, an zzso observed final pattern often does not uniquely determine the underlying exchange zzso Further, resolution limitations in the painting protocol sometimes lead to apparently incomplete final zzso We here describe an zzso for systematically finding exchange processes consistent with any observed final zzso This zzso uses aberration zzso a mathematical zzso that links the various aspects of aberration zzso By applying a measure to the space of consistent zzso we will show how to generate zzso zzso of aberration processes from zzso experimental zzso The approach is implemented by software freely available over the zzso As a sample application, we apply these zzso to an aberration data set, obtaining a distribution of exchange cycle sizes, which serves to measure aberration zzso zzso complexity, in turn, helps indicate how damaging the aberrations are and may facilitate identification of radiation type in retrospective zzso
