The objective of this work is to evaluate zzso impact of zzso balloon zzso rotation in zzso zzso zzso for breast zzso zzso zzso dose distribution was generated for patients A and B, depending upon zzso proximity to skin and zzso Both skin and rib spacing was zzso zzso zzso for zzso only rib spacing was zzso zzso zzso for zzso Thirty-five rotation scenarios were simulated for each patient by rotating outer zzso every zzso over zzso zzso range with respect to central zzso using zzso calculated zzso zzso Thirty-five rotated plans were compared with three plans: 1) original zzso zzso zzso plan, 2) zzso zzso zzso plan, and 3) zzso zzso zzso zzso For plan comparison, planning target volume for evaluation zzso coverage zzso to zzso and zzso volume of zzso zzso and zzso skin and rib zzso dose zzso and normal breast tissue volume receiving zzso zzso and zzso zzso of prescribed dose zzso were zzso zzso variation due to device rotation ranged from zzso to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso for skin zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso of zzso for rib zzso zzso zzso breast tissue zzso and zzso variation was zzso zzso zzso except for zzso to zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso device rotation increased rib zzso over zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso rotation and zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso For a highly zzso dose distribution, device rotation can outweigh the potential benefit of improved dose shaping capability afforded by zzso and make zzso data worse than zzso plans unless it is properly zzso
