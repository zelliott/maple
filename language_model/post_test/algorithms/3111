zzso structures have proven to be a crucial piece of information for biomedical zzso Of the millions of currently zzso proteins only a small fraction is zzso solved for structure and the only feasible way to bridge the gap between sequence and structure data is zzso zzso Half a century has passed since it was shown that the zzso acid sequence of a protein determines its shape, but a method to translate the sequence code reliably into the zzso structure still remains to be zzso This review summarizes modern protein structure prediction techniques with the emphasis on comparative zzso and describes the recent advances in methods for theoretical model quality zzso
