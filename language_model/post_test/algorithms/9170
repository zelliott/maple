Although quantities derived from zzso accessible surface areas zzso are useful in many applications in protein design and structural biology, the zzso cost of accurate zzso calculation makes zzso scores difficult to integrate into commonly used protein design zzso We demonstrate a method for maintaining accurate zzso during a zzso Carlo search of sequence and zzso space for a fixed protein zzso We extend the fast Le Grand and zzso zzso zzso Grand and zzso J zzso zzso 14, zzso which zzso the zzso accessible surface for each atom by placing dots on a sphere and combines zzso masks to determine which dots are zzso By replacing zzso operations with group operations (from zzso logic to counting dot zzso we support zzso zzso Our zzso takes time zzso to the number of atoms affected by zzso zzso rather than the number of atoms in the zzso For design simulations with a one hundred zzso protein our approach is approximately 145 times faster than performing a Le Grand and zzso zzso calculation from scratch following each zzso zzso To demonstrate practical effectiveness, we zzso a zzso measure of protein packing in the complete redesign of a large set of proteins and zzso zzso
