One of the major zzso of the human zzso project relates to the investigation of the molecular mechanisms of zzso Identification of genes which are involved in a specific pathological process and characterization of their interactions is of fundamental importance for supporting the drug design zzso Discovery of targets and the related experimental validation is a critical step in the development of new zzso The new experimental methods for gene expression analysis, such as zzso technology, allows for the concurrent evaluation of the expression of multiple zzso The outcome of these new experimental methods requires a subsequent validation of the gene function by using in zzso or in zzso zzso In the last decade, one of the most promising zzso for the investigation of gene function relies upon zzso zzso zzso The crucial step in zzso experiment design is the characterization of the zzso zzso that can efficiently be targeted by this kind of synthetic zzso At present, no standardized procedures for target selection are zzso In this paper, we propose an zzso approach to zzso target zzso the proposed tool Automatic Gene Walk zzso combines a neural filter with database mining for the prediction of the optimal target for zzso zzso
