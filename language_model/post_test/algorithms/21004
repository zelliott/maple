A simple zzso approach to phase space analysis of the performance of zzso optical zzso zzso combining several elements in zzso space is zzso The mathematical description of a large class of optical elements commonly used on zzso zzso has been reviewed and extended with respect to the existing literature and is reported in a revised zzso Novel features are introduced, in particular, the possibility to account for imperfections on mirror surfaces and to incorporate zzso devices like zzso zzso in advanced zzso zzso using the same zzso zzso Phase space analysis results of the simulation of an zzso zzso with focusing zzso at the European zzso zzso Facility compare favorably with results obtained by geometric zzso methods and, more importantly, with experimental zzso This approach has been implemented into a simple and zzso program zzso for optical calculations based on the zzso software zzso
