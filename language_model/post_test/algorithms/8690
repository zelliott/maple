The zzso of the zzso method for measuring local cerebral zzso zzso zzso has been extended for use in zzso by determination of the values of the lumped constant to be used in rats with plasma zzso zzso ranging from approximately 2 to 6 zzso zzso constant values were higher in zzso and declined from a value of zzso at the lowest zzso plasma zzso level zzso zzso to about zzso in zzso The distribution of zzso and therefore also of the lumped constant, was found to remain relatively uniform throughout the brain at the lowest plasma zzso levels zzso zzso in moderate, zzso zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso concentration zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined with the appropriate lumped constant corresponding to the zzso plasma zzso concentration and compared with the results obtained in six zzso zzso The weighted average rate of zzso zzso for the brain as a whole was significantly depressed by zzso in the zzso animals, zzso 61 zzso zzso in zzso compared to 71 zzso zzso in the zzso controls zzso less than zzso zzso was lower in 47 of 49 structures examined but statistically significantly below the rate in zzso rats in only six structures zzso less than zzso by multiple comparison zzso zzso within the zzso were most prominently zzso The greatest zzso statistically significant or not, occurred in structures in which zzso zzso is normally high, suggesting that zzso delivery and transport to the tissue became zzso first in those structures with the greatest zzso demands for zzso
