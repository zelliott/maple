A technique has been developed zzso motion can be detected in real time during the acquisition of zzso This enables the zzso of several zzso to reduce or eliminate motion effects from an image as it is being zzso One such zzso previously described is the zzso zzso This paper deals with another real-time zzso called the diminishing zzso zzso zzso With this method, a complete set of preliminary data is acquired along with information about the relative motion position of each frame of zzso After all the preliminary data are acquired, the position information is used to determine which data frames are most corrupted by zzso zzso of data are then zzso starting with the most corrupted zzso The position information is continually updated in an zzso process; therefore, each subsequent zzso is always done on the worst frame of zzso The zzso has been implemented on several different types of zzso zzso in zzso studies indicate that motion artifacts are dramatically zzso
