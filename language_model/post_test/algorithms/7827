The detection of growth hormone zzso abuse by athletes raises statistical problems as well as zzso zzso We outline the statistical approaches to the various issues which have arisen during the work of the zzso and zzso zzso in particular, it considers the need to develop a test which detects zzso abuse in any elite athlete zzso reasonable zzso The test needs to be robust enough to withstand legal challenge, while zzso the risk of false zzso The paper identifies various issues which arise in the development of such a test, and describes how these were zzso Since zzso is a naturally occurring hormone whose concentration varies zzso its abuse cannot be detected by direct zzso The methodology considered here made use of markers whose levels are more stable but are influenced by zzso The statistical methods employed aimed to make the best use of these zzso taking account of all factors contributing to errors in zzso There were two key steps in the statistical investigation undertaken to develop the zzso detection zzso The first was the requirement to identify zzso zzso which would identify zzso doping reliably and robustly for a significant length of zzso The second was to zzso the zzso detection method in the elite athlete population, so that the method would be zzso to all athletes, regardless of age, sex and ethnicity, and regardless of whether they had recently sustained an zzso In practice, further work was needed to ensure that the methodology met the WADA testing protocol rules, but also that the proposed method can be used by any WADA zzso lab without placing any athlete at an unfair disadvantage and ensuring a high level of confidence in any result zzso
