zzso array zzso are commonly used to perform zzso quality assurance procedures, which makes them highly desirable for measuring transit zzso for in zzso dose zzso The purpose of this study was to determine if an in zzso dose reconstruction via transit zzso using a zzso array dosimeter was zzso To test the accuracy of measuring transit dose distribution using a zzso array zzso we evaluated it against the zzso made using zzso chamber and zzso film zzso profiles for various air gap distances zzso from the exit side of the solid water zzso to the detector distance; 0 zzso 30 zzso 40 zzso 50 zzso and 60 zzso and solid water slab thicknesses (10 zzso and 20 zzso The zzso dose reconstruction zzso was described and zzso The agreement between the zzso chamber and zzso profiles for the transit dose distribution zzso ranged from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using the zzso dose reconstruction algorithm, we found that, of the six zzso fields, four had a zzso gamma index passing rate zzso zzso gamma index zzso and two had gamma index passing rates of zzso and zzso Of the five zzso fields, three had a zzso gamma index passing rate, and two had gamma index passing rates of zzso and zzso It was found that a zzso array dosimeter could be used for zzso dose reconstruction for in zzso zzso
