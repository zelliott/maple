zzso mixture factor analysis provides a zzso model to explore zzso group structures of zzso zzso In this modeling zzso we can explore zzso structures for continuous zzso However, zzso items are often used to define zzso zzso in zzso This paper proposes an extended finite mixture factor analysis model with zzso to model mixed continuous and zzso zzso We use a zzso Carlo zzso zzso zzso to estimate the zzso In the E step, zzso solutions are not available for the conditional expectation of complete data log likelihood, so it is zzso by sample means, which are in turn generated by the Gibbs zzso from the joint conditional distribution of zzso zzso To monitor the convergence of the zzso algorithm, we use bridge sampling to calculate the log likelihood ratio of two successive zzso We adopt a diagnostic plot of the log likelihood ratio against zzso for monitoring the convergence of the zzso zzso We compare different models based on zzso in which we approximate the observed data log likelihood by using a zzso Carlo zzso We investigate the zzso properties of the zzso zzso by simulation zzso We use a real data example to illustrate the practical usefulness of the zzso Finally, we discuss limitations and possible zzso
