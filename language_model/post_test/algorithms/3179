The polar zzso drug zzso is front-line treatment for chronic zzso C virus zzso The human zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso into zzso where it is zzso These zzso zzso accumulate in the zzso and produce zzso zzso zzso Here, we examined the in zzso and ex zzso transport and metabolism of zzso by zzso isolated from humans and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher zzso zzso 255 zzso zzso into zzso from zzso mice compared with that from zzso mice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results showed a zzso zzso of 382 zzso zzso zzso transport of zzso into zzso from zzso zzso We found that zzso concentration rapidly zzso 60 zzso reached equilibrium in zzso using a time course of zzso transport zzso zzso and metabolism in mouse and human zzso for 8 zzso However, total zzso of zzso was predominantly attributed to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our findings allow us to estimate zzso zzso zzso and zzso clearance and to predict in zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso of both mice and zzso Our modeling of zzso in zzso on long-term administration of zzso suggests that the zzso of zzso inside the cells is dependent on zzso transport and the rates of zzso zzso and the degradation of the zzso zzso We predict that zzso and zzso mice will serve as excellent models to investigate the contribution of zzso to the zzso and toxicity of zzso in zzso
