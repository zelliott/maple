This paper describes an automatic method for zzso the control for a neural zzso zzso that could augment elbow zzso and zzso zzso in persons with zzso The basis for the control was a synergistic model of reaching and grasping that uses zzso and spatial synergies between the arm and body zzso The synergies were determined from the movement data measured in nondisabled persons during the performance of functional zzso The work space was divided into six zzso distance zzso zzso and zzso (three zzso zzso basis function artificial neural networks zzso zzso were used to determine zzso zzso of zzso ANN characterized with good zzso were selected as control laws for elbow zzso and zzso zzso The validation was performed for three zzso zzso distance, and zzso zzso For all of the defined spatial synergies, the correlation was high for zzso and distance, yet low for the zzso zzso This suggests the necessity for implementing different maps for different directions, but the same maps for different zzso The natural movements of the upper arm then drive the lower arm zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a way that is very well suited for the administration of functional electrical therapy zzso in persons with zzso soon after the onset of zzso
