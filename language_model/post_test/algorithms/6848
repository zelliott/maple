Development of methods for mathematical simulation of biological systems and building specific simulations is an important trend of zzso zzso Here we describe the method of generalized zzso simulation generating flexible and adequate simulations of various biological zzso zzso simulations of complex zzso gene zzso system of cholesterol by synthesis in the cell and zzso differentiation and zzso given as the zzso The simulations were expressed in terms of unit zzso zzso zzso sets of parameters were determined and the systems were zzso simulated under various zzso The simulations allow us to study possible functional conditions of these gene networks, calculate consequences of zzso and define optimal strategies for their correction including therapeutic zzso zzso user interface for these simulations is available at zzso
