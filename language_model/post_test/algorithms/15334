zzso plays a fundamental role in zzso Yet, whether direct zzso of inflammation will reduce the occurrence of adverse cardiovascular outcomes is not zzso 

The zzso zzso Reduction Trial zzso zzso will randomly allocate 7,000 patients with prior zzso zzso zzso and either type 2 diabetes or the zzso syndrome to zzso zzso (target dose zzso zzso or zzso over an average follow-up period of 3 to 5 zzso zzso zzso is a commonly used zzso regimen for the treatment of zzso arthritis and lacks significant effects on zzso levels, blood pressure, or zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso studies suggest that zzso zzso has clinically relevant zzso zzso The zzso primary end point is a composite of nonfatal zzso nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular zzso Secondary end points are zzso zzso coronary zzso plus the primary end point, hospitalization for zzso heart failure plus the primary end point, zzso mortality plus coronary zzso plus zzso heart failure plus the primary end point, incident type 2 diabetes, and net clinical benefit or zzso zzso will use standardized central methodology designed to ensure consistent performance of all dose adjustments and safety interventions at each clinical site in a manner that protects the blinding to treatment but maintains safety for enrolled zzso 

zzso aims to test the inflammatory hypothesis of zzso in patients with prior zzso and either type 2 diabetes or zzso syndrome, conditions associated with persistent zzso If zzso zzso reduces cardiovascular events, zzso would provide a novel therapeutic approach for the secondary prevention of heart attack, stroke, and cardiovascular zzso
