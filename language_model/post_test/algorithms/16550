Natural resource management is littered with cases of zzso and zzso management, leading to loss of both zzso and human zzso zzso boundaries stifle the search for solutions to these zzso Here, I combine the approach of management strategy zzso widely applied in zzso with household utility models from the conservation and development literature, to produce an integrated framework for evaluating the effectiveness of competing management strategies for harvested resources against a range of performance zzso I demonstrate the strengths of this approach with a simple model, and use it to examine the effect of manager ignorance of household decisions on resource management effectiveness, and an allocation zzso between monitoring resource stocks to reduce observation uncertainty and monitoring users to improve zzso I show that this integrated framework enables management assessments to consider household utility as a direct metric for system performance, and that although utility and resource stock conservation metrics are well zzso harvest yield is a poor proxy for both, because it is a product of household allocation decisions between alternate livelihood options, rather than an end in zzso This approach has potential far beyond zzso harvesting in situations where managers are in full zzso I show that the integrated approach enables a range of management intervention options to be evaluated within the same zzso
