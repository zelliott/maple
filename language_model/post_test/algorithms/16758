The zzso between G zzso receptors zzso and zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso regulates various signal zzso from zzso space into the zzso However, the zzso mechanism between zzso and G proteins is still unknown, and experimental determination of their zzso specificity and function is both expensive and time zzso zzso it is significant to develop a theoretical method to predict the zzso specificity between zzso and G proteins as well as their function using their primary zzso In this study, a novel zzso predictor zzso based on support zzso machine zzso continuous zzso transform zzso and information theory zzso is developed to zzso G proteins and predict the zzso specificity between zzso and G zzso zzso is used for construction of zzso zzso and IT are used to characterize the primary structure of zzso Performance of zzso is evaluated with zzso test on various working zzso The overall accuracy of the G proteins at the levels of class and family is zzso and zzso zzso The accuracy of the zzso specificity prediction varies from zzso to zzso These results indicate that the proposed predictor is an effective and feasible tool to predict the zzso specificity between zzso and G proteins as well as their functions using only the protein full zzso The establishment of such an accurate prediction method will facilitate drug discovery by improving the ability to identify and predict zzso zzso zzso and zzso can be acquired freely on request from the zzso
