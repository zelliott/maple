We propose an integrated zzso approach for zzso grouping of localized melanoma zzso This approach incorporates the survival tree model with the zzso zzso zzso to group terminal zzso with similar zzso zzso The zzso score is used to evaluate the goodness of fit and the zzso zzso test is used to evaluate the zzso of the scheme for zzso The proposed approach is applied to an American Joint Committee on Cancer zzso localized melanoma data set and compared with the current zzso staging zzso This approach performs more efficiently than the standard tree methods and has made improvement over the current zzso melanoma staging zzso
