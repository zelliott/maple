A general zzso for solving zzso zzso models including recycling systems has been developed and its zzso on a zzso is zzso zzso algebra is used to obtain for any zzso model an zzso solution, which is expressed as the exponential of a zzso of rate zzso A special technique is used in the zzso to enable this exponential to be evaluated with a rapidly zzso zzso zzso errors incurred in this process are estimated zzso Thus, in an extreme case, where these errors may be zzso the appropriate action can be zzso Given a particular model, the user enters the model parameters into a rate zzso according to a simple zzso The zzso then uses this zzso to solve the model, and thus no specialized mathematical knowledge is zzso The zzso is given in a short zzso program zzso zzso listed in an zzso No additional software is zzso By running this program on a standard zzso the user can solve models of any zzso those up to 15 compartments in seconds and those up to 30 compartments within a zzso The zzso is thus zzso suited to solve kinetic models describing the transport of zzso in the environment or the zzso of elements in biological systems such as the zzso models recommended by the International Commission on zzso Protection zzso Given the initial amount of material in each compartment at time zzso zzso 0, together with its radioactive zzso constant, the zzso gives both the amount in each compartment at any future time zzso and the number of zzso that will have occurred in each compartment up to time zzso The computer program, shown in an zzso could easily be used to calculate zzso over any time zzso of interest, or to predict the quantities or zzso of an intake expected to be present in any in zzso or zzso compartments of zzso Thus, the zzso can be useful in both the design and conduct of zzso and internal dose assessment zzso
