zzso zzso zzso has been considered as a means of providing dose zzso that conform to zzso target zzso For computer-controlled zzso zzso zzso to be used to zzso zzso beams, some procedure must be used to determine the sequence of leaf positions used to produce the desired zzso This article derives and compares four zzso zzso zzso leaf sequencing can be accomplished by representing the zzso intensity zzso of a beam with a series of beam zzso A zzso equation for computing the zzso required for a one-dimensional profile, described originally using more extensive algebra, is derived using a graphic zzso The zzso approach is compared with an equal incremental zzso approach derived by zzso and zzso An zzso zzso technique derived by zzso and zzso is introduced and compared with the zzso zzso Finally, an approach is considered using multiple repeated arcs developed by zzso This wide variety of methods can yield an approach to zzso that zzso to the engineering constraints imposed by the design of a particular linear zzso
