For the first time, we demonstrate the application of the time domain transmission line method zzso to accurate modeling of surface zzso zzso zzso zzso The constructed zzso zzso allows for modeling of zzso materials through simple zzso zzso Using such zzso an zzso band zzso can be applied to obtain the response over the band of zzso zzso perfectly matched layer zzso boundary condition can readily be implemented using the same zzso We illustrate our zzso approach through the modeling of different challenging structures including zzso filters and focusing zzso
