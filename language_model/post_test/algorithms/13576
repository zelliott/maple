zzso beam zzso zzso zzso enables zzso image reconstruction from zzso projection data and plays an important role in image guided radiation therapy zzso zzso back projection is still the most frequently used zzso in zzso The zzso zzso the scanning process zzso zzso into a system of linear zzso which must then be solved to recover images from measured projection zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso can be used to solve zzso zzso linear systems of equations zzso and linear least squares problems zzso especially when the zzso A is very large and zzso Their applications can be found in a general CT context, but in zzso problems zzso zzso zzso they have not widely been zzso zzso zzso reconstruction using the zzso zzso zzso was implemented and studied in this zzso In zzso zzso the main zzso challenge is that the zzso A usually is very large, and storing it in full requires an amount of memory well beyond the reach of commodity zzso Because of these memory capacity constraints, only a small fraction of the weighting zzso A is typically used, leading to a poor zzso In this paper, to overcome this difficulty, the zzso A is zzso and stored zzso and zzso zzso zzso are implemented within zzso This zzso allows us to use the full weighting zzso A for zzso reconstruction without further enhancing computer zzso zzso zzso can also be implemented in this fashion, and can produce significant improvement in the reconstructed zzso
