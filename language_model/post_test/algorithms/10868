zzso search leveraging zzso index structures is increasingly being used for both multimedia and biological database zzso We consider zzso indexing for three important biological data types, protein zzso with the metric zzso model, DNA zzso with zzso distance and zzso fragmentation zzso with a zzso derived from zzso zzso To date, the primary driver of this research has been multimedia applications, where similarity functions are often zzso norms on high zzso feature zzso We develop results showing that the character of these biological zzso is different from multimedia zzso In particular, they are not zzso very high zzso and deserving different zzso zzso Based on zzso we develop a zzso selection zzso seeking centers and show it zzso the most widely used corner seeking zzso Similarly, we develop a data zzso approach sensitive to the actual data distribution in lieu of median zzso
