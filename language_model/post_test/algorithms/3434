The concept of using residual zzso zzso zzso for the structure determination of organic molecules is applied to the simultaneous assignment of all zzso zzso in zzso To use this important zzso zzso the zzso has to be aligned in the magnetic zzso Here we present a new alignment medium for organic zzso The zzso of the alignment properties of zzso of zzso zzso and zzso are described and the alignment properties of zzso at different zzso are zzso A comparison of zzso with zzso zzso shows considerable differences in the magnitude of alignment for zzso in the two alignment zzso zzso zzso a lower degree of order and makes the measurement of residual zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso All zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso were determined by using zzso zzso single quantum zzso zzso zzso The strategy for the extraction of zzso for zzso groups is described in zzso The zzso and order parameters are used to assign pairs of zzso zzso This methodology can distinguish not only one pair of zzso zzso but it can be used to assign all pairs of zzso zzso zzso Two different calculation approaches to achieve this task are described in zzso
