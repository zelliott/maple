The aim of this study was to present a new technique for frontal zzso template creation used in zzso zzso surgery, obviating the need for the traditional zzso Caldwell zzso 

zzso human zzso skulls were studied zzso Using digital addition zzso of sequential zzso zzso zzso zzso images of the frontal zzso to create a composite image, an image is printed to 1 zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso A frontal zzso template was created using this processed image and compared with a control zzso Caldwell zzso 

The mean zzso between corresponding vertical points on the templates was zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso between horizontal points was zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso The mean difference in zzso was zzso zzso The plain film templates were always wider than the zzso zzso 

The zzso frontal zzso templates are virtually identical to the Caldwell zzso zzso They may zzso the need for additional imaging and minimize the potential errors commonly associated with zzso Caldwell zzso
