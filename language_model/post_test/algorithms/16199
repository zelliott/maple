Early detection of zzso zzso in cardiac surgery is zzso We have developed an zzso system for continuous zzso monitoring by use of miniature zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the system's ability to detect zzso in patients undergoing zzso coronary artery bypass zzso zzso and whether automated signal analysis could detect zzso 

In 10 patients scheduled for zzso ultrasound zzso were fixed to the zzso in the area supplied by left anterior descending artery zzso and in a remote area for zzso zzso images with zzso of zzso zzso were presented in real time and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso An automated zzso for zzso detection was developed, using zzso wall zzso as a fraction of total wall zzso zzso were made at baseline and during zzso zzso zzso strain was used as zzso 

Nine of 10 patients developed zzso during zzso zzso with resulting decrease in zzso and increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso In these nine patients, zzso shifted below zero with no overlap between baseline and zzso zzso zzso The automated zzso fraction was reduced from zzso to zzso zzso A zzso value of zzso could completely separate normal from zzso zzso in all zzso 

The zzso system detected regional zzso during zzso zzso An automated analysis zzso demonstrated excellent ability to detect zzso This technology can develop into a useful tool to detect zzso in cardiac zzso
