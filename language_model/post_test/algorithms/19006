zzso stabilization is a step in the zzso of zzso data that can greatly benefit the performance of subsequent statistical modeling and zzso Due to the often limited number of technical replicates for zzso and zzso zzso achieving zzso stabilization can be zzso Although the zzso zzso platform provides a larger number of technical replicates on each array (usually over 30 randomly distributed beads per zzso these replicates have not been leveraged in the current zzso data transformation zzso We devised a zzso transformation zzso method that takes advantage of the technical replicates available on an zzso zzso We have compared zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso by using the zzso zzso data zzso and Barnes zzso data zzso The results of the zzso data suggest that zzso zzso zzso of zzso within an zzso The results of the Barnes data show that zzso can improve the detection of zzso expressed genes and reduce zzso zzso We conclude that although both zzso and zzso are built upon the same model of measurement noise, zzso zzso the zzso better and more efficiently for the zzso platform by leveraging the availability of a larger number of zzso zzso The zzso and zzso Data are included in the zzso package of zzso available at: zzso
