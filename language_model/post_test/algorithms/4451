We introduce an zzso to evaluate hip zzso scans using quantitative image analysis procedures based on the zzso zzso zzso for differentiation between zzso women with and without hip zzso In a population of 30 zzso women, the new zzso has a highly zzso potential with a performance superior to standard zzso providing complementary information compared to zzso 

We introduce a novel zzso to evaluate zzso scans of the hip using quantitative image analysis based on the zzso zzso zzso to identify zzso women with zzso and to compare the results with zzso 

zzso of 30 women zzso zzso zzso zzso 15 of whom had a recent hip zzso is obtained by zzso using the zzso zzso zzso The zzso of mineral distribution in the scan images is evaluated using the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis is employed to assess the zzso potential zzso 

The zzso zzso for identification of patients zzso fractures by zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso is zzso zzso zzso No statistically significant correlation exists between zzso and zzso By zzso analysis we can show that by combination of zzso and zzso the outcome increases zzso using zzso or zzso alone, zzso and zzso of cases are classified correctly versus zzso of cases in the zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso has a high zzso potential with respect to identification of patients with high risk of hip zzso performance is superior to zzso The new method provides information complementary to zzso Best zzso results are obtained when zzso and zzso are combined in a zzso zzso
