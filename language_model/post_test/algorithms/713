Changes in flexibility upon zzso complex formation of zzso and the zzso domain of zzso have been investigated using the molecular framework approach FIRST zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and molecular dynamics simulations zzso of in total approximately 35 zzso zzso In a zzso time of about one second, FIRST identifies flexible and rigid regions in a single, zzso three-dimensional molecular zzso whose zzso represent protein atoms and whose edges represent zzso and zzso zzso bond and zzso constraints and fixed bond angles within the zzso The two methods show a very good agreement with respect to the identification of changes in flexibility in both binding partners on a local zzso This implies that flexibility can be successfully predicted by identifying which bonds limit motion within a zzso and how they are zzso In particular, as identified by MD, the zzso in zzso shows considerably more pronounced zzso correlations in the bound state compared to the zzso zzso Similarly, FIRST assigns the zzso to the largest rigid cluster of the zzso Interestingly, FIRST allows us to identify that interactions across the interface (but not zzso changes upon complex zzso result in the observed zzso Since regions of the zzso of zzso that do not interact directly with Ras become zzso this also demonstrates the long-range aspect to rigidity zzso zzso implications of the change of flexibility of the zzso domain of zzso on the zzso of zzso upon complex formation are zzso Finally, the sensitivity of FIRST results with respect to the representation of zzso interactions used as constraints is zzso
