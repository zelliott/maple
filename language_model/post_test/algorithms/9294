The zzso structure of a zzso is zzso by variation in the zzso zzso and zzso content within and between the zzso Describing the zzso structure of zzso zzso is a challenging task, and many zzso methods have been developed and applied to zzso Here we apply a well-known zzso optimal zzso zzso to zzso zzso The zzso finds the best division of the sequence into k pieces, such that the segments are internally as homogeneous as zzso We show how this simple zzso method can be applied to zzso discovery using as input the zzso content of sliding windows on the zzso To evaluate the performance of this zzso technique on zzso zzso we present results from zzso previously studied zzso regions of the human zzso zzso results on the zzso zzso on parts of zzso 21 and 22, and on a 100 zzso region from zzso 1 are similar to previously suggested zzso zzso We also give results on zzso all 22 zzso human zzso An advantage of this technique is that zzso of zzso rich regions can generally be zzso This is because the technique concentrates on greater zzso instead of smaller local, differences in the sequence zzso The effect is further emphasized by a zzso of the data that lowers the high zzso that is observed in zzso rich zzso We conclude that the zzso optimal zzso method is zzso efficient and yields results close to previous biologically motivated zzso zzso
