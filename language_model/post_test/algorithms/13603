To evaluate the contribution made by fetal zzso in identifying zzso syndrome zzso and other zzso disorders in a zzso sequential screening method zzso zzso combined test zzso second zzso modified genetic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso in the general population of pregnant zzso 

Prospective zzso During a zzso study period zzso zzso zzso zzso pregnant women underwent zzso with zzso (with fetal cardiac zzso evaluation performed by zzso in a zzso zzso as a screening method for zzso We evaluated the sensitivity and false positive rate zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso of three screening methods for zzso and all zzso zzso CT, CT + zzso and CT + fetal zzso 

A total of zzso cases were analyzed with 67 zzso disorders and 45 zzso cases being zzso For zzso the CT sensitivity was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for all zzso disorders, with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For CT + zzso and CT + fetal zzso the sensitivity for zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for all zzso zzso The zzso for CT + zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of CT + fetal zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso screening and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso 

Fetal zzso is highly capable of identifying zzso and other zzso disorders as a part of genetic zzso in zzso sequential zzso
