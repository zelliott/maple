It has been well established that zzso zzso zzso accumulate zzso zzso to varying zzso this is thought to be due to differing amounts of zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of zzso imaging on the management of patients diagnosed with zzso zzso We conducted a retrospective review of the clinical data of 91 consecutive patients diagnosed with zzso who underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging between August 1993 and March zzso The patients were divided into two zzso In Group one 67 of 91 zzso patients were evaluated for proven but zzso zzso zzso using zzso In Group two the remaining 24 patients zzso were referred for evaluation of zzso recurrence but did not have prior zzso The zzso images were acquired with two dedicated PET zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and GE zzso General Electric Medical Systems zzso zzso one hour after the intravenous administration of 10 zzso of zzso zzso biopsy or zzso specimens were available for review from 34 patients and were evaluated for zzso grade, presence of zzso tumor zzso and zzso zzso In group one 43 of 67 zzso of the zzso accumulated zzso Sixteen of the 43 patients in whom zzso was accumulated had multiple subsequent zzso scans either for monitoring therapy or for detection of zzso zzso imaging had an impact on the management of 20 of these zzso by guiding the biopsy at the metabolically active site of a large zzso tumor zzso by identifying distant zzso zzso by monitoring the response to treatment with zzso zzso and guiding additional regional therapy zzso and by detecting recurrence zzso In group two recurrence and/or zzso were demonstrated with zzso imaging in six of 24 zzso patients, three of whom had multiple subsequent zzso scans to monitor their zzso Higher zzso grade and zzso zzso but not necrosis or zzso correlated with PET zzso In this study only 64 per cent of zzso accumulated zzso Despite this limitation zzso imaging remains a useful tool in the diagnosis and treatment of zzso zzso imaging had a clinically significant impact in 26 of 91 zzso patients with zzso This includes detection of zzso zzso disease in high-risk zzso liver transplant zzso monitoring response to zzso zzso zzso should be considered as part of the zzso and management of selected patients with zzso
