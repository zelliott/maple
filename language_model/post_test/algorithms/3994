Fast zzso zzso zzso is an emerging zzso technique that allows the main magnetic field to vary, allowing probing zzso at various magnetic field zzso This technique offers promising possibilities but requires long scan times to improve the zzso zzso This paper presents an zzso derived from the zzso method proposed by zzso that can estimate zzso using only one image per field, thereby zzso the scan time by a factor of nearly two, taking advantage of the fact that the equilibrium zzso is zzso to the magnetic field zzso Therefore the equilibrium zzso only needs measuring once, then zzso can be found from inversion recovery experiments using the Bloch zzso The precision and accuracy of the zzso are estimated using both simulated and experimental data, by zzso simulations and by comparison with standard techniques on a zzso The results are acceptable but usage is limited to the case where variations of the main magnetic field are fast compared with zzso and where the zzso curve is relatively zzso The zzso of zzso zzso resulting from the new method is likely to make zzso more acceptable when it is applied in the zzso
