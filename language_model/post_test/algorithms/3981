The proliferation of zzso studies has increased the importance of statistical methods for zzso data that can incorporate zzso zzso The Cox zzso hazards model is one such method that is widely zzso As more extensions of the Cox model with zzso zzso are developed, simulations studies will grow in importance as zzso An essential starting point for simulation studies of zzso models is the ability to produce simulated survival times from a known data generating zzso This paper develops a method for the generation of survival times that follow a Cox zzso hazards model with zzso zzso The method presented relies on a simple transformation of random variables generated according to a truncated zzso exponential distribution and allows practitioners great flexibility and control over both the number of zzso zzso and the number of time periods in the duration of follow-up zzso Within this zzso an additional argument is suggested that allows researchers to generate zzso data in which zzso change at zzso steps of the time zzso The purpose of this approach is to produce data for simulation experiments that mimic the types of data structures applied that researchers encounter when using zzso biomedical zzso zzso is assessed in a set of simulation experiments, and results indicate that the proposed procedure performs well in producing data that conform to the assumptions of the Cox zzso hazards zzso
