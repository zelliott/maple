The prevalence of cognitive impairment consistent with zzso in older adults with zzso was zzso and the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment was zzso The odds of zzso in those with zzso were significantly higher, even after adjustment for age, education level, net worth, and prior stroke zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso 

zzso impairment is common in older adults with zzso and is independently associated with risk of zzso A cognitive assessment should be routinely incorporated into zzso models of zzso
