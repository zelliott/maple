Based on the exquisite sensitivity, zzso and wide dynamic range of quantitative zzso real-time zzso chain reaction zzso it is currently the gold standard for gene expression zzso Target gene expression is calculated relative to a zzso expressed reference zzso An ideal reference should be zzso expressed during all experimental conditions within the given experimental zzso However, no commonly zzso zzso reference gene has been zzso Thus, zzso controls must be determined for every experimental zzso As no appropriate reference genes have been reported for zzso studies in zzso we aimed at identifying and zzso a set of zzso controls for these zzso An extensive validation of zzso possible zzso controls in a panel of 8 normal and transformed zzso cell lines in experimental conditions with and without zzso was zzso zzso and zzso quality was zzso zzso zzso reference genes were assessed by zzso zzso Two different statistical zzso were used to determine the most zzso and zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso abundance was compared and reference genes with widely different ranges of expression than possible target genes were zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso as the most zzso expressed genes in the zzso panel under the given experimental zzso We conclude that the geometric means of expression values of these four genes represents a robust zzso factor for zzso analyses in zzso gene expression studies in zzso The methodology and results zzso may help other researchers by zzso their choice of reference zzso
