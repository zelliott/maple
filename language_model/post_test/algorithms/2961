To develop a method that zzso independently of previous zzso information, the dose delivered to patients by combining zzso imaging with transit dose zzso during zzso 

A zzso zzso CT scan of the patient anatomy was acquired with the patient in treatment zzso During treatment, delivered fields were measured behind the patient with an electronic portal imaging zzso The dose information in these images was zzso through the zzso CT scan and used for zzso Carlo simulation of the dose distribution inside the zzso CT zzso zzso was performed using various zzso for zzso and zzso zzso Clinical zzso is shown for a zzso cancer patient treated with zzso 

For single zzso beams and a zzso zzso zzso plan, the dose distribution was reconstructed within zzso compared with the measured or planned zzso A three-dimensional zzso plan, verified using eight zzso zzso resulted in a difference of zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso compared with the reconstructed zzso For the patient case, planned and reconstructed dose distribution was within zzso for about zzso of the points within the zzso zzso zzso zzso mean dose values, obtained from zzso zzso were within zzso of prescribed values for target volumes and normal zzso 

We present a new method that verifies the dose delivered to a patient by combining zzso imaging with the transit dose measured during zzso This zzso procedure opens possibilities for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strategies taking into account the dose distribution delivered during treatment zzso
