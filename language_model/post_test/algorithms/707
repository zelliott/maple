zzso methods for detecting cervical spine injury in zzso zzso patients continue to zzso This study compared the use of plain zzso to zzso zzso zzso scanning of cervical spines in the zzso blunt trauma zzso The accuracy of plain zzso and CT scanning in detecting clinically significant cervical spine injury in the zzso blunt trauma patient was zzso 

We conducted a prospective cohort study with a zzso convenience zzso The study population consisted of a high-risk zzso of severely injured patients, zzso or with a zzso zzso zzso score zzso 9 at zzso Patients were assessed with a zzso cervical spine series and a CT scan of their cervical spines from the skull base to zzso zzso review of plain zzso and CT scans was performed by two zzso zzso zzso and accuracy of plain films were compared with CT zzso zzso of CT scanning was compared with discharge diagnosis of cervical spine or zzso zzso 

One hundred two patients were eligible and underwent zzso plain zzso and CT zzso zzso zzso and accuracy of plain films compared with CT scanning were zzso zzso and zzso zzso CT scanning was zzso sensitive in detecting cervical spine zzso 

CT scanning in conjunction with plain films enhances the number of cervical spine injuries seen zzso Application of a protocol of plain zzso and CT scanning may be used to clear cervical spines in the zzso trauma zzso zzso evaluation of this protocol is zzso
