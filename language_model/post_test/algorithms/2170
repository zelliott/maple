An automated registration zzso was used to zzso match an anatomical magnetic resonance zzso zzso onto individual brain MR zzso Our goal was to evaluate the accuracy of this procedure for measuring the volume of zzso brain zzso We applied two successive zzso to a series of 28 MR brain images, from 14 schizophrenia patients and 14 normal zzso First, we used an automated zzso program to differentiate between white matter, cortical and zzso gray matter, and zzso zzso Next, we zzso zzso the zzso zzso to fit the zzso brain, by matching the white matter and zzso gray matter zzso To assess the accuracy of these zzso we zzso on all 28 images, 11 brain structures, measured with elastic matching, with the same structures traced manually on zzso zzso The similarity between the zzso (the relative difference between the manual and the automated zzso was zzso for whole white matter, zzso for whole gray matter, and on average zzso for zzso zzso The relative spatial overlap between the manual and the automated volumes was zzso for whole white matter, zzso for whole gray matter, and on average zzso for zzso zzso For all pairs of structures rendered with the automated and the manual method, zzso correlations were between r zzso zzso and r zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso N zzso zzso except for zzso zzso where r zzso zzso (left) and r zzso zzso 44 (right) zzso zzso zzso N zzso zzso In the schizophrenia group, compared to the controls, we found a zzso increase in zzso volume for the zzso zzso zzso zzso nucleus, zzso and zzso zzso but no difference in total zzso matter volume or in zzso MR zzso This finding reproduces previously reported results, obtained in the same patient population with manually drawn structures, and suggests the zzso of our automated registration zzso over more zzso manual zzso
