In this study we investigated the performance of zzso different zzso capable of simultaneously detecting zzso to zzso and zzso referred to as combined screening zzso zzso on a panel of 371 zzso with a prevalence of zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso The geographic distribution of the zzso was as zzso Europe zzso Africa (203) and Latin America zzso These zzso were collected from different clinical groups of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients zzso infected individuals with zzso zzso zzso blood donors zzso and subjects with unknown clinical status zzso The zzso Western zzso zzso kit for detection of zzso zzso and the zzso new zzso II kit were used for the confirmation of zzso and zzso infection zzso Of the 14 tests zzso 9 were zzso linked zzso zzso zzso and 5 were zzso tests requiring visual zzso An alternative approach for zzso zzso testing was studied zzso zzso zzso positive in an initial zzso zzso were zzso on a second zzso zzso that was different from the zzso The use of zzso was limited to zzso that gave zzso zzso results in the two zzso A positive result in both zzso was reported as zzso zzso A negative result in the first zzso was reported zzso zzso zzso zzso cost, and the delta zzso values zzso values of the zzso zzso were taken into consideration when selecting suitable pairs of zzso All the zzso scored zzso sensitivity, but for the zzso the sensitivity ranged from zzso to zzso The specificity for the zzso and zzso varied from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso Delta zzso values for the zzso ranged from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso for the zzso positive and zzso negative populations zzso Of the 121 test combinations zzso 9 zzso pairs yielded zzso sensitivity and specificity and 61 zzso pairs of zzso required further testing on zzso This implies zzso positive zzso value, at a cost that was on average 6 times less, and a testing time that was 5 times faster than the conventional zzso We conclude that there are several combinations of pairs of zzso that can be used in the alternative zzso that can provide accurate results at a much lower cost than the conventional zzso requiring confirmation by zzso of all initially zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
