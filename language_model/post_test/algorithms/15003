A zzso algorithm, zzso zzso for zzso was developed to correlate the activity of zzso drugs against human cell zzso zzso evaluates the relationships among compounds and cell lines and displays the resulting clusters on a 3-D surface zzso This plot along with a frequency plot and rank graph provides clear information regarding the sensitivity of groups of cell lines to particular zzso The program was tested on published zzso data sets and found associations useful in the selection and design of chemotherapy drugs for zzso zzso zzso may be applied to other situations where details of groupings and relationships need to be extracted from large sets of zzso
