To zzso evaluate the accuracy of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and function obtained by using images acquired with one-tenth the typical radiation dose and zzso with a highly constrained zzso zzso reconstruction zzso zzso zzso 

This study was approved by the institutional Animal Care and Use zzso Two consecutive CT zzso acquisitions were performed in 10 zzso pigs over 180 seconds by using routine zzso zzso 160 zzso and one-tenth zzso zzso 16 zzso dose zzso Images obtained with each acquisition were reconstructed with identical zzso and the one-tenth dose images were also processed with a zzso zzso zzso changes in zzso were determined as a function of time to form zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed, and regional zzso zzso zzso rate, and zzso blood flow were zzso Image quality was evaluated (in 10 zzso and the agreement for zzso zzso and function between the routine dose and the one-tenth dose zzso images was determined (for 20 zzso by using statistical zzso zzso analysis was performed by using the paired zzso test, linear regression, and zzso zzso 

zzso obtained with the one-tenth dose were similar to those obtained with the routine zzso zzso analysis showed that there were no significant differences between the routine dose and the one-tenth dose acquisitions in zzso zzso and zzso values and that there were slight but statistically significant differences in some values with the one-tenth dose zzso zzso The image quality of the one-tenth dose acquisition was improved by using the zzso zzso Linear zzso and zzso plots showed agreement between the images acquired by using the routine dose and those acquired by using the one-tenth dose with zzso zzso 

A zzso dose reduction at zzso zzso CT imaging can be achieved in zzso without loss of zzso The image quality of the one-tenth dose images could be improved to be near that of the routine dose images by using the zzso zzso zzso
