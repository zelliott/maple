zzso dynamics is investigated in chemical zzso biological evolution, social and economic zzso The dynamics of these systems can be analyzed within the unifying framework of evolutionary game zzso In this zzso we show that even in zzso finite zzso where the dynamics is inherently zzso zzso is possible with three zzso zzso We show how the interplay of evolutionary zzso zzso of the population, and the nature of the interactions influences the coexistence of zzso We calculate a critical population size above which coexistence is zzso
