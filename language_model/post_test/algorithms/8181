zzso of the reliability of specific real value predictions is zzso and the efficacy of this is often zzso It is important to know if you can trust a given prediction and therefore the best methods associate a prediction with a reliability score or zzso For discrete qualitative predictions, the reliability is conventionally estimated as the difference between output scores of selected zzso Such an approach is not feasible for methods that predict a biological feature as a single real value rather than a zzso As a solution to this challenge, we have implemented a method that predicts the relative surface accessibility of an zzso acid and simultaneously predicts the reliability for each zzso in the form of a zzso 

An ensemble of artificial neural networks has been trained on a set of zzso solved protein structures to predict the relative exposure of the zzso zzso The method assigns a reliability score to each surface accessibility prediction as an inherent part of the training zzso This is in contrast to the most commonly used procedures where zzso are obtained by zzso the zzso 

The performance of the neural networks was evaluated on a commonly used set of sequences known as the zzso zzso An overall zzso correlation zzso of zzso was zzso which is comparable to the performance of the currently best public available method, zzso Both methods associate a reliability score with the individual zzso However, our zzso of reliability scores in the form of a zzso is shown to be the more zzso measure for discriminating good predictions from bad ones in the entire range from completely buried to fully exposed zzso zzso This is evident when comparing the zzso correlation zzso for the upper zzso of predictions sorted according to zzso For this zzso values of zzso and zzso are obtained using our and the compared method, zzso This tendency is true for any selected zzso
