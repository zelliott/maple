Computer simulations of zzso such as molecular dynamics simulations are limited by the time scale of zzso zzso Several sampling techniques are available to search the zzso free energy landscape but most efficient, zzso methods do generally not produce a zzso zzso A sampling zzso based on a zzso zzso of searching copies in the zzso zzso is zzso in this zzso The learning process using zzso and long-term memory functions allows an efficient search in phase space while combining a deterministic dynamics and zzso swaps with the searching copies zzso a zzso zzso The sampling efficiency and accuracy are indicated by comparing the zzso with conventional molecular dynamics and replica exchange zzso
