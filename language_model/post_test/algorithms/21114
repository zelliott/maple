The aim of the current study was to evaluate the potential of the dynamic zzso model to simulate the zzso of a poorly soluble model drug compound, zzso from three zzso zzso and to predict the in zzso zzso correlation zzso using zzso zzso An oil solution and two zzso and zzso drug delivery systems were tested in the zzso zzso The release of zzso to the zzso zzso phase was monitored during the progress of zzso These release profiles compared with plasma profiles obtained in a previous zzso study conducted in zzso at the same zzso The release rate and extent of release from the oil zzso were found to be significantly lower than from zzso and zzso The rank order of zzso released zzso approximately zzso zzso oil zzso was similar to the rank order of zzso from the in zzso zzso The employed zzso model zzso achieved significantly high prediction ability for different data zzso zzso greater than zzso and prediction error close to zzso without employing complex zzso These preliminary results suggest that the dynamic zzso model combined with the zzso can be a useful tool in the prediction of the in zzso behavior of zzso zzso
