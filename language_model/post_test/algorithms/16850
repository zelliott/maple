We show that the zzso routes reconstruction problem can be stated as an instance of a graph theoretical problem known as the minimum cost zzso problem, for which there exist efficient zzso Furthermore, we derive some theoretical results, in a simplified setting, on the possible optimal values that can be obtained for this zzso With this, we place the zzso routes reconstruction problem on solid theoretical zzso establishing it as a zzso problem that also lends itself to formal mathematical and zzso zzso Finally, we present an zzso example of how this framework can be applied to real zzso We propose that our zzso method can be used to define the most zzso zzso (or zzso scenarios, which can then be tested using complementary methods such as genetic zzso
