The comparison of samples, or beta diversity, is one of the essential problems in ecological zzso Next generation sequencing zzso technologies make it possible to obtain large amounts of zzso and zzso short read sequences across many microbial zzso De zzso assembly of the short reads can be especially challenging because the number of zzso and their sequences are generally unknown and the coverage of each zzso can be very low, where the traditional zzso sequence comparison methods cannot be zzso zzso approaches based on zzso zzso on the other hand, have yielded promising results for the comparison of zzso zzso However, it is not known if these approaches can be used for the comparison of zzso zzso and which zzso measures perform the zzso 

We applied several beta diversity measures based on zzso zzso to real zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso sequencing platforms to evaluate their effectiveness for the zzso of zzso samples, including three zzso zzso measures, one zzso measure in zzso one relative zzso based measure zzso and three classical zzso zzso zzso showed that the measure zzso can achieve superior performance on zzso zzso samples into different groups under different sequencing depths for both zzso and zzso zzso recovering environmental zzso affecting microbial samples, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and being robust to sequencing zzso We also investigated the effects of zzso size and order of the background zzso zzso A software pipeline to implement all the steps of analysis is built and is available at zzso 

The zzso based sequence signature measures can effectively reveal major groups and zzso variation among zzso samples from zzso zzso The zzso zzso measure performs well in all application scenarios and its performance is robust with respect to zzso size and order of the zzso zzso
