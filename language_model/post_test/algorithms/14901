A new highly automated zzso search procedure combines a fast zzso transform translation function, Patterson zzso functions and Patterson correlation zzso The search procedure can be applied to various native and difference Patterson maps and their statistically weighted zzso The procedure was tested with zzso data for several crystal structures with up to 30 zzso sites in the zzso unit and with minimum Bragg zzso ranging from 3 to 4 zzso In all cases, the correct sites were found with modest computing zzso
