We have examined the effects of current and zzso noise in a zzso model which can generate a variety of zzso important impulse zzso Current noise enters the membrane equation directly while zzso noise is zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso white noise which is implemented as zzso noise appears in the zzso equations as an additive and a zzso zzso Moreover, the originally white noise is turned into colored zzso The noise correlation time is a function of the system's control parameters which may explain the different effects of current and zzso noise in different dynamic zzso We have found the most zzso qualitative differences between different noise zzso in a zzso zzso firing regime at the transition to chaotic burst zzso This reflects a dynamic state of high zzso zzso
