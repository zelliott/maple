The goal of feature selection is to select useful features and simultaneously exclude garbage features from a given zzso for zzso zzso This is expected to bring reduction of processing time and improvement of zzso zzso 

In this study, we devised a new feature selection zzso zzso based on zzso of zzso Feature zzso expresses zzso among classes in a zzso zzso clear features contribute towards obtaining high zzso zzso zzso is a measure to score zzso of each feature and is based on clustered samples to zzso of classes in a zzso We also suggest combining zzso and other zzso to improve zzso zzso 

From the experiment we confirm that zzso is more excellent than up-to-date feature selection zzso including zzso zzso can be applied to zzso gene selection, text zzso and image zzso
