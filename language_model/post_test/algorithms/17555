zzso studies that aim to map zzso genes for complex diseases commonly test for excess zzso sharing among affected zzso Conventional methods based on zzso zzso zzso sharing do not allow for possible differences among families, such as arise in the case of locus zzso and thus have reduced ability to detect linkage in the presence of such zzso We investigated two approaches to test for zzso in zzso sharing, using a zzso zzso that may be associated with different disease mechanisms leading to differences in zzso zzso zzso ratio tests for zzso were formulated based on an extension of the linear and exponential likelihood models developed by Kong and zzso zzso we examined the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso for differences between mean zzso linkage scores from two zzso family subgroups, assuming zzso The size and power of zzso tests were evaluated for zzso and zzso zzso scoring functions using data sets of families with affected sibling and cousin pairs, generated under a model of locus zzso In certain simulation scenarios, the likelihood ratio test statistics did not follow the expected zzso zzso The type I error estimates for the zzso zzso to nominal 5 and zzso levels in all scenarios considered, and corresponding power was comparable to that of the likelihood ratio zzso Application of these tests for zzso detected significant differences in zzso sharing between zzso of families with inflammatory zzso zzso
