To investigate the relationship between peripheral pulse wave zzso and the carotid zzso pulse wave in a large clinical patient zzso and to establish a process for correct zzso of delay time from zzso to foot zzso zzso or peak times of carotid zzso pulse zzso 

zzso comprised 209 patients scanned using zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso for zzso phase contrast images at the common carotid zzso zzso multiple zzso analysis was conducted for the relationship between foot or peak times and the following factors after excluding correlated factors with zzso zzso pulse rate zzso zzso blood zzso zzso blood zzso zzso body zzso body mass zzso zzso zzso diabetes zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso showed significant correlation with foot zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and peak zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso The following equations were zzso foot time zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso and peak time zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso No other factors showed significant zzso 

zzso was the only factor showing significant relationships to foot and peak times of carotid artery zzso The derived equations will facilitate various kinds of zzso MR acquisition with simple zzso
