zzso zzso of zzso has shown a great promise in identifying markers that could be linked to zzso One of the major obstacles involved in performing these studies is that the underlying population zzso could produce zzso zzso zzso zzso can be caused by the presence of two distinct zzso or a single pool of zzso zzso In this work, we focus on the latter, which is significantly harder to detect in zzso New advances in this research direction are expected to play a key role in identifying zzso that are different among different populations and are still associated with a zzso We evaluated current methods for zzso of population zzso in such cases and show that they might be quite inaccurate even in relatively simple zzso We therefore introduce a new method, zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso which zzso the ancestry of each individual at every zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the ancestry structure for overlapping windows of zzso zzso and combines the results with a majority zzso Our empirical results show that zzso is significantly more accurate and more efficient than existing methods for zzso zzso zzso enabling it to handle large-scale zzso We further show that zzso can be used to estimate the individual zzso of each zzso Our experimental evaluation indicates that this extension yields a considerably more accurate estimate of individual zzso than state-of-the-art methods such as zzso or zzso which are frequently used for the correction of population zzso in association zzso
