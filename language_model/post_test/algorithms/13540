The aim of this study was to compare the zzso provided by three different means of measuring the resting energy expenditure zzso in anorexia zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured, after 24 h of zzso using a portable zzso body monitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso method and the zzso equation for individuals with body mass index zzso zzso the latter being based on zzso X-ray zzso assessment of body zzso The mean differences between zzso values estimated by zzso and those provided by the zzso equation and the zzso method were significantly different from zero in both zzso In contrast, the mean differences between zzso method and zzso equation were zzso significantly different from zero, and a significant correlation was noted between these two zzso In conclusion, the zzso does not appear to be an alternative to zzso and zzso equation methods for assessing zzso in AN zzso
