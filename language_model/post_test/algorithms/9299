There are few contemporary estimates of prevalence rates for inflammatory zzso disease zzso in diverse North American zzso 

We estimated the period prevalence of zzso for January 1, 1999, through June 30, 2001, among zzso million randomly sampled members of nine integrated zzso organizations in the US using computerized diagnoses and zzso pharmaceutical zzso We also assessed the positive zzso value zzso and sensitivities of 1) the zzso algorithm, and 2) the zzso sampling period using medical chart review and linkage to a zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in two different zzso In both, the sensitivity of the optimal algorithm, compared with the most inclusive, exceeded zzso The sensitivity of the zzso sampling period compared with 78 months was zzso zzso zzso zzso in one zzso zzso a slightly more sensitive zzso algorithm, the average period prevalence of zzso across the nine organizations, standardized to the zzso and zzso of the US population, 2000 census, was 388 cases zzso zzso zzso per 100,000 persons zzso zzso per zzso average follow-up 26 zzso The prevalence of Crohn's disease, zzso zzso and unspecified zzso was zzso zzso and 69 per zzso zzso 

The observed average prevalence was similar to prevalence proportions reported for other North American populations zzso per zzso Additional research is needed to understand differences in the occurrence of zzso among diverse populations as well as practice variation in diagnosis and treatment of zzso
