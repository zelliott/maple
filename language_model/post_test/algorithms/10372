Water molecules zzso polar interactions in zzso complexes can substantially contribute to binding affinity and zzso To account for such water molecules in zzso drug design, we performed an extensive search in the Cambridge zzso Database zzso to identify the geometrical criteria defining interactions of water molecules with zzso and zzso In addition, with zzso zzso calculations the propensity of zzso zzso was zzso Based on this information, we developed an zzso zzso to reproduce water molecules bridging polar interactions between zzso and protein zzso This approach was validated with 20 crystal structures and yielded a match of zzso between experimental and calculated water zzso When water molecules establishing only weak interactions with the protein were zzso the match could be improved to zzso zzso by a zzso alignment zzso the zzso zzso was then applied to the zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso binding protein A zzso zzso waters based on the crystal poses matched an average of zzso of the experimental zzso With water molecules calculated based on the zzso zzso the average match with the experimental waters dropped to zzso
