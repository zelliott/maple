zzso data enables the zzso survey of zzso expression profiles at the zzso zzso however, he data presents a challenging statistical problem because of the large number of transcripts with small sample sizes that are zzso To reduce the zzso various zzso or empirical zzso zzso models have been zzso However, because of the complexity of the zzso data, no model can explain the data zzso It is generally difficult to scrutinize the irregular patterns of expression that are not expected by the usual statistical gene by gene zzso 

As an extension of empirical zzso zzso procedures, we have developed the zzso zzso zzso approach based on a zzso measure which can be regarded as an zzso weighted zzso likelihood zzso The weight of a transcript zzso is described as a power function of its likelihood, zzso Genes with low zzso have unexpected expression patterns and low zzso By assigning low weights to zzso the zzso becomes zzso The value of zzso which controls the balance between the zzso and efficiency, is selected by maximizing the zzso zzso by zzso The proposed zzso approach identified six significant zzso contaminated transcripts as zzso expressed zzso in zzso zzso from the head and neck of cancer zzso These six genes were all confirmed to be related to zzso they were not identified as DE genes by the classical zzso zzso When applied to the zzso analysis of zzso zzso the proposed zzso approach identified some potential master regulators that were missed by the zzso zzso 

The simulation data and real gene expression data showed that the proposed zzso method was robust against zzso The distribution of the weights was used to scrutinize the irregular patterns of expression and diagnose the model zzso When zzso outside the range of the predicted distribution were observed, a detailed inspection of the data was carried zzso The zzso described here can be applied to other zzso statistical models for diagnosis, and may serve as a useful tool for zzso and zzso zzso
