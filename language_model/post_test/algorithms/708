A central goal of structural zzso is to zzso determine representative structures for all protein zzso At least 14 structural zzso pilot projects are currently investigating the feasibility of zzso structure zzso the National Institutes of Health zzso nine of these in the United zzso Initiatives differ in the particular subset of zzso zzso on which they zzso At the zzso zzso zzso consortium zzso we target zzso protein domain zzso The automatic target selection procedure has three zzso 1) identify all protein domain families from currently five entirely zzso zzso target organisms based on their sequence zzso 2) discard those families that can be modeled on the basis of structural information already present in the zzso and 3) target representatives of the remaining families for structure zzso To guarantee that all members of one family share a common zzso region, we had to begin by zzso proteins into structural zzso regions before zzso Our zzso approach, zzso utilizing zzso to zzso zzso and zzso chopped the zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso Of these fragments, zzso appeared suitable targets that were grouped into zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, our results suggested that it might be necessary to determine zzso structures to minimally cover the subset of five zzso zzso
