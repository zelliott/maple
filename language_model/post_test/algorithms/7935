X-ray zzso zzso which uses two transmission zzso has the advantage that broad energy bandwidth zzso can be zzso We demonstrate the use of white zzso radiation for high-speed X-ray phase imaging and zzso in combination with an X-ray zzso zzso The zzso fringe visibility over zzso was zzso enabling quantitative phase zzso X-ray phase images with a frame rate of 500 zzso and an X-ray phase zzso with a scan time of zzso s were obtained zzso This result suggests a breakthrough for zzso three-dimensional observation of objects that zzso absorb X-rays, such as soft material and biological zzso
