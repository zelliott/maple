A balanced probe circuit is used to generate high zzso magnetic field for sensitivity enhancement of zzso zzso spinning zzso experiment applied to zzso zzso zzso zzso balancing of the sample zzso can cut the peak zzso by a half, therefore improving the power handling when generating a zzso higher zzso zzso Experimental results, illustrated here with zzso data for two layered double zzso show that the zzso efficiency increases more than zzso with the zzso field zzso The zzso enhancements from high zzso and zzso fields and an zzso zzso pulse sequence provide the critically needed sensitivity for acquiring zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso at natural zzso
