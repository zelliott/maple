We report the first experimental demonstration of an zzso one-way zzso of zzso quantum zzso on a zzso cluster zzso All the possible zzso of a balanced or constant function acting on a zzso register are realized within the zzso model for quantum zzso The experimental results are in excellent agreement with the theoretical model, therefore demonstrating the successful performance of the zzso
