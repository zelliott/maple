To clarify the origin and pathways of zzso zzso evoked zzso zzso zzso to zzso sound zzso we compared the results of zzso with zzso with zzso with zzso zzso zzso cervical zzso zzso with zzso and the caloric test in patients with unilateral zzso zzso zzso

zzso referral zzso 

zzso patients with zzso unilateral zzso 

Each patient underwent zzso tests, including zzso to zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and caloric zzso The correlations among these tests were zzso 

Of the 45 patients zzso 28 patients zzso showed reduced or absent zzso to zzso solely on the affected zzso There were no significant differences in abnormal response ratios among zzso to zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso or the caloric zzso The results of zzso to zzso had a significant correlation with those of zzso to zzso and the caloric test zzso zzso zzso but not with those of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These findings support the hypothesis that zzso in response to zzso are predominantly zzso by the superior zzso nerve and probably reflect the function of the zzso
