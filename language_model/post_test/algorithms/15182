This work presents a new class of three-dimensional spiral zzso for sampling magnetic resonance zzso The distributed spirals trajectory efficiently zzso a cylinder or sphere or intermediate shape in zzso The trajectory is shown to be nearly as efficient as a conventional stack of spirals trajectory in terms of scan time and zzso ratio, while reducing coherent zzso in all three spatial directions and reducing Gibbs ringing due to the nature of collecting data from a sphere in zzso The trajectory uses a single two-dimensional spiral zzso with the addition of a single zzso zzso which is scaled with each repetition, making it relatively easy to zzso zzso from zzso only occurs in two dimensions due to the zzso nature of the zzso
