zzso problems for zzso system models of cognitive processes comprise the determination of synaptic weight zzso or kernel functions for neural networks or zzso field models, zzso We introduce dynamic cognitive modeling as a three tier zzso approach where cognitive processes are first described as zzso that operate on complex symbolic data zzso Second, symbolic expressions and operations are represented by states and transformations in abstract zzso zzso Third, prescribed zzso through representation space are implemented in zzso zzso We discuss the zzso equation for a zzso field theory as a special case and show that the kernel construction problem is particularly zzso We suggest a zzso learning method as zzso technique and demonstrate its zzso and zzso for basic examples of cognitive zzso
