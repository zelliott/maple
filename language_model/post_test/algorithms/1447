Body, zzso and zzso weights were recorded and zzso zzso zzso were counted to determine daily zzso production and the number of zzso stored within the zzso zzso zzso in 145 zzso of a control line zzso and 128 zzso of a line selected for increased predicted weight of zzso zzso at 150 d of zzso Random samples of zzso were evaluated at five ages between 70 and 450 d in Generation 8 and 15 ages between 70 and 296 d in Generation zzso Data were analyzed using an animal model that included the fixed effect of line and the zzso zzso and cubic effects of zzso zzso components were estimated using a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and C line did not differ in body weight zzso zzso zzso in Generation zzso In Generation 9, zzso of line zzso were heavier between 118 and 198 d of age zzso zzso zzso thereafter, body weights of the lines were similar zzso zzso zzso The increase in organ weights for the zzso and zzso between 70 and 160 d of age were greater zzso zzso zzso for zzso of line zzso in each generation, and differences between the lines in zzso weights established around zzso were maintained at 450 d of zzso Daily zzso production and zzso increased more rapidly at younger ages and zzso at greater values zzso zzso zzso in zzso of line zzso At ages less than 200 zzso zzso of line zzso produced more zzso per gram of zzso than control zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
