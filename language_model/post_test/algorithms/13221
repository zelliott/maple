We propose a new optical zzso which is capable of changing zzso the zzso format of the optical zzso By using this zzso we can handle and assign various zzso zzso zzso phase shift keying zzso zzso phase shift keying zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The proposed zzso is based on a combination of a zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso with electrical zzso drive zzso zzso is a key element to produce the zzso and zzso formats where each arm of zzso is driven by independent zzso zzso This is because we can zzso the zzso and phase of the optical signal by using a frequency zzso of the zzso when we adjust properly the zzso of the electrical drive zzso In addition, we show an zzso by which the proposed zzso can intelligently select the zzso format in accordance with the signal zzso
