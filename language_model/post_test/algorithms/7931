zzso spectral zzso using balanced coherent detection enables zzso zzso characterization of zzso optical zzso with near zzso zzso A 90 degrees optical hybrid places a zzso in zzso with a stronger, zzso reference zzso zzso of the four zzso with an zzso two-dimensional detector array followed by balanced detection uniquely determines the signal zzso Balanced coherent detection provides zzso noise rejection and coherent gain enabling near zzso zzso The zzso zzso was temporally gated from a 100 zzso periodic train of arbitrary optical zzso generated using zzso pulse shaping on a 10 zzso optical frequency zzso The zzso show arbitrary zzso with zzso record zzso 500 zzso optical zzso and only 1200 detected zzso
