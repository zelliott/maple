zzso studies are used to investigate the energies of xenon binding to zzso and to describe pathways through the protein interior for a zzso zzso zzso energy calculations indicate a favorable zzso contribution of zzso to zzso zzso to xenon binding for four zzso determined xenon zzso These calculated zzso help to explain the different xenon zzso observed zzso A fifth site, modeled in place of the iron zzso water zzso in the zzso zzso is also predicted to bind zzso The largest contribution to the binding energy is from van der zzso interactions with smaller contributions from polarization and protein strain zzso zzso trajectory calculations as well as a new geometric zzso define a connecting network of zzso pathways through the zzso protein zzso One or two pathways appear to lead most easily from each major internal cavity to the protein zzso The importance of these channels in protein dynamics and their implications as routes for zzso motion are zzso
