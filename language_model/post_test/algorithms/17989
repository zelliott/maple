In the zzso era, there is a great need for zzso affinity zzso to explore the human zzso zzso are suitable as zzso but generation of zzso with low zzso to other human proteins requires careful selection of zzso Here we show the results from a zzso effort to map linear zzso based on uniqueness relative to the entire human zzso The analysis was based on a sliding window sequence similarity search using short windows zzso 10, and 12 zzso acid zzso A comparison of exact string matching zzso distance) and a zzso method zzso was performed, showing that the zzso method combined with a grid strategy allows for whole zzso analysis with high accuracy and feasible run zzso The analysis shows that it is possible to find unique zzso for a majority of the human zzso with relatively strict rules involving low sequence identity of the possible linear zzso The implications for human zzso zzso efforts are zzso
