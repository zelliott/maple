The zzso medicine information system enables or supports health-care delivery zzso A secure zzso scheme will thus be needed to safeguard data integrity, zzso and zzso In this paper, we propose a generic construction of zzso password zzso protocol and prove its zzso The proposed framework is superior to previous schemes in three following aspects : zzso our scheme is a true zzso zzso zzso zzso our scheme can yield a forward secure zzso zzso scheme with user anonymity when appropriately zzso zzso our scheme zzso each user's unique identity to accomplish the user zzso and does not need to store or verify zzso zzso And yet, our scheme is still reasonably efficient and can yield such a concrete scheme that is even more efficient than previous zzso Therefore the end result is more practical for the zzso medicine zzso
