To estimate the effect of Employee Assistance Program zzso use on zzso zzso as measured by health zzso 

A unique data set that combines zzso information on zzso zzso demographic information, and health insurance claims from 1991 to 1995 for all employees of a large zzso zzso 

Using zzso zzso models that control for zzso differences between zzso zzso to use zzso resources and the zzso we perform our analyses in two zzso First, for those employees who visited the zzso we test whether zzso claims differ from zzso zzso Second, we combine claims data of individuals who went to an zzso with those of individuals who did not use an zzso to test whether differences in zzso exist between zzso users and zzso 

From the zzso we obtained the date of first zzso contact for all employees who used the service, and from the company's human resources department we obtained limited demographic data on all zzso We obtained zzso zzso claims data on all employees and their dependents from the company's two zzso plans: a zzso zzso plan and a health maintenance organization zzso zzso 

We found that going to an zzso substantially increases both the probability of an alcohol, drug abuse, or mental health zzso claim and the number of zzso claims in the same quarter as zzso zzso The increased probability of an zzso claim persists for approximately 11 quarters after the initial zzso while the increased zzso charges persist for approximately six quarters after the initial zzso zzso 

Our results strongly suggest that the zzso is able to identify behavioral and other health problems that may affect workplace performance and prompt zzso users to access zzso and other zzso zzso with the stated goals of many zzso including the one examined in this study, this process should improve zzso health, family zzso and workplace zzso
