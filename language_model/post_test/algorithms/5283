Previous tests of zzso in deception detection have focused mainly on zzso zzso Since zzso for such tests have been reported, we looked here at other possible variables as deception zzso zzso scalp distribution and zzso zzso both across 30 zzso We were also concerned, for the first time, in testing for recognition of more than one guilty item in a mock crime zzso There were three groups: zzso zzso group, two of six items were guilty knowledge zzso items; zzso zzso group, three of six items were zzso items; zzso control group, zero of six items were zzso zzso In group zzso in the zzso group, zzso for lies were significantly greater than zzso for zzso zzso There were significant interactions of condition zzso vs zzso by site, suggesting different scalp profiles for deceptive versus zzso zzso zzso zzso across sites was also greater in Lie than in Truth zzso These results did not obtain in the zzso and control zzso In terms of zzso zzso in probe conditions across groups, zzso group was larger than zzso and control zzso Regarding individual zzso the zzso method yielded a zzso detection rate of zzso versus zzso false zzso Regarding zzso at multiple zzso sites, zzso of guilty subjects were detected versus zzso false zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of various test discrimination efficiencies varied from zzso to zzso zzso of the present study suggested further investigation of the zzso method as a diagnostic tool for lie zzso
