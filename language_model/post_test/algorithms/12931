Using zzso zzso techniques, we have modeled an area of 126 zzso of a zzso zzso mirror with zzso zzso These techniques produce models zzso to zzso zzso zzso where the turbulent zzso is measured before it hits the zzso zzso The zzso input is the zzso correction to apply to the mirror and its output is the set of zzso to shape the zzso Our experiments have achieved positioning errors of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
