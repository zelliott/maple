In this paper, a new and zzso zzso for zzso zzso is zzso Two inequalities, one used for terminating the searching process and the other used to delete impossible zzso are presented to reduce the distortion zzso Our zzso makes use of a zzso features zzso value, edge strength, and texture zzso to reject many unlikely zzso that cannot be rejected by other available zzso Experimental results show that our zzso is superior to other zzso in terms of computing time and the number of distortion zzso Compared with available approaches, our method can reduce the computing time and the number of distortion zzso zzso Compared with the best method of reducing distortion computation, our zzso can further reduce the number of distortion calculations by zzso to zzso Compared with the best zzso zzso for zzso zzso our approach also further reduces the computing time by zzso to zzso
