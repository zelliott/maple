A novel discrete mathematical approach is proposed as an additional tool for molecular zzso which does not require prior statistical assumptions concerning the evolutionary zzso The method is based on zzso generating mathematical representations directly from zzso or protein zzso followed by the output of zzso zzso or zzso and visual characteristics zzso The zzso zzso sequence information is transformed into a compact zzso form, called the zzso zzso Form (or zzso of zzso functions, which can then be used as a generalized molecular zzso The method provides raw zzso data for calculating different distance zzso which in turn can be analyzed by zzso or zzso to derive a tree, or by principal coordinates analysis to get an zzso zzso The new method and the associated software for zzso zzso trees are called the zzso analysis or zzso
