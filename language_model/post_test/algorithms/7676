zzso learning has been successfully applied to a variety of medical imaging zzso Its use in real-time applications requires fast projection onto the zzso zzso To this end, zzso extensions are applied by constructing an zzso function that maps from the input space to the zzso zzso zzso used approaches such as the zzso extension and kernel zzso zzso require using all training zzso We propose an zzso function that only depends on a small subset of the input training zzso zzso in the testing phase each new point only needs to be compared against a small number of input training data in order to project the point onto the zzso zzso We interpret our method as an zzso extension that zzso kernel zzso zzso Our method involves solving a simple convex zzso problem and has the attractive property of guaranteeing an upper bound on the approximation error, which is crucial for medical zzso zzso this error bound controls the zzso of the resulting zzso zzso We illustrate our method in two clinical applications that require fast mapping of input images onto a zzso zzso
