A zzso zzso operator splitting zzso is employed to derive a zzso linear solution for the three-dimensional zzso wave equation due to small variations of the sound speed in the zzso The solution shown in this paper zzso other solutions obtained from less accurate zzso Examples of three-dimensional acoustic ducts are presented to demonstrate the accuracy of the zzso Future work on the applications of associated zzso models for acoustic zzso is proposed and zzso
