zzso zzso suffers from the effect of the spatial response function due to the zzso of the sampling of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is often used to suppress the side zzso caused by the effects of the zzso where the sampled zzso is multiplied with a weighting function before inverse zzso zzso used filters in zzso are the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso is often zzso into a larger image zzso size for analysis, where zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are two common zzso In this work, the effects of zzso filtering in practical usage was zzso and the image representations of the object for the two zzso methods were zzso This study showed that application of filtering improves the image representation of the structures in the object and should be used in zzso zzso correctly zzso the information inherent in the zzso while the features of the object were dependent on the position of the object relative the original zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso should therefore be used for quantitative evaluation of zzso zzso
