zzso zzso zzso is a zzso hormone, whose action is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from six zzso healthy male volunteers were obtained after four different administrations of zzso zzso zzso We present a modeling study to provide a possible explanation for the observations that increased exposure to zzso zzso higher and then lower testosterone zzso and that marked rebound effects are observed at the end of repeated administration of zzso We used zzso models (in which flexible functions represent unknown parts of the zzso to identify the relationship of zzso zzso to the testosterone zzso Based on the results obtained with the zzso models, different zzso zzso models were devised and zzso The final model uses a zzso model to describe the zzso production rate of zzso zzso affects the production rate with a mechanism consistent with a zzso binding site, with effect zzso to zzso bound zzso The modeling results indicate that when zzso concentration increases, the testosterone production rate increases to 45 times the baseline zzso However, at an zzso concentration of more than about 30 zzso the production rate zzso zzso showed that both dose and dosing zzso profoundly influence testosterone response to zzso
