The programs described zzso function as part of a suite of programs designed for zzso zzso multiple zzso generation of zzso zzso production of alignment scores and a sorting routine for analysis of the alignments zzso The sequence alignment programs zzso gaps zzso of zzso within regions of protein secondary structure and have the added option of zzso structurally or functionally important zzso The multiple alignment program is based upon the sequence alignment method of zzso and zzso and the multiple alignment extension of Barton and zzso Our application includes the feature of zzso weighting active site, zzso zzso contact or other important template zzso to bias the alignment toward matching these zzso A zzso for the alignments is introduced, which is independent of gap zzso This score more adequately reflects the character of the alignments for a given scoring zzso than the zzso total score described previously in the zzso In addition, individual zzso acid similarity scores at each zzso position in the alignments are printed with the alignment output to enable immediate quantitative assessment of zzso at key sections of the aligned zzso
