A zzso association zzso study is usually designed as a zzso study, where the presence and absence of the primary disease define the cases and controls, zzso Using the existing data from zzso studies, investigators are also trying to identify the association between genetic zzso and secondary zzso which are defined as traits associated with the primary zzso However, recent studies have shown that bias arises in the zzso of zzso zzso association using originally collected zzso We recently proposed a bias correction approach to accurately estimate the odds ratio zzso for zzso zzso zzso In this communication, we further investigated whether our bias correction approach is robust for a scenario involving the interactive effect of the secondary zzso and genetic zzso on the primary zzso We found that in such a scenario, our bias correction approach also provides an accurate zzso of OR for zzso zzso zzso We investigated accuracy of our approach using simulation studies and showed that the approach better controlled for type I errors than the existing zzso We also applied our bias correction approach to the real data analysis of association between an zzso zzso zzso and smoking on the basis of zzso zzso zzso
