About ten years ago, zzso was proposed as a simple and biologically feasible model for object recognition, based on how the visual zzso processes zzso However, the model does not zzso sparse zzso which is a hallmark of zzso at all stages of the visual zzso The current paper presents an improved model, called sparse zzso which zzso sparse zzso This model is able to learn zzso features of objects on zzso training zzso Unlike most other deep learning models that explicitly address global structure of images in every layer, sparse zzso addresses local to global structure gradually along the hierarchy by applying zzso learning to the output of the previous zzso As a consequence, the learning method can be standard sparse coding zzso or independent component analysis zzso two techniques deeply rooted in zzso What makes zzso and zzso zzso at higher levels is the introduction of linear zzso statistical zzso by max zzso After training, high-level units display zzso zzso selectivity for particular individuals or for image categories like those observed in human inferior zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso lobe zzso Finally, on an image zzso zzso sparse zzso zzso the original zzso by a large margin, suggesting its great potential for computer zzso
