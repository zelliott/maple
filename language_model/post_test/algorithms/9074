Recent progress in the technology for single unit recordings has given the zzso community the opportunity to record the zzso activity of large zzso zzso At the same pace, statistical and mathematical tools were developed to deal with zzso zzso typical of such zzso A major line of research investigates the functional role of zzso of zzso with significant zzso behavior: the zzso cell zzso Here we review three linear methods for the detection of cell zzso in large zzso populations that rely on principal and independent component zzso Based on their performance in spike train simulations, we propose a modified framework that incorporates multiple features of these previous zzso We apply the new framework to actual single unit recordings and show the existence of cell zzso in the rat zzso which typically zzso at zzso zzso and couple to different zzso of the underlying field zzso
