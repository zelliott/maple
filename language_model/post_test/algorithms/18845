We present here a fast method for the exploration of channels in proteins based on molecular dynamics simulations of probe particles in a discrete grid space defined by an ensemble of protein zzso obtained either zzso or by zzso zzso molecular dynamics zzso The method is able to provide zzso zzso with a small zzso effort, requires no human intervention in defining possible exit pathways and can detect both major and minor channels, giving a correct balance to the relative flux between zzso The zzso approach is then a suitable method for massive exploration of channels in zzso even of those with unknown functional zzso
