Analysis of gene expression data can provide insights into the positive and negative zzso of zzso However, existing methods such as association rule mining are zzso expensive and the quality and quantities of the rules are sensitive to the support and confidence zzso In this paper, we introduce the concept of positive and negative zzso gene cluster zzso that more accurately reflects the zzso of zzso and propose an efficient zzso to extract zzso 

We experimented with the zzso zzso and compared our resulting zzso with the association rules generated by the zzso mining zzso Our results show that our zzso identify some missing zzso of association rules, and our zzso greatly reduces the large number of rules involving zzso genes generated by the zzso zzso 

The software is available upon zzso
