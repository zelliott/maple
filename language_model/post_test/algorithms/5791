We present zzso a new zzso to predict zzso secondary structures with zzso The method is based on a zzso of zzso structures according to their zzso zzso zzso is guaranteed to find the minimum free energy structure regardless of zzso zzso This unique proficiency is obtained at the expense of the maximum length of sequences that can be treated, but comparison with state-of-the-art zzso shows that zzso significantly improves the quality of zzso Analysis of zzso incorrect predictions sheds light on the need to study how zzso constraints limit the range of zzso structures that can be formed from a given zzso An zzso of zzso on a public server can be found at zzso
