zzso for determining zzso distances between zzso spin labels from zzso zzso in the intermediate range zzso zzso by zzso are zzso For zzso powder patterns, the assumption of unlike spins is a better approximation than assuming strong zzso between like zzso zzso that determine the average splitting in zzso zzso yield the mean value zzso and those that determine the zzso contribution to the spectral second moment zzso yield zzso To relate these ensemble averages to the mean zzso distance zzso requires knowledge of the distribution in zzso zzso of the inverse roots zzso always lie below zzso zzso comparisons of literature data on zzso zzso peptides support this zzso zzso of zzso for zzso zzso in zzso yield zzso to determine zzso for a given distribution zzso zzso
