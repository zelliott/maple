The purpose of this research is to develop a computerized method to zzso carotid plaque zzso on zzso ultrasound images and to compare the results with the zzso analysis of the zzso 

zzso patients (age range, zzso years; mean zzso zzso age, zzso zzso zzso zzso were recruited before zzso zzso ultrasound examination of the carotid artery was performed by applying low mechanical index and zzso with pulse zzso An zzso was developed that implemented several image processing methods to automatically zzso zzso and reconstruct the vascular tree in the zzso zzso zzso and the number of inflammatory cells seen on zzso analysis of the plaque after zzso were compared with zzso determined by the computerized zzso The mean zzso zzso ratios of the ultrasound and zzso zzso were zzso 

In five patients, heavy zzso of the plaque prevented zzso of plaque zzso zzso zzso on zzso ultrasound images was significant in 19 patients and low in three zzso The ratio of the zzso area to the total plaque area on zzso ultrasound images was well correlated with the same zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso and with the number of inflammatory cells present in the plaque zzso zzso zzso The zzso ratio and the number of zzso inflammatory cells also were well correlated zzso zzso zzso 

The newly developed method allowed zzso of the zzso zzso as a feature of vulnerability in the carotid plaque and proved to be highly correlated with zzso zzso
