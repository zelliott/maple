We describe a new assembly algorithm, where a zzso assembly with low sequence coverage, either throughout the zzso or locally, due to cloning bias, is considerably improved through an assisting process via a related zzso We show that the information provided by aligning the zzso shotgun reads of the target against a reference zzso can be used to substantially improve the quality of the resulting zzso
