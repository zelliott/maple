Our goal is to assess the potential of zzso methods as an alternative to zzso models to predict the two zzso wave modes observed in zzso bone and predicted by the zzso zzso A three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso method is coupled with 34 human zzso zzso zzso measured using zzso zzso The main zzso alignment zzso and the degree of zzso zzso were assessed for all zzso zzso values were comprised between zzso and zzso The influence of bone volume fraction zzso between zzso and zzso on the properties of the fast and slow waves was studied using a dedicated image processing zzso to modify the initial zzso zzso A zzso method was devised to determine when both wave modes are time zzso The simulations zzso in three perpendicular zzso predicted that both waves generally overlap in time for a direction of propagation perpendicular to the zzso When these directions are zzso both waves are separated in time for samples with high zzso and zzso zzso A relationship was found between the least bone volume fraction required for the observation of zzso waves and the degree of zzso The higher the zzso the lower the least zzso
