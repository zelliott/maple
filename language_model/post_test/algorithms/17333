We have created a zzso for a universal zzso model of a health care system compatible with the zzso approach used in version zzso of the zzso standard for communication zzso A set of three models has been developed: zzso the Object Model describes the zzso structure of objects in a zzso identity, zzso zzso and zzso zzso the Dynamic Model represents the sequence of operations in time as a collection of state zzso for object classes in the system; and zzso functional zzso represents the transformation of data within a system by means of data flow zzso Within these models, we have defined major object classes of health care participants and their zzso associations, attributes and operators, states, and behavioral zzso We have also defined the major processes and zzso The zzso design approach allows use, zzso and cloning of standard zzso
