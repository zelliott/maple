We have compared cerebral zzso changes measured by zzso zzso zzso with simultaneously acquired zzso zzso signals during breath hold challenge in zzso The zzso and zzso concentration changes were obtained from the same broadband zzso data using four different zzso zzso One method used only two zzso zzso zzso and 830 zzso and three other methods used broadband data with different spectral fitting zzso We found that the broadband techniques employing spectral derivatives were significantly superior to the zzso methods in terms of the correlation with the zzso zzso In two cases out of six we found that the time courses of the zzso changes produced by the zzso method were zzso inconsistent with the zzso zzso zzso
