The use of zzso zzso zzso sprinkles is a new approach for home zzso Iron and zzso status may affect the zzso of iron from zzso 

The objective was to measure the zzso zzso zzso incorporation of zzso of 2 different doses of iron from sprinkles added to a zzso complementary food provided to infants with different iron and zzso zzso 

zzso aged zzso zzso were randomly assigned to receive either 30 zzso zzso zzso or 45 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso sprinkles added to a zzso zzso on 3 consecutive zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso was also infused zzso zzso zzso zzso Blood was drawn at baseline and 14 d later to determine zzso incorporation of zzso and zzso by using zzso coupled plasma mass zzso On the basis of zzso and soluble zzso zzso zzso subjects were classified as having iron zzso anemia zzso iron zzso zzso or sufficient iron zzso 

There was no significant effect of dose on iron zzso zzso zzso zzso Geometric mean iron zzso was zzso zzso zzso in infants with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in infants with ID zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso infants zzso zzso zzso Geometric mean iron zzso was significantly higher in infants with zzso than in infants with ID or zzso infants zzso zzso zzso however, there were no significant differences between infants with ID and zzso zzso 

During zzso iron zzso from sprinkles in a zzso zzso meets and zzso requirements for absorbed iron and is zzso in infants with zzso
