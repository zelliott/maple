Automatic identification of action zzso from one or more zzso zzso recordings is generally achieved by zzso similar segments of the measured zzso zzso a method that fails (or requires substantial human zzso for spikes whose zzso zzso We formulate the problem in terms of a simple zzso model, and develop a unified method to identify spike zzso along with zzso estimates of their arrival times, even in the presence of zzso Specifically, we make use of a recent zzso known as Continuous zzso Pursuit for solving linear inverse problems in which the component zzso are sparse and are at arbitrary zzso zzso We demonstrate significant performance improvements over current state-of-the-art zzso methods for four simulated and two real data sets with ground truth, each of which has previously been used as a benchmark for spike zzso In addition, performance of our method on each of these data sets zzso that of the best possible zzso method zzso one that is specifically zzso to minimize errors on each data zzso Finally, the zzso is almost completely zzso with a zzso cost that scales well for zzso zzso
