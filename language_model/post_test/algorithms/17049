Muscle forces and zzso moments were calculated with a two-dimensional zzso force and moment analysis zzso to the zzso zzso zzso during the zzso phase, stance phase and stem phase in the hind legs of zzso During the zzso phase, the largest production of force is zzso in the zzso biceps zzso and the highest zzso moment in the zzso third of the zzso zzso The lowest influence of force resulted during the stance zzso During the stance phase, high forces are zzso only in the zzso ligament and zzso forces in the zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso forces are almost equal in strength in the zzso and zzso The strongest forces are zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and extreme demands of the zzso ligament as well as of the zzso in the zzso ankle joint during the stem zzso
