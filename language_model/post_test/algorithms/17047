zzso of the relative gene order on zzso is of critical importance in the construction of human gene zzso In this paper we develop a sequential zzso for gene zzso We start by comparing three sequential procedures to order three genes on the basis of zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio, and minimal zzso zzso In the second part of the paper we extend sequential procedure based on the zzso probabilities to the general case of g zzso We present a zzso that states that the predicted average probability of committing a decision error, associated with a zzso sequential procedure that accepts the hypothesis of a zzso zzso with zzso probability equal to or greater than zzso zzso is smaller than 1 - zzso zzso This zzso holds irrespective of the number of zzso the genetic model, and the source of genetic zzso The zzso is an extension of a classical result of zzso concerning the sum of the actual and the nominal error probabilities in the sequential probability ratio test of two zzso A zzso strategy for ordering a large number of zzso with control over the zzso zzso is zzso An zzso approximation is zzso which zzso the calculations with existing computer software for gene zzso of the zzso probabilities of an order and the error zzso We illustrate with some simulations that the zzso ordering is an efficient zzso
