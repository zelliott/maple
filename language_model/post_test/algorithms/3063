During an illness requiring brief use of zzso therapy zzso patients and surrogates sometimes feel that zzso must be withdrawn before it becomes unnecessary to avoid later being stuck living in a zzso condition that the patient considers worse than zzso This fear depends on the belief that the patient can legitimately refuse only artificial zzso so that if such therapies are no longer required, he or she will have missed the zzso to zzso This fear of being stuck with life can lead to premature decisions to terminate zzso and is unfounded because adequate ethical and moral justification exists for refusal of not just artificial zzso but also for refusal of natural zzso including oral zzso and zzso
