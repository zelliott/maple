zzso learning has attracted a great deal of attention in machine learning and data zzso In this paper, we have proposed a novel zzso Twin Support zzso zzso (called zzso for the zzso zzso problem, which can exploit the geometry information of the marginal distribution embedded in zzso data to construct a more reasonable zzso and be a useful extension of zzso Furthermore, by choosing appropriate zzso zzso zzso to either zzso or zzso All experiments on synthetic and real data sets show that the zzso zzso combined by two zzso zzso is superior to zzso and zzso in both zzso accuracy and zzso zzso
