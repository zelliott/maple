We have developed a new method for reconstructing zzso trees called random local zzso zzso Our method is different from the zzso method zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso a more thorough sampling of solution space by randomly searching for local pair of neighbors in each zzso zzso using the zzso method to analyze zzso data show an increasing possibility to get a smaller S value zzso of branch zzso compared with the NJ method as cases with more zzso are analyzed and many individual runs using the zzso method usually generate more than one zzso with small S zzso Computer simulation shows the fact that the zzso method can improve the possibility of recovering correct zzso significantly by zzso more than one zzso In addition, when using the zzso method, computer simulation also shows that the proportion of correct zzso zzso will increase as the number of different zzso decreases and as the proportion of zzso frequent zzso zzso Thus, the number of different zzso and the proportion of zzso frequent zzso can be used as auxiliary criteria to evaluate reliability of a zzso zzso
