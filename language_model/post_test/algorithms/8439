zzso detection of zzso zzso zzso is zzso requires trained analysts, and is frequently subject to significant human zzso zzso neural networks zzso were developed to help identify zzso labeled zzso zzso zzso A total of 525 digitized images of zzso labeled zzso fluorescent zzso and other zzso zzso images were employed in the training of the zzso The images were cropped to a zzso by zzso image, and the cropped images were placed into two categories, zzso and zzso zzso The images were converted to zzso and processed into a zzso of gray color zzso zzso zzso available software was used to develop and train the zzso The networks were zzso by varying the number of training images, number of hidden zzso and a combination of these two zzso The network performance was then evaluated using a set of 362 unique testing images which the network had never zzso zzso Under zzso conditions, the correct identification of authentic zzso images ranged from 81 to zzso and the correct identification of zzso images ranged from 78 to zzso depending on the type of fluorescent zzso that was zzso The results indicate that the ANN developed were able to zzso the training images and subsequently discern previously unseen zzso images efficiently and zzso Thus, ANN can be used to reduce human errors associated with the microscopic detection of zzso zzso
