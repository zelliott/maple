zzso detection on metal surface requires ultra high zzso zzso zzso Generation zzso zzso and Surface zzso zzso zzso zzso are regarded as two powerful techniques with zzso sensitivity to detect zzso on metal zzso However, in some cases it's still challenge to characterize molecules or groups with relatively high zzso zzso such as zzso zzso on flat metal surface even combining these two zzso Basically, this is due to that zzso with zzso zzso groups is zzso insensitive while flat metal surface is zzso to yield strong zzso zzso In this concern, a simple and efficient method, silver mirror method, was employed to facilitate the detection of zzso SAM on flat gold zzso Silver zzso with diameters around 300 zzso was zzso through silver mirror reaction and in zzso formed milky zzso on top of zzso SAM zzso on gold zzso zzso enhancement on zzso signal can be achieved with such special assembly structure of the zzso zzso Generally, the silver mirror method provided a complementary approach to facilitate the zzso applications of zzso level detection on various metal surfaces in zzso
