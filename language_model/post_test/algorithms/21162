zzso two-dimensional MR zzso zzso zzso is zzso the in zzso studies of brain zzso due to improved spectral resolution and zzso assignment zzso Despite the large number of transgenic mouse models available for neurological disorders, localized zzso MRS has not yet been implemented in the mouse brain due to size zzso In this study we zzso a localized zzso zzso chemical shift correlated zzso sequence at field strength of zzso to obtain highly resolved zzso zzso from localized regions in mouse brains in zzso The combination of the zzso zzso zzso high field strength, strong zzso system, efficient water suppression, and the use of a short echo time allowed clear detection of zzso of up to 16 brain zzso allowing their direct chemical shift assignments in zzso To our knowledge this is the first in zzso zzso MRS study of the mouse brain, demonstrating its feasibility to resolve and simultaneously assign several zzso zzso in the mouse brain in zzso Implementation of zzso MRS will be invaluable in the identification of new zzso during disease progression and treatment using the various available mouse zzso
