zzso modulated zzso zzso provides better sparing of normal zzso We investigated the feasibility of inverse treatment planning for zzso in zzso zzso for breast zzso 

In addition to zzso planning in conventional technique with zzso wedged zzso beams we performed zzso planned zzso zzso In the CT scans for treatment planning we defined a zzso zzso of zzso HE zzso The influence of this zzso on planning zzso was determined by zzso without and dose calculation with and without zzso zzso calculation after dose zzso with zzso was performed using different zzso thickness to determine the influence of the zzso on dose zzso The results were compared with dose distribution in conventional zzso 

zzso zzso with a dose zzso which considers tissue zzso results in unintended dose increase at the patient zzso With a virtual zzso zzso used for inverse zzso the dose increase was zzso Thus, skin sparing was identical to conventional zzso The relative dose distribution was zzso affected by the use of a zzso zzso zzso in absolute dose was zzso compared to calculation without zzso zzso the zzso must be removed before final dose zzso 

The realization of inverse zzso for zzso of the breast requires the use of a virtual zzso zzso zzso in accordance to the consensus recommendations of the zzso zzso and zzso is zzso zzso the same target definition as in conventional technique may be zzso zzso techniques with a conventional beam arrangement of two zzso fields or multiple beam techniques can be zzso
