This paper investigates the zzso consensus control problem of zzso zzso systems under an arbitrary zzso zzso A novel zzso zzso fuzzy modeling method is proposed to describe the problem of zzso follower agents approaching a zzso leader, zzso the error dynamics between the follower agents and the leader, whose dynamics is evolving according to an isolated unforced zzso agent model, is described as a set of zzso fuzzy zzso Based on the model, a zzso consensus zzso is designed so that, under an arbitrary network zzso all the follower agents reach consensus with the leader subject to external zzso preserving a guaranteed zzso performance zzso In addition, we obtain a sufficient condition for choosing the pinned zzso to make the entire zzso network reach zzso Moreover, the fuzzy modeling method is extended to solve the synchronization problem of zzso systems, and a fuzzy zzso controller is designed so that two zzso systems reach synchronization with a prescribed zzso performance zzso The controller design procedure is greatly simplified by zzso of the proposed fuzzy modeling zzso Finally, zzso simulations on chaotic systems and arbitrary zzso functions are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical zzso
