zzso is an effective measure to improve the scanning speed and decrease the radiation dose for zzso zzso However, because of acceleration and zzso of the zzso as well as the response lag of the scanning control terminals to the host PC, zzso and redundant projections are inevitably created, which seriously decrease the quality of the reconstruction zzso In this paper, we first analyzed the aspects of the theoretical sequence chart of the zzso zzso Then, an zzso sequence chart was proposed by extending the rotation angle span to ensure the effective zzso projections were situated in the stable rotation zzso In order to match the rotation angle with the projection image accurately, structure similarity zzso index was used as a control zzso for extraction of the effective projection sequence which was exactly the complete projection data for image zzso The experimental results showed that zzso based method had a high accuracy of projection view locating and was easy to zzso
