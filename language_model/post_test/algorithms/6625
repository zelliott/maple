The effect of several zzso present in a zzso reaction system on cells of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso These four strains have been widely zzso from zzso to the production of fine zzso in zzso reaction zzso The zzso tested were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The cell population was monitored by zzso zzso and analysis of the images captured provided zzso information on cell zzso zzso factors of both viable and zzso cells, and on the number of viable cells in zzso These data, and those concerning the initial zzso zzso the carbon source used during growth, the adaptation time to the zzso prior to zzso addition, and the properties of the organic zzso were interpreted using principal components analysis zzso For zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso between zzso and zzso of the zzso of the data could be explained by six principal zzso while zzso of the zzso in the results obtained with zzso zzso could be represented by seven principal zzso In all cases, zzso toxicity could explain over a third of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso cells were able to maintain their viability under harsh zzso A period of contact between cells and zzso prior to the addition of zzso was zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells, at least for the most toxic zzso but was beneficial for zzso zzso zzso The number of zzso zzso cells in clusters was lower after an adaptation period compared to the number of cells in zzso when the zzso was added at time zzso The zzso transformed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells increased the toxicity of the system by decreasing the log P of the reaction zzso zzso was responsible for a reduction in the ability of zzso zzso to respond to stress zzso zzso zzso cells were apparently unaffected by zzso The results obtained are useful for the design of more efficient zzso reaction systems where zzso toxicity may be overcome in order to increase cell zzso
