The zzso of the primer design is critical for the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso Recently developed statistical models of the zzso primer extension zzso reaction allow further improvement of primer quality for the zzso 

Here we describe how the statistical models can be used to improve primer design for the zzso We also show how to zzso zzso of the zzso markers into multiplex panels using statistical model for multiplex zzso The primer set failure probability calculated by a model is used as a zzso function for both primer selection and zzso zzso Three zzso zzso for the multiplex zzso zzso zzso are described and their relative performance is zzso We also describe the approaches to improve the speed of primer design and zzso calculations when using the statistical zzso Our zzso decreases the average failure probability of the marker set by zzso The experimental marker failure rate in the multiplex reaction was reduced dramatically and success rate can be achieved as high as zzso 

The primer design using statistical models is freely available from zzso
