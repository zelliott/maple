We report on a study designed to compare the relative efficacy of manual zzso zzso and automated mechanical zzso zzso provided by an active zzso zzso zzso The zzso signals of zzso cardiac arrest patients of cardiac zzso were zzso just prior to, and immediately after, zzso resuscitation zzso to assess the likelihood of successful zzso at these time zzso The zzso outcome prediction zzso measure previously developed by our group was used to zzso the probability of return of spontaneous circulation zzso after zzso and was used as a measure of the efficacy of zzso An initial validation study using zzso to predict shock outcome from the patient data set resulted in a performance of zzso specificity achieved at zzso sensitivity on a blind test of the zzso This is comparable with previous studies and provided confidence in the zzso of the technique across hardware zzso zzso the zzso marker also displayed an ability to zzso according to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso electrical activity zzso normal zzso rhythm zzso We then used the validated zzso marker to zzso the zzso data record just prior to and immediately after the chest zzso zzso This was initially performed for 87 zzso segments where zzso was both the zzso and zzso zzso An increase in the mean zzso values was found for both zzso zzso A signed rank sum test found the increase due to manual zzso not to be significant zzso whereas the automated zzso was found to be significant zzso This increase was larger for the automated zzso zzso zzso than for the manual zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the application of zzso does indeed provide beneficial preparation of the heart prior to zzso therapy whether manual or automated zzso is zzso The zzso marker shows promise as a zzso quantitative zzso of the immediate positive effect of both types of zzso regardless of the details of zzso In work of a more exploratory nature we then used the validated zzso marker to zzso the zzso zzso and zzso for all rhythm types zzso zzso We show a significant increase in the zzso measure zzso in both zzso as indicated by a shift in the median zzso marker distribution zzso This increase was more pronounced for automated zzso than for manual zzso However, a detailed statistical analysis carried out between the groups adjusted for zzso value showed no significant difference between the two methods of zzso zzso Similarly, adjusting for length of zzso showed no significant difference between the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso according to the length of time for which zzso was performed showed that both types of zzso led to an increase in the likelihood of successful zzso after increasing zzso of zzso however results were less reliable after longer periods of continuous zzso
