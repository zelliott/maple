In both zzso and zzso cells, gene expression is regulated across the cell cycle to ensure zzso assembly of select cellular structures and molecular zzso However, present in all zzso gene expression zzso is zzso that arises from both systematic error in the cell zzso process and zzso in the timing of cell division at the level of the single zzso Thus, gene or protein expression data collected from a population of synchronized cells is an inaccurate measure of what occurs in the average zzso across a cell zzso Here, we present a general zzso method to extract zzso information from zzso zzso expression zzso This method removes the effects of 1) zzso in growth rate and 2) zzso in the zzso and zzso state of the zzso Moreover, this method represents an advance in the zzso of molecular expression data in its flexibility, minimal zzso and the use of a zzso analysis to determine the appropriate level of zzso zzso our zzso zzso to cell cycle gene expression data from the zzso zzso zzso zzso we recovered critical features of cell cycle regulation in essential zzso including zzso and zzso that were obscured in zzso zzso In doing so, we highlight the problem with using population data alone to decipher cellular regulatory mechanisms and demonstrate how our zzso zzso can be applied to produce a more realistic picture of zzso regulation in a zzso
