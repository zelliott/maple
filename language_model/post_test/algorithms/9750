zzso Carlo simulation is the gold standard method for zzso scattering processes in medical zzso zzso zzso zzso Carlo codes, however, typically use the independent atom approximation zzso This is known to be inaccurate for zzso zzso for many materials, in the forward zzso This work addresses whether the zzso is sufficient for the typical zzso tasks in medical zzso zzso zzso As a means of comparison, we incorporate a more realistic zzso zzso model into a zzso zzso Carlo zzso First, we conduct simulations of scatter from isolated zzso of soft zzso zzso cortical bone and zzso Then, we simulate scatter profiles from a cylinder of water and from zzso of a patient's head, zzso and zzso constructed from zzso CT data zzso Lastly, we reconstruct CT numbers from simulated sets of projection images and investigate the quantitative effects of the zzso We show that the zzso can produce errors of several per cent of the total zzso across a projection image, for typical zzso beams and zzso The errors in reconstructed CT number, however, for the zzso zzso were small (typically zzso 10 zzso The zzso can therefore be considered sufficient for the zzso of scatter correction in CT zzso Where accurate quantitative estimates of scatter in individual projection images are required, however, the appropriate interference functions should be zzso
