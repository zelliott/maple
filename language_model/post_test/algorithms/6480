The prognosis of a tooth affected by zzso may depend on the amount of bone remaining around the root zzso The aim of this study was to find how the surface area of a single root is related to the true thickness data and the calculated thickness data from digital dental zzso 

Eight extracted zzso teeth were digitized zzso for direct surface area zzso Meanwhile, they were also exposed to a digital dental X-ray zzso The true thickness of the tooth root was zzso The estimated circumference data were calculated from both the measured thickness and the thickness estimated from the digital image and then measured and estimated zzso were zzso 

zzso The largest circumference difference mean for measured thickness and for estimated thickness was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The largest zzso confidence zzso for difference means for measured thickness and for estimated thickness was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

When the thickness data are available, the surface area of a zzso tooth can be estimated to an error of less than zzso zzso the root thickness can be derived from the projected zzso image of the zzso However, the error of estimated circumference from digital dental zzso may be over zzso This error can be minimized if the estimated thickness from digital dental zzso can be made more zzso
