To develop a statistic measuring the impact of zzso disease management programs on outcomes for patients with chronic mental illness that allowed for zzso controls to zzso zzso to early gains of treated zzso 

zzso power was estimated from simulated samples representing effect sizes that grew, remained constant, or declined following an initial zzso Estimates were based on the Texas Medication Algorithm Project on adult patients (age zzso or zzso zzso with bipolar disorder zzso zzso zzso who received care between 1998 and 2000 at 1 of 11 clinics across zzso 

Study patients were assessed at baseline and three-month follow-up for a minimum of one zzso Program tracks were assigned by zzso 

zzso linear modeling was modified to account for zzso Outcomes were based on zzso zzso for Depression zzso zzso 

zzso analyses had significantly greater power detecting program differences than traditional growth models in constant and zzso zzso zzso patients with severe depressive symptoms in an zzso disease management program reported fewer symptoms after three months, with zzso controls zzso zzso within one zzso 

In addition to zzso properties, data collection design, and power, investigators should consider how outcomes unfold over time when selecting an appropriate statistic to evaluate service zzso zzso analyses may be zzso to a wide range of treatment and intervention zzso
