zzso instruction may alter knowledge zzso and diagnostic reasoning strategies through the provision of structured knowledge to novice zzso The effects of zzso instruction on diagnostic accuracy and knowledge zzso have not been rigorously zzso 

Year 2 medical students were zzso to learn four cardiac diagnoses using zzso instruction zzso zzso 26) or traditional instruction zzso zzso zzso on a zzso zzso simulator zzso Students completed zzso learning in groups of two to five and underwent individual written and practical zzso The written test consisted of questions testing features that linked or distinguished diagnoses zzso zzso and questions testing features of individual diagnoses zzso zzso A practical test of diagnostic accuracy on the zzso was performed for two diagnoses present in the learning phase zzso zzso and two zzso zzso A majority of students zzso zzso 37, zzso voluntarily returned for follow-up written testing 2-4 weeks zzso 

Learning time and accuracy did not differ between students on zzso and those on traditional zzso Students receiving zzso instruction performed better on structured knowledge questions zzso zzso zzso and no differently on factual knowledge questions zzso zzso zzso Relative differences between groups remained unchanged on follow-up zzso zzso success was higher in the zzso instruction group for taught zzso zzso difference zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso difference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso instruction was associated with improved retention of structured knowledge and diagnostic performance among zzso This study provides important zzso for a zzso approach and suggests there is substantial benefit to using this approach with novice zzso
