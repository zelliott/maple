zzso and climate zzso zzso zzso shifts of river flow zzso However, a theory that identifies the range of foreseen impacts on zzso resulting from zzso zzso and sensitivity zzso across diverse regimes is zzso Here, we derive a measurable index embedding climate and landscape attributes (the ratio of the mean zzso of zzso zzso events and the mean zzso response zzso that discriminates erratic regimes with enhanced zzso zzso zzso from persistent regimes endowed with regular flow zzso zzso and empirical data show that erratic zzso regimes typical of rivers with low mean zzso are resilient in that they hold a reduced sensitivity to climate zzso The distinction between erratic and persistent regimes provides a robust framework for characterizing the hydrology of freshwater zzso and improving water management strategies in times of global zzso
