zzso in the rate and extent of zzso distribution and elimination of ethanol has important ramifications in clinical and legal zzso The speed of zzso of ethanol from the gut depends on time of day, drinking pattern, dosage form, concentration of ethanol in the zzso and particularly the fed or zzso state of the zzso During the zzso phase, a concentration zzso exists between the stomach, portal vein and the peripheral zzso zzso zzso metabolism and zzso are difficult to assess because of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Ethanol is transported by the zzso to all parts of the zzso The rate of zzso is governed by the ratio of blood flow to tissue zzso zzso and zzso zzso differ as a function of time after zzso Ethanol has low zzso in lipids and does not bind to plasma zzso so volume of distribution is closely related to the amount of water in the body, contributing to zzso and age-related differences in zzso The bulk of ethanol zzso zzso is zzso and the remainder is zzso in breath, urine and zzso The zzso step in zzso is conversion of ethanol into zzso by zzso alcohol zzso zzso which has a low zzso constant zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, this zzso displays zzso which accounts for racial and ethnic variations in zzso When a moderate dose is zzso zzso elimination operates for a large part of the zzso time course, since zzso quickly becomes zzso Another zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has a higher zzso zzso zzso and is also zzso so that the clearance of ethanol is increased in heavy zzso Study design influences zzso in blood ethanol zzso zzso or intravenous administration, or fed or zzso state, might require different zzso zzso Recent work supports the need for zzso models to describe the disposition of ethanol instead of the traditional zzso model with zzso zzso Moreover, appropriate statistical analysis is needed to isolate zzso and zzso components of zzso zzso at low blood ethanol zzso improve the zzso of parameters and reduce zzso zzso in ethanol zzso stems from a combination of both genetic and environmental factors, and also from the zzso nature of ethanol zzso experimental design, subject selection strategy and dose zzso More work is needed to document zzso in ethanol zzso in real-world zzso
