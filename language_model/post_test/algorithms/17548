The zzso of reduced unit cells is an important building block for a number of zzso applications, but zzso it is very easy to demonstrate that the conventional zzso of cell reduction zzso is not zzso zzso A zzso stable zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The stability is achieved by consistently using a tolerance in all zzso zzso The tolerance must be greater than the accumulated zzso zzso A second stable zzso is also zzso the minimum reduction, that does not require using a zzso It produces a cell with minimum lengths and all angles acute or zzso The zzso is a simplified and modified version of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso have been enhanced to generate a zzso zzso along with the parameters of the reduced zzso
