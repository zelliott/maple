Some articulated motion representations rely on zzso zzso of the statistical distribution of low-level features such as orientation, color, or zzso zzso As zzso among parts changes with articulated motion, the distribution changes, tracing a trajectory in the zzso space of zzso which we call the zzso zzso These zzso can then be used for recognition using standard techniques such as dynamic time zzso The core theory in this paper concerns embedding the zzso zzso which can be looked upon as probability functions, into a zzso space so that we can estimate various meaningful zzso distances such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso distances based on dot products between points in this zzso Apart from zzso advantages, this representation also zzso zzso matching of motion zzso Speed zzso representations can be formed by zzso the zzso zzso along their arc zzso without using any knowledge of the zzso scale variations between the zzso We experiment with five different zzso distance measures and show the usefulness of the representation in three different zzso recognition (with large number of possible zzso gesture recognition (with person zzso and zzso of zzso interaction sequences (with zzso zzso We find the importance of using the right distance measure for each zzso The zzso embedding makes matching two to three times faster, while achieving recognition zzso that are close to those obtained without using a zzso zzso We also zzso establish the zzso of the representation with respect to low-level zzso embedding zzso and zzso zzso
