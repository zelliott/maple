In this article, we introduce an exploratory framework for learning patterns of conditional zzso in gene expression zzso The main idea behind the proposed approach consists of zzso how the information content shared by a set of M zzso in a network (where each zzso is associated to an expression zzso varies upon conditioning on a set of L conditioning variables (in the simplest case represented by a separate set of expression zzso The method is zzso and it is based on the concept of statistical zzso which, unlike conventional correlation based techniques, is not restricted in scope to linear conditional dependency zzso Moreover, such conditional zzso relationships can potentially indicate regulatory interactions that do not manifest themselves when only zzso relationships are zzso A moment based approximation of the zzso measure is derived that efficiently gets around the problem of zzso zzso zzso probability density functions from the data, a task usually not viable due to the intrinsic sample size limitations that characterize expression level zzso By applying the proposed exploratory method, we analyzed a whole zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and were able to learn statistically significant patterns of conditional zzso A selection of such interactions that carry a meaningful biological interpretation are zzso
