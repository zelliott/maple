To compare zzso terminal zzso zzso zzso during MR zzso zzso with zzso severity of acute inflammation in Crohn's zzso 

A total of 28 Crohn's patients underwent zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso images were supplemented by multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences through the small zzso zzso zzso zzso index zzso was zzso using validated zzso an acute inflammation score zzso zzso was assigned to the zzso Two observers zzso scored mural zzso zzso zzso contrast enhancement and zzso zzso zzso to produce an activity score zzso based on anatomical zzso The association among the zzso zzso and zzso was tested using zzso rank zzso zzso rank sum test compared zzso in subjects with and without zzso zzso 

Mean zzso and mean zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso There was a significant difference in zzso between zzso zzso zzso range zzso and inflamed zzso zzso range zzso zzso zzso and a significant negative correlation between zzso and both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso measures of disease activity and existing anatomical zzso activity zzso 

zzso zzso resonance imaging is increasingly used to assess Crohn's zzso zzso zzso zzso can provide a quantitative assessment of small zzso zzso zzso MR zzso can grade Crohn's zzso zzso Small zzso zzso can be used as a marker of inflammatory zzso
