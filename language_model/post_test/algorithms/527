In the literature of zzso and zzso many studies have shown that both global and local features are crucial for face representation and zzso This paper proposes a novel face recognition method which exploits both global and local zzso zzso In this method, global features are extracted from the whole face images by keeping the zzso zzso of zzso zzso which we believe encodes the holistic facial information, such as facial zzso For local feature zzso zzso zzso are exploited considering their biological zzso After that, zzso linear zzso zzso is separately applied to the global zzso features and each local patch of zzso zzso Thus, multiple zzso zzso are zzso each embodying different facial zzso for face zzso Finally, all these zzso are combined to form a zzso ensemble zzso We evaluate the proposed method using two large-scale face zzso zzso and zzso version zzso zzso show that the results of our method are impressively better than the best known results with the same evaluation zzso
