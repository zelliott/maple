The kinetic analysis of zzso zzso by zzso suggested that zzso binding and release occurred in the multiple steps and such events proceeded zzso However, the crystal structure of the zzso complex reveals that no obvious channel is open enough to allow zzso to pass zzso Thus, an intriguing and important question zzso how zzso enters and exits the active site, which is deeply buried at the center of zzso zzso In this study, geometric analysis of the potential openings was first performed on all the available crystal structures of zzso And then, random acceleration molecular dynamics simulations were used to explore the possible zzso zzso channels in zzso Two channels were most frequently zzso zzso steered molecular dynamics simulations were performed and zzso of mean force were constructed to compare the preference of the two channels serving as the zzso zzso zzso The results showed that channel zzso which is located between zzso I and G and the zzso zzso region, was the most likely channel for zzso zzso The opening of channel zzso was characterized by a rotation of zzso together with a zzso of zzso zzso Our findings will not only be helpful for understanding the zzso mechanism of zzso and for identifying structural zzso related to the biological function of zzso but also provide further insight into the channel selectivity of zzso
