To evaluate the effectiveness of a commercial zzso in reducing zzso treatment uncertainty by gating the radiation zzso 

The gating system considered here measures zzso from the position of a reflective marker on the patient's zzso zzso planning CT scans were obtained for 8 patients (4 zzso 4 zzso at the intended phase of zzso (6 at end expiration and 2 at end zzso In addition, zzso movies were recorded simultaneously with the respiratory zzso During the treatment sessions, gated zzso films were used to measure the position of the zzso relative to the zzso bodies, which was compared to the reference digitally reconstructed zzso derived from the zzso planning zzso zzso was zzso by the standard zzso about the mean zzso We also assessed the zzso zzso of soft tissue structures during gated treatment in 2 patients using an zzso silicon electronic portal imaging zzso 

The gated zzso films revealed an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bars indicate standard zzso in the patient zzso The zzso data yielded a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso With no zzso this zzso excursion became zzso zzso zzso zzso In gated zzso films, the zzso mean displacement of the zzso from the planning position was zzso zzso zzso zzso However, in 4 of the 8 patients, the mean (over zzso films) displacement was zzso zzso indicating a systematic displacement in treatment position from the planned zzso The position of soft tissue features observed in portal images during gated treatments over several zzso showed a mean zzso between zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso however, was between zzso and zzso zzso indicating that most of the zzso was due to patient setup errors rather than to respiratory zzso 

The gating system evaluated here reduces the zzso and zzso zzso of anatomy due to respiratory zzso However, systematic zzso were observed in some cases between the location of an zzso feature at simulation and its location during zzso zzso monitoring is zzso with film or portal zzso
