To review the literature on risk zzso after acute zzso zzso in the zzso era and to propose an zzso for early and continual risk zzso 

A zzso search of the English-language literature on humans was done using the terms zzso zzso prospective studies, and zzso This search was supplemented by narrowed searches for zzso (such as zzso zzso zzso therapy, and stress zzso and surveys of references cited in review articles and book zzso 

Literature on prognosis and zzso zzso published from 1981 to 1996 was zzso From the literature on stress testing methods, studies that enrolled patients before 1980, enrolled patients for indications other than zzso zzso tested patients more than 6 weeks after zzso were missing outcome data, or had inadequate follow-up were zzso 

Because too few zzso trials were available to allow the zzso of zzso methods, the available zzso data were zzso and supplemented with clinical judgments to produce zzso 

zzso zzso must begin when acute zzso zzso is zzso zzso patients (such as those with zzso zzso and candidates for zzso therapy must be identified quickly if ideal emergency care is to be zzso At specific points during zzso specialized tests may be useful if they add incremental information to the results of clinical zzso zzso patients who have complications after zzso or significant left zzso dysfunction probably benefit from early zzso patients without these conditions are at low risk for zzso events and should have zzso stress testing for further risk zzso 

Physicians should continually zzso risk throughout hospitalization to zzso both patient outcomes and cost zzso
