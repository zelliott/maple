Generally accepted reference values in zzso zzso are not valid in zzso fluid zzso containing large amounts of zzso zzso blood may obscure zzso as zzso largely depend on parameters such as cell count, zzso acid and total protein zzso We sought to improve the zzso by evaluating a zzso panel and soluble zzso as markers of zzso In addition, we tested an zzso of established parameters to predict zzso in a specific patient zzso 

Analysis was performed on zzso zzso samples from 50 consecutive zzso Gram zzso zzso culture, total cell count, total protein and zzso expression on zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and soluble zzso were measured by flow zzso 

Positive culture was detected in ten zzso Of all parameters tested only zzso zzso and zzso on zzso were significantly different between zzso and zzso zzso The highest zzso value was obtained when zzso zzso The zzso value of a zzso combination zzso in zzso zzso protein and zzso in zzso zzso was comparable to zzso Half of the patients in this analysis were identified as culture positive because of the lack of inflammatory zzso 

zzso and perhaps also zzso provide very good zzso performance when looking for zzso in patients with residual blood in zzso zzso time is short, and results could be reported within 1 h for 24 h a zzso In some patients application of zzso may result in restricted inflammatory zzso Even in these patients zzso provides a reliable zzso for the immediate diagnosis of zzso
