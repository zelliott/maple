zzso zzso frequency zzso radio devices are being employed in both humans and animals for zzso and zzso zzso This paper describes the experimental measurement and electromagnetic modeling of propagation from zzso and zzso sources placed in the human zzso zzso homogeneous and zzso software models were constructed using data from the Visible Human zzso zzso radiation efficiencies for a zzso placed zzso source were calculated using zzso zzso and ranged between zzso and zzso zzso to net body losses of between zzso and zzso zzso Greater losses were encountered at zzso zzso with efficiencies between zzso and zzso zzso body loss ranging between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were in good agreement with simulations, to within 2 zzso at zzso zzso and 3 zzso at zzso zzso The degree of zzso for zzso models was found to have a minimal effect on calculated zzso radiation patterns and zzso radiation efficiency, provided the region surrounding the implanted source was sufficiently zzso
