To evaluate a photographic procedure for zzso of the zzso distribution of zzso zzso density in normal pediatric zzso 

zzso blue zzso zzso and green zzso zzso photographic images were aligned and zzso to generate optical density difference zzso An 8 degrees zzso 8 degrees area concentric with the zzso was zzso zzso zzso were fitted through the zzso along the vertical and horizontal zzso The peak density and full zzso at half maximum zzso were zzso The subjects zzso zzso 23; median age zzso zzso had normal eyes and good zzso 

The peak zzso zzso zzso density was zzso zzso zzso density units zzso which is at the lower end of the range previously obtained by other zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso The zzso ranged was zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso Neither zzso nor zzso varied significantly with zzso 

The photographic method is feasible and provides quantitative assessment of zzso properties of zzso zzso in young zzso Future application to clinical studies of pediatric patients is zzso
