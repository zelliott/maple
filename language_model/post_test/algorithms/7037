A rational strategy for the automated detection of artifacts in heart period data is outlined and zzso The specific zzso of this approach for heart period data is based on the distribution characteristics of successive heart period zzso Because zzso differences generated by artifacts are large, relative to normal heart period zzso extreme differences between successive heart periods serve to identify potential zzso Critical to this approach are: 1) the derivation of the artifact criterion from the distribution of beat differences of the individual subject, and 2) the use of zzso distribution indexes, which are less sensitive to corruption by the presence of zzso values than are zzso zzso The artifact zzso were able to effectively identify zzso beats embedded in heart period records, flagging each of the zzso simulated and actual artifacts in data sets derived from both humans and zzso At the same time, the artifact zzso yielded a false alarm rate of less than zzso Although the present zzso was restricted to heart period data, the outlined approach to artifact detection may also be zzso to other biological zzso
