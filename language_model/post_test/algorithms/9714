Human movement models often divide movements into zzso In walking, the stride can be segmented into four different parts, and in golf and other sports, the swing is divided into sections based on the primary direction of zzso These parts are often divided based on key events, also called zzso zzso When analyzing a movement, it is important to correctly locate these key events, and so automated techniques are zzso There exist many methods for dividing specific actions using data from specific sensors, but for new sensors or sensing positions, new techniques must be zzso We introduce a generic method for zzso zzso extraction called the hidden zzso event model based on hidden zzso zzso Our method zzso the state structure to facilitate precise location of key zzso This method can be quickly adapted to new movements and new zzso zzso Furthermore, it zzso well to subjects not used for zzso A zzso zzso technique using genetic zzso is applied to decrease error and increase zzso zzso Further, collaborative techniques are zzso We validate this method on a walking zzso by using zzso sensors placed on various locations on a human zzso Our technique is designed to be zzso complex for training, but zzso simple at zzso to allow deployment on zzso sensor zzso
