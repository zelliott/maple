This study examines the data from single loop detectors on northbound zzso zzso in San Jose, California to estimate real-time crash risk assessment zzso 

The zzso tree and neural network based crash risk assessment models developed with data from zzso zzso are applied to data from the same freeway, as well as to the data from nearby segments of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The performance of crash risk assessment models on these nearby segments is the focus of this zzso 

The model applications show that it is in fact possible to use the same model for multiple zzso as the underlying relationships between traffic data and crash risk remain zzso 

The framework provided here may be helpful to authorities for freeway segments with newly installed traffic surveillance zzso since the real-time crash risk assessment models from nearby zzso with existing infrastructure would be able to provide a reasonable estimate of crash zzso The zzso of the model output is also assessed by location, time of day, and day of zzso The analysis shows that on some locations the models may require further learning due to higher than expected false positive zzso the zzso interchange on zzso zzso or false negative zzso The approach for zzso the results from the model provides ideas to refine the model prior to or during the zzso
