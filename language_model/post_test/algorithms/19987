We describe the application of a novel zzso zzso testing zzso to determine the primary efficacy zzso in a large Phase III zzso zzso zzso women were enrolled between 2005 and zzso Of these women, zzso zzso had at least one positive zzso rapid test after zzso This triggered the use of the zzso which made use of zzso serum and zzso zzso zzso The overall sample set was zzso zzso zzso zzso of the rapid test positive samples were confirmed as primary zzso using a combination of zzso for the detection of zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso and for components of the virus itself zzso for the detection of zzso acids and zzso for zzso zzso 63 zzso cases were confirmed as being zzso at screening or zzso and 55 zzso were confirmed as zzso zzso The testing zzso confirmed the zzso at the same visit as that of the first positive rapid test in zzso of cases and at the time of the preceding visit in zzso of zzso Of the 63 cases which were subsequently confirmed to be zzso positive at or before zzso 54 specimens contained no zzso zzso zzso at screening or zzso However, 43 were positive using an zzso which detects both zzso zzso and zzso and also had a positive zzso zzso or zzso zzso test, which was highly suggestive of acute zzso There were 6 unusual cases which had zzso zzso DNA or zzso In 4 of the 6 cases the presence of zzso zzso was confirmed by Western zzso One of these cases with an indeterminate Western zzso was a previous vaccine trial zzso The zzso served the objectives of the study well and can be recommended for use in determining zzso as an zzso in clinical zzso
