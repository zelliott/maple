zzso zzso transfer increases the observed nuclear zzso enhancement zzso between two zzso in many cases, leading to an zzso of target zzso zzso distance bounds are necessary to account for this zzso However, this leads to a loss of information and may reduce the quality of the structures generated from the zzso zzso Although several methods for spin diffusion correction have been published, they are often not employed to derive distance zzso This prompted us to write a zzso and zzso method to correct for spin diffusion that is fully integrated in our program ambiguous restraints for zzso assignment zzso zzso thus allows automated zzso zzso assignment and structure calculation with spin diffusion corrected zzso The method relies on zzso integration of the coupled differential equations which govern relaxation by zzso zzso and sparse zzso zzso We derive a correction factor for the distance restraints from calculated zzso volumes and zzso zzso To evaluate the impact of our spin diffusion zzso we tested the new zzso process extensively with data from the zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso By comparing structures refined with and without spin diffusion zzso we show that spin diffusion corrected distance restraints give rise to structures of higher quality zzso fewer zzso violations and a more regular zzso zzso Furthermore, spin diffusion correction permits the use of tighter error bounds which improves the distinction between signal and noise in an automated zzso assignment zzso
