We give a simple zzso model of zzso zzso zzso zzso addressing the electronic zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso band in zzso zzso The model is given in terms of the integrated line strength, zzso and first zzso zzso for the zzso zzso line shape zzso Although the two states addressed respond differently to the magnetic field (they adhere to the dissimilar zzso zzso zzso it is shown that the technique shares some properties with zzso when zzso zzso are zzso the line shapes have a similar form and the signal strength has an analogous magnetic field and pressure zzso The differences are that the maximum signal appears for larger magnetic field zzso and pressures, zzso G and zzso zzso zzso
