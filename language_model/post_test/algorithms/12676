In this study, quantitative zzso models are developed for modeling and predicting both zzso zzso activity and oral zzso of novel zzso The models developed are thoroughly discussed to identify the key components that influence the zzso activity and oral zzso of the selected zzso These selected zzso serve as a first zzso for the design of novel and potent zzso zzso with desired zzso zzso
