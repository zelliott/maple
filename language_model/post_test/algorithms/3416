zzso were isolated from male zzso mice and mounted on a small vessel wire zzso for zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso were inhibited with high affinity by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and with low affinity by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso produced only a small reduction in the maximum response to zzso zzso to electrical field stimulation were also inhibited with high affinity by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were sensitive to zzso zzso at low zzso of stimulation zzso at 2 zzso zzso but not at high zzso zzso at 20 zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso to zzso and zzso zzso in mouse zzso small arteries are zzso mainly by zzso zzso are not involved in responses to zzso zzso but appear to be activated by zzso released zzso at a low frequency of zzso
