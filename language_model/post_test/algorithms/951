The success in utilizing in zzso zzso to identify and/or monitor zzso abnormalities will be determined in large part on the reliability with which the spectral parameters of the zzso present can be zzso For these reasons it is clear that there is a need for the development of zzso with which to obtain zzso reliable estimates of the spectral parameters of the zzso zzso In this report we describe an adaptation of the zzso zzso which we have found useful in fitting in zzso spectral data in the frequency zzso This zzso zzso was implemented on an zzso AT compatible zzso We evaluated the zzso zzso on three representative kinds of spectral zzso a simulated spectrum, zzso spectrum of normal calf muscle, and the zzso spectrum of a pediatric patient with a brain zzso In each case we generated a set of zzso by adding varying amounts of zzso On the basis of our simulations and the two examples discussed, we conclude that the zzso method generates parameters which are reliable estimates of the areas of the zzso present when the zzso is above zzso for zzso We found that the speed of convergence of the zzso was improved by overestimating the zzso of the zzso zzso We also found that the method zzso more rapidly in the presence of a moderate amount of zzso We conclude that the zzso described here can provide a robust method with which to analyze in zzso zzso in a quantitative zzso Because the method requires little user intervention, it lends itself to zzso in a zzso or fully, automated zzso
