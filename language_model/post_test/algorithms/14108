In order to segment the blurred image with large noise, the authors propose a new zzso image zzso method based on generalized fuzzy Gibbs random zzso Based on the generalized fuzzy set, the new method introduces generalized fuzzy membership into Gibbs potential function and the potential function is zzso to obtain the new zzso zzso The optimal processing is executed through zzso conditional modes zzso The experiment results showed that the new approach could effectively segment the zzso zzso
