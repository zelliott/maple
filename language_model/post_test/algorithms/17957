Fluorescence and circular zzso zzso were used to study the effect of two zzso having zzso charged head groups - zzso zzso ammonium zzso zzso and zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso - on the structure of the zzso zzso proteins alpha s-, zzso and zzso Although zzso proteins are generally known to zzso on interacting with zzso the zzso were found to adopt more ordered zzso in presence of both zzso and zzso The folding induced by zzso was more efficient than by zzso as implied by the zzso of zzso and circular zzso zzso of the zzso in solutions containing varying zzso of the zzso The differential response of the proteins to the two zzso may lie in the fact that the zzso charged zzso experience a repulsive zzso interaction with the zzso charged head groups of zzso while their interaction with the positively charged head groups of zzso is attractive in zzso Our results are consistent with two different types of the zzso and zzso model for the structure of zzso zzso while groups of zzso molecules zzso tail first around exposed zzso surfaces of the zzso to form zzso structures, the protein itself wraps around zzso zzso of zzso that have zzso head groups in close association with its zzso zzso zzso
