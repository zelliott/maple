There are a number of licensed databases that assign biological activities to zzso zzso The zzso Drug Data Report zzso compiled from the patent literature, is a popular zzso It contains several hundred distinct activities, some of which are therapeutic areas zzso zzso and some of which are related to specific zzso or receptors zzso zzso zzso There are several data mining applications where it would be useful to calculate a similarity between any two zzso Two distinct activity labels can have a significant similarity for a number of reasons: two activities can be nearly synonymous zzso zzso B zzso vs zzso zzso one activity may be a subset of another zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso or an activity can be the mechanism by which another activity works zzso zzso inhibitor vs zzso zzso In an ideal world, similarities for two activities could be calculated simply by comparing the compounds they have in common, but in zzso databases such as the zzso the assignment of activities to compounds are inevitably inconsistent and zzso We propose a number of methods of calculating zzso similarities that hopefully compensate for errors in zzso Two of these, zzso and trend zzso show zzso Soft zzso of the activities using a union of similarity methods shows a reasonable association of therapeutic areas with their zzso
