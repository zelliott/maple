The zzso prediction of zzso zzso zzso involvement and the avoidance of otherwise futile and potentially zzso definitive local therapy is paramount in men with newly diagnosed prostate zzso To identify patients with prostate zzso who likely have zzso zzso involvement and would benefit from staging zzso prior to definitive local therapy, the authors compared the ability of several zzso staging zzso and a zzso zzso zzso scan to predict zzso zzso prior to zzso 

Between August 1991 and June 1994, 198 men with clinical zzso or zzso classified zzso prostate zzso zzso scan zzso who were at high risk of zzso zzso involvement underwent a zzso zzso scan prior to staging zzso Several zzso models based on zzso prostate specific zzso level, biopsy zzso score, and clinical stage were selected to predict those men having a zzso or zzso probability of zzso zzso zzso The ability to predict zzso stage using several clinical zzso and the zzso zzso scan was compared with zzso examination of the zzso zzso 

Overall, zzso of the pelvic zzso zzso specimens were positive for zzso disease by zzso zzso Published zzso predicting zzso zzso zzso had a positive zzso value zzso ranging from zzso to zzso and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso ranging from zzso to zzso The zzso zzso scan had a zzso of zzso and an zzso of zzso The differences between the zzso and the zzso for the individual clinical zzso when compared with zzso were statistically zzso Combining the zzso zzso zzso scan with clinical zzso models, a zzso of up to zzso could be zzso 

These data suggest that the zzso for the clinical zzso zzso are similar and that the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso scan alone or in combination with the zzso has additional value in predicting zzso zzso involvement in prostate zzso patients at high risk of regional disease zzso These zzso and the zzso zzso scan may be used for the appropriate selection of candidates for definitive local therapy in men with clinically localized prostate zzso and significant risk of zzso zzso zzso
