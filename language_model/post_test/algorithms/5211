zzso zzso zzso zzso pulse design is a difficult problem, due to the zzso response of zzso to applied zzso at large zzso In parallel zzso zzso zzso pulse design is further complicated by the possibility for transmit field patterns to change between subjects, requiring zzso to be designed rapidly while a subject lies in the zzso To accelerate pulse design, we introduce a fast version of the optimal control method for zzso parallel zzso The new method is based on a novel approach to zzso zzso the Bloch equation about a zzso zzso pulse, which results in an approximate linear model for the zzso created by adding a zzso pulse to a zzso zzso The linear model can be evaluated rapidly using zzso fast zzso zzso and we apply it zzso to produce a sequence of pulse updates that improve zzso zzso We achieve drastic reductions in design time and memory requirements compared to conventional optimal control, while producing zzso of similar zzso The new method can also compensate for zzso such as main field zzso
