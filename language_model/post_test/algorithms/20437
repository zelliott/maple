zzso is zzso protein that forms a large zzso zzso channel in the inner membrane of zzso zzso Since zzso is gated by tension transmitted through the zzso zzso we have been able to measure its gating parameters as a function of absolute zzso Using zzso zzso zzso in zzso we recorded single channel currents and varied the pressure zzso zzso to vary the tension zzso The tension was calculated from P and the radius of zzso was obtained using video zzso of the zzso The probability of being open zzso has a steep zzso dependence on zzso with a zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso slope sensitivity of zzso was zzso zzso per zzso Assuming a zzso distribution, the energy difference between the closed and fully open states in the zzso membrane was zzso zzso zzso zzso If the zzso arises from tension acting on a change of zzso area zzso the free energy, zzso would zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is not a zzso channel, but has four conducting states and a closed zzso Most transition rates are independent of tension, but the zzso step to opening is the transition between the closed state and the lowest zzso zzso This transition thus involves the greatest zzso When summed over all zzso the zzso area change from closed to fully open was 6 zzso agreeing with the value obtained in the two-state zzso Assuming a zzso channel, the dimensions of the zzso zzso pore were comparable to zzso Thus, the tension dependence of channel gating is primarily one of increasing the external channel area to accommodate the pore of the smallest conducting zzso The higher conducting states appear to involve zzso changes internal to the channel that don't involve changes in zzso
