We seek in this paper to differentiate driven zzso systems using only a single output signal from the driven zzso We do not have access to the driving zzso We demonstrate the phase space identification techniques with an experimental model of a radio zzso We restrict the driving signals to nearly periodic signals, because these types of signals are the most common signals used in real zzso We find that by studying our zzso as a driven zzso system, we are able to distinguish one zzso from zzso This work may have consequences for real zzso
