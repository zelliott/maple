A fixed zzso zzso version of the kinetic method was applied to zzso simple, and accurate zzso analysis of zzso which is an important drug used for treatment of Parkinson's zzso zzso charged clusters containing the transition metal zzso zzso zzso zzso which serve as a fixed zzso some zzso acid as a reference, and the zzso zzso were generated by zzso zzso The cluster zzso of interest was zzso and the zzso of its competitive zzso zzso was investigated in an zzso trap mass zzso The zzso selectivity zzso the ratio of the two zzso zzso zzso when the cluster contains one pure zzso of the zzso expressed relative to that for the other zzso varies with fixed zzso references, and transition zzso zzso discrimination was zzso in zzso as a FL, zzso and zzso as a reference, and zzso as a central metal zzso zzso zzso of the zzso composition of zzso were achieved using zzso zzso zzso The linear relationship between the zzso of the zzso zzso abundance ratio zzso zzso and zzso compositions zzso of the zzso allows the determination of the zzso purity of zzso zzso
