zzso of structural classes plays an important role in understanding protein folding zzso In this paper, features based on the predicted secondary structure sequence and the corresponding zzso sequence are zzso Then, an zzso feature zzso is selected based on a wrapper feature selection zzso and a support zzso machine zzso Among the 11 selected features, 4 novel features are newly designed to model the differences between zzso class and zzso class, and other 7 rational features are proposed by previous zzso To examine the performance of our method, a total of 5 zzso are used to design and test the proposed zzso The results show that competitive prediction zzso can be achieved by the proposed method compared to existing methods zzso zzso and zzso and 4 new features are demonstrated essential to differentiate zzso and zzso zzso zzso version of the proposed method is written in zzso language and it can be downloaded from zzso
