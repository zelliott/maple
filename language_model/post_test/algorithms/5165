The purpose of this study was to improve estimated birth weight zzso determination in zzso fetuses zzso fetal weight zzso zzso by application of a correction factor to the zzso projection zzso zzso 

A review was performed of 411 singleton zzso delivered at zzso On the basis of zzso examinations previously performed between zzso and zzso zzso zzso an zzso was calculated for each patient by the GAP method zzso Using linear regression, a correction factor was developed that minimized the systematic error in the zzso The model was then tested zzso on a second group of 317 zzso 

The GAP method systematically overestimated weights of the heavier fetuses in our zzso The model we derived showed improved accuracy compared with the GAP zzso When applied to a second group of 317 patients, our correction to the GAP method improved specificity for zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differently, the zzso rate was reduced from zzso to zzso The difference in sensitivity for zzso was not zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Application of our model to our study population reduced the number of zzso results for fetal zzso
