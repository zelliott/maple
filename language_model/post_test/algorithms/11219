zzso available zzso plastic zzso used in zzso zzso zzso zzso usually have thick plastic walls, separating their content from the background zzso These zzso walls can modify the intensity values of neighboring active regions due to the partial volume effect, resulting in errors in the zzso of standardized zzso zzso Numerous papers suggest that this is an issue for phantom work simulating tumor zzso quality control, and zzso zzso This study aims to investigate the influence of the cold plastic wall thickness on the zzso of zzso on the image activity recovery and on the performance of advanced automatic zzso zzso for the zzso of active regions zzso by plastic zzso 

A commercial set of six spheres of different diameters was zzso using a manufacturing technique which achieves a reduction in plastic walls thickness of up to zzso while keeping the same internal zzso Both sets of zzso and zzso zzso were zzso simultaneously in a custom phantom for six different zzso zzso zzso values were compared in terms of mean and maximum standardized zzso values zzso in the spheres and mean zzso of the hottest 1 zzso region zzso zzso and zzso The recovery zzso zzso was also derived for each zzso The results were compared against the values predicted by a theoretical model of the zzso profiles for the same zzso ratios zzso sphere sizes, and wall zzso In addition, ten automatic zzso methods, written in house, were applied to both zzso and zzso zzso The contours obtained were compared to zzso zzso derived gold standard zzso zzso using five different accuracy zzso 

The zzso results showed that zzso zzso achieved significantly higher zzso zzso and zzso values (up to zzso zzso and zzso higher, zzso compared to zzso zzso which was in agreement with the zzso This effect decreased with increasing sphere size and zzso and resulted in substantial zzso differences between zzso and zzso zzso for spheres up to 30 zzso diameter and TBR up to zzso zzso plastic walls were also shown to significantly improve the zzso accuracy for the majority of the zzso methods tested, by increasing the proportion of zzso zzso zzso although the errors in image zzso remained zzso 

This study zzso the significant effect of a zzso reduction in the thickness of insert walls on zzso zzso and zzso boundary zzso Mean zzso inside the zzso and recovery zzso were particularly affected by the presence of thick cold walls, as predicted by a theoretical zzso The accuracy of some zzso zzso was also significantly improved by the introduction of thin wall zzso instead of thick wall zzso This study demonstrates the risk of errors zzso from the use of cold wall zzso to assess and compare the performance of PET zzso zzso
