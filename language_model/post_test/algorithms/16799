zzso zzso are vital to design precise computer aided diagnosis zzso zzso zzso performances of machine learning zzso are sensitive to the characteristics of zzso In this zzso determining the relevant and zzso features is a key step to improve performance of zzso There are various feature extraction methods in the zzso However, there is no universal variable selection zzso that performs well in every data analysis zzso Random zzso zzso an ensemble of trees, is used in zzso studies zzso The success of zzso zzso makes it eligible to be used as kernel of a wrapper feature subset zzso We used best first search zzso wrapper zzso to select optimal features of four medical zzso colon cancer, leukemia cancer, breast cancer and lung zzso We compared zzso of 15 widely used zzso trained with all features versus to extracted features of each zzso The experimental results demonstrated the efficiency of proposed feature extraction strategy with the increase in most of the zzso zzso of the zzso
