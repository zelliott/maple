We report an extension of the smoothed profile method zzso zzso zzso zzso Kim, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso E 26, zzso zzso a direct zzso simulation method for calculating the complex zzso of the zzso of zzso in which we introduce a temporally zzso external force into the zzso The zzso of the method was examined by evaluating the storage zzso and loss zzso zzso of a system composed of identical zzso particles dispersed in an zzso zzso host fluid at volume zzso of zzso zzso 0 , zzso zzso and zzso The zzso were evaluated at several zzso of zzso zzso the zzso flow used here has a zzso profile, as is consistent with the usual periodic boundary zzso The simulation results were compared with several experiments for zzso zzso of zzso zzso
