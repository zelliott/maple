In this paper, a new data zzso storage that is zzso adapted to the work load changes is zzso The proposed data zzso storage distributes the load of hot spot areas to neighboring sensor zzso by using a zzso grid zzso The proposed method is also able to use existing zzso protocols such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with small zzso Through zzso the proposed method enhances the lifetime of sensor networks over one of the state-of-the-art data zzso zzso We implement the proposed method based on an operating system for sensor networks, and evaluate the performance through running based on a simulation zzso
