Rates of zzso zzso in zzso undisturbed marine sediments were measured using the whole core injection method to assess microbial natural zzso activity as a function of zzso zzso zzso sediments were sampled from Eagle Harbor, a marine zzso site in Puget zzso zzso show significant zzso activities zzso zzso in the zzso horizons from 0 to 10 zzso The purpose and scope of this paper is to evaluate the range of experimental conditions giving valid results; a mathematical simulation described competing contaminant zzso diffusion and simultaneous zzso zzso zzso both retarded by zzso The effect of aging was examined with two zzso models in presumed zzso sediments having effective zzso The simulation predictions provide quantitative guidelines for the successful use of the whole core injection zzso zzso The effective zzso constant zzso in zzso is increased by a large partition zzso zzso between zzso and water and makes the apparent zzso zzso approach zzso zzso zzso When zzso zzso zzso the measured zzso zzso extent is biased by zzso distributed injected zzso only when less than zzso of the zzso horizon is initially zzso and mixed with injected zzso zzso A short incubation time zzso zzso is necessary when a mobile zzso zzso gaseous zzso is zzso For longer incubation times, predictions show that a zzso indicator zzso to adjacent zzso thus zzso the depth profile of zzso zzso This method employing a zzso zzso provides accurate zzso rates for freshly contaminated zzso and represents an upper limit to the natural zzso zzso zzso if the contaminant is aged over 50 zzso
