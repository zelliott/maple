A new general linear model zzso zzso method is described for processing zzso zzso zzso A standard zzso zzso is used to determine the time course of zzso zzso for each point in a zzso source zzso A zzso transform gives the envelope of zzso activity at each location in any chosen frequency band (not necessary in the case of sustained zzso zzso enabling the general linear model to be applied and a zzso T statistic image to be zzso The new method is illustrated by a zzso simulation zzso field and 20 zzso and is shown to provide accurate zzso The method is also shown to locate accurately the increasing and decreasing gamma activities to the zzso and frontal zzso respectively, in the case of a scintillating zzso The new method brings the advantages of the general linear model to the analysis of zzso data and should prove useful for the zzso of changing patterns of activity across all frequency ranges including DC zzso zzso
