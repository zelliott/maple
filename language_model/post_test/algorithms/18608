This paper investigates the absolute exponential stability of a general class of delayed neural networks, which require the zzso functions to be partially zzso continuous and monotone zzso only, but not necessarily zzso or zzso Three new sufficient conditions are derived to ascertain whether or not the equilibrium points of the delayed neural networks with zzso diagonally stable zzso zzso are absolutely zzso stable by using delay zzso inequality and zzso zzso The stability criteria are also suitable for delayed zzso neural networks and delayed cellular neural networks whose zzso functions are often zzso or zzso The results zzso answer a question: if a neural network without any delay is absolutely zzso stable, then under what additional conditions, the neural networks with delay is also absolutely zzso zzso
