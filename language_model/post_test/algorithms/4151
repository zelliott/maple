zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso technique with blood zzso level dependent zzso contrast is a powerful tool for zzso mapping of brain function under task and resting zzso The removal of zzso and zzso zzso noise in zzso data has been a significant challenge as zzso studies seek to achieve higher spatial resolutions and characterize more subtle zzso zzso The low zzso sampling rate of most zzso zzso experiments often causes zzso of zzso noise into the frequency range of zzso zzso zzso In addition, changes of heartbeat and zzso patterns also generate zzso fluctuations that have similar zzso with zzso zzso Most existing zzso zzso methods either place restrictive limitations on image acquisition or zzso filtering or zzso based zzso zzso which cannot distinguish the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso In this work, we address the challenge of zzso noise removal via the kernel machine technique, where a zzso kernel machine technique, kernel principal component analysis, is used with a specifically identified kernel function to differentiate zzso signal from the zzso noise of the zzso The proposed method was evaluated in human zzso data acquired from multiple zzso and resting state zzso zzso A comparison study was also performed with an existing zzso filtering zzso The results indicate that the proposed method can effectively identify and reduce the zzso noise in zzso zzso The comparison study shows that the proposed method can provide comparable or better noise removal performance than the zzso filtering zzso
