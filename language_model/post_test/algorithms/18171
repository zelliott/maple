The untranslated regions zzso of many zzso contain sequence and structural motifs that are used to regulate the stability, zzso and zzso of the zzso It should be possible to discover previously unidentified zzso regulatory motifs by examining many related zzso zzso which are assumed to contain a common zzso This is a general practice for discovery of zzso zzso patterns, in which alignment tools are heavily zzso However, because of the complexity of sequential and structural components of zzso zzso zzso tools are frequently zzso The consensus sequences they find frequently have the potential for significant zzso at any given position and are only loosely zzso The development of zzso discovery tools that zzso and integrate structural information into motif discovery is both necessary and zzso Here, we provide a selected list of existing zzso zzso for the discovery of zzso zzso which, although not zzso represents the current state of the zzso To facilitate the development, zzso and training of new software programs that identify zzso zzso we created the zzso training zzso zzso database, which is a collection of validated sets of sequences containing zzso defined regulatory zzso zzso zzso training sets have been generated with associated indexes and zzso zzso provided that identify where the previously characterized zzso motif zzso iron responsive element zzso zzso zzso element zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso resides in each zzso The zzso zzso collection is a shared resource that is available to researchers for software development and as a research zzso
