The aim of the project was to develop a novel method for diabetic zzso screening based on the examination of tear fluid zzso zzso In order to evaluate the zzso of protein zzso for zzso purposes several different approaches were used, including machine learning zzso 

All persons involved in the study had zzso zzso zzso zzso was diagnosed by capturing zzso zzso images, evaluated by two independent zzso 165 eyes were examined (from 119 zzso 55 were diagnosed healthy and 110 images showed signs of zzso zzso samples were taken from all eyes and state-of-the-art zzso coupled zzso mass zzso protein identification was performed on all zzso zzso of protein zzso was evaluated by six different zzso zzso machine learning zzso Support zzso Machine, zzso zzso Random Forest, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Out of the six investigated machine learning zzso the result of zzso zzso proved to be the most zzso The performance of the system realizing the above zzso reached zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso selected and classified with machine learning zzso alone are at present not recommended for screening purposes because of low specificity and sensitivity zzso This tool can be potentially used to improve the results of image processing methods as a complementary tool in automatic or semiautomatic zzso
