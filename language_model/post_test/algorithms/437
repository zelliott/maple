The objective of this paper is to introduce a zzso zzso for word zzso as an extension of the zzso zzso factor analysis zzso zzso , zzso It is shown that this extended zzso supports even the more complex model of signals that are supposed to be related to zzso zzso It is hypothesized that every topic in zzso data is characterized by a set of words which zzso appear in documents dedicated to a given zzso The appearance of each word in a document is coded by the activity of a particular zzso In accordance with the zzso learning rule implemented in the network, sets of zzso appearing words zzso as zzso create tightly connected groups of zzso zzso revealing them as zzso of the network zzso The found factors are eliminated from the network memory by the zzso zzso rule zzso the search of other zzso Topics related to the found sets of words can be identified based on the zzso zzso To make the method complete, a special technique based on a zzso procedure has been developed for the following purposes: first, to provide a complete description of factors in terms of component zzso and second, to enhance the accuracy of zzso of signals to determine whether it contains the zzso Since it is assumed that every word may possibly contribute to several topics, the proposed method might be related to the method of fuzzy zzso In this paper, we show that the results of zzso factor analysis and fuzzy zzso are not contradictory, but zzso To demonstrate the capabilities of this attempt, the method is applied to two types of zzso data on neural networks in two different zzso The obtained topics and corresponding words are at a good level of agreement despite the fact that identical topics in Russian and English conferences contain different sets of zzso
