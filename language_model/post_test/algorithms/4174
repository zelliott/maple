The zzso middle cerebral artery zzso dot sign representing a zzso is one of the important zzso zzso zzso findings for acute stroke on zzso CT zzso Our purpose in this study was to develop an automated method for detection of the zzso dot sign of acute stroke on zzso CT zzso The zzso of the method which we developed consisted of 5 major steps: extraction of the zzso zzso region, initial identification of zzso dots based on the zzso zzso zzso feature extraction of candidates, elimination of false zzso zzso by use of a zzso zzso and zzso of candidates using a support zzso machine zzso zzso with four zzso Our database comprised 297 CT images obtained from seven patients with the zzso dot zzso The performance of this scheme for zzso of the zzso dot sign was evaluated by means of a zzso out zzso The performance of the zzso by use of the zzso achieved a maximum sensitivity of zzso zzso at a zzso rate of zzso per zzso The sensitivity for detection of the zzso dot sign was zzso zzso with a zzso rate of zzso per zzso The method we developed has the potential to detect the zzso dot sign of acute stroke on zzso CT zzso
