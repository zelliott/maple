In this initial report, an imaging technique is described for automatically zzso the walls of a blood vessel during zzso zzso and hence automatically adjusting the position of the sample zzso The method reduces the inherently two-dimensional edge detection problem to a one-dimensional one, and zzso over several imaging frames to zzso the zzso The orientation and diameter of the vessel are also zzso The technique has been clinically tested zzso and is particularly zzso to zzso zzso flow zzso
