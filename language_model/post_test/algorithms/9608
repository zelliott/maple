zzso sensory integration between the auditory and visual systems has long been a topic of interest in cognitive zzso but zzso cortical zzso under audiovisual stimulation is still poorly zzso In this letter, zzso spectral analysis, specifically partial directed zzso zzso is used to study the cortical zzso zzso network under audiovisual cognitive processes within the time window of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso potential zzso A total of 13 subjects zzso zzso years; zzso zzso zzso performed an audiovisual recognition zzso zzso zzso signals were analyzed using an zzso zzso zzso model to identify zzso influences between different cortical zzso Three different cortical zzso networks were zzso and by comparing the cortical zzso network in the early cognitive process of audiovisual zzso perception with that in zzso situations zzso or zzso it was found that the left zzso zzso zzso might be responsible for audiovisual zzso Such zzso findings were highly consistent with previous functional zzso zzso Moreover, the results presented here show the dynamics of lateral zzso influences during audiovisual zzso
