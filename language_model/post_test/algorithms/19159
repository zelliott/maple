This article tackles the registration of zzso biomedical images zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our goal is to adequately match anatomical features of interest without inducing biologically improbable tissue zzso We observe that the large variety of registration zzso volume zzso zzso molecular zzso zzso a no less diverse set of requirements in terms of accuracy and zzso In turn, these directly translate into zzso constraints on the deformation model, which should zzso be zzso by the zzso We propose an zzso zzso approach where the rigidity constraints are informed by the registration application at hand and whose support is controlled by the geometry of the images to be zzso For each site of a sparse lattice over which a displacement field has been zzso our zzso estimates, in a robust fashion, a rigid or zzso transformation within a circular zzso cut to fit the local geometry around the zzso We investigate the zzso of this technique and discuss its sensitivity to the rigidity zzso
