zzso image registration zzso was widely used in radiation therapy, such as in automatic zzso generation, dose zzso tumor growth or zzso zzso To achieve higher registration accuracy and faster zzso an improved zzso zzso registration zzso was proposed and zzso Based on zzso et zzso zzso constancy assumption and zzso efficient zzso zzso zzso algorithm, a zzso value zzso similarity term and a transformation error term were added into the demons energy function, and a formula was derived to calculate the update of transformation zzso The limited zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso the energy function so that the iteration number could be determined zzso The proposed zzso was validated using zzso zzso images and physically zzso phantom zzso Compared with the original zzso zzso algorithm, the registration method proposed achieve a higher precision and a faster convergence zzso Due to the influence of different scanning conditions in zzso radiation, the density range of the treatment image and the planning image may be zzso In such a case, the improved demons zzso can achieve faster and more accurate zzso
