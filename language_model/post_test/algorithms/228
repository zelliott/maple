The purpose of this study was to develop a panoramic zzso display technique, the band view, which causes minimal image zzso and to determine its feasibility as a zzso primary three-dimensional review method of CT zzso zzso Image distortion was compared between the band view and four other three-dimensional review modes using ten zzso and ten zzso zzso generated zzso zzso performance and interpretation time were compared between the band view and the conventional zzso view by two independent readers in 52 patients who underwent zzso and zzso on the same zzso Mean image distortion index values, in which 1 indicates no distortion and the larger value represents greater zzso were significantly smaller with the band view zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso than with the filet view zzso and zzso or the virtual colon dissection zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity for detecting zzso zzso zzso or zzso 6 zzso did not zzso but the mean interpretation time was significantly shorter with the band view than with the conventional zzso view by zzso and zzso minutes in readers 1 and 2, respectively zzso zzso zzso The band view can be a zzso alternative for primary three-dimensional review of zzso
