This paper considers the control problem of a class of uncertain switched systems defined on zzso sets known as zzso linear systems where, instead of the conventional zzso solutions, zzso solutions are zzso In other words, in contrast to the previous studies, solutions with infinite switching in finite time along the zzso and on faces of arbitrary dimensions are also taken into zzso zzso established upon previous studies, a set of linear zzso zzso are brought forward which determines the zzso stability of zzso linear systems with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inequality conditions for zzso a robust controller with a guaranteed zzso performance are zzso Furthermore, these results has been generalized to the case of zzso zzso zzso Finally, a zzso iteration zzso is proposed to deal with the aforementioned zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the proposed method is verified through the analysis of two simulation zzso
