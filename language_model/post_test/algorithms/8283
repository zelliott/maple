From a theoretical point of view, statistical zzso is an attractive model of brain zzso However, it is unclear how to implement these zzso processes in zzso zzso We offer a solution to this problem by showing in detailed simulations how the belief propagation zzso on a factor graph can be embedded in a network of zzso zzso We use pools of zzso zzso as the function zzso of the factor zzso Each pool gathers zzso in the form of population activities from its input zzso and combines them through its network zzso Each of the various output messages to be transmitted over the edges of the graph is zzso by a group of zzso zzso that feed in their respective destination zzso We use this approach to implement two examples of factor zzso The first example, drawn from coding theory, models the transmission of signals through an unreliable channel and demonstrates the principles and zzso of our network zzso The second, more applied example is of a zzso mechanism in which visual cues are used to resolve hypotheses about the interpretation of an zzso shape and zzso These two examples, and also a statistical analysis, demonstrate good agreement between the performance of our networks and the direct zzso evaluation of belief zzso
