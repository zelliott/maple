We examined an zzso coordination task where optimal visual search and hand movement strategies were zzso zzso were asked to find and touch a target among five zzso on a touch zzso Their reward for touching the target was reduced by an amount zzso to how long they took to locate and reach to zzso zzso the eye and the hand appropriately would markedly reduce the zzso zzso Using statistical decision theory we derived the sequence of interrelated eye and hand movements that would maximize expected gain and we predicted how hand movements should change as the eye gathered further information about target zzso We recorded human zzso eye movements and hand movements and compared them with the optimal strategy that would have zzso expected zzso We found that most observers failed to adopt the optimal zzso zzso We analyze and describe the strategies they did zzso
