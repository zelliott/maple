The application of the zzso zzso Resolution by zzso zzso zzso zzso method to model and control blend processes of pharmaceutical zzso is zzso Within the zzso zzso different data analysis approaches have been tested depending on the objective of the study, zzso knowing the effect of different factors in the evolution of the blending process zzso or detecting the blend zzso and monitoring the concentration of the different species during and at the end of the process zzso Data analysis has been carried out studying multiple blending runs simultaneously taking advantage of the zzso mode of the zzso zzso During the ALS zzso natural constraints, such as zzso zzso and concentration zzso have been applied for blend zzso When blending control is the main purpose, a zzso of the zzso zzso with correlation constraint in the concentration direction has been additionally zzso This constraint incorporates an internal zzso zzso which relates resolved concentration values (in arbitrary zzso with the real reference concentration values in the zzso samples zzso zzso providing values in real concentration scale in the final zzso zzso Two systems consisting of pharmaceutical zzso of an active principle zzso with two or four zzso have been zzso In the first case, zzso results allowed the description of the evolution of the individual compounds and the assessment of some physical effects in the blending zzso In the second case, zzso analysis allowed the detection of the zzso of the process and the assessment of the effects linked to variations in the concentration level of the zzso
