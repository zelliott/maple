zzso The biases and shortcomings of zzso multiple zzso are well established within the statistical zzso However, an examination of papers published in 2004 by three leading ecological and zzso journals suggested that the use of this technique remains zzso of 65 papers in which a multiple zzso approach was used, 57% of studies used a zzso zzso zzso The principal drawbacks of zzso multiple zzso include bias in zzso zzso inconsistencies among model selection zzso an inherent (but often zzso problem of multiple hypothesis testing, and an inappropriate focus or reliance on a single best zzso We discuss each of these issues with zzso zzso We use a worked example of data on zzso distribution collected over 4 years to highlight the pitfalls of zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso allows models containing significant zzso to be obtained from each year's zzso In spite of the significance of the selected models, they vary substantially between years and suggest patterns that are at odds with those determined by zzso the full, zzso data zzso zzso An information zzso zzso analysis of the zzso data set illustrates why the varying outcomes of zzso analyses zzso In particular, the IT approach identifies large numbers of competing models that could describe the data equally well, showing that no one model should be relied upon for zzso
