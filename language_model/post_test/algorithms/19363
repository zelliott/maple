The purpose of this study was to obtain different structure measures as the three-dimensional zzso zzso index method zzso and standard two-dimensional zzso bone zzso parameters from high-resolution zzso magnetic resonance zzso images of the zzso radius and to compare these parameters with bone mineral density zzso in their diagnostic performance to differentiate zzso patients with and without zzso zzso 

zzso zzso images of the zzso radius were obtained at zzso T in 40 zzso women (17 with zzso spine fractures and 23 zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed using the new structure measure zzso derived from the zzso as well as standard zzso zzso zzso zzso of the spine was obtained using quantitative zzso zzso zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso analyses were used to determine diagnostic performance in zzso both zzso zzso were validated by zzso zzso 

zzso differences between both patient groups were obtained using zzso zzso zzso and spine zzso zzso In comparison with the zzso texture parameters zzso under the curve zzso up to zzso diagnostic performance was significantly higher for zzso zzso There was a trend for a higher zzso value for zzso compared with zzso of the spine zzso zzso 

zzso yielded a robust measure of zzso bone zzso for zzso images of the zzso which significantly improved the diagnostic performance in zzso zzso women with and without zzso spine fractures compared with standard zzso bone zzso zzso This zzso characterization of zzso zzso may provide a new approach to better assess the strength of human zzso bone using zzso image zzso
