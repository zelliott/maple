zzso of a chaotic system can be made by calculating the correlation dimension zzso of the data that the system generates zzso et zzso zzso The zzso algorithm, however, requires zzso of the zzso a feature that biological data rarely reflect zzso et zzso zzso So we developed the zzso correlation zzso zzso an zzso that accurately tracks zzso in linked data of different dimensions zzso et zzso zzso We now present a mathematical argument that, for stationary data, individual zzso zzso to zzso and we demonstrate that the zzso rejects contributions made by bursts of zzso Data were obtained from the surface of the zzso bulb of the conscious rabbit zzso electrodes, 640 zzso each, zzso zzso zzso before and after presentation of a novel or zzso zzso zzso could be calculated in only 1 of 10 zzso trials, whereas zzso could be calculated in zzso Both zzso indicated that a novel odor evokes a zzso uniform zzso zzso The zzso uniquely exhibited the zzso decreases that occur during inspiration and the zzso of mean dimension present during the zzso control zzso These control zzso remained unchanged without odor experience, but showed zzso specific zzso increases following odor zzso It is interpreted that, 1) the zzso is sensitive, accurate, and appropriate for zzso assessment of biological data, 2) that during analysis of unfamiliar information a single global process is zzso evoked in the zzso and 3) after experience multiple zzso specific processes zzso map the sites of zzso
