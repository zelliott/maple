A method for zzso for zzso zzso in liquid crystal based spatial light zzso is zzso By zzso a commonly used zzso generating zzso to account for zzso zzso the intensity errors in obtained zzso spot zzso are significantly zzso We also introduce a novel method for characterizing the zzso zzso in zzso spatial light zzso providing input for the zzso generating zzso The methods are zzso evaluated and an improvement of the spot uniformity by more than zzso is demonstrated for an zzso with large zzso zzso
