In this paper, we propose a novel approach of simultaneous localized feature selection and model detection for zzso zzso In our approach, local feature zzso together with other parameters of zzso zzso are estimated by zzso zzso zzso zzso performed on both synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate that our approach is superior over both global feature selection and zzso zzso zzso
