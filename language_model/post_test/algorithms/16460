In this paper we present a new dedicated zzso setup which is capable of measuring one-dimensional moisture profiles in heated porous zzso The setup, which is placed in the bore of a zzso T zzso zzso is capable of reaching temperatures up to 500 zzso zzso and temperature profiles can be measured zzso simultaneously with a typical time resolution of zzso zzso A methodology is introduced for correcting temperature effects on zzso zzso at these elevated zzso The corrections are based on the zzso law for zzso and the observed temperature dependence of the relaxation mechanisms occurring in porous zzso Both these corrections are used to obtain a moisture content profile from the raw zzso signal zzso To illustrate the methodology, a zzso heating experiment of concrete with a moisture content in equilibrium with zzso zzso is zzso This kind of heating experiment is of particular interest in the research on fire zzso of concrete, since it directly reveals the moisture and heat transport occurring inside the zzso The obtained moisture profiles reveal a moisture peak building up behind the boiling front, resulting in a saturated zzso To our knowledge the direct proof of the formation of a moisture peak and subsequent moisture clogging has not been reported zzso
