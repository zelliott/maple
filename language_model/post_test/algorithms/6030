In order to introduce flexibility into the simple zzso zzso water model, the impact of the zzso degrees of freedom on liquid properties was systematically studied in this work as a function of many possible zzso zzso It was found that the diffusion constant is extremely sensitive to the equilibrium bond length and that this effect is mainly due to the strength of zzso hydrogen zzso The zzso zzso constant was found to be very sensitive to the equilibrium bond angle via the distribution of zzso angles in the zzso A larger bond angle will increase the angle formed by two molecular zzso which is particularly significant for the first zzso zzso This result is in agreement with the work of zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A new flexible simple zzso water model was derived by zzso bulk diffusion and zzso zzso to the experimental values via the equilibrium bond length and zzso Due to the large sensitivities, the zzso only slightly zzso the molecular geometry of the base zzso zzso zzso comparisons of zzso zzso and kinetic properties indicate that the new model is much improved over the standard zzso model and its overall performance is comparable to or even better than the extended zzso zzso
