zzso between zzso zzso concentration and daily zzso exposure was analyzed with the workers from zzso mining and processing plants in zzso Province and population from zzso background area far from zzso industry as zzso The results demonstrate that there was significant zzso zzso zzso between zzso urine zzso concentration and daily zzso exposure, and the zzso of the zzso equation was up to zzso by considering of the effect of the different group of population, and the equation predicting daily zzso exposure by zzso urine zzso concentration was zzso Daily zzso zzso of the subjects in 2004 were predicted using this zzso Comparing of the daily zzso exposure observed, the average of zzso between the zzso zzso predicted and observed was zzso and there was no significant difference between the exposure value predicted and zzso zzso it is feasible to predict daily zzso exposure by zzso concentration of zzso zzso The analyzing of predicted daily zzso exposure of all subjects in 2004 show that the daily zzso exposure of peoples from occupational exposure group, community group and background control group were respectively zzso zzso and zzso
