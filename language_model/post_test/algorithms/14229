The authors investigated the role of zzso zzso in an emergency zzso task in which participants waited until the last possible moment to slam on the zzso zzso of the size of the approached object and initial speed on the initiation of zzso were used to identify the optical variables on which participants relied at various stages of zzso In zzso zzso and zzso size and speed effects that were present early in practice diminished but were not eliminated as participants learned to initiate zzso at a rate of optical expansion that varied with optical zzso When size and speed were manipulated together in zzso 2, the size effect was quickly zzso and participants learned to use a 3rd optical variable zzso zzso flow zzso to nearly eliminate the speed zzso The authors conclude that zzso zzso depends on the range of practice conditions, the availability of information, and the criteria for zzso
