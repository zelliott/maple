zzso or zzso bone, the type of bone found in the zzso and near the zzso of long bones, consists of a network of plates and zzso zzso measurement of zzso thickness is of significant interest, for example, to assess the effectiveness of anabolic zzso zzso agents of patients with zzso Here, we introduce a new fuzzy distance transform zzso thickness zzso method that zzso zzso zzso and that can effectively deal with images acquired at a zzso size comparable to the typical zzso bone zzso The zzso zzso is shown on the basis of zzso images of human zzso bone, zzso at progressively zzso resolution and after application of rotation and addition of noise as a means to simulate the in zzso zzso zzso of the method is demonstrated with zzso images by comparing zzso of thickness within and between data sets and with zzso volume data sets of human volunteers zzso zzso Finally, with in zzso zzso images from a prior study in rabbits subjected to zzso exposure, it is demonstrated that short-term treatment resulting in zzso thinning can be zzso with the new zzso
