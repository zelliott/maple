zzso zzso zzso zzso is an invaluable tool for biologists and neuroscientists to study brain structure at the zzso zzso While able to image tissue samples with up to 5 zzso zzso resolution, image acquisition is zzso slow and limits the size of processed zzso In this work, we propose a novel approach to speeding up imaging when looking for specific zzso Unlike earlier methods, we explicitly balance the conflicting requirements of spending enough time scanning potential regions of interest to ensure that all targets are found while not wasting time on zzso zzso This is achieved by using a zzso Random Field to model target locations and zzso scanning locations by using a zzso zzso We show that our approach significantly zzso state-of-the-art methods to locate zzso in brain zzso
