In order to zzso both ultrasound zzso and zzso zzso zzso images of the liver zzso for medical applications such as diagnosis and zzso intervention, zzso registration between these two types of images is an essential step, as local deformation between US and CT images exists due to the different respiratory zzso involved and due to the probe pressure that occurs in US zzso This paper introduces a zzso zzso registration zzso between the zzso zzso US and CT images of the zzso In the proposed algorithm, to improve the registration zzso we zzso the surface information of the liver and gallbladder in addition to the information of the vessels inside the zzso For an effective correlation between US and CT images, we treat those anatomical regions separately according to their characteristics in US and CT zzso Based on a novel objective function using a zzso joint zzso of the intensity and zzso information, zzso zzso registration is followed by zzso zzso registration in zzso which improves the registration zzso The proposed zzso is tested for ten clinical zzso and quantitative evaluations are zzso Experimental results show that the registration error between anatomical features of US and CT images is less than 2 zzso on average, even with local deformation due to different respiratory zzso and probe zzso In addition, the zzso registration error is less than 3 zzso on average with a maximum of zzso zzso that is considered acceptable for clinical zzso
