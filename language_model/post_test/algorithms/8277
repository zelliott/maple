The measurement of the area of a zzso plane region is one of the basic problems in traditional zzso In order to calculate the zzso area of such a region, we have superimposed a net of identical squares on this region, counted the squares containing at least one point of the region, and calculated the sum of the areas of said zzso This sum represents an approximation of the region's zzso By mathematical zzso and zzso techniques we have investigated the law governing the decrease of these areas with the decrease of the length of the zzso zzso In theory, the prediction of the zzso area could then be performed if the side of the zzso squares tend to zzso Of course, the accuracy of the calculated area strongly depends on the zzso potential and the statistical zzso Several zzso parameters are currently in use for the quantitative analysis of the zzso of zzso cell zzso The cell image area has not yet been used and evaluated as a zzso zzso - but it has the potential to be chosen over some other alternatives due to the high mathematical accuracy at which it is zzso By adopting mathematical zzso and zzso techniques we show that this zzso can lead to successful distinction between 2 types of zzso very similar cells zzso boundary zzso and large zzso zzso in the zzso nucleus of the zzso monkey zzso zzso while some other parameters failed to achieve positive zzso
