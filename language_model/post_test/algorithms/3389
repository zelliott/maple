A zzso zzso to produce pacing rate that resembles zzso response to activity was zzso zzso criteria for the zzso included workload dependent rate increases with activity and response time within 60 seconds of exercise zzso To evaluate the algorithm, right zzso blood temperature was recorded during rest and treadmill exercise in 25 patients with implanted Kelvin 500 zzso zzso zzso Patients included 16 males and nine zzso ages zzso zzso zzso zzso for pacing were zzso zzso disease, zzso block and zzso zzso with slow zzso zzso zzso changes reflected physical activity as well as emotional zzso The zzso was based on the rate of change zzso the relative change zzso zzso and the baseline history zzso of zzso At exercise zzso a zzso brief drop in temperature zzso typically occurred due to peripheral zzso causing prompt increase in pacing zzso As exercise continued, the increase in zzso rate caused zzso as well as delta T to increase, further increasing pacing zzso After exercise, temperature returned to resting level which zzso decreased the pacing zzso zzso of the zzso to temperature variations, and the upper and lower pacing rate limits were zzso to adapt to individual patient zzso The rates produced by the zzso zzso intrinsic rate response for various activity levels and produced a mean response time of 16 seconds from exercise zzso Previous exercise had no significant effect on response zzso zzso between normal zzso response and simulated pacing rate from five exercise tests was zzso These results show good specificity and zzso the statement that blood temperature yields a slow zzso
