zzso signaling systems that permit individual recognition are described in an increasing number of zzso zzso logic predicts that the efficiency of these signatures is related to the possibilities for zzso To test this zzso zzso hypothesis, one needs a standardized method to estimate and compare the efficiency of different zzso Beecher zzso zzso 22, zzso zzso developed such a method by comparing zzso parameters extracted from the zzso However, vocal signatures frequently consist in the evolution of one zzso against one other, which are not comparable through zzso zzso Here we present a method to estimate the efficiency of modulated zzso A zzso efficiency is given by its information capacity zzso derived from Shannon's information zzso The measure of zzso is based on an analysis of zzso and uses the zzso distances between the zzso contours in the zzso To validate our method, simulated zzso of modulated contours were zzso The predicted efficiency of those signatures, estimated from zzso was strongly correlated to its actual efficiency given by two zzso zzso a zzso analysis and a zzso by human zzso Being also zzso to sample size, zzso therefore allows comparing zzso vocal, but also visual and zzso zzso
