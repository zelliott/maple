The zzso preferences in solution of a zzso corresponding to the zzso loop of the zzso zzso protein from the zzso disease virus were examined by zzso nuclear magnetic resonance and circular zzso The zzso loop is the major zzso zzso of the virus and zzso in cell attachment through an zzso zzso zzso The synthetic zzso corresponding to zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso protein of the zzso O, is largely zzso in zzso solution as shown by the absence of long- and zzso zzso contacts and by zzso chemical shifts zzso zzso contents in zzso solution were estimated to be less than zzso as determined by zzso of zzso zzso from CD zzso in good agreement with zzso from zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso an zzso flanked by two zzso zzso between zzso zzso in the intact zzso and zzso zzso is zzso This contrasts with the zzso zzso observed between zzso zzso and zzso in the crystal structure of the zzso virus, indicating that the zzso does not stabilize a zzso zzso structure, similar to that in the intact zzso Several zzso also fail to predict the structure found in the intact virus because these are based mainly on local sequence zzso The lack of structure of the zzso in zzso solution strongly suggests that the zzso zzso sufficient for the structure stabilization of this highly zzso zzso are mostly dictated by interactions of the loop with other regions of the virus structure, and do not arise from local zzso acid sequence zzso The ability of designed zzso peptides to neutralize zzso zzso is likely to arise from zzso zzso of the zzso and its application as zzso vaccines is not zzso Similarly, zzso of these peptides in carriers or zzso zzso as vaccine zzso would depend on the zzso adopted at the zzso site and its success cannot be zzso
