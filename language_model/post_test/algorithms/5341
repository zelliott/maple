zzso zzso concentration dynamics have been perceived as a zzso deterministic zzso zzso system in zzso for many zzso Recent experimental findings challenge that view and suggest them to be fluctuation zzso That renders this system interesting for zzso physics, in general, since we can study the emergence of zzso behavior from zzso zzso In particular, we can observe the random zzso events, called zzso and the zzso pattern with the same experimental zzso Here, we give a short introduction to the current discussion on theoretical and modeling concepts, and this Focus zzso reflecting zzso
