The dynamics of aquatic biological communities in a zzso environment is of great interest in respect to zzso between phenomena at various spatial and time zzso To study the complex zzso dynamics in relation to variations of such a biologically essential zzso as the fish zzso rate, we use a simple zzso model of zzso interactions between zzso zzso and zzso We suggest that zzso is distributed between two zzso one of which is zzso due to zzso zzso while the other is zzso We show that zzso variations in the fish zzso rate do not violate the strong correspondence between the character of spatial distribution of zzso and changes of zzso biomass in time: regular zzso zzso of zzso biomass zzso to large-scale zzso patches, while chaotic zzso zzso to small-scale zzso zzso As in the case of the constant fish zzso rate, the chaotic zzso dynamics is characterized by coexistence of the chaotic zzso and limit zzso
