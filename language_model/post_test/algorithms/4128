In 2010, four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso were defined by molecular genetic zzso The objective of this study was to assess whether zzso independently of the type and grade, could be subdivided into zzso zzso 

A tissue zzso zzso approach was applied to incorporate tissue samples of zzso and high-grade zzso into five zzso High expression levels of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor 2 zzso and zzso zzso 1 with the zzso zzso were assessed using zzso zzso zzso could be subdivided into four zzso by zzso The majority of the zzso zzso were of the zzso zzso zzso high zzso expression zzso of grade zzso The classical zzso with high zzso and low zzso zzso was most common in zzso zzso followed by the zzso zzso and zzso (with high zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a frequency that is in line with previously published data based on molecular zzso 

Assessment of the expression of the five proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is sufficient for zzso zzso and can be recommended for zzso in clinical practice for both zzso and high-grade zzso
