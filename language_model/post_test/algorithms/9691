In patients with severe traumatic brain injury zzso the depth and duration of cerebral zzso are independent zzso of zzso This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of brain zzso therapy in improving cerebral zzso and neurological outcome in severe zzso zzso 

Thirty zzso patients had brain oxygen monitors placed zzso to the side of mass zzso or to the zzso side if injury was zzso The first 10 patients zzso 1, zzso had brain tissue oxygen zzso zzso but not zzso The next 20 patients zzso 2, zzso were treated according to brain tissue zzso zzso aiming to improve cerebral oxygen zzso The zzso neurological outcome of Group 2 patients was compared with that of Group 1 patients and with contemporary control patients zzso 3) treated without the use of brain oxygen zzso 

The mean duration of brain hypoxic episodes zzso zzso zzso was 106 minutes in Group 1, and 34 minutes in Group 2 zzso Brain tissue oxygen was zzso zzso for zzso of monitoring time in Group 1 and zzso in Group 2 zzso The peak zzso of cerebral hypoxic events in both groups occurred during zzso day zzso The mean zzso zzso zzso zzso of patients experiencing cerebral zzso was higher than that of patients without cerebral hypoxic episodes zzso vs zzso zzso There was no statistically significant difference in neurological outcome between those patients treated with and those without brain zzso zzso 

In zzso patients, brain tissue zzso therapy is associated with decreased duration of episodes of cerebral zzso zzso studies are indicated to determine the effects of this therapy on neurological zzso
