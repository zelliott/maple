The aim of this study is to evaluate performance of zzso Pursuit zzso zzso against visual analysis for automatic sleep zzso zzso detection in a sample of sleep stages 2-4 and zzso pertaining to nine healthy young zzso zzso zzso frequency and duration characteristics were investigated for the zzso threshold zzso that zzso yield between test sensitivity and zzso zzso distribution zzso were also built for correctly detected zzso zzso and zzso zzso For sleep stage 2, zzso reached zzso sensitivity and specificity for an AT value of zzso For all stages together, zzso sensitivity and specificity were reached for an AT value of zzso zzso zzso were adequate for all zzso sensitivity was lower for zzso zzso frequency range activity with zzso characteristics was detected within zzso zzso zzso indexes obtained with zzso were much higher than visual prevalence indexes for all zzso similar zzso frequency and duration distribution zzso were obtained for true positive and false positive zzso For this sample of young male healthy subjects, the zzso zzso zzso showed satisfactory performance for SS detection in sleep stage 2 as reported earlier, acceptable performance in sleep stages zzso although with lowered sensitivity, and zzso frequency range activity within zzso sleep that needs better zzso Within zzso sleep, correspondence between the zzso automatic and the visual method was zzso
