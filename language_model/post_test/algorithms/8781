Duplex zzso is a mode of medical zzso that allows one to zzso at the same time, the inner structure of the body zzso and the blood flow at a particular point in the body zzso zzso This mode requires a strategy for alternating zzso and flow zzso Traditional strategies either zzso the maximum measurable zzso or introduce gaps in the flow zzso The objective of this article is to propose a completely original method based on zzso sensing for reconstructing the zzso signal segment by zzso Our approach is based on randomly alternating zzso and flow zzso The influence of the different parameters on the reconstruction quality is studied in zzso The technique is evaluated and its zzso is validated in simulation and from experimental in zzso zzso It is also compared to the only method from the literature, proposed by Jensen, that reconstructs blood zzso estimates from sparse data zzso
