zzso zzso zzso activates the central zzso of the zzso system, zzso zzso The zzso zzso complex binds zzso as a specific zzso and zzso it into zzso zzso which binds SK to form the zzso complex that zzso zzso zzso zzso complex formation is dependent on zzso site zzso interactions between a zzso zzso and the SK zzso zzso zzso zzso recognition is also zzso but the zzso and SK structural zzso responsible have not been zzso SK zzso lacking zzso with Ala zzso of charged zzso in the SK zzso zzso were evaluated in kinetic studies that resolved zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso only zzso 5 of zzso by SK with Ala zzso of zzso zzso and zzso showed decreases in the zzso rate constant for zzso generation, with nearly total zzso for the SK zzso double zzso zzso of bovine zzso zzso to the zzso complex containing zzso labeled zzso demonstrated zzso assembly of a zzso zzso zzso complex, whereas zzso did not bind to the complex containing the SK zzso zzso zzso was activated by zzso with a zzso indistinguishable from the zzso for zzso binding to form the zzso complex, whereas the SK zzso zzso did not support zzso zzso We conclude that SK zzso zzso zzso and zzso mediate zzso zzso recognition through zzso 5 of the zzso and zzso zzso A molecular model of the zzso 5 complex identifies the putative interactions involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso
