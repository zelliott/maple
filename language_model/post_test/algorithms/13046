zzso viruses have been responsible for large losses of lives around the world and continue to present a great public health zzso zzso characterization based on zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the routine procedures for influenza vaccine strain zzso However, zzso zzso is only a crude experiment reflecting the zzso correlations among testing zzso zzso and reference zzso zzso Moreover, zzso characterization is usually based on more than one zzso zzso The combination of multiple zzso results in an incomplete zzso zzso with many zzso zzso This paper proposes a new zzso framework for constructing an influenza zzso zzso from this incomplete zzso which we refer to as zzso zzso Scaling zzso In this approach, we first reconstruct the zzso zzso with viruses and zzso using zzso zzso zzso and then generate the two-dimensional zzso zzso using zzso zzso Moreover, for influenza zzso tables with zzso immunity effect (such as those from Human influenza zzso we propose a zzso model to reduce the inherent zzso bias of zzso tables caused by zzso zzso By applying our method in zzso zzso containing zzso influenza A viruses isolated from 1968 to 2003, we identified zzso clusters of zzso zzso representing all major zzso drift events in these 36 zzso Our results showed that both the completed zzso zzso and the zzso zzso obtained via zzso are useful in identifying influenza zzso zzso and thus can be used to facilitate influenza vaccine strain zzso The zzso is available at zzso
