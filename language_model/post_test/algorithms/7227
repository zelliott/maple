zzso are naturally occurring aromatic zzso which consist of an zzso zzso zzso system joining two zzso zzso These compounds are reported to exhibit several pharmacological activities, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso and zzso zzso In the present work, a zzso zzso zzso zzso study is carried out to zzso zzso derivatives with respect to their zzso activity zzso on the basis of molecular zzso For this purpose, two techniques to select zzso are zzso the zzso zzso Algorithm zzso and the zzso Algorithm zzso The selected zzso are initially employed to build Linear zzso Analysis zzso zzso An additional investigation is then carried out to determine whether the results can be improved by using a zzso zzso technique (One zzso zzso zzso In a case study involving 100 zzso zzso the zzso models were found to provide better rates of correct zzso than zzso both in the training and test zzso The best result was achieved by a zzso model with six molecular zzso which provided correct zzso rates of zzso and zzso for the training and test sets, zzso
