The purpose of this study was to establish an equation to predict incremental zzso length on the basis of the analysis of the cervical zzso in a single zzso zzso and to compare the zzso accuracy with other zzso Data comprised two groups of 23 Japanese girls between zzso I and zzso zzso Group A was examined to construct the zzso zzso Group B served to compare the zzso accuracy with the growth potential method and the growth percentage zzso The following results were zzso zzso an equation was determined to obtain zzso length increments on the basis of the zzso in the third and fourth cervical zzso bodies, and zzso the average error between the predicted zzso and the actual zzso was zzso zzso for the equation method, zzso zzso for the growth potential method, and zzso zzso for the growth percentage zzso These results suggest that with the use of cervical zzso zzso it may be possible to evaluate the zzso growth zzso
