High zzso zzso ordered zzso thin films are considered to have high potential for use as high zzso density recording media, beyond 1 Tera zzso In this paper, we review recent results on the synthesis and magnetic properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso Several fabrication methods have been developed to produce zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C, zzso composite films that might be used for perpendicular zzso zzso zzso zzso films grown with a zzso technique and having uniform cluster size and narrow size zzso zzso zzso particles prepared with chemical synthesis by zzso techniques, zzso The magnetic properties are zzso through variations in the zzso properties and zzso zzso and related films show promise for development as zzso magnetic recording media at extremely high zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso show potential for approaching the ultimate goal of zzso patterned zzso
