The generalized zzso equations zzso approach has been popular for analyzing zzso clinical trials data with missing zzso The zzso methodology allows one to obtain unbiased estimates only when the data are missing completely at zzso The use of weights into the zzso equations has been proposed as an adjustment for differential probabilities of zzso to zzso more realistic zzso zzso This article addresses the problem of assessing the relative improvement due to weights using simulated data generated around an alcoholic zzso zzso We argue that weights yield improved results in terms of bias, coverage rate, and efficiency only when the underlying zzso mechanism is correctly zzso
