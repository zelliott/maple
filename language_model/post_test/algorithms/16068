zzso mass declines in all populations with age, and the literature suggests that changes in oral bone may be linked to the status of the zzso zzso zzso However, there is a lack of information defining the relationship between zzso process bone and the zzso skeleton in healthy zzso The purpose of this study was to zzso zzso if the bone zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso processes are related to the bone density of the spine, hip, or radius in healthy zzso and zzso if the zzso process zzso decline with zzso zzso zzso Caucasian women aged 20 to 78 years underwent assessment of zzso zzso and zzso process zzso zzso vertical zzso and zzso zzso incorporating aluminum zzso controlled exposure and processing conditions, and a density correction zzso were used to make zzso process density assessments with regions of interest zzso zzso to zzso bone and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and lateral zzso zzso to zzso spine, total hip (and zzso and radius bone zzso were determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed significant relationships between zzso zzso process bone density and the density of the zzso zzso process zzso zzso zzso p zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso spine zzso zzso zzso p zzso or zzso zzso lateral zzso spine zzso zzso zzso p zzso or zzso zzso total hip zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso total radius zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and age zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso A zzso zzso test comparison revealed significantly greater zzso zzso process bone density in women younger than 50 years of age than in those 50 and older zzso zzso or zzso zzso We conclude that the density of zzso zzso process bone is significantly related to the density of the zzso zzso process, zzso spine, hip, and radius in healthy women and that zzso zzso process bone density declines with zzso
