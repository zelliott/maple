Few studies have been conducted on the socioeconomic position of women undergoing breast zzso and none have been conducted in the Danish zzso We investigated the association between educational level and breast reconstruction in a nationwide cohort of Danish women with breast zzso 

From nationwide zzso 13 zzso women aged zzso years who had been treated by mastectomy for breast cancer in Denmark in zzso were identified and followed up through November zzso zzso zzso zzso models were used to investigate the simultaneous influence of educational level on the likelihood of having immediate or delayed (up to three years after zzso breast zzso with adjustment for age, breast cancer zzso zzso socioeconomic variables and availability of plastic surgery services at each woman's affiliated zzso 

The odds ratios zzso for both immediate and delayed breast reconstruction increased significantly with level of zzso Being affiliated to a hospital with a plastic surgery department increased the likelihood of both immediate zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and delayed breast reconstruction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no association between education and breast reconstruction among zzso year old women, regardless of type of breast zzso however, medium or higher education was significantly associated with a fourfold increase in the OR for immediate breast reconstruction in women aged zzso years and a more than twofold increase in the OR for delayed breast reconstruction in women aged zzso years compared to women with short zzso 

zzso education was associated with increasing odds for having immediate or delayed breast zzso but only in the older age zzso The offer of breast reconstruction appears to be zzso distributed in Denmark, and living in an area where the hospital has a plastic surgery department significantly increased the odds for having breast zzso
