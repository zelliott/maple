To study the influence of zzso on chemical control of breathing relative to the zzso properties of zzso the authors zzso zzso analgesia and respiratory depression in a single group of healthy zzso Both respiratory and pain zzso were performed over single zzso time zzso 

Eight subjects (four men, four zzso received a zzso intravenous zzso zzso eight others (four men, four zzso received a zzso zzso zzso At regular time zzso respiratory variables zzso at a fixed zzso partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 50 zzso and the zzso acute hypoxic zzso pain tolerance zzso from a zzso electrical acute pain zzso and zzso blood samples were zzso Data acquisition continued for 24 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso models were applied to the respiratory and pain zzso The models are characterized by potency zzso shape parameters zzso and zzso site zzso zzso All collected data were analyzed simultaneously using the statistical program zzso 

zzso had no systematic effect on zzso or respiratory zzso zzso potency zzso and zzso site zzso zzso did not differ significantly among the three measured effect parameters zzso zzso zzso The integrated zzso analysis yielded a potency zzso of 32 zzso zzso zzso zzso value zzso zzso and a zzso site zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma was 1 for zzso and hypoxic breathing but zzso zzso zzso for analgesia zzso zzso zzso 

Our data indicate that systems involved in zzso analgesia and respiratory depression share important zzso zzso This suggests similarities in central zzso zzso and respiratory pathways zzso similarities in zzso receptors and G zzso The clinical implication of this study is that after zzso administration, despite lack of good pain relief, moderate to severe respiratory depression remains zzso
