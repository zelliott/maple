Recent advances in zzso sensor technologies for motion capture have produced devices, mainly based on zzso and zzso measurement units zzso that are now suitable for zzso use with zzso In fact, the reduced size, weight and the wireless connectivity meet the requirement of minimum zzso and give scientists the possibility to analyze children's motion in daily life zzso Typical use of zzso and zzso measurement units zzso motion capture systems is based on attaching a sensing unit to each body segment of zzso The correct use of this setup requires a specific zzso methodology that allows mapping zzso from the zzso frames of reference into useful zzso information in the human zzso frames of zzso The present work addresses this specific issue, presenting a zzso protocol to capture the zzso of the upper limbs and zzso in typically developing zzso zzso The proposed method allows the construction, on each body segment, of a meaningful system of coordinates that are representative of real zzso motions and that are referred to as functional frames zzso We will also present a novel cost function for the zzso algorithm, to retrieve the rotation zzso between each sensor frame zzso and the corresponding zzso zzso results on a group of 40 children suggest that the method is zzso and reliable, opening the way to the extensive use of this technology for zzso motion capture in zzso
