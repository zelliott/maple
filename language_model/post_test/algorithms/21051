We investigate a neutral model for zzso and zzso the constant rate zzso zzso The process is zzso to have zzso extant species today, we look at the tree distribution of the reconstructed zzso the trees without the extinct zzso Whereas the tree shape distribution is well-known and actually the same as under the pure birth process, no zzso results for the zzso times were zzso We provide the distribution for the zzso times and calculate the expectations zzso This characterizes the reconstructed trees zzso We will show how the results can be used to date zzso
