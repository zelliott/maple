zzso zzso is a new diagnostic zzso for detection of zzso zzso in sponge or zzso samples taken from a variety of environmental zzso The method is an zzso zzso acid amplification zzso based on the zzso zzso amplification reaction zzso Following zzso sample enrichment for zzso zzso the zzso is completed in 40 zzso requiring only simple zzso In zzso testing, 48 of 51 zzso strains tested positive, with only the three strains of zzso zzso producing negative zzso Further investigation showed that zzso zzso is zzso in the zzso zzso but its ability to grow under the selective enrichment conditions used in the method is zzso In zzso testing, 32 species of zzso zzso bacteria all produced negative zzso zzso zzso Performance of the zzso method was compared to that of the zzso Department of zzso Safety and zzso Service reference culture procedure for detection of zzso zzso in sponge or zzso samples taken from zzso stainless steel, zzso ceramic tile, sealed concrete, and rubber zzso Data were analyzed using zzso and probability of detection zzso Only one surface, stainless steel, showed a significant difference in performance between the methods, with the zzso method producing more positive zzso zzso of internal trials were supported by findings from independent laboratory zzso The zzso zzso method can be used as an accurate, zzso and simple alternative to standard culture methods for detection of zzso zzso in environmental zzso
