It is shown that the resonant zzso and the transmission zzso of ring zzso can be adjusted by zzso or zzso the zzso zzso layer on the ring zzso without introducing an extra loss or extra variations of channel zzso The zzso zzso layer increases the minimum zzso of the gap in the zzso region to larger than zzso which makes it possible to consider zzso instead of zzso zzso for the typical design rule of ring zzso zzso silicon zzso can also adjust not only the resonance zzso but also zzso zzso with a small sacrifice of guiding zzso
