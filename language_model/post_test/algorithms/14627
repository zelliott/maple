Assessment of liver zzso is important in determining prognosis and evaluating zzso Due to limitations of accuracy and patient hazard of liver zzso zzso methods have been sought to provide information on liver fibrosis, including the European liver zzso zzso test, shown to have good diagnostic accuracy for the detection of moderate and severe zzso Access to independent zzso of patients has provided an opportunity to explore if this test could be zzso This paper reports the zzso of the zzso test and its ability to identity severity of liver zzso in external validation studies in patients with chronic zzso C zzso zzso biopsy and serum samples from 347 zzso patients with zzso in three independent zzso were zzso zzso performance characteristics were derived zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso zzso and clinical utility zzso performed to determine the proportion of zzso that could have been avoided if zzso test was used in this patient zzso It was possible to simplify the original zzso test without loss of performance and the new zzso is zzso The simplified zzso test was able to predict severe zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and using clinical utility zzso to predict severe zzso zzso stages zzso zzso stages 3 and 4) zzso of zzso could have been avoided zzso zzso zzso of spectrum effect in diagnostic test evaluations are zzso In chronic zzso C a simplified zzso test can detect severe liver zzso with good zzso
