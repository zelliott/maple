This paper describes a novel solution to the rigid point pattern matching problem in zzso spaces of any zzso Although we assume rigid motion, jitter is zzso We present a zzso zzso time zzso that is guaranteed to find an optimal solution for the zzso zzso First, we model point pattern matching as a weighted graph matching problem, where weights zzso to zzso distances between zzso We then formulate graph matching as a problem of finding a maximum probability zzso in a zzso zzso By using graph rigidity arguments, we prove that a sparse zzso model yields equivalent results to the fully connected model in the zzso zzso This allows us to obtain an zzso that runs in zzso time and is zzso optimal for exact matching between zzso point zzso For zzso matching, we can still apply the same zzso to find approximately optimal zzso Experimental results obtained by our approach show improvements in accuracy over current methods, particularly when matching patterns of different zzso
