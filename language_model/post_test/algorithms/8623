For an improved understanding of the structural basis of cellular mechanisms, it is highly desirable to develop methods for a detailed zzso analysis of biological zzso and their dynamics in the interior of zzso zzso zzso We present a method of zzso laser zzso zzso to measure relative zzso positions of zzso fluorescent targets and the distance between each target in the range of a few zzso The physical principle behind this approach can be extended to the determination of three-dimensional zzso positions and zzso distances between any number of objects that can be zzso zzso to their spectral signature, thus allowing zzso zzso so far regarded to be beyond the capabilities of light zzso
