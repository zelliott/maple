To adjust pulse sequences that produce zzso zzso signals for increased sensitivity to nucleus size, the zzso method in zzso is applied to a zzso geometry that would describe each member of a collection of cells and their zzso with several possible representations of the zzso zzso The method is extended to allow propagation between nucleus, zzso and zzso space through zzso zzso using an approximate adjustment of zzso zzso zzso patterns are first calculated for the three compartments zzso for zzso and zzso pulse zzso and verified by comparison with zzso Carlo zzso The detailed patterns from the separate compartments determine the zzso value for maximum contrast in the total signal between large and small zzso an zzso that is not accurate in a zzso Phase Distribution zzso zzso Then zzso patterns are calculated for the case of linked compartments with zzso zzso The treatment of zzso adequately estimates zzso parameters for maximum contrast in calculated signal as nucleus size zzso
