Despite increasing applications of mass zzso zzso to characterize zzso modifications zzso on zzso zzso most existing protocols are not properly suited to robustly measure them in a zzso quantitative zzso In this work, we expand on current protocols and describe improved methods for quantitative Bottom Up characterization of zzso and their zzso with comparable sensitivity but much higher zzso than standard zzso zzso This is accomplished by first bypassing zzso zzso of zzso proteins and working directly with total zzso from a typical zzso acid zzso Next, using a chemical zzso procedure that is combined with zzso labeling in a zzso process, we can zzso compare samples using zzso We show that our method can successfully detect 17 combined zzso zzso and over 25 combined zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a single zzso zzso We test our method by zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso from zzso zzso and a zzso knockout zzso This improved methodology establishes that time and sample consuming zzso zzso or zzso zzso of individual zzso zzso prior to zzso interrogation as commonly performed is not strictly zzso Our protocol significantly zzso the analysis of zzso zzso and will allow for studies of zzso expressed zzso between multiple samples during biologically relevant processes in a rapid and quantitative zzso
