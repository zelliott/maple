We introduce the general form of the continuous zzso measure zzso which is a quantitative zzso of the degree of zzso for a given zzso The zzso makes it possible to calculate the zzso content of any mathematical description of a system by zzso zzso operators and zzso Another advantage of the new methodology is the ability to provide zzso expressions for the zzso zzso We apply it for specific cases, including zzso and molecules zzso zzso rotation zzso zzso zzso zzso potential operators zzso for example, parity zzso and functions (the electronic structure of zzso
