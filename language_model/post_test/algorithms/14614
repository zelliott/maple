Voice pitch carries important cues for speech perception in zzso Recent studies have shown the feasibility of recording the zzso response zzso to voice pitch in zzso zzso The presence of such a response, however, has been dependent on zzso interpretation of zzso The purpose of this study was to develop and test an automated procedure including a zzso protocol and zzso criteria suitable for zzso zzso to voice pitch, and compare the results to human zzso 

A set of four Mandarin tones zzso 1 zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso 3 zzso and zzso 4 zzso were prepared to reflect the four zzso pitch zzso Two distinctive zzso short-term zzso in the time domain and zzso zzso in the frequency domain, were used to estimate the zzso zzso Slope zzso Tracking zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the recordings from individual listeners as well as the power and zzso rates of each zzso 

Eleven native speakers (five zzso age: mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of Mandarin Chinese were zzso 

The results demonstrated that both zzso were suitable for zzso zzso and the objective measures showed comparable results to human zzso 

The automated procedure used in this study, including the use of the zzso protocol and response thresholds used for each of the five objective zzso can be used for zzso patients and may prove to be useful as an assessment and diagnostic method in both clinical and basic research zzso
