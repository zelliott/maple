An electromagnetic zzso heating system is developed to achieve the rapid and uniform warming of zzso zzso Using the heating system, a zzso resonant cavity is excited in zzso mode at zzso near 434 zzso In experiments, a zzso phantom of zzso with a diameter of 36 zzso is placed at the center of the zzso The phantom is first cooled down to about zzso degrees C within the cavity and then thawed by zzso zzso zzso show that zzso warming can produce much higher warming rate than conventional zzso warming zzso The spatial temperature distribution in the phantom during zzso warming is also more uniform than that during the zzso zzso
