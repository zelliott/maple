An improved edge detection zzso is proposed in this paper for the medical images with strong noises and fuzzy zzso The zzso modified the combination of zzso operations, so that the unclear edges of the images are zzso In this paper is also introduced the zzso of zzso elements which can reserve integrated edges from different directions of the zzso Furthermore, the contrast enhancement and zzso filter processing are zzso This method can detect the edges zzso keep the detected edges smooth and obtain coherent image zzso zzso demonstrate that this edge detector has a better performance of noise reduction and keeps the edges more accurate than do the traditional edge zzso thus its practicality is zzso
