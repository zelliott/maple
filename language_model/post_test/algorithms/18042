Many programs have been developed to identify zzso factor binding zzso However, most of them are not able to zzso zzso motifs with variable zzso zzso This case is encountered for zzso zzso zzso zzso Factor zzso Sites zzso usually composed of two boxes, called zzso and zzso in reference to the zzso initiation zzso Our goal is to design an zzso detecting zzso by using zzso and statistical constraints deduced from biological zzso 

We describe a new approach to identify zzso by comparing two related bacterial zzso The method, named zzso zzso Factor binding sites zzso using zzso to select zzso zzso performs a simultaneous analysis of pairs of promoter regions of zzso zzso zzso uses a prior identification of zzso patterns in whole zzso as selection criteria for potential zzso and zzso zzso These patterns are then grouped using pairs of short seeds (of which one is possibly zzso allowing a zzso zzso between zzso Next, the motifs are extended guided by statistical considerations, a feature that ensures a selection of motifs with statistically relevant zzso We applied our method to the pair of related bacterial zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso is detailed, zzso the zzso zzso for zzso and zzso were also zzso and the results suggested some new targets for these zzso zzso In addition, consensus motifs for zzso and new zzso binding sites were zzso overlapping previously proposed zzso zzso tests were carried out also on bacteria with moderate zzso content zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso factors were found as well as other zzso such as that of zzso in zzso zzso 

We demonstrate that our approach combining statistical and biological criteria was successful to predict zzso The method versatility zzso the recognition of other kinds of zzso regulatory zzso
