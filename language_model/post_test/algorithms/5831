It has recently been shown that differences between the marginal predictability associated with scalp zzso adjacent to and remote from the site of a seizure focus are able to distinguish between epochs temporally distant from and just prior to zzso about 20 zzso the onset of a seizure in patients with zzso lobe zzso The purpose of this paper is to show that these differences of marginal predictability intervals are independent of the state of consciousness of the zzso 

We have studied a data set encompassing 33 zzso epochs zzso 1 h prior to a zzso and 61 zzso epochs zzso as at least 1 h away from any zzso from 14 zzso Each 30 s zzso of each zzso was zzso into one of seven different states of zzso zzso models were used to search for relationships (in zzso zzso between the values of differences of marginal zzso and state of zzso 

It was not possible to reject the zzso hypothesis of no relationship between differences of marginal zzso and state of zzso 

The values of the differences between marginal zzso on zzso data are apparently insensitive to the state of zzso This conclusion, coupled with the fact that the differences between marginal zzso do depend on time to seizure, suggests the potential utility of these measures as the basis for zzso zzso methods of seizure zzso However, the development of a practical zzso method for seizure anticipation requires further extensive study on zzso data from individual zzso
