zzso technologies have become common tools in biological zzso As a result, a need for effective zzso methods for data analysis has zzso Numerous different zzso have been proposed for analyzing the zzso However, an objective evaluation of the proposed zzso is not possible due to the lack of biological ground truth zzso To overcome this fundamental problem, the use of simulated zzso data for zzso validation has been zzso 

We present a zzso simulation model which can be used to validate different kinds of data analysis zzso The proposed model is unique in the sense that it includes all the steps that affect the quality of real zzso zzso These steps include the simulation of biological ground truth data, applying biological and measurement technology specific error models, and finally simulating the zzso slide manufacturing and zzso After all these steps are taken into account, the simulated data has realistic biological and statistical zzso The zzso of the proposed model is demonstrated by several zzso 

The proposed zzso simulation model is modular and can be used in different kinds of zzso It includes several error models that have been proposed earlier and it can be used with different types of input zzso The model can be used to simulate both spotted zzso and zzso based single-channel zzso All this makes the model a valuable tool for example in validation of data analysis zzso
