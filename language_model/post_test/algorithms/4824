The typical way of judging about either the efficacy of a new treatment or, on the contrary, the damage of a zzso agent is through a test of hypothesis having its ineffectiveness as zzso zzso This is the typical operational field of zzso statistical framework where zzso of data (for instance non significant deaths in a zzso zzso represent the main zzso Instead, confidence intervals about zzso effectiveness are a way of exploiting all data, whatever their number zzso We recently proposed a new statistical zzso called zzso zzso for overcoming crucial difficulties usually met when computing these intervals and abandoning general simplifying hypotheses such as zzso zzso zzso When effectiveness is expressed in terms of zzso zzso between observed data we come to a learning problem that we solve by identifying a region where the whole curve lies with a given zzso The approach to zzso we propose is very suitable for identifying these regions with great zzso even in the case of zzso zzso models and/or a limited size of the observed sample, provided that a normally powered computing station is zzso In the paper we discuss this new way of zzso functions from the experimental data and drawing conclusions about the treatments originating zzso From an operational perspective, we give the general layout of the procedure for computing confidence regions as well as some applications on real zzso
