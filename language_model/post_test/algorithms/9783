In cone beam industrial zzso zzso zzso it is often required to inspect the large object using flat zzso If traditional zzso scanning is used, the field of view zzso is limited due to the size of flat zzso As an alternative, a dual zzso zzso scanning is proposed in this zzso Before each zzso zzso zzso source and flat detector are zzso translated a given distance, and part of the object is covered by zzso at each view zzso Then the object function is reconstructed by use of the improved zzso zzso algorithm, which does not zzso projection zzso zzso validate that the images, which are reconstructed by proposed scanning mode and improved zzso with small flat zzso are similar to those from the conventional zzso scanning and zzso zzso with large flat zzso The improved zzso zzso is not sensitive to translation zzso Furthermore, the proposed scanning mode can extend the radius of zzso up to at least zzso zzso
