A number of diffusion models have been proposed to overcome the limitations of diffusion zzso imaging zzso which cannot represent multiple zzso with zzso zzso at each zzso Among them, zzso models such as zzso models, zzso or zzso represent each zzso with a zzso model and are of great interest to characterize and compare white matter zzso However, the identification of the appropriate model, and particularly the zzso of the number of zzso has proven zzso In this context, different model selection approaches have been proposed to identify the number of zzso at each zzso Most approaches attempt to maximize the quality of fit while zzso complex models to avoid zzso However, the choice of a zzso strategy and the zzso between zzso and quality of fit are rather arbitrary and produce highly variable zzso In this paper, we propose for the first time to determine the number of zzso at each zzso by assessing the zzso zzso This criterion naturally prevents zzso by comparing how the models predict new data not included in the model zzso Since the zzso error cannot be directly zzso we propose to estimate it by the zzso zzso technique which has low bias and low zzso zzso on synthetic zzso and in zzso data show that our approach performs better than existing techniques, and is robust to the choice of decision zzso Together with zzso models of the diffusion zzso this technique will enable accurate identification of the model complexity at each zzso and accurate assessment of the white matter zzso
