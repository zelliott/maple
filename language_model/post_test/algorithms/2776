Numerous methods for predicting zzso in proteins have been zzso However, the results they generally provided are not very good, with a Matthews correlation zzso zzso Here, an attempt has been made to develop a method to improve the accuracy of zzso zzso First, we employ the geometric mean metric as optimal criterion to evaluate the performance of support zzso machine for the highly zzso zzso zzso This metric tries to maximize both the sensitivity and the specificity while keeping them zzso Second, a predictor to generate protein shape string by structure alignment against the protein structure database has been designed and the predicted shape string is introduced as new variable for zzso zzso Based on this perception, we have developed a new method for zzso zzso After training and testing the benchmark zzso of 320 zzso protein chains using a fivefold zzso technique, the present method achieves excellent zzso The overall prediction accuracy zzso can achieve zzso and the zzso is zzso which outperform the existing zzso prediction zzso Our results indicate that the protein shape string is useful for predicting protein tight turns and it is reasonable to use the zzso angle information as a variable for machine learning to predict protein zzso The zzso used in this work and the software to generate predicted shape string from structure database can be obtained from anonymous zzso site zzso zzso
