The objective of this study was to validate a zzso image registration technique, termed zzso zzso for left zzso strain measurement during zzso using zzso zzso MR images with strains measured from zzso zzso The technique combines deformation from high resolution, zzso MR image data with a detailed zzso model, including estimated zzso material properties, fiber direction, and active fiber contraction, to provide a comprehensive description of zzso zzso zzso A normal volunteer zzso age 30) with no history of cardiac pathology was zzso with a zzso T zzso zzso clinical scanner using a zzso imaging sequence and a zzso cardiac zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso MR images were zzso The zzso zzso solution was evolved using a series of zzso images in ten intermediate zzso from zzso to zzso The solution may be considered as ten separate zzso problems with multiple templates and zzso At each stage, an active contraction was initially applied to a finite element model, and then zzso zzso penalty forces were zzso to generate the final zzso zzso results for zzso strain zzso and zzso strain zzso were strongly correlated with results obtained from zzso MR images analyzed with a zzso Phase zzso zzso zzso for fiber stretch, zzso twist, and zzso strain zzso were in good agreement with experimental values in the zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso provides a unique alternative for zzso regional zzso deformation during zzso without the need for zzso
