The zzso method for predicting protein structures uses a single protocol across the entire range of targets, from comparative modeling to new zzso This protocol is similar to the zzso protocol used in zzso but has improvements in the zzso search for similar sequences in finding and aligning templates, in creating zzso libraries, in generating protein zzso and in scoring the zzso The automatic procedure made some improvements over simply selecting an alignment to the zzso template, and human intervention made substantial improvements over the automatic zzso The main improvements made by human intervention were from adding constraints to build (or zzso zzso and from splitting zzso proteins into separate zzso The uniform protocol was moderately successful across the entire range of target difficulty, but was somewhat less successful than other approaches in zzso on the comparative modeling zzso
