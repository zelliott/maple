zzso soft tissue loading can produce adverse structural and zzso changes in the absence of any visible tissue zzso However, zzso analysis techniques to assess zzso changes during loading without any visible zzso remain zzso zzso polarized light imaging zzso can generate spatial maps of collagen fiber alignment during loading with high zzso resolution and can provide a useful technique to measure zzso zzso While collagen fibers normally zzso in the direction that tissue is zzso zzso zzso fiber realignment during loading may be associated with the response of a local zzso network to fiber zzso A zzso correlation technique was developed to detect this zzso fiber realignment using zzso and mechanical data collected from human facet zzso ligaments zzso loaded until visible zzso zzso detection of anomalous realignment coincided with a measurable decrease in the tissue zzso in every zzso and occurred at significantly lower strains than those at visible zzso zzso suggesting this technique may be sensitive to a loss of zzso zzso The spatial location of anomalous realignment was significantly associated with regions where visible zzso developed zzso This analysis technique provides a foundation to identify regional differences in soft tissue injury zzso and relevant mechanical zzso
