We have studied the question of how much extra zzso power the correlated zzso zzso of pairs of zzso acid zzso separated along a sequence has concerning the likelihood of those zzso being in contact in the folded zzso The zzso zzso is deduced from multiple sequence zzso Our findings are that there is, indeed, some valuable information available from this source and that it is sufficient to make a significant improvement in our ability to predict zzso when compared with earlier methods that do not take into account the correlations between the zzso This improvement is approximately twice as large as can be obtained by the more economical method of simply averaging pair preferences over the same sequence zzso Even when using a method based on pair preferences, a further significant improvement can be made by zzso more variable regions (on the reasonable assumption that zzso zzso are relatively more likely to be in zzso though we have found no way of improving the pair preference method to the extent that it matches the method based on correlated zzso Our new method is thought to be the best zzso method of contact prediction developed so far, achieving, on average, an improvement over a random zzso zzso prediction of a factor of five when the number of contacts predicted is chosen to match the number that actually zzso
