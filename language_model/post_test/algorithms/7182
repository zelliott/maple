Gene selection is a key step in performing cancer zzso with DNA zzso The challenges from high dimension and small sample size of zzso zzso still zzso On rough set theory applied to gene selection, many zzso have been zzso but most are zzso In this paper, a zzso zzso gene selection as a new method is zzso First, some zzso zzso concepts are introduced and then some of their important properties are zzso The relationship between positive zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is zzso Then, a significance measure of feature is proposed to improve the efficiency and decrease the complexity of classical zzso By using zzso and input sequence techniques, a fast zzso zzso is constructed for the better zzso efficiency of gene selection for cancer zzso zzso experiments are conducted on five public gene expression data sets and seven data sets from zzso zzso The experimental results confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed zzso
