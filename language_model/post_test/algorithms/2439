zzso zzso zzso a new class of small zzso discovered from zzso zzso are involved in zzso zzso of zzso and other genetic elements in germ line zzso In order to identify a full zzso set of zzso expressed in the sexually mature zzso zzso small zzso zzso were extracted and were subjected to a zzso deep zzso We cloned zzso clean reads of zzso zzso small zzso zzso zzso and performed functional zzso zzso zzso small zzso showed a zzso length distribution with two zzso at 21 zzso and 29 zzso Then from zzso zzso small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified by a zzso scheme and zzso zzso were identified by zzso zzso All zzso predicted by the zzso scheme were then mapped to zzso zzso by Short zzso Analysis Package zzso and zzso of all uniquely mapping zzso zzso were located to zzso defined zzso regions zzso zzso Within these regions, 536 and zzso zzso clusters generally distributed across only minus or plus zzso zzso 48 zzso clusters distributed on two strands but in a divergent manner, and 39 zzso clusters distributed on two strands in an overlapping zzso Furthermore, expression pattern of 7 zzso identified by zzso searches showed 5 zzso displayed a ubiquitous expression pattern, although 2 zzso were specifically expressed in the zzso Overall, our results provide new information of zzso zzso and their specific expression pattern in zzso zzso suggests that zzso have a role in regulating zzso
