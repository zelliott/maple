zzso S zzso zzso belong to an important class of zzso zzso characterized by an zzso zzso zzso structure with Type zzso zzso Such compounds can be used as model systems to understand the zzso process of zzso and more in general of zzso In the present study, we specifically investigate the zzso behavior of the zzso zzso S analogue zzso by using zzso molecular dynamics zzso simulations at different temperatures, coupled to a statistical mechanical model based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso Such an approach permits to describe the zzso zzso and kinetic properties of the zzso and to zzso characterize its zzso zzso
