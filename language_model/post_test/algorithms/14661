Current disease association studies are routinely conducted on a zzso scale, testing hundreds of thousands or millions of genetic zzso Besides detecting marginal associations of individual markers with the disease, it is also of interest to identify zzso and zzso zzso which zzso zzso to the disease zzso The zzso number of possible combinations of markers and environmental factors, however, makes interaction mapping a daunting task both zzso and zzso In this paper, we review and discuss a set of zzso partition methods developed recently for mapping zzso zzso in zzso studies, their extension to quantitative traits, and further zzso to multiple zzso We use simulation and real data sets to demonstrate the performance of these methods, and we compare them with some existing interaction mapping zzso With the recent advance in zzso sequencing technologies, zzso zzso of zzso factor enrichment, structural variations, and zzso activities become available at the individual zzso The tsunami of data creates more challenges for zzso interaction zzso but at the same time provides new opportunities that, if zzso properly through sophisticated statistical means, can improve the power of mapping interactions at the zzso zzso
