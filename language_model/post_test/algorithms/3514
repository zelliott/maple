This paper proposes a novel genetic zzso zzso zzso to construct a zzso fuzzy system for zzso an unknown system with a satisfactory degree of zzso In the algorithm, the adequate number of fuzzy rules, the adequate number of membership functions of each input zzso and the parameters of membership functions will be determined zzso in addition, the dummy input variables will be detected and zzso Finally, several typical examples are illustrated to show the effectiveness of the zzso
