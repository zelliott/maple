A method for reduction of power line interference zzso in zzso with sampling rate zzso multiple of the nominal power line frequency is developed and tested using simulated signals and records from the databases of the American Heart Association and the Massachusetts Institute of zzso The method involves zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the signal components with zzso corresponding to zzso by discrete zzso zzso and zzso approximation of zzso series of averaged instantaneous values of zzso using appropriately defined zzso Tests of the proposed method with simulated data show that for zzso ratios zzso greater than 25 zzso the zzso relative error is below zzso zzso and the zzso ratio is less than zzso zzso For lower zzso the errors increased, and a noise zzso of zzso zzso is zzso The main advantage of the developed method in comparison with other simpler and faster approaches is the accurate interference reduction in cases when the power line frequency deviates from the nominal 50 or 60 zzso Due to zzso burden, the method is more suitable for zzso application, but real-time zzso using modern processors, is also zzso
