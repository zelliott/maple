The zzso and R statistical packages have implemented a counting process setup to estimate Cox models with time varying effects of the zzso The data set has to be zzso in a repeated measurement zzso the time is divided into small time intervals where a single event occurs and for each time zzso the zzso values and outcome in the zzso for each subject still under observation are stacked to a large data zzso This is the known zzso zzso implemented in zzso Survival library zzso which has been zzso into an R package by Thomas zzso However, the expansion of a data set leads to a larger set, which can be hard to handle even with fast modern zzso We propose the use of a fast and efficient algorithm, written in zzso which works on the original data without the use of an zzso The zzso are done on the original data set, with significant less memory resources zzso This improves the zzso time by orders of zzso The zzso can also fit reduced rank Cox models with time varying zzso We illustrate the method on a large data set of zzso breast cancer patients, a smaller study of zzso zzso cancer patients, and compare the zzso times on simulated data of up to 10,000 cases with zzso zzso zzso and survival package in zzso For larger data sets our zzso was several times faster, and was able to handle larger data sets then zzso and zzso
