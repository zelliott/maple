To study the relationship between retinal nerve fiber layer zzso thickness measured by time domain zzso and spectral domain zzso zzso optical zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso 

Sixty healthy participants, 48 glaucoma suspects, and 55 subjects with zzso 

Participants were zzso by a single trained operator using the zzso zzso zzso zzso scan zzso and zzso zzso zzso disc cube zzso at the same zzso 

The zzso thickness as measured by the zzso zzso zzso zzso scan zzso and zzso zzso zzso disc cube zzso was compared zzso zzso zzso The relationship between zzso thickness zzso of the 2 zzso were evaluated using a zzso correlation zzso The presence of abnormal zzso as determined by using an internal zzso data base in each machine was compared zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity of zzso zzso of 2 zzso zzso were zzso 

Average zzso thickness as determined by the 2 zzso machines was correlated zzso zzso zzso zzso but was significantly different with the 2 machines zzso zzso zzso standard zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso classified a significantly higher percentage of eyes as abnormal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in average zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity zzso and zzso than zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso of average zzso zzso 

There were significant differences in zzso thickness and zzso zzso as determined by zzso zzso and zzso zzso despite an excellent correlation of zzso thickness zzso zzso sensitivity and specificity were higher with zzso zzso These findings are particularly relevant when an individual zzso zzso follow-up with different zzso
