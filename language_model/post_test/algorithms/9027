Although the importance of quality zzso resuscitation zzso and its link to survival is still emphasized, there has been recent debate about the balance between zzso and zzso particularly for long response zzso zzso shocks for zzso zzso zzso of recently zzso hearts have high success for the return of spontaneous circulation zzso but hearts with depleted zzso zzso zzso stores have low recovery zzso Since quality zzso has been shown to both slow the degradation process and restore cardiac zzso a measurement of patient condition to zzso the timing of zzso shocks may improve outcomes compared to zzso zzso Researchers have proposed numerous zzso features of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which can be zzso from the zzso zzso signal to distinguish between the rhythms which convert to spontaneous circulation and those which do zzso We looked at the zzso prediction performance of thirteen of these features on a single evaluation database including the recordings from 116 zzso cardiac arrest patients which were collected for a separate study using zzso in zzso and medical centers in 4 European regions and the US between March 2002 and September zzso A total of 469 shocks preceded by zzso or zzso VT rhythm episodes were identified in the zzso Based on the zzso zzso for the zzso rhythm, the shocks were zzso to result in either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The features were calculated on a zzso zzso segment prior to the shock zzso These features examined were: Mean zzso Average zzso zzso zzso Range, zzso zzso Analysis zzso Peak zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Measure zzso Energy, Max Power, zzso Power, Power zzso Analysis zzso Mean Slope, and Median zzso zzso hypothesis tests zzso zzso and zzso with zzso significance zzso were applied to determine if the means and medians of these features were significantly different between the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso curve was zzso for each feature, and Area Under the zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso held at zzso as well as zzso with zzso held at zzso was also zzso All features showed statistically different mean and median values between the zzso and zzso groups with all zzso less than zzso The zzso was zzso for all zzso For zzso zzso zzso the zzso range was zzso for zzso zzso zzso the zzso range was zzso The features showed good zzso prediction zzso We believe that a zzso employing a clinical decision tool based on these features has the potential to improve overall survival from cardiac zzso
