Prospective identification of patients with structural heart disease who could profit from zzso zzso therapy is hampered by the low zzso power of the currently available risk zzso zzso zzso T wave zzso measured zzso is a new promising zzso to assess impaired zzso zzso which has been associated with an increased zzso of zzso zzso T wave zzso is zzso to induce zzso heart rate may be increased by zzso stimulation during invasive zzso testing or zzso by exercise stress zzso The first clinical validation with respect to prediction of zzso of zzso zzso and of zzso events during follow-up in patients undergoing invasive zzso testing was reported in zzso zzso a good zzso between the results of invasive and zzso assessment of T wave zzso was demonstrated by our zzso The first prospective evaluation of the zzso zzso measurement using zzso exercise testing was performed in patients surviving zzso zzso zzso or sustained zzso zzso referred to our zzso The occurrence of T wave zzso in this patient population was zzso of future zzso events with subsequent appropriate zzso zzso The results of the currently performed prospective trials in various patient populations will help to establish the utility of T wave zzso assessment as a risk zzso in clinical zzso
