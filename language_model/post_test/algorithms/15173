zzso has multiple functions in the brain, and there is interest in zzso in zzso zzso rather than merely the zzso determined by nuclear zzso zzso can be estimated using magnetic resonance zzso but measurement is difficult due to its multiple zzso zzso signals overlapping with other zzso zzso To minimize the effect of interfering signals, echo time zzso values between 60 and 95 zzso were zzso and the loss in signal due to the zzso effect was corrected in both the zzso of zzso concentration and in creation of the basis files for zzso The effectiveness of the zzso method was evaluated by measuring the zzso concentration in zzso rats before and after zzso The brain zzso in all rats increased after feeding with zzso and fed zzso ratios of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Data at a short TE of 13 zzso measured ratios of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the zzso and fed rats, respectively, demonstrating the difficulty in obtaining reliable zzso zzso at short zzso Overall, TE averaging zzso the influence of zzso signals and nearby zzso to give precise, consistent estimates of zzso
