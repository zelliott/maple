A method for assessing zzso zzso relationships in zzso time series, based on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso models is zzso The method evaluates bilateral interactions between two time series by zzso the predictability improvement zzso of the output time series when the dynamics associated with the input time series are included, zzso moving from zzso to zzso zzso The zzso model identification was performed by the optimal zzso search zzso algorithm, and its results were compared to the zzso method to determine the most appropriate method to be used for experimental zzso The statistical significance of the zzso was assessed using a surrogate data zzso The proposed method was tested with simulation examples involving short zzso of linear zzso processes and zzso deterministic signals in which either zzso or zzso zzso and varying strengths of interactions were zzso It was found that the zzso zzso model was accurate and sensitive in detecting imposed zzso causality zzso In addition, the zzso zzso model was more accurate than the least squares zzso Application to the zzso blood pressure and heart rate zzso signals demonstrated the feasibility of the zzso In particular, we found a bilateral zzso relationship between the two signals as evidenced by the significant reduction in the zzso values with the zzso model prediction compared to the zzso model zzso which was also confirmed by the surrogate data zzso Furthermore, we found significant reduction in the complexity of the dynamics of the two zzso pathways of the two signals as the body position was changed from the zzso to zzso The proposed is a general method, thus, it can be applied to a wide variety of zzso signals to better understand causality and zzso that may be different between normal and diseased zzso
