We address the problem of achieving a random laser with a cloud of cold zzso in which gain and scattering are provided by the same zzso In this system, the elastic scattering zzso is related to the complex atomic zzso As a consequence, the random laser threshold is expressed as a function of this zzso which can be fully determined by zzso zzso We apply this idea to zzso evaluate the threshold of a random laser based on zzso gain between zzso zzso states and find a critical optical thickness on the order of zzso which is within reach of state-of-the-art zzso zzso
