A zzso framework to obtain an accurate zzso of the zzso and zzso component of water zzso diffusion through brain zzso with diffusion zzso imaging, is zzso The diffusion zzso imaging model zzso the zzso the degree of zzso on a direction dependent basis, zzso a higher order diffusion zzso zzso which is estimated in addition to the well-known diffusion zzso To reconcile with the physical phenomenon of molecular zzso both zzso estimates should lie within a physically acceptable zzso Otherwise, clinically and artificially significant changes in diffusion zzso parameters might be zzso To guarantee physical zzso we here suggest to estimate both zzso zzso by maximizing the joint likelihood function of all zzso distributed diffusion weighted images given the diffusion zzso imaging model while imposing a set of zzso zzso As shown in this study, correctly accounting for the zzso noise structure is necessary to avoid significant zzso of the zzso zzso The performance of the constrained zzso was evaluated and compared to more commonly used strategies during zzso Human brain data were used to emphasize the need for constrained zzso as not imposing the constraints give rise to constraint violations in about zzso of the brain zzso
