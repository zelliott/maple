Large margin zzso (such as zzso are designed to assign training samples with high confidence (or zzso to one of the zzso Recent theoretical results of these systems show why the use of zzso terms and feature zzso techniques can enhance their zzso zzso Since the optimal subset of features selected depends on the zzso problem, but also on the particular zzso with which they are used, global learning zzso for large margin zzso that use feature zzso techniques are zzso A direct approach is to zzso a cost function based on the margin error, which also incorporates zzso terms for controlling zzso These terms must zzso a zzso with the largest margin for the problem at zzso Our work shows that the inclusion of a zzso term can be employed for this zzso Since zzso only achieves an optimal zzso projection for some particular distribution of data, the margin of the zzso can then be effectively zzso We also propose a simple constrained search for the global zzso in which the feature zzso and the zzso are trained zzso This allows a degree of flexibility for including zzso that can enhance the search and the performance of the zzso zzso Experimental results demonstrate the potential of the proposed zzso
