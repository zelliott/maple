The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of zzso True fast imaging with steady zzso zzso zzso imaging of mouse heart at high resolution and its efficiency for cardiac zzso zzso zzso of control and hypoxic mice was carried out at zzso T without zzso preparation or zzso The zzso lines were acquired with the zzso sequence zzso repetition zzso time zzso zzso zzso in a repeated sequential zzso zzso zzso of raw data allowed the reconstruction of 10 three-dimensional images per cardiac zzso The acquisition scheme used an alternating zzso phase and zzso reconstruction zzso zzso three-dimensional images at around 200 zzso resolution were produced without zzso artifact throughout the cardiac zzso High contrast to noise made it possible to estimate cavity volumes during zzso and zzso Right and left zzso stroke volume was significantly higher in hypoxic mice vs controls zzso zzso 2 vs zzso zzso 2; P zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 vs zzso zzso 2; P zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso imaging in living mice is a method of choice to investigate cardiac abnormalities in mouse zzso
