A zzso zzso procedure is proposed to model zzso data with the aim of zzso the population size for a closed zzso zzso zzso are possibly time dependent and missing at zzso times and may be measured with zzso A set of zzso equations zzso based on zzso process and zzso data is constructed to estimate the relevant parameters and the population zzso These zzso can be solved by an zzso similar to an zzso zzso zzso results show that the proposed procedures work better than the zzso zzso In some cases they are even better than zzso estimates, for which the true values of zzso are available for all captured subjects over the entire experimental zzso We apply the method to a zzso experiment on the bird species zzso zzso in Hong zzso
