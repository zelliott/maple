zzso interactions between zzso that are zzso apart and well separated in sequence are important in the function of zzso proteins as well as zzso zzso This observation suggests that, among the zzso that are involved in long-range communications, zzso at one site should affect interactions at a distant zzso By adopting a zzso approach, we present an automated approach that uses a zzso of the familiar sequence zzso in conjunction with a coupled zzso zzso algorithm, to predict the network of interactions that trigger zzso interactions in zzso We use the method to identify the subset of zzso important zzso in three families, zzso the small zzso family, G zzso receptors zzso and the zzso which are zzso receptors that mediate the zzso and rolling of zzso on inflamed zzso For the zzso and zzso families, our procedure zzso in agreement with previous studies, a network containing a small number of zzso that are involved in their zzso Application to the zzso family reveals a network of zzso zzso throughout the zzso end of the structure that are responsible for binding to zzso Based on our results and previous studies, we propose that functional zzso requires that only a small subset of zzso connected zzso be involved in zzso zzso signals in zzso
