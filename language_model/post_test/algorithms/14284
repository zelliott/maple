zzso frequently have abnormal zzso zzso zzso the so-called zzso zzso that refers to the inability to zzso in the absence of zzso However, the origin of this zzso is still unknown and may arise from one of several pathways of Met zzso To help characterize the zzso features of zzso zzso the fate of the zzso carbon of zzso was chased in a zzso model of zzso melanoma zzso in zzso and in zzso Growth zzso under Met restriction showed that melanoma cells in zzso were zzso whereas implanted melanoma tumors in zzso were zzso zzso high-resolution magic angle spinning zzso zzso zzso zzso profiling showed that, in zzso zzso and zzso zzso were poor, but zzso and zzso zzso protein signals were zzso In contrast, in zzso zzso and zzso zzso were strong but zzso and zzso protein signals were zzso In addition, in zzso zzso was very efficient, consumed zzso units originating from the zzso carbon of Met, and yielded zzso zzso From these data, the zzso zzso appear closely related to the source of zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso zzso profiling allowed the discrimination between zzso and zzso and provided novel zzso information on their zzso
