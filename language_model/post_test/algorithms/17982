zzso are a vertical arrangement of zzso zzso that may constitute a fundamental zzso ensemble but have been difficult to study zzso because of the challenges of determining the three-dimensional zzso spatial arrangements of individual zzso in the zzso Previously, a statistical density map method was developed to characterize zzso using two-dimensional zzso coordinates of zzso from thin tissue zzso Here we extend this approach to derive the relationship between these zzso density maps and the actual zzso properties of zzso by creating a theoretical zzso model of cortical zzso In seven steps, we transform a zzso initial arrangement of zzso from a zzso zzso with distances and zzso numbers zzso the idealized cortical zzso as zzso by our zzso density map analysis, into a model whose zzso locations represent a plausible zzso arrangement of zzso in the zzso Because we zzso the transformations on the zzso model by the zzso density map properties, the transformed zzso model will exhibit properties that are consistent with experimental findings regarding zzso anatomy in the zzso Moreover, because our methodology only requires the zzso locations of zzso from thin zzso it is readily accessible to any set of input data regardless of preparation or zzso from human or zzso By generating zzso model zzso arrangements and comparing between control, aged, and diseased brain, our method can be used to test hypotheses about the effects of neurological diseases as well as normal aging on the zzso structure of zzso in the zzso
