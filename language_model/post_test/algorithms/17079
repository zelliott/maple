The purpose of this study was to use the zzso data base to devise and test an improvement in an zzso zzso zzso criterion for detecting left zzso zzso that is gender specific and adjusts for age and zzso 

zzso detection of left zzso zzso has been receiving increasing zzso The zzso zzso zzso defined as the sum of zzso for the R wave of lead zzso and S wave of lead zzso has been shown to correlate strongly with zzso estimated left zzso zzso Because the magnitude of this zzso varies with both age and zzso we have proposed a simple formula for its adjustment for these two zzso 

Using linear regression, the adjustment formula was estimated from data on zzso men and zzso women from the zzso Heart Study cohort who were free of zzso zzso and who had both an zzso and an zzso recorded during the same clinic zzso A modified receiver operating characteristic curve method was used to compare sensitivities at the same specificity zzso The adjustment formula was estimated from one randomly chosen half of the study cohort and applied to the other half for zzso 

zzso improvement in sensitivity for the detection of left zzso zzso was realized at all levels of zzso At a specificity level of zzso the adjustment increased the sensitivity of the Cornell zzso from zzso to zzso in men and from zzso to zzso in zzso For severe zzso defined as a left zzso mass zzso 3 zzso above the zzso mean, the sensitivity increased from zzso to 38% for men and from zzso to zzso for women at a specificity level of zzso 

This approach can substantially enhance the utility of the zzso for the detection of left zzso zzso If these results are validated in other population groups, this approach may prove valuable in the screening of zzso populations and for the monitoring of patients undergoing treatment for zzso
