A new zzso zzso Carlo zzso zzso has been developed to test protein potential functions and, ultimately, refine protein zzso The main principle of this zzso is, in each cycle, a new trial zzso is generated by carrying out a short period of molecular dynamics zzso zzso with a set of random parameters (including the MD time step, the number of MD steps, the MD temperature, and the seed for initial MD zzso zzso then to accept or reject the new zzso on the basis of the zzso zzso The novelty in this paper is that the potential in MD zzso is different from that in the zzso zzso In the former, it is a molecular mechanics potential, in the latter it is a zzso potential zzso Directed by the zzso the MD iteration is used to search zzso space for realistic zzso with low zzso zzso It zzso the difficulty in using zzso functions directly in MD zzso as zzso functions are typically incomplete, and do not always have continuous derivatives required for the calculation of the zzso The new zzso has been tested in explorations of zzso zzso In these test calculations the zzso energy was found to drop below the value for the native zzso and the correlation between the root mean square zzso zzso and the zzso energy was shown to be different from the test results in other zzso At the present time, the zzso is useful for testing new zzso zzso Furthermore, if a zzso function can be found for which the native zzso has the lowest energy and the zzso correlation is good, then this new zzso also will be a tool for refinement of the zzso structural zzso
