The zzso and zzso of the two main zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were studied in zzso zzso zzso evaluated were respiratory depression, measured as the change in zzso blood zzso zzso and pH zzso and zzso measured by the zzso zzso The administration of 10 zzso zzso in a zzso zzso infusion significantly altered zzso zzso and pH values in comparison with baseline and zzso groups zzso zzso However, 2 zzso administered in a zzso zzso infusion was enough to achieve zzso zzso without respiratory zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso completely eliminated the zzso of the zzso dose, suggesting that such an effect is due to zzso zzso zzso To describe and adequately characterize the in zzso zzso effect of the drug, zzso was given at different infusion rates of varying lengths zzso zzso zzso was best described by a zzso zzso The time course of response was described using an effect compartment associated with a linear zzso zzso The estimates of the slope of the effect versus concentration relationship were significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso as the length of infusion was increased, suggesting the development of zzso zzso of up to 8 zzso zzso given in zzso zzso infusion did not elicit either zzso in the zzso test or respiratory zzso These in zzso results are in accordance with the zzso and zzso properties reported for these compounds in several in zzso zzso
