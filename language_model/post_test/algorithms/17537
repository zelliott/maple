This paper proposes a new zzso genetic programming zzso zzso for discovering zzso rules in medical data zzso The proposed zzso contains several zzso constraints to be enforced by the system using a zzso normal form zzso so that individuals represent valid rule sets that are easy to zzso The zzso is compared with zzso a well-known zzso algorithm, and with another zzso that uses zzso zzso zzso in five medical data zzso chest pain, Ljubljana breast cancer, zzso Wisconsin breast cancer, and pediatric zzso zzso For this last data set a new zzso step was devised for survival zzso zzso experiments show that, overall, the zzso zzso obtained good results with respect to zzso accuracy and rule zzso by comparison with zzso and zzso
