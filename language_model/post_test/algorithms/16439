zzso zzso zzso also known as a heart attack, is a leading cause of mortality in the zzso zzso zzso zzso signals are recorded on the body surface to monitor the underlying cardiac electrical activities in three zzso directions of the body, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The 3-D zzso zzso zzso provide a new way to study the cardiac zzso behaviors, as opposed to the conventional zzso reconstructed phase space from a single zzso zzso However, few, if any, previous approaches studied the relationships between cardiac disorders and recurrence patterns in zzso zzso This paper presents the recurrence zzso analysis zzso of zzso signals in multiple zzso scales for the identification of cardiac zzso The linear zzso models using zzso zzso features were shown to detect zzso with an average sensitivity of zzso and an average specificity of zzso in the zzso zzso experiments of zzso zzso zzso database, which is comparable to the performance of human zzso This study is strongly indicative of potential automated zzso zzso zzso for diagnostic and therapeutic zzso
