In this study, the problem of detecting and tracking zzso from the surface zzso signal is zzso A method based on the calculation of a Second Order Moment zzso zzso inside a window W sliding over the zzso signal is here zzso An zzso zzso of the detector allows the extraction of the optimal parameters characterizing the zzso Performance of the zzso method is assessed on a set of synthetic zzso zzso signals in terms of sensitivity, precision and accuracy through the use of a properly defined cost function able to explain the overall detector zzso The obtained results are compared to those emerging from the application of zzso versions of traditional detection zzso Once tested on a database of synthetic zzso zzso data, a quantitative assessment of the zzso zzso performance is carried out on experimental zzso zzso signals recorded from two patients affected by Essential zzso and from two patients affected by Parkinson's zzso The zzso zzso zzso the traditional techniques both in detecting zzso and positive zzso value zzso for zzso higher than zzso and in zzso zzso of muscular zzso bursts zzso and standard zzso on the zzso of the onset and offset time zzso lower than zzso Its independence from the zzso level and its low zzso cost make it suitable for real-time zzso and clinical zzso
