With the increasing number of transgenic mouse models of human brain diseases, there is a need for a sensitive method that allows assessing quantitative whole brain zzso within a reasonable scan zzso zzso spin labeling zzso an zzso technique that permits the zzso zzso of cerebral blood flow, has been used to assess zzso brain zzso For mice, the reported experiments performed with continuous or zzso zzso were challenged by poor zzso zzso limited sensitivity, or zzso zzso Here, the recently proposed zzso zzso strategy, which has shown great promise for human studies, was investigated for mouse brain zzso imaging at zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso and compared with a standard zzso alternating inversion recovery sequence for sensitivity, zzso absolute zzso and zzso imaging zzso A sensitivity gain up to zzso and clear advantages for zzso imaging are obtained with zzso zzso
