This paper presents an zzso hybrid control system using a diagonal zzso zzso zzso network to control a linear zzso ceramic motor zzso driven by a zzso zzso zzso resonant zzso Since the dynamic characteristics and motor parameters of the zzso are highly zzso and time zzso an zzso hybrid control system is therefore designed based on a hypothetical dynamic model to achieve zzso position zzso The architecture of zzso network is a modified model of a zzso zzso network to attain a small number of zzso The novel idea of this study is that it employs the concept of diagonal zzso neural network zzso in order to capture the system dynamics and convert the zzso zzso into a dynamic zzso This zzso hybrid control system is composed of two zzso One is a zzso network controller that is used to mimic a conventional zzso zzso control law due to unknown system zzso and the other is a compensated controller with bound zzso zzso that is zzso to recover the residual approximation error for guaranteeing the stable zzso The effectiveness of the proposed driving circuit and control system is verified with hardware experiments under the occurrence of zzso In addition, the advantages of the proposed control scheme are indicated in comparison with a traditional zzso zzso position control zzso
