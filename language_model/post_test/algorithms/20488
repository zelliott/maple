Most of the zzso signals zzso zzso blood flow, human zzso zzso characterize by complex dynamics including both zzso and zzso These time series resemble red noise with long-range correlation and zzso zzso power zzso A question arises as to how to distinguish the characteristics of the process underlying the signal dynamics from the properties of the observed time zzso The classical methods to determine possible zzso zzso dynamics zzso correlation zzso often fail in such signals because of relatively short data records containing zzso components and zzso We report an application of several approaches, aimed at zzso determining of the zzso in the signals and zzso testing whether zzso dynamics zzso Assessment of the intrinsic correlation properties of the dynamic process and distinguishing the same from external trends was performed using singular zzso and zzso fluctuation zzso The existence of zzso dynamics was tested by correlation dimension zzso zzso of zzso and by correlation zzso of real and surrogate zzso The correlation zzso of real signal and surrogate data sets were statistically compared using zzso zzso zzso The procedures were tested on zzso and zzso zzso blood zzso Our suggestion is that no one approach taken alone is the best for our zzso Instead, a battery of methods should be zzso
