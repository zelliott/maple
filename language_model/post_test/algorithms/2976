zzso zzso is a key step in the evaluation of tissue elasticity by zzso strain zzso An efficient approach may incorporate a tracking strategy zzso each estimate is initially obtained from its zzso zzso and then refined through a localized zzso This increases the accuracy and reduces the zzso expense compared with exhaustive zzso However, simple tracking strategies fail when the target displacement map exhibits complex zzso For example, there may be zzso and regions of indeterminate displacement caused by zzso between the zzso and zzso radio frequency zzso echo zzso This paper introduces a novel displacement tracking algorithm, with a search strategy guided by a data quality zzso Comparisons with existing methods show that the proposed zzso is more robust when the displacement distribution is zzso
