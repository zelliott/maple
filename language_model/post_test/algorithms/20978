Although the highly dynamic and mosaic organization of the plasma membrane is zzso depicting a zzso global view of this organization remains zzso We present an zzso zzso tracking zzso method and zzso zzso tracing zzso that takes advantage of the high spatial resolution provided by zzso zzso zzso can be used to generate dynamic maps at high zzso of tracked zzso thereby providing global representation of molecular dynamics in cell zzso zzso by zzso detected zzso allows detection of zzso zzso We zzso detected particles using zzso with performance reaching theoretical limits, and then zzso zzso zzso the statistical information from past zzso We demonstrate the potential of this method by applying it to the zzso growth factor zzso zzso labeled with quantum dots zzso in the plasma membrane of live zzso We anticipate the use of zzso to explore molecular dynamics and interactions at the cell zzso
