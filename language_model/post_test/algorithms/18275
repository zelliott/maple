We investigate the organization of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso These types of zzso can be explained as a combination of relaxation zzso and zzso zzso controlled by canard solutions that are associated with a folded zzso on a critical zzso The zzso zzso system has a cubic critical zzso for a range of zzso and an associated folded zzso of zzso zzso there exist corresponding attracting and zzso slow zzso that intersect in canard zzso We present a general technique for the zzso of two-dimensional slow zzso zzso zzso It is based on a boundary value problem approach where the zzso are zzso as zzso families of orbit zzso zzso of the zzso surfaces gives unprecedented insight into the geometry of the zzso In particular, our techniques allow us to find and zzso canard solutions as the intersection zzso of the attracting and zzso slow zzso
