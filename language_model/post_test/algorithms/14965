zzso of rates is a basic tool for zzso The zzso can be classified into direct and indirect zzso The direct methods facilitate a valid comparison between populations or across calendar zzso However, they suffer from the problem of zzso By contrast, the indirect methods achieve zzso precision but may sacrifice a valid zzso comparison zzso the zzso zzso In this paper, we propose a new weighting system to zzso the zzso The weighting system is optimal in the sense that it produces zzso rates which are most stable and ensure a valid comparison between zzso The new weighting system calls for an zzso zzso However, the procedure zzso considerably under some zzso We use real and simulated data to demonstrate the new zzso
