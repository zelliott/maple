Signaling zzso are triggered by environmental stimulation and zzso the signal to regulate zzso zzso reconstruction of the underlying regulatory mechanisms requires zzso zzso experimental zzso However, practical experimental design approaches are still in their zzso Here, we propose a framework that zzso design of experiments and identification of regulatory relationships downstream of a given zzso The experimental design zzso called zzso aims to minimize the amount of laboratory effort required in this zzso To avoid ambiguity in the identification of regulatory zzso the choice of experiments zzso diversity between expression profiles of genes regulated through different zzso The framework takes advantage of expert knowledge about the pathways under study, zzso in a zzso logical zzso By considering zzso zzso between experiments, zzso is able to suggest a whole set of experiments that can be carried out zzso Our framework was applied to investigate interconnected signaling pathways in zzso In comparison with other approaches, zzso suggested the most zzso experiments for zzso identification of zzso regulation in this zzso
