In the decomposition of zzso zzso signals, principal component analysis zzso and independent component analysis zzso have widely been zzso However, as both methods are based on handling zzso data, zzso two-dimensional zzso zzso methods might improve the interpretation of frequency transformed zzso zzso of channel zzso frequency zzso time zzso The zzso decomposition method Parallel Factor zzso also named zzso zzso zzso was recently used to decompose the zzso transformed ongoing zzso of channel zzso frequency zzso time zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso data into zzso components using parallel factor zzso zzso 22, zzso In this article, zzso is used for the first time to decompose zzso transformed zzso zzso given by the zzso phase zzso zzso encompassing zzso analysis of differences between conditions and zzso analysis of channel zzso frequency zzso time zzso subject zzso zzso A flow chart is presented on how to perform data exploration using the zzso decomposition on zzso zzso This includes zzso channel zzso frequency zzso time zzso zzso of F test values from a repeated measures analysis of zzso zzso between two stimulus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso an overall zzso analysis of channel zzso frequency zzso time zzso subject zzso zzso The zzso zzso were able to extract the expected features of a previously reported zzso zzso zzso a quantitative difference of coherent zzso gamma activity between conditions of a visual zzso Furthermore, the method revealed a qualitative difference which has not previously been zzso The zzso decomposition of the zzso array of zzso F test values clearly showed the difference of regions of interest across zzso while the zzso analysis enabled zzso of both quantitative and qualitative zzso zzso zzso is a promising data exploratory tool in the analysis of the zzso transformed zzso zzso
