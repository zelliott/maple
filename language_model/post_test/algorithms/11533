A zzso zzso method is proposed for evaluating the frequency distribution function of organ transit zzso The zzso is treated as a zzso constrained zzso problem and it is solved by using a modified constrained variable metric zzso The only constraint implemented in the solution is that all the discrete transport function values are not allowed to become zzso The method is tested on model mathematical systems of known zzso transport zzso The tests are performed on systems that included noise in both the input and output zzso The criteria of successful zzso are the zzso error and, most importantly, the zzso of the zzso transport function from the known zzso zzso The proposed method is then applied, as a pilot experiment, to biological data obtained from an isolated, zzso rabbit lung preparation contained within a zzso The results indicate that this type of zzso produces stable estimates which faithfully follow the zzso function while zzso the need to assume either any functional form for the behavior of the transport function or any educated initial guess of its zzso
