To assess the efficacy of a variety of zzso models in the definition of zzso prostate cancer and to compare them to our own zzso zzso 

Two hundred zzso consecutive men with prostate zzso treated with external beam zzso alone were zzso zzso failure zzso as 3 consecutive zzso rises or the initiation of zzso deprivation zzso was examined using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The risk zzso model used in our department was then compared to a number of published models to assess the relative performance of each in discriminating risk zzso 

At a median follow-up of zzso months, the zzso zzso zzso survival zzso was zzso for the overall zzso This relates to zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso based on our institutional criteria for zzso zzso and high-risk features, zzso All the models examined showed an outcome group with a comparatively similar poor outcome when applied to our zzso Large variation was seen in the zzso groups, with zzso zzso ranging from zzso to zzso Good risk categories had similar large zzso All published models showed inability to delineate three significantly different outcome zzso zzso zzso analysis derived categories based on combinations of zzso (with zzso at zzso 20, and zzso zzso and zzso score (with zzso at 2-6 and zzso zzso 

Large variations in the relative performance of a number of zzso models are shown when applied to our local zzso The zzso efficacy of zzso and biopsy zzso score is zzso although other factors will need to be explored to further improve the performance of zzso models, particularly in defining the zzso subset of prostate zzso
