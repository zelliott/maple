The directed transfer function zzso has been proposed as a measure of information flow between the components of zzso time zzso In this paper, we discuss the interpretation of the zzso and compare it with other measures for directed zzso In particular, we show that the zzso does not indicate zzso or zzso zzso zzso but that it is closely related to the concept of impulse response function and can be viewed as a spectral measure for the total zzso influence from one component to zzso Furthermore, we investigate the statistical properties of the zzso and establish a simple significance level for testing for the zzso hypothesis of no information zzso
