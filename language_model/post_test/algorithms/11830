A software scheme is presented to extract the shapes of zzso and zzso from zzso computer zzso zzso data for use in prosthetic finite element zzso A snake zzso is implemented to overcome challenges of zzso tissue edge detection common in this zzso Means to enhance initial guess zzso ensure zzso zzso overcome zzso problems, and handle zzso regions are also zzso zzso of the zzso is demonstrated on image data from a unilateral zzso zzso zzso
