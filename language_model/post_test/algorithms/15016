The aim of this study was to compare the disposition of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in Japanese and Swedish patients receiving continuous zzso zzso drug monitoring data for C and the active zzso zzso zzso in Japanese patients receiving zzso (N zzso zzso and in those receiving C plus zzso zzso (N zzso zzso as well as in Swedes receiving C zzso (N zzso zzso and in those receiving C plus zzso (N zzso zzso were zzso A population kinetic approach with zzso feedback was used to estimate the individual clearance values for zzso The relationships between kinetic variables and zzso were evaluated by linear multiple zzso The median zzso and zzso zzso zzso oral clearance of C was zzso zzso zzso zzso in Japanese patients receiving C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in Japanese patients receiving C plus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in Swedish patients receiving C zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in Swedish patients receiving C plus zzso When combining all populations in a linear multiple regression, clearance was correlated with ethnic group zzso zzso zzso and age zzso zzso zzso but it was zzso with zzso body weight, and administration of zzso The zzso plasma concentration ratios were zzso in Japanese patients receiving C zzso zzso in Japanese patients receiving C plus zzso zzso in Swedish patients receiving C zzso and zzso in Swedish patients receiving C plus zzso Thus, the lower oral clearance of C in Japanese patients compared with that in Swedish patients is not accounted for by the lower body weight in Japanese patients or by zzso treatment with zzso and is therefore likely to be a true ethnic zzso The higher zzso ratio implicates a more pronounced zzso than zzso effect in Japanese patients than in Swedish zzso
