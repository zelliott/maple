zzso is a computer program that reconstructs the electron density of single particles from their X-ray zzso patterns, using a zzso adaptation of the holographic method in zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The method, like its parent, is unique because it does not rely on zzso transformation from the zzso pattern into real space and on zzso within measured zzso It is designed to deal successfully with zzso zzso incomplete and noisy zzso It is also designed to use prior information for ensuring sensible results and for reliable zzso This article describes the theoretical basis for the reconstruction algorithm, its zzso and quantitative results of tests on synthetic and zzso obtained zzso The program could be used for determining the structures of zzso samples and, eventually, of large biological molecular structures without the need for zzso
