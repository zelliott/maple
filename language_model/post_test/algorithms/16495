zzso movements can easily be adapted to different zzso zzso However, the cortical representation of the processing of visual input and its transformation into motor commands remains poorly zzso In a zzso zzso zzso subjects were presented with a 3-D zzso representation of a human arm, presenting movements of the subjects' right arm either as right or left zzso In order to isolate possible effects of coordinate zzso coordinate mirroring at the body zzso was implemented zzso In each of the resulting four conditions, 10 normal, right-handed subjects performed three runs of circular movements, while being scanned with zzso zzso analysis included orientation and accuracy of a fitted zzso zzso Imaging analysis was performed with zzso 99 with zzso threshold at P zzso zzso (not zzso The shape of the trajectory was dependent on the zzso of the arm, irrespective of movement zzso and accompanied by a robust zzso difference in the zzso zzso Movement mirroring decreased movement zzso which was related to increased zzso in the left zzso Those two movement conditions that cannot be observed in reality were related to an zzso focus at the left middle zzso zzso but showed no influence on movement zzso These findings demonstrate the prominent role of the zzso for zzso zzso transformations and have implications for the use of mirror therapy and virtual reality techniques, especially zzso such as Nintendo Wii in zzso
