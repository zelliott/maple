Several clinical and ambulatory settings zzso respiratory monitoring without a mouthpiece or zzso Several studies have demonstrated the utility of breathing sound zzso performed on the chest or neck to detect zzso However, there are limitations to skin surface zzso including zzso to external noise and zzso zzso Thus, this zzso study investigated a novel location for breathing sound zzso the external zzso The first study investigated characteristics of sound transmission from the zzso to the external ear in 19 adults zzso zzso zzso noise was directed into the zzso through a tube and mouthpiece and measured indirectly via an zzso affixed to the zzso zzso transmission to the external ear was measured with a microphone inserted into an zzso that provided acoustic isolation from ambient zzso zzso zzso estimates zzso zzso between the sounds recorded at the external ear and the zzso were observed up to approximately 800 zzso indicating a zzso region of preferred zzso In the second study, each of 20 subjects zzso zzso zzso through a zzso at targeted shallow zzso zzso and tidal zzso zzso flows zzso to body mass, and the resulting sounds were recorded at the external zzso zzso during breath hold measured background zzso zzso and tidal zzso flows, respectively, produced zzso zzso + zzso ratios of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso standard zzso across all subjects between 150 and 300 zzso zzso inspiration demonstrated zzso + zzso ratios of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, the external ear shows promise as an zzso site to detect and monitor breathing in a relatively zzso and unobtrusive zzso
