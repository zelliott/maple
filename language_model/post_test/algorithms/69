zzso resonance imaging zzso near metallic implants remains an zzso need because of severe artifacts, which mainly stem from large zzso field zzso This work addresses zzso near metallic implants with an innovative imaging technique called zzso zzso for Metal zzso zzso zzso The zzso technique zzso metal artifacts via robust zzso of each excited slice against zzso field zzso The robust slice zzso is achieved by extending a zzso zzso zzso sequence with additional zzso zzso Although the zzso compensation zzso suppresses most zzso zzso the zzso zzso fully resolves distorted zzso profiles that cause zzso zzso By positioning all spins in a zzso to their actual spatial locations, the zzso zzso can be corrected by summing up the resolved spins in each zzso The zzso technique does not require additional hardware and can be deployed to the large installed base of zzso zzso zzso The efficacy of the zzso technique in eliminating zzso zzso with feasible scan times is validated in phantom and in zzso spine and knee zzso
