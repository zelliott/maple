zzso are common features in the zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso They are visible in retinal images and their quantitative analysis is important in the follow up of the zzso However, their evaluation is fastidious and difficult to reproduce when performed zzso 

This article proposes a methodology for Automatic zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso Images zzso by using digital image processing zzso It includes an image zzso method to correct the uneven zzso and to zzso the intensity contrast with smoothing zzso The zzso detection uses a zzso based zzso zzso that zzso zzso and provides basic zzso characterization to the zzso zzso The detected zzso are then fitted by zzso zzso functions, producing a model of the image that is used to evaluate the affected zzso two images were graded by eight experts, with the aid of a custom made software and compared with zzso This comparison was based both on the total area and on the zzso zzso The zzso of variation, the zzso correlation zzso the sensitivity, the specificity and the zzso zzso were zzso 

The ground truth used in this study was the zzso average zzso In order to evaluate the proposed methodology three indicators were zzso zzso compared to the ground truth zzso each expert compared to the other experts zzso and a standard Global zzso method compared to the ground truth zzso results obtained for the three zzso zzso zzso and zzso were: zzso of variation zzso zzso zzso % and zzso zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso and zzso sensitivity zzso zzso and zzso specificity zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso produced by zzso obtained an agreement with the ground truth similar to the experts (with a higher zzso and significantly better than the zzso zzso Despite the higher sensitivity of the zzso method, explained by its over zzso bias, it has lower specificity and lower zzso zzso zzso it can be concluded that zzso accurately zzso zzso using a zzso method with benefits for zzso evaluation and zzso
