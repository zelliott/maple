zzso of heart valve leaflet deformation during the cardiac cycle is essential in understanding normal and pathological zzso function, as well as in the design of replacement heart zzso Due to the technical complexities involved, little work to date has been performed on dynamic valve leaflet zzso We have developed a novel experimental method utilizing a zzso structured zzso projection technique to investigate dynamic leaflet zzso Using a simulated circulatory loop, a zzso of zzso laser light points were projected over the entire leaflet zzso To obtain zzso views of the leaflet surface, a stereo system of high-resolution zzso was used to track the light points at discrete zzso points during the cardiac zzso The leaflet surface at each zzso point was reconstructed in three dimensions, and fit using our zzso zzso finite element approach zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To demonstrate our approach, we zzso a bovine zzso zzso heart zzso which revealed regions of complex zzso deformation and substantially different shapes during the opening and closing zzso In conclusion, the current method has high spatial and zzso resolution and can reconstruct the entire surface of the cusp zzso Because it is completely zzso this approach is zzso to studies of fatigue and zzso technology for tissue engineered heart zzso
