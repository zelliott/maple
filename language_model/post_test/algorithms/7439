We study the zzso accuracy and zzso efficiency of alternative zzso of the finite element solution procedure for the zzso equations of cardiac zzso focusing on the interaction of spatial zzso zzso with operator splitting and examining both zzso and zzso zzso methods and zzso that mix zzso storage of state variables with zzso zzso We evaluate the performance of all possible combinations of zzso approximations of consistent zzso and mass zzso Most generally, we find that zzso schemes and lumped approximations that produce zzso zzso zzso equations allow for the greatest zzso efficiency, this being afforded through the use of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso state variable zzso We identify two lumped approximation schemes that exhibit superior zzso rivaling that of the most expensive zzso consistent zzso Finally, we illustrate some of the zzso consequences of zzso error in zzso simulation relevant to cardiac zzso and zzso These results suggest caution with the use of zzso zzso zzso and zzso meshing zzso available in most commercially available meshing software, which produce zzso zzso having a large distribution of element zzso
