We tested the hypotheses that in patients with zzso heart failure zzso and sleep zzso breathing zzso zzso zzso improves cardiac function and quality of zzso Between March 2007 and September 2009, patients with stable zzso zzso zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso index zzso 20 events zzso zzso were zzso to receive either zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and optimal medical management, or optimal medical management alone zzso Outcomes were assessed at baseline and 12 zzso The zzso index assessed with zzso scored in one core laboratory was significantly more reduced in the zzso group zzso zzso 16 versus zzso zzso 13 events zzso zzso zzso with an average use of zzso zzso zzso h zzso zzso Both groups showed similar improvements of the primary zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 versus zzso zzso zzso zzso assessed with zzso In the zzso group, reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly greater zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso 625 zzso zzso zzso zzso No differences were observed between the groups in zzso quality of zzso In patients with zzso and zzso zzso reduced zzso levels, but improvement of zzso or quality of life was not greater than in the control zzso The data support that such patients can be zzso in zzso long-term trials of positive airway pressure therapy versus control to determine effects on cardiovascular zzso
