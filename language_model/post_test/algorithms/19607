Abstract The zzso clock protein zzso regulates the zzso cycle by exhibiting rhythms in transcription, translation, and zzso zzso zzso persists in zzso cycling even under zzso conditions and was zzso in zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso This presents a novel perspective for zzso zzso occurring due to interactions between clock zzso Using mathematical models, the authors investigated the mechanism for the zzso zzso zzso zzso They developed a simple model based on the possible zzso behavior, which is zzso suggested by zzso et zzso zzso zzso J, zzso They hypothesized that the zzso complex formation, followed by a decrease in free zzso zzso may zzso the zzso zzso rate, and it acts as negative feedback in the zzso However, this model was shown not to be adequate to generate the zzso zzso zzso The authors developed the general version of the model and determined the necessary condition to generate the zzso zzso zzso Linear stability analysis revealed that zzso can occur when the distance of feedback between the recipient reaction and the zzso is far zzso Furthermore, they classified negative feedback regulations in the closed system into 2 zzso zzso zzso and stabilizing zzso Based on this result, the authors predicted that, in addition to the identified states of zzso another unknown state must be present between zzso zzso and the complex zzso By incorporating the unknown state into the previous model, they realized the periodic pattern reminiscent of the zzso zzso cycle in computer zzso This result implies that the zzso complex formation requires more than 1 step of zzso zzso including zzso or zzso change of zzso
