zzso zzso zzso filters out zzso signals from a fluorescent background by zzso using multiple zzso zzso The filtering method exploits the shift of the zzso zzso with zzso frequency and the zzso response of the fluorescent zzso This technique builds upon previous work which used two slightly shifted zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in order to filter the zzso zzso An zzso zzso is used to estimate the zzso and zzso signals from multiple zzso acquired with slightly shifted zzso zzso In both simulation and experiment, the efficacy of the zzso increases with the number of zzso zzso even when holding the total zzso energy constant, such that the signal to noise ratio is zzso zzso to the number of zzso zzso In situations where the intense zzso causes significant shot noise compared to the weak zzso signals, the zzso approach is more effective than zzso techniques such as zzso background zzso
