In the sequencing process, reads of the sequence are generated, then assembled to form zzso New technologies can produce reads faster with lower cost and higher zzso However, these reads are zzso With zzso short reads make the assembly step more zzso zzso et zzso zzso proposed an zzso to correct the reads prior to the assembly zzso The result is not satisfactory when the error rate is high zzso zzso We improve their approach to handle reads of higher error zzso Experimental results show that our approach is much more effective in correcting zzso producing zzso of higher zzso
