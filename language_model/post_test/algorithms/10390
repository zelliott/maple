This study developed and assessed a computerized scheme to detect breast abnormalities and predict the risk of developing cancer based on bilateral zzso tissue zzso A digital zzso database of 100 randomly selected negative cases and 100 positive cases for having high-risk of developing breast cancer was zzso Each case includes four images of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso views of the left and right zzso To detect bilateral zzso tissue zzso a pool of 20 zzso features was zzso A genetic zzso was applied to select optimal features and build an artificial neural network based zzso to predict the likelihood of a test case being zzso The zzso validation method was used to evaluate the zzso zzso Several approaches were investigated to improve the zzso performance including zzso zzso tissue features from either selected regions of interests or the entire segmented breast area depicted on bilateral images in one view, and the fusion of zzso results from two zzso The results showed that zzso using the features zzso from the entire breast area, the zzso yielded the higher performance than using zzso and zzso using a weighted average fusion method, the zzso achieved the highest performance with the area under zzso curve of zzso At zzso zzso the scheme detected zzso of high-risk cases in which zzso developed and verified zzso months zzso The study demonstrated the feasibility of applying a computerized scheme to detect cases with high risk of developing breast cancer based on zzso bilateral zzso tissue zzso
