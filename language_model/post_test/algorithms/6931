Recent advances in biotechnology offer the ability to measure the levels of expression of thousands of genes in zzso Analysis of such data can provide understanding and insight into gene function and regulatory zzso Several machine learning approaches have been used to aid to understand the functions of zzso However, these tasks are made more difficult due to the noisy nature of array data and the overwhelming number of gene zzso In this paper, we use the parallel genetic zzso to filter out the zzso genes relative to zzso By combing with the zzso method proposed by zzso et zzso and zzso et zzso we zzso the data sets with zzso of different classes, and the preliminary results are presented in this zzso
