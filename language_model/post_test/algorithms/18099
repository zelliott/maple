Genes often regulate multiple zzso zzso clusters of traits influenced by a common group of genes helps zzso regulatory networks and can improve linkage zzso 

We show that the zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso between two zzso score profiles can, with high specificity and sensitivity, identify pairs of genes that have their zzso regulated by shared quantitative trait zzso zzso Furthermore, using theoretical and/or empirical methods, we can approximate the distribution of zzso L under the zzso hypothesis of no common zzso zzso it is possible to calculate zzso and false discovery rates for testing whether two traits share common zzso We then examine the properties of zzso L through simulation and use zzso L to cluster genes in a zzso zzso experiment examining zzso zzso 

zzso show that zzso L can have more power than the zzso methods currently used in zzso zzso Combining experimental results with Gene zzso zzso zzso show that genes within a zzso cluster often share similar zzso
