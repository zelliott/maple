Presented is an zzso for the approximate calculation of the membrane stress distribution and the internal pressure of a steadily zzso red zzso The zzso is based on an idealized zzso model of the zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1982, zzso zzso zzso zzso joined with experimental observations of projected zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results are zzso because the membrane shape and zzso are assumed a zzso rather than being determined via appropriate material zzso relations for the zzso these results are, zzso believed to be approximately correct, and show that internal pressure builds up slowly as cell zzso increases, rising more rapidly as the zzso cell approaches the limiting geometry of a zzso zzso The maximum zzso stress zzso in the membrane was found to be below but approaching the yield point range at the highest zzso rate zzso
