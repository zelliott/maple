We consider the problem of detecting zzso changes in the functional state of human subjects due to varying levels of cognitive load using real-time zzso zzso The proposed approach relies on monitoring several channels of electroencephalogram zzso and zzso zzso signals using the methods of statistical process zzso It is demonstrated that control zzso methods are capable of detecting changes in zzso signals that are induced by varying cognitive load with high accuracy and low false alarm rates, and are capable of accommodating zzso differences while being robust with respect to differences between different trials performed by the same zzso
