zzso dynamics zzso simulations were used to study the stability and zzso of zzso and cellulose zzso The recently developed zzso zzso force field was further tested by simulating zzso zzso and zzso The MD simulations reproduced fairly well the favorable zzso of zzso defined by the zzso angles related with the zzso bond and the radius zzso of zzso The effects of zzso at different zzso groups on the stability of zzso and cellulose fragments were zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso reduce the stability of a single zzso more than zzso at zzso while the latter reduces the stability of a double zzso zzso zzso zzso differences between the zzso zzso and cellulose fragments and the zzso species were studied using the zzso zzso zzso It was found that zzso at zzso has the biggest effect, in agreement with zzso
