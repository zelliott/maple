To compare the different digital filters implemented in the zzso zzso system with conventional film and to analyze the filter specificity to zzso zzso 

Ten panoramic image pairs and 10 zzso image pairs (1 digital and 1 zzso were obtained from 20 patients conventionally and zzso The display quality of different zzso image structures was rated zzso on a zzso zzso The responses were evaluated using zzso and zzso post hoc zzso The zzso reliability was evaluated by Cohen's zzso zzso 

The display quality of zzso structures was rated higher by using zzso 1 or 2 filters for zzso and zzso 1 or 2 filters for panoramic images, whereas zzso and Noise zzso images received the lowest zzso compared to all other digital image zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The superiority of conventional zzso to the digital ones was statistically significant zzso zzso or zzso zzso and P zzso or zzso zzso zzso 

Depending on the diagnostic task, digital images of the zzso system should be filtered before zzso Perfect conventional zzso still remain the gold standard for image zzso
