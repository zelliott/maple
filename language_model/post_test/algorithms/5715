zzso glasses are of considerable current interest, primarily for applications in fiber circuitry, optical isolation, zzso diodes, optical switching and zzso While the benchmark materials are still zzso glasses offer a variety of unique advantages, such as very high zzso and zzso zzso and, in principle, the possibility of being produced in fiber zzso In comparison to conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso crystal fibers with zzso glasses offers an alternative route to creating complex zzso zzso from unusual combinations of zzso For instance, strongly zzso zzso or zzso glasses with high zzso index can be combined with zzso in an zzso zzso zzso This promises the zzso of zzso but strongly active glass candidates as fiber zzso for example in zzso crystal zzso
