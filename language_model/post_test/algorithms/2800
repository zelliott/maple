We present the zzso structures and zzso of clusters of the linear zzso zzso with small numbers of zzso molecules with zzso additive zzso zzso energies of zzso and zzso complexes were calculated by averaging the corresponding zzso zzso over the zzso angular zzso The averaged zzso potential has three zzso corresponding to the zzso and the linear zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso structures was performed using a zzso zzso It was found that zzso molecules fill three zzso rings around the zzso zzso each of them containing up to five zzso zzso followed by zzso of two zzso molecules at the oxygen and nitrogen zzso The first zzso shell is completed at N zzso zzso The calculated chemical potential zzso with cluster size up to the completed first zzso zzso These results are consistent with the available experimental zzso
