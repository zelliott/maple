zzso element zzso analysis is a well established technique for the evaluation of the elastic properties of zzso bone, but is limited in its application due to the large number of elements that it requires to represent the complex internal structure of the zzso In this paper, we present an alternative zzso approach that makes use of a recently developed zzso Skeleton zzso Analysis zzso technique to represent the complex internal structure of zzso bone as a network of simple straight beam elements in which the beams are assigned geometrical properties of the zzso that they zzso Since an enormous reduction of zzso can be obtained with this beam modeling approach, ranging from approximately 1,200 to 3,600 for the problems investigated here, we think that the zzso modeling technique that we introduced could potentially constitute an interesting alternative for the evaluation of the elastic mechanical properties of zzso zzso
