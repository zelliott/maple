In the registration of zzso and stereo retinal images, the rotation angle is normally less than 5 degrees and the zzso factor is between zzso and zzso Due to sitting constraints in the imaging process, the zzso translation can be more than 100 zzso but the y translation is usually zzso This paper successfully incorporates these constraints in the mutual zzso registration and exploits a constrained zzso to seek an optimal zzso The proposed approach increases the success rate of the registration zzso zzso The impacts of the dynamic ranges of registration parameters on the registration outcome are studied and the effects of the order of zzso zzso and translation are also zzso
