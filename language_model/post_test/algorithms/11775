zzso has become an active research area in recent zzso The amount of mapped sequences doubles every zzso zzso zzso has been widely employed for retrieving sequences which has similar zzso to a given zzso However, zzso has to scan the entire database every time when a query is zzso This can be very time consuming especially when the database is zzso In this paper, we study the problem on how to build a persistent index structure for protein sequences to support approximate zzso The zzso tree has been proposed as a solution to index sequence database and has been deployed on organizing DNA sequences zzso et zzso zzso Unfortunately, it suffers from the problem of zzso zzso that prevents it from being applied efficiently to a large zzso The performance even degrades further for protein database due to a larger zzso at each zzso Here, we employ an indexing structure, called zzso to support approximate match in zzso time on a large protein zzso We call this indexing method as sequence approximate match zzso index zzso The search of approximate matches can be properly directed to the portion in the database with a high potential of matching zzso It has been demonstrated in our experiments that the potential performance improvement is in an order of magnitude over alternative methods such as the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso
