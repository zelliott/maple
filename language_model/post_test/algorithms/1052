Changes in the zzso state of zzso affect its optical qualities, such as light scattering and zzso In this study, the rate of zzso loss was measured when zzso zzso zzso with different zzso history were left to zzso Four groups of zzso were zzso In groups A, B and C, the zzso were prepared in zzso in an zzso zzso Group A was kept as control, and groups B and C were zzso (4 weeks) without and with 1 zzso F in solution, zzso Group D consisted of natural zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured for all zzso immediately after removal from water and subsequently at short intervals for 30 zzso The change in zzso with zzso varied between the zzso In zzso from groups A and B, it followed a double exponential decrease, while in zzso from groups C and D, it followed a zzso zzso In all groups, the zzso of sound surfaces declined zzso The zzso zzso zzso defined as zzso - zzso zzso became constant after periods of zzso of about 5, 5, 20 and 5 zzso for groups A to D, zzso The observation of the change of zzso with zzso should be taken into consideration when planning studies that use zzso as an assessment zzso However, it might also be used to gain insight into the properties for fluid transport inside the various zzso relevant to zzso or zzso zzso
