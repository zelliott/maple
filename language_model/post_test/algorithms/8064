The concept of multiple graph alignment zzso has recently been introduced as a novel method for the structural analysis of zzso Using approximate graph matching techniques, this method enables the robust identification of approximately zzso patterns in biologically related zzso In particular, zzso enables the characterization of functional protein families independent of sequence or fold zzso This article first recalls the concept of zzso and then addresses the problem of computing optimal alignments from an zzso point of zzso In this regard, a method from the field of evolutionary zzso is proposed and zzso compared with a zzso existing zzso zzso zzso it is shown that the former yields significantly better results than the latter, albeit at the cost of an increased zzso
