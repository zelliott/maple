We propose a new approach to determine a suitable zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso The same zzso as in complete active space zzso zzso zzso is used but it is split in two parts, a principal space zzso and a much larger extended space zzso zzso zzso technique is employed to map the initial zzso problem to a zzso equal to that of zzso zzso Combined with a simplified expression for the zzso portion of the zzso we are able to drastically reduce the storage and zzso demands of the zzso zzso This scheme is used to produce reference zzso and energies for subsequent zzso zzso theory zzso zzso zzso the constraint of computing the exact zzso energy and zzso prior to the zzso treatment introduces a zzso paradigm for zzso zzso Based on the results of test calculations, we argue that principal parts with only few zzso of the total number of zzso zzso could provide final zzso zzso energies of the same accuracy as in the standard zzso In the future, zzso improvements for this scheme will bring into reach active spaces much beyond the present limit of zzso methods, therefore allowing for accurate studies of systems featuring strong zzso
