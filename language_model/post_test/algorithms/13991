With the progression of structural zzso projects, comparative modeling remains an increasingly important method of zzso It helps to bridge the gap between the available sequence and structure information by providing reliable and accurate protein zzso Comparative modeling based on more than zzso sequence identity is now approaching its natural zzso limits and further improvements require the development of effective refinement techniques capable of driving models toward native zzso For difficult targets, for which the most significant progress in recent years has been observed, optimal template selection and alignment accuracy are still the major zzso
