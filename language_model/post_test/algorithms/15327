zzso zzso zzso a woody zzso that grows in zzso and North Africa, is an ornamental and medicinal zzso Its fruits have been used for centuries in China as a traditional herbal medicine and as a valuable zzso zzso There has been no report describing the selection of reference genes for stringent zzso for quantitative zzso zzso in zzso The present study identified reliable reference genes for zzso of zzso data in zzso during fruit development from among eight candidate genes zzso zzso G, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso using the zzso and zzso statistical zzso The results showed that the zzso references genes differed across the zzso A combination of zzso and zzso would be appropriate as a reference panel for zzso gene expression data across fruit zzso zzso A combination of zzso zzso and zzso would be appropriate as a reference panel for zzso gene expression data at the stage A tested, whereas the combination of zzso zzso and zzso G was the most suitable for stage zzso zzso and zzso exhibited the most stable expression under stage C and stage zzso zzso ranking of reference gene candidates was slightly different from that determined by zzso These results provide guidelines for the selection of reference genes under different development stages and also represent a foundation for more accurate and widespread use of zzso in zzso gene zzso
