The transport of zzso particles by zzso is a major biological zzso Under appropriate in zzso conditions, zzso preparations behave as a zzso system and show zzso zzso In particular, they form zzso structures that zzso over zzso distances by a combination of reaction and zzso 

Here, we show that zzso also gives rise to a collective transport of zzso particles along a specific zzso zzso such as polystyrene zzso zzso zzso and zzso are carried at speeds of several zzso per zzso The process also results in the zzso zzso of these zzso After zzso is completed, they show the same pattern of zzso as the zzso zzso simulations of a population of growing and shrinking zzso incorporating zzso realistic reaction zzso predict zzso They forecast that during zzso zzso parallel zzso of oriented zzso form which cross the reaction space in successive zzso Such travelling waves are capable of transporting zzso zzso The fact that in the simulations, the aligned zzso move along the same direction and at the same speed as the particles move, suggest that this process forms the underlying mechanism for the observed transport zzso 

This process constitutes a novel physical chemical mechanism by which chemical energy is converted into collective transport of zzso particles along a given zzso zzso of this type provides a new mechanism by which zzso cellular particles such as zzso and zzso can be displaced and simultaneously zzso by zzso It is plausible that processes of this type occur in zzso
