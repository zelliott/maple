One of the many risks of zzso space flights is the excessive exposure to zzso radiation, which has great importance particularly during solar zzso and higher sun zzso Monitoring of the zzso radiation on board space vehicles is carried out on the basis of wide international zzso Since space radiation consists mainly of charged heavy particles zzso alpha and heavier zzso the equivalent dose differs significantly from the absorbed zzso A radiation weighting factor zzso is used to convert absorbed dose zzso to equivalent dose zzso zzso is a function of the linear energy transfer of the zzso Recently used equipment is suitable for measuring certain radiation field parameters changing in space and over time, so a combination of different zzso and calculations is required to zzso the radiation field in terms of dose zzso The objectives of this project are to develop and manufacture a zzso silicon detector zzso called zzso and to develop software for data evaluation of the measured energy deposition zzso The device will be able to determine absorbed dose and dose equivalent of the space zzso
