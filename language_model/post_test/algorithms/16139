This study tested the hypothesis that changes in indirect markers of muscle damage following zzso eccentric exercise would be smaller for the knee zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared with the elbow zzso zzso and zzso zzso A total of 17 sedentary men performed five sets of six zzso zzso zzso zzso eccentric zzso of zzso zzso of motion, zzso zzso 0 zzso full zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using a different limb with a zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Changes in zzso zzso and concentric zzso strength, optimum angle, limb zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso muscle zzso and zzso of zzso ultrasound images before and for 5 days following exercise were compared amongst the four exercises using zzso zzso zzso All variables changed significantly following zzso zzso and zzso exercises, but zzso exercise did not change the optimum angle, limb zzso and zzso Compared with zzso and zzso zzso and zzso showed significantly greater changes in all zzso without significant differences between zzso and zzso Changes in all variables were significantly greater for zzso than zzso For the same subjects, the magnitude of change in the dependent variables following exercise varied among the zzso These results suggest that the two arm muscles are equally more susceptible to muscle damage than leg muscles, but zzso is more susceptible to muscle damage than zzso The difference in the zzso to muscle damage seems to be associated with the use of muscles in daily zzso
