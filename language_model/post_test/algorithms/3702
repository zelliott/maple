The relationship between zzso usage and zzso expression in zzso zzso has been extensively zzso Recently, protein expression data for the whole zzso zzso was zzso We investigate which properties of coding DNA sequences can be used to predict expression zzso The new zzso by zzso et zzso for computing dominating zzso bias in a zzso is zzso It is concluded that it works at least as well as existing methods, and eliminates the need to arbitrarily choose a set of highly expressed zzso Also, the hypothesis that information on zzso pair zzso can be used to predict expression is zzso Our conclusion is that zzso pairs do not contribute more information than do single zzso zzso zzso correlation between predicted and actual expression data using properties of coding DNA sequences is around zzso zzso while being a useful source of information, the expression levels predicted by these methods should only be used as a rule of zzso
