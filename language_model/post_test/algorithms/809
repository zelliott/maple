Many different methods and techniques have been investigated for the processing and analysis of zzso gene expression profiling zzso It is noted that the accuracy and reliability of the results are often dependent on the measurement approaches applied, and no single measurement so far is guaranteed to generate a satisfactory zzso In this paper, an zzso fusion approach is presented for zzso genes that are zzso to clinical outcomes zzso of diffuse large zzso zzso on a set of zzso data for gene expression zzso The approach zzso a set of zzso from different aspects in terms of the zzso indications and merit expectations of the gene expression patterns with respect to the clinical zzso A combination of statistical and zzso criteria, continuous and discrete zzso as well as zzso and zzso evaluations is applied in the zzso By zzso these zzso a set of genes that are indicative to the clinical outcomes are better captured from the gene expression profiling zzso
