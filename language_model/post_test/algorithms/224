Lots of studies on zzso zzso zzso computer assisted diagnosis are based on certain important zzso components which only account for local zzso zzso zzso signals which were regarded as zzso zzso data were zzso to extract features from global information in this zzso zzso feature extraction techniques for zzso attempt to zzso all the classes zzso However sometimes it is more important to better recognize certain specific classes rather than to discriminate all the zzso A feature extraction method based on zzso was proposed to discriminate the specific classes, which the zzso priority was given zzso and each of the other classes was separated at the same zzso The method includes data reduction by principal component analysis zzso data zzso by zzso transformation and derivation of projecting zzso for zzso zzso The data in the analysis were collected from zzso diagnostic zzso zzso The results show that the proposed method can obtain a small number of effective features from zzso zzso to better zzso classes with priority, and the other classes can be classified at the same zzso
