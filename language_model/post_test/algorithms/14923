In this paper, zzso zzso emissions zzso are zzso by an active auditory model, and zzso by continuous zzso transform zzso to study the zzso relationship and the generation of zzso zzso The controlled zzso sources that relate to the mobile mechanism of the outer hair cells zzso are proposed to serve as the generation sources of zzso zzso The zzso method is adopted to calculate the auditory zzso The mother zzso used in zzso is selected on basis of the zzso The results of this study show that the simulated zzso signal is similar to the clinically detected ones not only in the zzso zzso but also in the zzso zzso It seems to be clear that the generation of zzso signals is related to the same active mechanism as the cochlear sharp frequency zzso
