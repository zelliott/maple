zzso zzso zzso zzso has been proposed for the comprehensive assessment of coronary artery zzso and zzso zzso yet traditionally required reducing the zzso resolution of cardiac zzso We evaluated a reconstruction zzso that preserves high zzso resolution at cardiac zzso 

Twelve consecutive patients (3 zzso mean zzso age, 64 zzso zzso with an abnormal single zzso zzso CT result underwent invasive coronary zzso and cardiac zzso zzso CT studies were reconstructed using the standard zzso with zzso zzso resolution and a hybrid zzso providing zzso zzso zzso These studies were rated for coronary image quality and motion artifacts and compared with invasive coronary zzso zzso 

One hundred zzso coronary artery segments zzso were zzso The standard zzso reconstruction provided zzso diagnostic segments compared with zzso using the zzso hybrid zzso Image quality was rated significantly zzso zzso zzso better with hybrid reconstruction and had zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso positive zzso value, and zzso negative zzso value for detecting significant zzso versus zzso zzso zzso and zzso with standard zzso zzso 

zzso image reconstruction zzso the former limitations in zzso resolution of cardiac zzso
