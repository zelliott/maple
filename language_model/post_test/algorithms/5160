A single flexible zzso chain can assume a variety of zzso which can be broadly classified as expanded zzso collapsed zzso and compact zzso Here we study transitions between these zzso states for an zzso zzso chain comprised of zzso zzso zzso with zzso diameter zzso and zzso diameter zzso zzso sampling with zzso zzso Carlo moves is used to zzso the density of states for this chain and both zzso and zzso analyses are used to identify and characterize phase transitions in this finite size zzso The zzso range zzso zzso phase zzso is constructed for zzso zzso assume an expanded zzso zzso at high temperatures and a zzso structure at low zzso For zzso these two states are separated by an intervening collapsed zzso phase and thus, with decreasing temperature a chain zzso a continuous zzso zzso transition followed by a zzso zzso zzso zzso For well diameters zzso the collapse transition is pre-empted by the freezing transition and thus there is a direct zzso zzso phase zzso These results confirm the recent zzso based on a lattice zzso model, that a collapsed zzso state is unstable with respect to a solid phase for flexible zzso with sufficiently short-range zzso zzso
