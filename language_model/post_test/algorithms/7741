A method has been developed, included in the zzso zzso for measuring and assessment of the zzso electromagnetic field zzso at the working zzso In a hygienic assessment of fields, zzso from several sources with different zzso in one premises, it cannot be applied because of the step frequency relationship of the hygienic zzso The same difficulty is encountered in the hygienic assessment of zzso in zzso where the summing of the from several radio television and other zzso is zzso With the zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso (in a zzso zzso in such cases, the zzso field of the working place cannot de resolve into component zzso obtained from the separate generators and hygienic assessment of the determined value cannot be zzso The same concerns also the cases when we separately measure the radiation from each separate zzso summing is zzso If the electromagnetic waves are discussed as flat waves in the free space, a system of zzso equations with 3 m unknown quantities could be worked out after several zzso where m is the number of the emitting generators in the zzso Furthermore, if consideration is given to the technical devices for measurement of zzso zzso of zzso a system of 2 m equations with so many unknown zzso could be zzso hence a mathematical method is proposed for its zzso The expression of the zzso of the field is zzso in a zzso and an original zzso is proposed for the solving of the zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
