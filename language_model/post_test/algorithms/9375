We here present a neural network-based method for the prediction of protein zzso sites in zzso important model zzso for basic zzso zzso protein zzso site zzso are primarily based on zzso data and show reduced sensitivity on zzso zzso sites compared to those in humans, suggesting the need for an zzso zzso site zzso zzso achieves a correlation zzso close to zzso with a sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso and zzso existing zzso in the identification of zzso sites in zzso 

The zzso prediction service is available as a public web server at zzso
