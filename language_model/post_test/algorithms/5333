We explore the possibility of extending the stabilizing transformations approach zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 28, zzso zzso to the problem of locating large numbers of unstable periodic orbits in zzso flows, in particular those that result from spatial zzso of partial differential zzso The approach has been shown to be highly efficient when detecting large sets of periodic orbits in zzso zzso Extension to zzso flows has been achieved by the use of an appropriate zzso surface of section zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 400, 67 zzso For the case of zzso flows, we show that it is more efficient to apply stabilizing transformations directly to the flows without the use of the zzso surface of zzso We use the proposed approach to find many unstable periodic orbits in the model example of a chaotic zzso extended zzso zzso zzso The performance of the proposed method is compared against other methods such as zzso and zzso zzso In the latter case, we also argue that the zzso algorithm, or any other zzso approach, is more efficient and simpler in zzso when applied directly to the detection of periodic orbits in zzso flows without the use of the zzso surface of section or other additional zzso
