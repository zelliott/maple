A method is presented that combines zzso polarization resolved zzso zzso probe zzso and density functional theory calculations in determining the three-dimensional orientation of an electronic transition zzso moment zzso within the molecular zzso The method is demonstrated on the approximately zzso zzso zzso 314 zzso dissolved in zzso which can exist in two ground state zzso the zzso and the zzso Based on an exhaustive search analysis on polarization resolved measurement data for four different zzso zzso it is concluded that zzso in zzso is the zzso The electronic zzso zzso for the electronic zzso transition is determined and the analysis shows that performing the procedure for four zzso modes instead of the minimally required three reduces the zzso probability area from zzso to zzso of the solution zzso Moreover, the fastest zzso correlation time zzso for the zzso zzso is determined to be zzso zzso
