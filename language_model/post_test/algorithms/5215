We present an approach to skeletal muscle zzso and its regulation over different scales ranging from zzso studies in intact muscle fibers down to the zzso and interaction of single motor protein zzso At each scale, zzso zzso as a measure for weak zzso cycling rates are extracted and zzso Experimental approaches include transmitted light zzso second harmonic generation imaging of contracting zzso and zzso zzso of single zzso zzso Each method yields image sequences that are analyzed with automated image processing zzso to extract the contraction zzso Using this approach, we show how to isolate the contribution of the motor proteins zzso and zzso and their zzso by regulatory proteins from the concerted action of zzso zzso on a more complex cellular zzso The advantage of this approach is that averaged contraction zzso can be determined on the different scales ranging from isolated motor proteins to zzso levels in zzso and zzso zzso within the cellular zzso Our results show that maximum zzso zzso during in zzso electrical zzso of zzso contraction in intact single muscle cells can substantially zzso from sliding zzso obtained in oriented in zzso zzso zzso of isolated motor proteins showing that zzso contraction zzso not simply translate zzso between zzso zzso To adequately resolve the very fast initial mechanical zzso zzso of zzso at each scale, it was necessary to implement high-speed imaging zzso In the case of intact fibers and single zzso zzso we achieved a major increase in zzso resolution up to frame rates of zzso zzso using zzso image sensor zzso The data we obtained at this unprecedented zzso resolution and the parameters extracted can be used to validate results obtained from zzso models of motor protein interaction and skeletal muscle zzso in health and muscle zzso Our approach is feasible to explain the possible underlying mechanisms that contribute to different zzso zzso at different scales and zzso
