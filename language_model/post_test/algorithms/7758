We simultaneously measured zzso and zzso exhalation rates in areas of weathered acid rocks in Japan to investigate the relationship between them and between measured and calculated zzso exhalation zzso To calculate the zzso exhalation rate, we used an equation proposed by zzso Our analysis showed that both the zzso and zzso exhalation rates measured at one location in a natural environment zzso widely, even within one zzso We found a strong correlation between the zzso and zzso exhalation zzso The measured zzso exhalation rates tended to be lower than the calculated zzso the mean ratio of the measured exhalation rate to the calculated rate was zzso We concluded that the zzso equation is zzso under a controlled environment zzso zzso zzso but not where there are artificial underground structures that may influence the transportation of zzso in zzso
