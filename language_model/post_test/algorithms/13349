zzso devices are highly rated in zzso performance zzso A few years ago, the broad variety of existing products was extended by the zzso zzso In order for an zzso device to be clinically useful, the reliability of specific applications must be zzso Although there have already been single studies on this topic for the zzso 2000 concerning maximum strength zzso there has been no study regarding the assessment of zzso so zzso The aim of the present study was to establish the reliability for various methods of zzso of zzso using the zzso zzso 

A sample of 33 healthy young subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso participated in one zzso and two testing sessions, zzso days zzso Testing consisted of a series 30 full effort concentric zzso cycles of the right knee muscles at an angular zzso of 180 zzso Based on the parameters Peak, zzso and Work for each repetition, zzso of absolute zzso and relative zzso zzso were zzso zzso was calculated as the mean value of all testing zzso zzso was determined in two ways: on the one hand, as the percentage decrease between the first and the last 5 repetitions zzso and on the other, as the negative slope derived from the linear zzso zzso of all repetitions zzso zzso of systematic errors was performed using paired sample zzso relative and absolute reliability were examined using zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso and standard error of measurement zzso zzso 

In general, for extension zzso concerning zzso and - in an weakened form - zzso high zzso zzso of zzso combined with clinically acceptable values of zzso of zzso % could be zzso For zzso zzso this only applies to zzso whereas results for zzso turned out to be clearly weaker with zzso and zzso values of zzso and zzso % and leave considerable doubts on the clinical zzso However, if there should be after all a need to measure zzso for zzso it is - in view of the stronger reliability results - recommended zzso to concentrate on the calculation of zzso zzso to use the zzso Work and - in view of considerable zzso and learning effects of zzso % - zzso to include a zzso period that extends exceeds the zzso session conducted in the present zzso
