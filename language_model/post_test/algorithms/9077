Within an zzso design aimed at studying what type of soccer is better adapted to the possibilities of the zzso year-old child, a comparison was made of the results obtained using two fully consolidated analysis techniques in zzso methods, and which form the basis in the development of two respective software zzso zzso and zzso which allow one to detect the existence of sequential patterns hidden in a data zzso This work is intended to shed light on the comparison of results obtained using these two analysis zzso In particular, the data used for the analysis are zzso event data zzso the lexicon of the sequential zzso and do not incorporate the duration zzso zzso for the detection of regular structures using the zzso program zzso a constant duration has conventionally been assigned to each zzso Using zzso among the greatest number of sequential structures zzso zzso and zzso correspondence was observed zzso reflecting identical zzso with each and every one of the sequential patterns obtained using the lag technique, by the zzso zzso This coincidence strengthens the link between the zzso that support zzso and zzso The results indicate that zzso soccer and zzso soccer types facilitate the spatial zzso of the game by the child, compared with the adult form, zzso zzso
