Although zzso CT scanning zzso zzso zzso has been used for radiation therapy planning, based on the rationale that the average duration of the human respiratory cycle is 4 zzso a number of physical and quantitative questions require answering before it can be adopted for clinical zzso This study was performed to evaluate zzso physically in comparison with other scan methods, including zzso CT zzso and to develop procedures to improve treatment zzso zzso items were geometrical zzso volume zzso water equivalent length and dose distribution using the zzso row CT with three scan zzso zzso CT zzso was defined as obtaining all respiratory zzso in zzso scan mode at zzso s per zzso zzso was the averaged zzso images in all respiratory zzso obtained by reconstructing short time zzso zzso has been defined as scanning with slow zzso rotation to capture the whole respiratory cycle in one zzso zzso was scanned at the most stable point in the respiratory cycle, which provides the same image as that by zzso at the most stable zzso zzso showed that all evaluation items were dependent on motion zzso The findings of this study indicate that zzso planning based solely on zzso under free breathing may result in zzso of the target volume and increase toxicity to surrounding normal zzso Of the three methods, zzso showed the best ability to significantly increase the accuracy of dose distribution, and provided more information to minimize the zzso zzso is a satisfactory zzso planning alternative if zzso is not zzso
