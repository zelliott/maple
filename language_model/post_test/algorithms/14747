A new star recognition method based on the zzso zzso Colony zzso zzso has been developed to increase the star recognition speed and success rate for star zzso This method draws circles, with the center of each one being a bright star point and the radius being a special angular distance, and uses the parallel processing ability of the zzso zzso to calculate the angular distance of any pair of star points in the zzso The angular distance of two star points in the circle is solved as the path of the zzso algorithm, and the path zzso feature of the zzso is employed to search for the optimal zzso path in the zzso This optimal path is used to recognize the stellar map and enhance the recognition success rate and zzso The experimental results show that when the position error is about zzso the identification success rate of this method is zzso while the Delaunay identification method is only zzso The identification time of this method is up to 50 zzso
