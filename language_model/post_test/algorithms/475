The structure and temperature zzso of the zzso zzso zzso as a function of zzso concentration were examined using differential scanning zzso zzso zzso zzso scattering zzso and zzso X-ray zzso zzso zzso revealed the coexistence of two zzso zzso in the zzso the zzso phase, formed due to zzso binding to the zzso zzso and the condensed zzso phase zzso with DNA strands packed between the zzso zzso With increasing concentration of zzso the temperature of the gel - zzso phase transition of zzso increases in both zzso and the volume fraction of zzso phase zzso In the gel state (at 20 degrees zzso the repeat distance of zzso phase is constant, zzso approximately zzso zzso up to 20 zzso of zzso and increases for higher zzso of the zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso phase decreases substantially with the increasing concentration of the salt in the zzso In the zzso state, zzso above 20 zzso zzso promote the dissolution of the zzso phase into zzso + zzso zzso zzso and DNA is neutralized by zzso zzso The screening of zzso charge and the formation of a diffuse double layer due to increasing zzso strength of solution are responsible for the observed zzso
