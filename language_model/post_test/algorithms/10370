The utility of zzso systems depends on the accurate computer representation and efficient manipulation of chemical zzso In such systems, a small zzso is often digitized as a large fingerprint zzso where each element indicates the zzso or the number of zzso of a particular structural zzso Since in theory the number of unique features can be zzso large, these fingerprint zzso are usually folded into much shorter ones using hashing and zzso operations, allowing fast zzso manipulation and comparison of zzso There is increasing evidence that zzso fingerprints can substantially improve retrieval performance in chemical database searching zzso or zzso which have led to the development of several zzso fingerprint zzso zzso However, any gains in storage and retrieval afforded by zzso need to be weighed against the extra zzso burden required for zzso before these fingerprints can be zzso Here we demonstrate that graphics processing units zzso can greatly alleviate this problem, enabling the practical application of zzso fingerprints on large zzso More specifically, we show that, with the help of a zzso ordinary video card, the entire zzso database of zzso million compounds can be searched in zzso s on average, which is 2 orders of magnitude faster than a conventional zzso If multiple query patterns are processed in zzso the zzso is even more dramatic (less than zzso zzso for 1000 zzso In the present study, we use the Elias gamma zzso algorithm, which results in a zzso ratio as high as zzso
