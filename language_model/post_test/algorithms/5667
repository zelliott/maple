In zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging, the main function of scatter and zzso corrections is to improve contrast and quantitative zzso Both corrections are essential and critically zzso Several zzso reconstruction schemes incorporating scatter and zzso corrections have been developed over the zzso In this work, the authors propose a new method to incorporate the scatter and zzso corrections into the zzso image zzso which has shown promising results in regards to improving reconstruction performance and image quality as compared to the standard zzso 

The authors describe a scatter and zzso weighted zzso zzso PET reconstruction zzso The zzso method is based on the zzso of the zzso fraction zzso within the zzso Once the zzso is estimated, it is then incorporated into the weighting component of the system zzso and the net result is a scatter and zzso weighting in the sensitivity image similar to the zzso correction zzso Although using the measured zzso in the zzso zzso was demonstrated to achieve the fastest convergence at high statistics, it is not reliable in low counts situations due to the sparse and noisy nature of the measured zzso zzso a mean zzso of the zzso derived from the forward projection of the reconstructed zzso image was introduced into the zzso zzso A contrast phantom was zzso and the data were reconstructed using the standard and the zzso zzso 

The contrast vs noise, precision vs accuracy in contrast, absolute error vs number of zzso zzso and standard zzso image over different zzso of the same object were evaluated at low counts situations, and it was observed that the zzso method zzso the standard approaches such as the scatter and zzso data zzso and the ordinary zzso zzso The image intensity zzso outside the object can also be minimized using the zzso zzso In addition, further improvement in zzso precision, zzso and noise properties can be achieved by further improving the zzso and the zzso zzso 

The authors have developed a practical scatter and zzso weighting scheme in the sensitivity image for zzso PET zzso Our proposed zzso method has a number of advantages over the conventional methods, and it has shown promising results with additional zzso for various applications to be further zzso
