This paper deals with the problem of reconstruction of the zzso interaction graph from the raw data of genetic zzso coming with new technologies of zzso zzso zzso zzso These new imaging devices in general only give information about the zzso part zzso zzso of zzso or limit cycles of such zzso of the zzso evolution of the regulatory networks zzso and/or zzso underlying the functioning of living zzso zzso the casual structure and interaction zzso of a gene interaction network from the observed zzso is a complex zzso But if all the fixed zzso are supposedly observed and if they are zzso into two or more zzso of values, then the interaction graph possesses as many connected components as the number of factors and the solution is obtained in zzso zzso This new result allows us for example to partly solve the zzso of the genetic regulatory network ruling the flowering in zzso zzso zzso
