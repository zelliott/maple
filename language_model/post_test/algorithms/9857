A new zzso zzso zzso protocol for assessing the local zzso zzso zzso of water confined within living cells is zzso zzso for the apparent zzso displacement zzso as a function of the effective diffusion time zzso and the duration of the zzso zzso zzso delta are zzso The standard method of zzso zzso zzso until the influence of zzso between the water molecules and the plasma membrane can be zzso fails because of the small size of typical zzso As demonstrated here, the decrease of the apparent zzso with increasing delta at constant zzso can be zzso to measure zzso
