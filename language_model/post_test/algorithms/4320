To investigate zzso tumor by looking at the zzso tissue around the zzso zzso tissue is not only an zzso storage system for excess zzso but is involved in several pathological processes linked to tumor zzso 

We obtained 24 zzso specimens after surgical zzso from patients affected by zzso cancer at different tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were collected from two zzso in proximity of the zzso and far from it, in each zzso with a zzso zzso We differentiated patients by pathological tumor stage, and we compared the chemical composition of zzso tissue between patient groups, both close the tumor and far from zzso 

zzso fatty acids zzso close the zzso are increased at higher tumor zzso while zzso far from the zzso do not follow this zzso This study is really zzso due to the small numbers of subjects and we are cautious on the interpretation of the zzso However, the approach of the present work allows a further insight in the tumor zzso 

Looking at the zzso tissue around a zzso through zzso zzso can return important information regarding its genesis and zzso
