The purpose of this study was to develop a new diagnostic technique for measuring bone mineral density zzso for the assessment of zzso which improves upon the coherent to Compton scattering ratio zzso method, which was first developed in the zzso To help the authors achieve these goals, they have identified and studied two new zzso for zzso the forward scattered to backward scattered zzso and the forward scattered to transmitted zzso zzso They believe that, at small angles, these two parameters can offer a practical in zzso determination of zzso that can be used to overcome the limitations of past zzso systems, including high radiation zzso costs, and examination zzso 

In previous zzso studies, a zzso radioactive source with a long zzso (usually zzso and an expensive and bulky zzso zzso detector were applied to both in zzso and in zzso zzso To make this technique more suitable for clinical applications, the possibility of using a standard diagnostic zzso tube generating a continuous spectrum was investigated in this zzso Scattered radiation from zzso zzso zzso containing various mineral zzso that span the normal range of in zzso zzso was collected in this study using relatively inexpensive zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

The initial results demonstrate that a modified version of zzso can be successfully applied to zzso bone assessment using a diagnostic zzso tube with a continuous spectrum in two variations, the zzso and the zzso zzso When zzso is measured, intensity zzso in the forward and backward directions must be collected while zzso requires only the integral intensity of the scattered and transmitted zzso zzso in the energy region above 40 zzso For both of these methods, forward scattering angles less than or equal to zzso and backward scattering angles greater than or equal to zzso zzso - zzso are zzso 

The authors determined that zzso is more sensitive to changes in zzso than transmission or zzso alone and that the zzso method can yield an absolute measurement of the mean atomic number of the scattering zzso after a correction for zzso zzso Since this study determined that the zzso ratio is independent of the incident energy over a broad energy region, it will be possible to apply zzso to bone zzso using inexpensive integral zzso zzso The authors believe that, by replacing the zzso source with an zzso tube and the zzso cooled zzso detector with a single solid state zzso zzso or silicon detector or an zzso array of zzso as suggested in this study, the past difficulties of zzso concerning high radiation exposure, costs, and zzso as well as lack of convenience can be overcome and that zzso could eventually become popular in clinical zzso
