Complex zzso relationships exist among human zzso Thus, the identification of disease associations could provide new methods of disease care and zzso To this end, numerous studies have investigated disease zzso However, zzso effect of zzso factors, which is the main characteristic of biological systems, has not been considered in most previous zzso 

In this study, we zzso disease associations with a novel approach that considered zzso clinical factors in zzso ways by using the National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso data, and the results have been shown as disease zzso Here, the zzso algorithm, an association rule mining algorithm, was used to generate a clinical attribute combination profile of each zzso In addition, we characterized the 22 clinical risk attribute combinations frequently discovered from the 26 diseases in this zzso Furthermore, we validated that the results of this study have great potential for drug repositioning and outperform other existing disease networks in this zzso Finally, we suggest a few disease pairs as new candidates for drug repositioning and provide the evidence of their associations from the zzso
