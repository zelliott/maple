We present a zzso Carlo zzso that allows the simultaneous determination of a few zzso zzso of a very large zzso without the need to zzso the inner product of two zzso or store all the components of any one zzso The algorithm, a zzso Carlo zzso of a deterministic one we recently zzso is an extension of the power zzso In the zzso zzso we used a basic zzso Carlo splitting and termination method called the zzso incorporated the weight cancellation method of zzso et zzso and exploited a sampling method, the sewing method, that does a large state space sampling as a succession of small state space zzso We illustrate the effectiveness of the zzso by its determination of the two largest zzso of the transfer zzso for variously sized zzso zzso zzso zzso While very likely useful for other zzso problems, the zzso is however quite general and should find application to a larger variety of problems requiring a few dominant zzso of a zzso
