Many methods are used for determining the zzso zzso zzso by means of sophisticated zzso 

To test the AT variation, detected by mathematical models and visual inspection, when low cost zzso is used and intended for clinical zzso 

zzso nine apparently healthy subjects were volunteers in this study; from these, 57 zzso The zzso and the zzso threshold were determined by zzso zzso zzso The zzso method was used for analyzing the zzso and direct determination of the zzso zzso zzso The AT was determined by two mathematical methods zzso and zzso based on the gases exchange, and by the zzso visual method, for determining the zzso Two independent investigators determined the AT through visual inspection of three zzso considering two methods zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The data were analyzed by means of zzso statistics for determining the differences between zzso versus zzso zzso and zzso zzso versus zzso and zzso and zzso versus zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

The zzso was the only method that presented a significant difference between the zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso versus zzso did not present significant difference zzso however, it was observed a high zzso zzso 

It was concluded that with the low cost equipment, the zzso and zzso methods can be used for determining the zzso The zzso method did not present satisfactory precision to be employed with this zzso
