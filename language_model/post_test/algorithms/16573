This study evaluated zzso insulin delivery with a model zzso control zzso zzso during early zzso weeks) and late gestation zzso weeks) in pregnant women with type 1 zzso 

Ten women with type 1 diabetes (age 31 years, diabetes duration 19 years, zzso zzso zzso booking zzso zzso were studied over 24 h during early zzso weeks) and late pregnancy zzso zzso A nurse adjusted the zzso insulin infusion rate from continuous zzso zzso zzso fed into the zzso zzso every 15 zzso Mean zzso and time spent in target zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 180 zzso and zzso zzso to zzso 50 zzso were calculated using plasma and sensor zzso zzso Linear zzso models were used to compare zzso control during early and late zzso 

During zzso insulin delivery, median zzso zzso plasma zzso levels were 117 zzso zzso in early and 126 zzso zzso in late gestation zzso zzso zzso The overnight mean zzso zzso plasma zzso time in target was zzso zzso in early and zzso zzso in late pregnancy zzso zzso zzso Overnight mean zzso zzso time spent zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso in early and zzso zzso in late pregnancy zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso control, zzso zzso insulin infusion rates, and zzso sensor accuracy were no different in early or late zzso 

zzso zzso performance was maintained throughout pregnancy, suggesting that overnight zzso insulin delivery could be used safely during zzso More work is needed to achieve optimal zzso zzso zzso
