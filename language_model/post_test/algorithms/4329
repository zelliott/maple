zzso in cerebral blood volume zzso blood flow zzso and zzso rate of oxygen zzso lead to associated changes in tissue zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso which can be measured by zzso zzso zzso A novel zzso model has been introduced to relate zzso zzso and measured zzso We seek to use this model to determine functional traces of zzso and zzso - zzso from zzso zzso data, and cerebrovascular zzso parameters from zzso zzso data zzso letters zzso the relative changes in zzso zzso and zzso with respect to zzso Such a practical zzso of a quantitative zzso model is an important step toward the clinical translation of zzso 

In the time domain, we have simulated zzso and zzso traces induced by cerebral zzso In the frequency domain, we have performed a new analysis of zzso zzso of cerebral zzso zzso during a paced breathing zzso 

We have demonstrated that zzso and zzso - zzso can be reliably obtained from zzso and zzso using the model, and that the functional zzso signals are delayed with respect to zzso - zzso as a result of the blood transit time in the zzso In the frequency domain, we have identified zzso parameters zzso blood transit time, zzso frequency of zzso that can be measured by zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

The ability to perform zzso zzso of cerebrovascular parameters has far-reaching clinical zzso zzso brain studies rely on zzso of zzso zzso and zzso whereas the diagnosis and assessment of zzso disorders, traumatic brain injury, and stroke would benefit from zzso of local cerebral zzso and zzso
