zzso zzso can give us useful information on locations of pollution zzso A zzso zzso based zzso was applied to zzso the concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso at a contaminated zzso zzso zzso were identified to imply the location of the pollution sources of heavy zzso The results showed that the zzso of 7 elements were best described by zzso model, and the zzso zzso were very small, especially for zzso zzso and zzso which were zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso can damp the effect of zzso and so get a smaller zzso zzso The spatial zzso existed in a cluster pattern, whose locations coincided with those of copper smelters in the zzso This indicated that the copper smelters were the important sources of soil heavy zzso
