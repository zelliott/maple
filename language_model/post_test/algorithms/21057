This paper describes a zzso navigation system using image fusion to support zzso interventions such as the accurate collection of biopsy zzso An zzso provides the physician with real-time ultrasound zzso and a video zzso An image slice that zzso to the corresponding image from the US scan head is derived from a zzso zzso zzso zzso or magnetic resonance image volume data set using zzso zzso and displayed side by side with the US zzso The position of the image acquired by the US scan head is determined by a zzso electromagnetic tracking system zzso after zzso the zzso scan zzso The transformation between the patient coordinate system and the zzso data set is calculated using a zzso zzso This is achieved by zzso an zzso zzso CT slice with an optical tracking system zzso using the same zzso as for the US zzso The slice is then used for zzso registration with the coordinate system of the zzso zzso The zzso registration error zzso for the US zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso CT zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso registration target registration error zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso registration between the zzso and the zzso had an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, we found an overall zzso for the complete system to be zzso zzso zzso zzso
