An investigation of the color metrics and the complexity of the zzso formula shows that zzso space is inadequate to represent zzso color zzso The zzso zzso Color zzso Committee has shown that no space with uniform scale for large color differences zzso Therefore the practical way for zzso zzso is a zzso formula in a zzso zzso First, the zzso zzso zzso zzso are considered in the zzso space, and their very high zzso suggests a new and very simple zzso formula at constant zzso Then the zzso zzso data set used for the development of the zzso formula is considered in the zzso space, and the zzso formula is extended to sample pairs with a different zzso zzso The value of the performance factor zzso for the proposed zzso formula shows that the formula performs like the more complex zzso formula for zzso color zzso
