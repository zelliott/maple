The presence of zzso zzso clusters of tiny calcium deposits that appear as small bright spots in a zzso has been considered as a very important indicator for breast cancer zzso Much research has been performed for developing zzso systems for the accurate identification of zzso however, the computer-based automatic detection of zzso has been shown difficult because of the complicated nature of surrounding of breast zzso the variation of zzso in shape, orientation, brightness and zzso 

This paper presents a new approach for the effective detection of zzso by incorporating a zzso mechanism in the genetic zzso zzso In the proposed approach, called zzso incorporated genetic zzso zzso the genetic zzso is used to search for the bright spots in mammogram and a zzso mechanism is integrated to improve the performance of the zzso The function of the zzso mechanism includes evaluating the possibility of a bright spot being a true zzso and zzso adjusting the associated fitness zzso The adjustment of fitness is to indirectly guide the zzso to extract the true zzso and eliminate the false zzso zzso zzso 

The experimental results demonstrate that the incorporation of zzso mechanism into the genetic zzso is able to eliminate the zzso and produce improved performance comparing with the conventional zzso zzso Furthermore, the experimental results show that the proposed zzso method provides a promising and generic approach for the development of zzso diagnosis for breast zzso
