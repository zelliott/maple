zzso is a zzso application for the rapid discovery of significant zzso elements from sets of zzso or zzso zzso zzso can automatically zzso retrieve genes and zzso regions, zzso identify putative regulatory regions, zzso score sequences for known zzso factor binding sites, zzso identify candidate motifs for unknown binding sites, and zzso detect those statistically zzso sites that are characteristic for a gene zzso Genes or zzso regions are retrieved from zzso or zzso together with zzso and supporting zzso zzso are aligned and zzso regions are selected as candidate regulatory zzso zzso sites for known zzso factors are detected using our zzso which scores position weight zzso using a zzso zzso New motifs are detected using our zzso based on Gibbs zzso zzso sites characteristic for a gene zzso thus statistically zzso with respect to a reference sequence zzso found using a zzso zzso We have validated zzso by analyzing zzso zzso zzso genes and zzso target zzso we have easily detected many known binding sites within zzso DNA and identified new biologically plausible sites for known and unknown zzso zzso Software available at zzso zzso approximately zzso
