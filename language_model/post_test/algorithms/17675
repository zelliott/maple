We investigated the zzso structural and functional consequences of zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso inhibitor zzso in 20 adult male zzso rats and 20 spontaneously zzso rats zzso The animals were separated into eight groups zzso zzso 5) and treated for 30 days: zzso zzso zzso deficient group), zzso zzso + zzso The elevated blood pressure in NO deficient rats was partially reduced by zzso zzso zzso was elevated in zzso and effectively treated with zzso The zzso was significantly higher only in zzso and this was reduced by treatment with zzso The zzso volume density zzso in zzso rats, both zzso and zzso was greater than in matched control rats, and zzso treatment effectively prevented this zzso zzso No significant differences were observed in zzso volume density, zzso or zzso surface density, zzso in all zzso zzso The zzso was smaller in zzso than in control zzso and this zzso zzso was not prevented by zzso The zzso was not different among the zzso zzso In zzso rats no changes were seen in vascular surface density, but a greatly increased cortical vascular volume density was seen in the zzso treated zzso The vascular length density was greatly diminished in NO deficient rats that was effectively prevented with zzso zzso The vascular cortical zzso zzso zzso are normally reduced in zzso Administration of zzso but not zzso changed this zzso However, zzso was not totally effective in preventing vascular damage in zzso NO deficient zzso
