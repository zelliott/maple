The zzso filament, which is the most abundant component of the zzso plays important roles in fundamental cellular activities such as shape determination, cell zzso and zzso In each activity, the zzso filament zzso changes its structure by zzso zzso and zzso These phenomena occur on the scales ranging from the dynamics of zzso molecules to filament structural changes with its deformation due to the various forces, for example, by the membrane and zzso To better understand the zzso filament zzso it is important to focus on these scales and develop its mathematical zzso Thus, the objectives of this study were to model and simulate zzso filament zzso zzso and severing based on the zzso dynamics zzso In the model, the zzso zzso and the zzso were considered as zzso particles and a zzso zzso The motion of the zzso molecules was assumed to follow the zzso zzso The zzso which increases the filament zzso was determined by the distance between the center of the zzso particle at the barbed end and zzso particles in the zzso The zzso which decreases the filament zzso was modeled such that the number of zzso particles from the filament end per unit time was zzso In addition, the filament zzso in which one filament divides into two, was modeled to occur at an equal rate along the zzso Then, we simulated the zzso filament dynamics using the developed model, and analyzed the filament zzso rate, its zzso and the effects of filament severing on the zzso and zzso zzso indicated that the model reproduced the linear dependence of the filament zzso on time, filament turnover process by zzso and zzso and acceleration of the zzso and zzso by zzso which zzso agreed with those observed in zzso
