We present a combined zzso study demonstrating the role of site disorder, zzso and strain on the optical properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso properties zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso obtained by performing zzso studies over the energy range zzso zzso on zzso laser deposited zzso thin films of zzso zzso zzso with zzso orientation and the data were compared with theoretical zzso zzso on the ground state structure show that the optical activity in zzso arises primarily from O zzso zzso zzso Further, inclusion of site disorder and zzso strain in the ground state structure significantly improves the agreement between the theory and the room temperature experimental data zzso the presence of site disorder in the zzso derived strained zzso films at room zzso We attribute the modification of the ground state optical behavior upon inclusion of site disorder to the corresponding changes in the electronic band structure, especially in zzso zzso states leading to a lowered zzso of the zzso
