Here, we propose a technique for sampling complex molecular systems with many degrees of zzso The technique, termed zzso replica zzso zzso does not suffer from poor zzso with the number of degrees of freedom associated with common replica exchange procedures and does not require sampling at high zzso The zzso involves creation of multiple copies zzso of the system, which interact with one another through a repulsive potential that can be applied to the system as a whole or to portions of zzso The proposed scheme prevents zzso of the most populated states and provides accurate descriptions of zzso zzso typically associated with sampling zzso energy zzso The performance of zzso is illustrated for three systems of increasing zzso A two-dimensional toy potential surface is used to probe the sampling efficiency as a function of key parameters of the zzso zzso simulations of the zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso performed in presence of explicit water molecules and totaling 32 zzso each, investigate the ability of zzso to characterize the zzso landscape of the zzso and the protein native zzso zzso zzso obtained for the zzso zzso reflect more closely the extensive zzso flexibility of this zzso than previously reported zzso Those obtained for zzso show that zzso ensembles sampled by zzso largely zzso structural fluctuations relevant to biological recognition, which occur on the zzso zzso or are observed in crystal structures of zzso complexes with other zzso zzso thus emerges as a very promising simple and versatile technique for modeling the structural plasticity of complex biological zzso
