There are significant changes in the zzso injury scale zzso 2005 system, which make it zzso to compare patients coded in zzso version 98 with patients coded in zzso version zzso 

zzso Medical Center created a computer zzso zzso zzso zzso Program zzso to automatically convert zzso 2005 to zzso 98 injury zzso The mapping was validated using 6 months of zzso patient injury records from a Level I zzso zzso zzso was used to determine how closely individual zzso and injury severity scores zzso were converted from zzso 2005 to zzso 98 zzso The zzso statistic was used to measure the agreement between manually determined codes and zzso zzso 

Seven hundred zzso patient records were used for zzso For the conversion of zzso codes, the measure of agreement between zzso and manually determined codes was zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso The zzso errors were smaller in magnitude than the manually determined coding zzso For the conversion of zzso the agreement between zzso versus manually determined zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso successfully converted injuries coded in zzso 2005 to zzso zzso This zzso will be useful when comparing trauma patient clinical data across populations coded in different versions, especially for zzso zzso
