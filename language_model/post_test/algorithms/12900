This paper reports the design analysis of a zzso zzso zzso surface zzso resonance zzso sensor zzso The proposed platform has periodic heavily doped profiles implanted into intrinsic silicon and a thin gold layer deposited on top, making a physically flat grating zzso zzso A rigorous zzso analysis was conducted to prove the design zzso characterize the zzso performance, and determine geometric parameters of the heavily doped zzso zzso element analysis zzso was also employed to zzso the electromagnetic field zzso at the zzso zzso zzso results reveal that the proposed structure can zzso the zzso on the normal zzso of zzso light, resulting in a large probing depth that will facilitate the study of larger zzso Furthermore, the whole structure can be zzso with well-established batch zzso providing zzso in the zzso zzso wavelength for specific zzso needs with a low manufacturing zzso When the zzso sensor is to be used in a zzso infrared zzso zzso platform, its detection sensitivity and limit of detection are estimated to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, at a sample layer thickness of 100 zzso The design analysis performed in the present study will allow the fabrication of a zzso zzso zzso zzso sensor that combines advantages of conventional zzso and metallic grating zzso zzso
