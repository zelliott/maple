zzso zzso and zzso zzso experiments are presented which allow fast resonance assignment of zzso protein side zzso In these zzso zzso experiments, two or three zzso are frequency labeled in the indirect zzso zzso spectral editing reduces the number of correlation zzso detected in each zzso spectrum, and helps in zzso determination during sequential backbone resonance zzso zzso are shown for a small zzso and a highly zzso zzso zzso The new experiments complement the set of zzso zzso correlation experiments, previously proposed for fast protein resonance assignment zzso zzso zzso 27 zzso zzso
