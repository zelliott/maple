zzso continues to be a major global health zzso Lack of accurate, rapid and cost-effective diagnostic tests poses a huge obstacle to global zzso zzso While several new diagnostic tools are being developed and evaluated for zzso it is important that new tools are introduced for widespread use only after careful validation of zzso impact as well as zzso in real-world zzso While there are large numbers of studies on the accuracy of zzso diagnostic tests, there are few studies that are focused on cost and zzso There are currently no widely accepted standards on how to evaluate costs of a zzso zzso In this review, we describe the basic approach for computing the costs of zzso diagnostic tests, and provide templates for various data elements and parameters that go into the costing zzso We hope this will pave the way for a standardized methodology for costing of zzso diagnostic zzso Such a tool would enable improved and more zzso costing analyses that can provide a strong foundation for more sophisticated economic analyses that evaluate the full economic and zzso impact resulting from the zzso and routine use of zzso new and innovative diagnostic zzso This, in turn, will facilitate evidence-based adoption and use of new zzso especially in zzso zzso
