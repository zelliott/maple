zzso where zzso zzso to an external zzso is ubiquitous in zzso The transient time leading to zzso plays a major role in many biological zzso Our goal is to unveil the specific dynamics that leads to fast zzso By studying a generic model, we characterize the transient time to zzso and show how it is governed by two basic properties of an zzso the zzso relaxation time and the phase zzso distribution around the limit zzso Those two basic properties are inherent in every zzso This concept can be applied to many biological systems to predict the average transient time to zzso or to zzso properties of the underlying zzso from the observed zzso We found that both a zzso zzso with fast zzso relaxation and a zzso zzso with slow zzso relaxation give rise to fast zzso As an example, we discuss the zzso experiments in the zzso zzso zzso
