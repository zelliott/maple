In order to determine zzso the bearing of a sound source, a fish must be able to resolve acoustic pressure and the components of the acoustic displacement zzso from the signals detected by the zzso zzso A new hypothesis for the processing of zzso information by zzso fish is zzso It is demonstrated that much of the processing required to do this may be implicit in the structure of the ear and its associated neural zzso zzso zzso are presented that the central nervous system might use to further process the derived information to zzso a sound source and discriminate frequency and zzso The hypothesis is shown to be consistent with much of what is known of the zzso and physiology of the auditory system of zzso zzso
