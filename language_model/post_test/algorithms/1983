The modern metaphor of the brain is that of a dynamic information processing zzso In the current study we investigate how a core cognitive network of the human brain, the zzso decision system, can be characterized regarding its zzso representation of zzso zzso We capitalize on a recently developed information zzso framework for the analysis of simultaneously acquired zzso zzso and functional magnetic resonance imaging data zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We show how this framework naturally extends from previous zzso in the sensory to the cognitive domain and how it enables the economic description of neural zzso information zzso Specifically, based on simultaneous zzso data features from zzso zzso 13 observers performing a visual zzso decision task, we demonstrate how the information zzso framework is able to reproduce earlier findings on the zzso zzso of zzso decisions from the response signal zzso marginal zzso Furthermore, using the joint zzso feature distribution, we provide novel evidence for a highly distributed and dynamic zzso of zzso information in the human zzso
