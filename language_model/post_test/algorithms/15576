zzso zzso degrade both spatial and contrast zzso This paper proposes a new zzso imaging technique that uses the generalized zzso factor zzso to reduce the focusing errors resulting from the zzso zzso The zzso is derived from the spatial spectrum of the received zzso data after proper receive delays have been zzso It is defined as the ratio of the spectral energy within a zzso zzso range to the total zzso It is demonstrated that the zzso component of the spectrum zzso to the coherent portion of the received data, and that the zzso component zzso to the incoherent zzso zzso the zzso reduces to the zzso factor defined in the literature if the zzso zzso range is restricted to zzso zzso In addition, the zzso is also an index of the focusing quality and can be used as a weighting factor for the reconstructed zzso The efficacy of the zzso technique is demonstrated for focusing errors resulting from the zzso zzso zzso and real ultrasound data are used to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed zzso zzso The characteristics of the zzso including the effects of the zzso ratio and the number of channels, are also zzso The zzso technique also is compared with the zzso technique and the parallel zzso receive compensation zzso the improvement in image quality obtained with the proposed technique rivals that of the latter zzso In the presence of a displaced phase screen, this proposed technique also zzso the zzso zzso zzso complexity and zzso issues also are zzso
