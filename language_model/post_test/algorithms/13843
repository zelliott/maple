I investigated the discrimination of rigid from zzso structure and the perception of zzso stretches along the line of sight zzso & Todd zzso zzso and zzso 53, zzso zzso zzso of performance at discriminating rigid from zzso structure showed that performance improved when number of views and amount of simulated three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso of zzso about the vertical which include zzso stretches along the line of sight compared zzso interpretations of zzso stimuli to human zzso These zzso interpretations were obtained from a simple zzso which recovered structure and motion from this limited class of stimuli under the assumption that distances to the axis of rotation did not zzso The zzso predicted that stretches along the line of sight would be perceived as nearly rigid and have variable angular zzso These predictions were supported by subjects' reports of zzso of zzso and zzso of angular zzso The zzso zzso also provided measures of zzso and motion zzso and experimental results were consistent with a prediction of when perception of zzso would be independent of perception of zzso The results are discussed relative to the advantages and shortcomings of both the zzso and zzso approaches to zzso
