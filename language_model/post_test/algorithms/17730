This paper presents a method to analyze three zzso zzso and dynamics of lower limb during zzso The proposed method is based on a homogeneous zzso concept, derived from zzso and using zzso expressive notation convenient for computer zzso The major advantage of this method is that no hypothesis is required on the joint model, which makes it zzso to complex and zzso zzso zzso data are zzso from 3-D zzso of markers collected by a motion analysis zzso External forces applied on the leg are measured zzso during the stance phase of zzso zzso zzso components obtained using the homogeneous zzso method are displayed for three subjects and compared with those obtained from the same experimental data using a zzso axis zzso Then, zzso moments calculated from the inverse dynamic part of the homogeneous zzso method are shown on the same zzso zzso results indicate that there are no significant differences between the methods, thus demonstrating the zzso of the stance phase of gait in the zzso zzso Use of this synthetic homogeneous method developed for both zzso and dynamics of rigid bodies demonstrates good promise for applications in zzso
