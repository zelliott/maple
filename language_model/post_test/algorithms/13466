In 2002, zzso and zzso proposed an zzso system, in which the patient can store zzso and related information using smart zzso zzso Yang et zzso proposed a novel zzso based zzso system based on zzso and zzso system in zzso Yang et zzso considered the privacy issues of prescription data and adopted the concept of a group signature to provide patient's privacy zzso To make the zzso system more zzso they further applied a proxy signature to allow a patient to delegate his signing capability to other zzso This paper proposed a novel security and privacy preserving zzso system model based on smart zzso A new role, zzso is included in the system model for settling the medicine zzso We further presented a concrete zzso zzso group signature scheme and an zzso proxy signature scheme to realize the proposed zzso Main property of an zzso system is that public key is simple user's identity and can be verified without extra public key zzso Our zzso group signature scheme can allow doctors to sign zzso zzso In a case of a medical zzso identities of the doctors can be zzso The proposed zzso proxy signature scheme can improve signing delegation and allows a delegation zzso The proposed zzso system based on our proposed two zzso schemes is more practical and efficient than Yang et zzso system in terms of security, communication zzso zzso costs, practical zzso
