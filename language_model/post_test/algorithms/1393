The minimum volume of zzso fluid that is zzso in zzso zzso with ultrasound in the trauma setting is not well zzso To evaluate this question, we used diagnostic zzso zzso zzso as a model for zzso zzso and undertook a blinded prospective study of the sensitivity of ultrasound in detecting zzso zzso Participants included attending physicians and residents in emergency medicine, zzso and zzso During the infusion of the zzso fluid, participants continuously scanned zzso zzso until they detected zzso All participants were blinded to the rate of infusion and the volume zzso One hundred patients were entered into the zzso The mean volume of fluid detected was 619 zzso Only zzso of participants detected fluid volumes less than 400 zzso and the overall sensitivity at one liter was zzso We conclude that reliable detection of zzso fluid in zzso zzso requires a greater volume than has been previously zzso
