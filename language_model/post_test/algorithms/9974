The zzso zzso equation possesses a variety of zzso zzso localized solutions organized in the so-called zzso zzso This structure is a consequence of a phenomenon known as zzso zzso and is in turn a consequence of spatial zzso of the zzso We examine here the consequences of breaking spatial zzso on the zzso zzso We find that the localized states now zzso and show that the zzso structure breaks up into a stack of zzso We explore the evolution of this new structure with increasing zzso breaking and study the dynamics of the system outside of the snaking region using a combination of zzso and zzso zzso
