zzso zzso for the probability distribution of a reporting delay is considered when delays are recorded only after a certain point in time zzso A method is proposed which zzso data on zzso arising prior to zzso By a suitable choice of parameters we find explicit expressions for maximum likelihood estimates and standard zzso An application to reporting delay data on Australian AIDS diagnoses demonstrates that inclusion of data on AIDS diagnoses made prior to zzso results in significant gains in the precision of zzso A simulation study indicates for this data set that there is minimal bias in the estimates and the large sample zzso for the standard errors give good estimates of the standard zzso of the zzso
