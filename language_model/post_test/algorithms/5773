It is important to identify which proteins can interact with zzso for the purpose of protein zzso since interactions between zzso and proteins influence the structure of the zzso and play important roles in gene zzso This paper tries to identify proteins that can interact with zzso using voting zzso zzso through zzso 34 learning zzso are chosen for zzso Then simple majority voting system zzso is used for the prediction of zzso zzso achieving average zzso zzso prediction zzso value of zzso and zzso zzso correlation zzso value of zzso for the independent testing zzso Then zzso zzso zzso maximum zzso strategy is used, which is transferred into zzso zzso In addition, the zzso value of each zzso is assigned to be the weight of the zzso zzso As a result, best average zzso values are attained when 22 zzso are selected and integrated through weighted votes, which are zzso for the independent testing zzso and zzso value is zzso at this zzso
