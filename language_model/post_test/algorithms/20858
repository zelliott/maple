Peak distortion caused by zzso zzso is a major problem that limits the utility of the zzso zzso zzso zzso method for studying zzso zzso This unwanted effect can be removed by incorporation of zzso zzso zzso pulse elements at the end of the zzso zzso Three methods, zzso zzso zzso pulse zzso and zzso based zzso were evaluated as potential candidates for an improved zzso diffusion method that is less sensitive to zzso peak zzso The zzso based zzso was found to be excellent in suppressing zzso zzso while leaving the zzso zzso basically intact in zzso and zzso based zzso The incorporation of zzso based zzso into zzso could allow diffusion analysis that would otherwise be impossible by conventional zzso
