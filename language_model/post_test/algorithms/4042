In budding zzso the zzso checkpoint 2 zzso protein regulates zzso zzso axis structure by maintaining the zzso organization of the zzso complex proteins zzso pairing 1 zzso and molecular zzso 1 zzso zzso has also been shown to zzso zzso zzso break repair outcomes to favor zzso between zzso play an important role in the progression of zzso zzso and maintain zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso are present in fruit flies, zzso and zzso however the molecular mechanism of zzso function is zzso In this study we provide a unique and detailed zzso analysis of zzso We find that zzso zzso is an zzso zzso associated with diverse cellular zzso protein that zzso into single zzso rings in the presence of zzso In addition, we show zzso binds to zzso a critical zzso component of the zzso complex that establishes zzso repair bias, in a zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso from large DNA zzso and that both zzso binding and zzso by zzso are required for zzso zzso Based on these and previous cell biological zzso we suggest that zzso impacts zzso zzso function by directly regulating zzso zzso
