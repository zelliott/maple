zzso methods for predicting zzso zzso zzso are an important tool in vaccine design and for enhancing our understanding of the cellular immune zzso The most popular methods currently available produce binding affinity predictions across a range of zzso zzso In comparing results between these zzso zzso it is common practice to apply a zzso procedure known as zzso to correct for possible discrepancies between the zzso zzso Using two of the most popular prediction software packages, zzso and zzso we tested the hypothesis that zzso removes genuine biological variation from the predicted affinities when comparing predictions across a number of zzso zzso We found that removing the condition of zzso improved the prediction software's performance both zzso in terms of ranking zzso and zzso in the accuracy of their binding affinity zzso We suggest that there is biologically significant variation among class 1 zzso molecules and find that retention of this variation leads to significantly more accurate zzso zzso
