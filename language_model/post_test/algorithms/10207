An zzso capable of zzso respiratory motion blurring artifacts in zzso zzso zzso zzso lung tumor images based on the motion of the tumor during the zzso scan is zzso The tumor motion trajectory and probability density function zzso are reconstructed from the acquired zzso projection images using a recently developed zzso Lewis et al zzso zzso zzso zzso 55 zzso Assuming that the effects of motion blurring can be represented by zzso of the zzso lung (or zzso anatomy with the motion zzso a cost function is zzso consisting of a data zzso term and a total variation zzso zzso zzso is performed through zzso zzso of this cost zzso The zzso was tested on digital respiratory zzso physical respiratory phantom and patient zzso A clear qualitative improvement is evident in the zzso images as compared to the zzso images for all zzso Line profiles show that the tumor boundaries are more accurately and clearly represented in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso error between the images used as ground truth and the zzso images are zzso zzso and zzso in the digital zzso physical phantom and patient data, zzso zzso reduces the corresponding values to zzso zzso and zzso Application of a zzso zzso threshold to the digital phantom results in tumor dimension zzso along the zzso axis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso ground truth and zzso images, zzso zzso values for the physical phantom are zzso zzso and zzso zzso A threshold of zzso zzso applied to the patient case gives zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso along the zzso axis in the zzso zzso and zzso images, zzso This technique could provide more accurate information about a lung zzso size and shape on the day of zzso
