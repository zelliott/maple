In many studies it is of interest to cluster states, counties or other small regions in order to obtain improved estimates of disease rates or other summary measures, and a more zzso representation of the country as a zzso This may be the case if there are too many to zzso zzso and/or many regions with a small number of zzso By merging the regions into larger geographic areas, we obtain more cases within each area (and hence lower standard errors for zzso zzso as well as fewer areas to zzso in terms of disease zzso The resulting clusters should be such that regions within the same cluster are similar in terms of their disease zzso In this paper we present a zzso zzso which uses data at the zzso level in order to cluster the original regions into a reduced set of larger zzso The proposed zzso zzso expresses the zzso goals in terms of a zzso zzso This zzso of the problem allows the regions to be clustered in terms of their association with the response, and zzso variables measured at the zzso level may be easily incorporated during the zzso zzso Additionally, this framework allows zzso and testing of the association between the areas and the zzso The statistical properties and performance of the zzso were evaluated via simulation studies, and the results are zzso Additional simulations illustrate the importance of controlling for zzso variables during the zzso process, rather than after the clusters are zzso The zzso is illustrated with data from the zzso Health zzso Although developed with a specific application in mind, the method is zzso to a wide range of zzso
