zzso induction zzso zzso is a technique to image the passive electrical properties zzso zzso zzso zzso of biological zzso The inverse zzso current problem is zzso and zzso thus a zzso zzso method in combination with four different zzso schemes is used to obtain stable zzso zzso with 16 zzso zzso 32 receiving coils and different zzso zzso inside a homogeneous cylinder were zzso In order to compare the statistical properties of the reconstructed results a zzso Carlo study with a zzso of 40 zzso and 20 zzso was carried zzso zzso zzso zzso inside a homogeneous cylinder can be localized and resolved and the results prove the feasibility of difference imaging with zzso
