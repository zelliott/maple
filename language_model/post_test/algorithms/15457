zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso frequency band manifest in the zzso zzso during a variety of behaviors and are particularly well characterized during spatial zzso In contrast, previous studies of rhythmic zzso activity in primates under comparable behavioral conditions suggest it may be less apparent and possibly less zzso or even zzso compared with the zzso We compared the relative presence of zzso zzso in rats and humans during spatial navigation by using an zzso detection zzso zzso or zzso to better characterize their presence in zzso local field potential zzso zzso This method zzso the proportion of time the zzso exceeds both a power and cycle duration threshold at each frequency, characterizing the presence of zzso zzso activity compared with background noise, zzso the peak frequency of zzso activity, and zzso the duration of zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that both humans and zzso have zzso rhythmic fluctuations zzso on average, zzso and zzso cycles, zzso zzso further suggest that human zzso zzso is centered around zzso zzso while that of rats is centered around zzso zzso These results establish that zzso rhythms relevant to spatial navigation are present in both the zzso and human zzso albeit with different properties under the behavioral conditions zzso
