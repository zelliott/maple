The zzso Carlo method provides the most accurate dose calculations on a patient zzso zzso zzso zzso The increase in accuracy is, at least in part, due to the fact that instead of treating human zzso as water of various zzso as in zzso zzso the zzso Carlo method allows human zzso to be characterized by zzso composition and mass density, and hence allows the accurate consideration of all relevant electromagnetic and nuclear zzso On the other hand, the zzso to convert CT zzso numbers to tissue materials for zzso Carlo dose calculation introduces zzso There is not a simple one to one correspondence between zzso numbers and tissue zzso To investigate the effects of zzso number conversion for zzso zzso Carlo dose calculations, clinical zzso treatment plans were simulated using the zzso zzso Carlo zzso Three zzso number to material conversion methods were zzso The results were compared in forms of dose volume zzso of gross tumor volume and clinical target zzso The differences found are generally small but can be zzso zzso Further, different methods may cause zzso in the predicted zzso beam range in particular for deep zzso zzso Typically, slight discrepancies in mass density assignments play only a minor role in the target region, whereas more significant effects are caused by different assignments in zzso zzso In the presence of large tissue zzso for head and neck treatments, treatment planning decisions could be affected by these differences because of zzso in the predicted tumor zzso Outside the target area, differences in zzso composition and mass density assignments both may play a zzso This can lead to pronounced effects for zzso at risk, in particular in the zzso Bragg peak zzso or zzso zzso In addition, the significance of the zzso composition effect zzso to water zzso dose to zzso is zzso dependent and is also affected by nuclear zzso
