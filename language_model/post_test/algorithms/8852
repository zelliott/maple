zzso spiral zzso zzso zzso of abdomen has been widely used as an effective imaging zzso to diagnose variety of zzso As a result, the accumulated radiation exposure on the abdomen is substantially higher than other human organ zzso According to zzso (as low as reasonably zzso principle, how to control radiation dose without compromising imaging quality becomes a research topic of high zzso However, how to achieve dose zzso of the abdomen CT examinations in Chinese patients have not been fully investigated in previous zzso In this study, we develop an zzso tissue model made by well-known zzso auxiliary testing model and the real CT data acquired from 68 Chinese male zzso Combining with zzso we simulated the visibility of low and high contrast objects at adult abdomen under variety of zzso dose zzso Using the automatic tube current zzso zzso technique, we reduced the total radiation dose and identified a proper noise index zzso for Chinese patients to maintain low or high contrast zzso of abdominal CT zzso Our zzso experiments showed that in the phantom study for Chinese patients, when a zzso was set at 10, the radiation dose reduced by zzso with low contrast objects zzso while setting zzso at 14 the dose level decreased by zzso without change the zzso of high contrast zzso The zzso ratings from three zzso also yielded high zzso with Kappa zzso zzso This study demonstrated the feasibility of performing the CT dose zzso studies through a unique phantom with the zzso zzso
