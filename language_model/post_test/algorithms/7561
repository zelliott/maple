In this paper, a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the artificial immune principle is zzso In the proposed algorithm, the zzso is divided into two kinds of zzso consisting of one elite zzso and several normal zzso The best individual of each normal zzso will be memorized into the elite zzso during the evolution zzso A hybrid method, which creates new individuals by using three different operators, is presented to ensure the diversity of all the zzso Furthermore, a simple zzso zzso learning operator is zzso for accelerating the convergence speed of the zzso zzso The improved zzso operator is employed for zzso the elite zzso while the migration scheme is employed for the information exchange between elite zzso and normal zzso The performance of the proposed zzso is verified by testing on a suite of standard benchmark functions, which shows faster convergence and global search zzso Its performance is further evaluated by its application to zzso zzso of zzso zzso machines, which shows that its performance significantly zzso existing zzso The proposed zzso can estimate the machine zzso zzso zzso winding resistance, and zzso flux linkage zzso
