This paper describes a number of improvements to a method, developed in this laboratory and described in zzso zzso zzso 85 (1989) zzso which makes it possible to determine values of long-range zzso zzso zzso from zzso multiple bond correlation zzso zzso First, it is shown how zzso zzso can be introduced into the zzso experiment without zzso the form of the zzso zzso a one-dimensional version of the experiment is also described which permits the rapid measurement of a small number of zzso Second, the experiment is modified so that zzso and long-range zzso can be zzso and so that the zzso zzso have more reliable zzso Finally, it is shown how these zzso zzso can be used to advantage in the fitting zzso
