zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can faithfully reproduce objects above and below the optical plane of zzso However, as in optical imaging, the zzso zzso and optimal reconstruction depth changes based on the zzso distance of objects from the focal plane of the input lens with the exception that objects above and below the focal plane are in focus with zzso and out of focus by standard optical zzso We have analyzed these effects both theoretically and zzso for two zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso This information has been used to reconstruct a test zzso object placed above or below the optical plane of focus with high zzso and image zzso Because zzso is inherently a zzso system, this advance makes it possible to create zzso zzso images from zzso zzso
