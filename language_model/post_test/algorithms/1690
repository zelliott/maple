The sign of the largest zzso zzso is the fundamental indicator of chaos in a zzso zzso However, although the extraction of zzso zzso can be accomplished with zzso zzso the experimental data, this is still a relatively zzso and sensitive zzso This paper presents an alternative pragmatic approach to identifying chaos using response frequency characteristics and extending the concept of the zzso The method is shown to work well on both experimental and simulated time zzso
