zzso zzso originating from the zzso testing zzso signal seriously influences the accuracy of the signal extraction and zzso zzso zzso analysis methods are mainly used to improve the defects detection zzso In fact, the zzso a hybrid of the Short time zzso transform zzso and zzso transform zzso has a time frequency resolution which is far from zzso In this paper, a new modified zzso based on zzso technique, which offers a better time frequency resolution compared to the original zzso is zzso The improvement is achieved by the introduction of a new zzso rule for the zzso window used in zzso zzso results are presented and show correct time frequency information of multiple zzso echoes under low zzso ratio zzso zzso In addition, experimental results demonstrate better and reliable detection of close echoes drowned in the zzso
