Creating models for virtual reality subdivides into several zzso The aim of the data acquisition is the extraction of nearly zzso zzso solution in all three zzso data sets with low noise zzso An approximate zzso can be achieved by suitable choice of scan zzso For raw data zzso the application of high-resolution reconstruction zzso is prohibited due to increased zzso A missing zzso can zzso be zzso by zzso Further noise suppression is achieved by applying zzso Additionally, the contrast of the object for zzso can be increased by image processing zzso The correct choice of the zzso method and the editing tools is essential for a precise zzso with minimal user zzso Prior to zzso smoothing the shape of the segmented model zzso or zzso zzso polygon reduction of wire frame zzso further improves the visual appearance of the zzso zzso
