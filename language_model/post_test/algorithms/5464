The accuracy of the zzso one-dimensional zzso equations of pressure and flow wave propagation in zzso zzso arteries was tested against zzso in a zzso experimental zzso replica of the 37 largest zzso arteries in the human systemic zzso The parameters required by the zzso zzso were directly measured in the in zzso setup and no data fitting was zzso The inclusion of wall zzso in the zzso model reduced the zzso zzso zzso obtained using a purely elastic tube law, especially in peripheral vessels, which was previously reported in this paper zzso et zzso zzso Pulse wave propagation in a model human zzso zzso Assessment of zzso zzso simulations against in zzso zzso zzso zzso 40, zzso In comparison to the purely elastic model, zzso significantly reduced the average relative zzso errors between zzso and experimental zzso over the 70 locations measured in the in zzso model: from zzso to zzso zzso for pressure and from zzso to zzso zzso for the flow zzso In the frequency domain, average relative errors between zzso and experimental zzso from the 5th to the 20th harmonic decreased from zzso to zzso zzso for pressure and from zzso to zzso zzso for the flow zzso These results provide additional support for the use of zzso reduced zzso to accurately simulate clinically relevant problems at a reasonable zzso zzso
