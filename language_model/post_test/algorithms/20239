zzso et zzso zzso zzso procedure for treatment effects and some aspects of computer zzso among them zzso and De zzso zzso and a zzso algorithm, are zzso For studies with up to sixty subjects, a table of zzso of the ranked zzso mean ratios or differences is given, to establish zzso zzso confidence zzso It is shown that zzso analysis is not limited to treatment zzso it can also be applied to period and sequence zzso This extended procedure can be seen as the zzso analogue of analysis of zzso on zzso zzso zzso A zzso program zzso incorporating zzso and De zzso zzso is zzso This program provides zzso point estimates for treatment and period effects, zzso and zzso confidence intervals for zzso treatments, the zzso confidence zzso for periods and a test on sequence effects, so that it can also be used for other than zzso zzso zzso can handle ratios zzso zzso as well as differences zzso zzso It zzso provides the complete zzso zzso probability distribution for treatment ratios or differences, so that zzso zzso zzso tests zzso can also be performed in a zzso zzso
