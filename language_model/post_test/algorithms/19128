An accurate analysis of the spatial distribution of blood flow in any organ must be based on detailed zzso zzso zzso vessel numbers, and branching zzso of the organ zzso Despite the significance of detailed zzso data, there is relative zzso of data on zzso vascular zzso One of the major reasons is that the process of zzso data collection is labor zzso The objective of this study is to validate a novel zzso zzso for zzso of zzso data zzso The utility of the method is demonstrated in zzso coronary arteries zzso by computerized zzso zzso The coronary arteries of five zzso hearts were injected with a zzso zzso The coronary zzso tree zzso to 1 zzso was extracted from the zzso CT zzso By determining the zzso of the extracted vessels, the vessel zzso and lengths were identified for various vessel zzso The extraction zzso described in this paper is based on a zzso analysis of a zzso field generated by normal zzso of the extracted vessel zzso With this approach, special focus is placed on achieving the highest accuracy of the measured zzso To validate the algorithm, the results were compared to optical zzso of the main trunk of the coronary arteries with zzso The agreement was found to be excellent with a root mean square zzso between zzso vessel diameters and optical zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the mean zzso and an average zzso of zzso zzso The utility and future applications of the proposed method to speed up zzso zzso of vascular trees are zzso
