Comparative biology includes the comparison of zzso and quantitative real-time zzso zzso data sets in a range of species to detect zzso zzso and divergent zzso zzso abundance analysis of target genes by zzso requires a highly accurate and robust zzso This includes reference genes with high expression stability zzso low zzso transcript abundance zzso for correct target gene zzso zzso zzso for proper comparative transcript zzso requires reference genes suitable for different zzso We addressed this issue using zzso zzso data sets of zzso zzso zzso seeds to identify new candidate reference zzso We investigated their expression stability in zzso seeds of zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso combined with in zzso analysis of zzso and zzso zzso zzso data zzso This revealed that reference gene expression stability is higher for a given zzso process between distinct species than for distinct zzso processes within a given single zzso The identified superior zzso reference genes may be used for zzso comparative zzso analysis of zzso seed zzso Furthermore, using zzso seeds, we exemplify zzso of the zzso zzso for challenging zzso regarding zzso quality, transcript stability, and tissue zzso Our work therefore can serve as a zzso for moving beyond zzso by establishing high-quality zzso zzso
