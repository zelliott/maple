To analyze the characteristics of pulmonary function and the clinical significance of zzso pattern zzso 

A total of 1933 pulmonary function tests of adult patients were zzso and those with zzso were zzso The pulmonary function test results, clinical diagnosis and zzso manifestations were zzso zzso distribution data were compared by zzso test, while zzso distribution data were compared by zzso U test, and zzso test was used to compare zzso 

There were 61 patients in the zzso group and zzso in the control zzso The zzso of the 2 groups was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, being not significantly different zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The age was 64 zzso years and 56 zzso years, and the smoking index was zzso zzso and 0 zzso respectively, showing no significant differences zzso values were zzso and zzso respectively, all P zzso zzso In the zzso group, zzso was zzso zzso predicted, zzso zzso zzso predicted, zzso zzso zzso RV zzso zzso predicted, and TLC zzso zzso zzso predicted, which were significantly different as compared to those of the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso values are zzso all P zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group and zzso zzso zzso in the control group, the difference being significant zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The decreased TLC indicated restricted zzso while the increased RV and zzso indicated air zzso The clinical diagnosis of zzso included zzso and restrictive diseases, some of which showed severe zzso zzso but there were 31 patients without pulmonary zzso 

Age and smoking, but not zzso may play a role in zzso has characteristics of zzso and restrictive ventilation zzso but does not associate with particular diseases, thus having limited clinical zzso
