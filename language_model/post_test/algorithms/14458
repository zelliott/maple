A standard approach to estimate zzso zzso on a zzso scale is zzso analysis zzso which zzso an objective function subject to constraints on zzso zzso zzso The performance of zzso models heavily depends on the relevance of the formulated objective function and the zzso of the defined zzso Previous studies indicated that zzso predictions can be improved by adding regulatory zzso zzso These constraints were imposed based on either absolute or relative gene expression zzso We provide a new zzso that directly uses regulatory zzso constraints based on gene expression data in zzso zzso zzso Our assumption is that if the activity of a gene drastically changes from one condition to the other, the flux through the reaction controlled by that gene will change zzso We allow these constraints to be zzso to account for zzso control and noise in the zzso These zzso constraints are less stringent than the zzso constraints as previously zzso Nevertheless, we obtain promising predictions, since many zzso constraints can be zzso The potential of the proposed method, zzso is demonstrated through the analysis of zzso in zzso under nine different zzso conditions, between which approximately 5,000 regulatory zzso constraints can be zzso We show that changes in gene expression are zzso for changes in zzso Additionally, we illustrate that flux zzso obtained with zzso better fit zzso data than previous zzso Finally, we compare zzso and zzso predictions to show that our approach yields more biologically relevant zzso
