zzso linear zzso analysis zzso is a traditional zzso reduction method that has been proven to be successful for zzso Numerous zzso such as the zzso Fisher zzso analysis zzso have been proposed to enhance the zzso power for zzso zzso Although effective, the zzso is zzso expensive, since the complexity increases with the size of the data zzso In this correspondence, we suggest a novel strategy to enhance the zzso for an entire family of the zzso Rather than invoke the zzso for the entire data set, we advocate that the data be first reduced into a smaller representative subset using a zzso reduction scheme and that the zzso reduction be achieved by zzso a zzso on this reduced data zzso In this way, data points that are ineffective in the dimension reduction and zzso can be eliminated to obtain a significantly reduced kernel zzso K without degrading the zzso Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism dramatically reduces the zzso time without sacrificing the zzso accuracy for artificial and real-life data zzso
