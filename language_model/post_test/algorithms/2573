zzso real-time zzso zzso is a powerful tool to measure gene expression zzso zzso and zzso results are dependent on the correct choice of the reference genes for data zzso To date, screenings evaluating candidate reference gene stability for expression studies in zzso have not been zzso In the present work, we analyzed the expression patterns of 12 genes in a set of 20 zzso samples, obtained from different zzso of plants grown at various experimental zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso zzso the expression stability of three zzso reference zzso such as ACT, zzso and zzso zzso and the newly identified candidates, was zzso With respect to the zzso our results showed similar performance among zzso zzso and zzso in evaluating the suitability of reference zzso Our data therefore showed that the currently and widely used reference genes for data zzso in zzso were not the most stable expressed zzso Five of the new putative reference genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited the highest expression stability according to all zzso In conclusion, with this study, we provide a list of validated reference genes and their relative primer sequences to conduct reliable zzso experiments in zzso
