In zzso zzso experiments are used widely in drug discovery and other areas of pharmaceutical zzso Much effort has been zzso in developing novel zzso models but generally much less attention has been paid to the zzso barrier in the actual zzso The restricted liquid flow in the vicinity of solid surfaces leads to a zone where the zzso movement of molecules exceeds the zzso This leads to formation of a concentration zzso between the bulk solution and the zzso The formed zzso water layer zzso reduces the apparent zzso zzso of compounds that rapidly pass through the actual zzso zzso This lowers the resolution of zzso versus zzso zzso zzso the zzso analysis and zzso apparent kinetic parameters of zzso zzso This review describes the techniques that can be used to determine the zzso thickness in zzso experiments and zzso described in the literature to control the in zzso zzso
