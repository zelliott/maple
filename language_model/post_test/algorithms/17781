zzso and zzso declared respectively that, in the absence of bias between the two DNA strands for zzso and selection, the base composition within each strand should be zzso and zzso (this state is called Parity Rule type 2, zzso However, the zzso sequences of many bacteria, zzso and viruses showed zzso in base composition and gene zzso To determine the relationship of base composition zzso with replication orientation, gene function, zzso usage biases and zzso evolution, in this paper a program called zzso was developed for the statistical analysis of strand asymmetry and zzso composition bias in the DNA zzso In addition, the program can also be used to predict the replication boundaries of zzso zzso The method builds on the fact that there are compositional zzso between the leading and the lagging strand for zzso zzso was written in zzso script language and implemented on the zzso operating zzso It works quickly with zzso or zzso sequences in zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The source code is freely available for academic use at zzso
