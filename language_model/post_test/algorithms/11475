In recent times, the problem of zzso zzso detection for zzso rotary blood pumps has attracted substantial research zzso Here, we compare the performance of various zzso zzso for different types of zzso and zzso events based on pump speed zzso A total of zzso different zzso that consist of previously proposed as well as newly introduced zzso zzso are tested using zzso zzso zzso These zzso can be classified as zzso based zzso from the mean, zzso and minimum values of a zzso duration based zzso from the duration of a zzso zzso based zzso from the first order as well as higher order zzso and frequency based zzso from the power spectral zzso The zzso event data consists of zzso ejection with or without zzso and intermittent and continuous zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso event data consists of partial zzso collapse that occurs zzso as well as continuously with or without zzso In addition, we also attempted to minimize the usage of multiple zzso by applying the sequential forward floating selection method to find which combination of zzso gives the best zzso In general, the zzso and zzso zzso performed quite well while the zzso and zzso zzso performed zzso By having only two zzso zzso the maximum zzso change in positive zzso and zzso the standard zzso of the maximum value in a zzso we were able to achieve a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso
