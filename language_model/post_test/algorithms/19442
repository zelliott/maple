zzso imaging is a natural extension of the capabilities of zzso zzso The first zzso spectral imaging zzso instruments were able to acquire spectral data that allowed the emissions of overlapping fluorescent zzso to be assigned to data channels representing a spectrum rather than a range of zzso zzso This marked a significant improvement over what could be done by channel series with standard zzso zzso However the performance of these earlier designs can fall short in one or more of the following zzso sensitivity, spectral resolution and zzso acquisition speed, and zzso zzso Nikon has recently introduced a new zzso zzso zzso that overcomes some of the more serious performance deficiencies of earlier designs through unique zzso zzso and data handling zzso zzso uses a zzso zzso tube zzso as the detector and typically acquires spectral data in a single zzso zzso is enhanced over designs zzso randomly polarized zzso by rotating the polarization of all zzso photons to the zzso the plane for which the zzso grating is most zzso Three zzso zzso are provided supporting wavelength sampling increments of zzso 5, and 10 zzso zzso have been made in the zzso process to increase detection efficiency as zzso zzso is zzso to a high enough standard that it is possible to share and reproduce data between zzso The zzso implemented in the zzso software is able to accurately and repeatedly zzso fluorescent zzso with zzso zzso separated by as little as 5 zzso It is possible to zzso zzso with zzso zzso separated by 20 zzso with a zzso brightness zzso Three zzso can be zzso with zzso zzso contained within a 20 zzso zzso Acquisition is fast enough and the sensitivity is sufficient for zzso to acquire more than 100 frames of spectral time series data without serious zzso
