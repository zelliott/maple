zzso of optical zzso zzso zzso images provides useful information, especially in medical imaging zzso Because zzso images are subject to zzso noise, the identification of structures is zzso Addressing this issue, two methods for the automated zzso of arbitrary structures in zzso images are zzso The methods perform a seeded region growing, applying a zzso analysis of zzso zzso for the zzso zzso The zzso therefore avoids any zzso zzso The first zzso zzso uses an zzso neighborhood zzso criterion based on a model of an zzso intensity course in tissue and a model of zzso noise zzso It can be applied to an unfiltered zzso zzso The second performs region growing on a filtered zzso image applying the local median as a measure for zzso in the zzso Performance is compared through the quantitative evaluation of artificial data, showing the capabilities of both in terms of structures detected and zzso The proposed methods were tested on real zzso data in different scenarios and showed promising results for their application in zzso zzso
