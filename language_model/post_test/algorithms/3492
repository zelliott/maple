In this paper, we describe ongoing work in the Image zzso and Analysis Group zzso at Yale University specifically aimed at the analysis of structural information as represented within magnetic resonance images zzso of the human zzso Specifically, we will describe our applied mathematical approaches to the zzso of cortical and zzso structure, the analysis of white matter fiber tracks using diffusion zzso imaging zzso and the zzso registration of zzso zzso data zzso Many of our methods rally around the use of geometric constraints, statistical zzso zzso and the use of level set evolution zzso The analysis of gray matter structure and connecting white matter paths combined with the ability to bring all information into a common space via zzso registration should provide us with a rich set of data to investigate structure and variation in the human brain in zzso disorders, as well as provide a basis for current work in the development of integrated brain zzso zzso
