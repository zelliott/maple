zzso bleeding carries a heavy burden of illness in cardiac zzso Although zzso dysfunction is considered to be an important cause, it is not routinely zzso Our objective was to explore the relationship between zzso dysfunction and blood loss in cardiac zzso 

In 100 zzso patients undergoing cardiac surgery requiring zzso zzso zzso function was measured before, zzso and after bypass with a zzso device that compares zzso counts before and after exposure to an zzso zzso were blinded to the results of zzso Patients whose calculated blood loss was part of the highest zzso for the cohort were classified as having had high blood zzso The independent relationship between zzso function and high blood loss was measured with the aid of multivariable zzso zzso modeling (with a robust error zzso that controlled for patients' overall risk of high blood zzso 

zzso blood loss was zzso skewed with a median of zzso zzso zzso and 75th zzso of 380 and 1775 zzso Patients whose blood loss exceeded zzso zzso were classified as having had high blood loss, and 25 patients met this zzso There was 1 death in the high blood loss group unrelated to zzso After adjusting for bleeding risk, each 10 zzso zzso increase in zzso functional zzso count during zzso and zzso respectively, was associated with a relative risk of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso for high blood zzso 

zzso dysfunction, as measured by a zzso method during zzso and zzso is independently associated with high blood loss in cardiac zzso Additional studies are needed to determine whether the incorporation of this zzso into blood management zzso might help zzso blood zzso therapy, potentially reducing blood loss and improving clinical zzso
