The visual system's flexibility in zzso depth is zzso We readily perceive 3-D structure under diverse conditions from the seemingly random dots of a zzso zzso zzso to the aesthetically beautiful, but obviously flat, zzso of the Old zzso Yet, 3-D perception is often enhanced when different cues specify the same zzso This zzso process is understood as zzso zzso that improves sensory zzso Despite considerable behavioral support for this theory, insights into the cortical circuits involved are zzso Moreover, extant work tested zzso similar cues, reducing some of the challenges associated with zzso zzso and zzso different zzso Here we address this challenge by measuring zzso responses to depth structures defined by zzso zzso disparity, and their zzso We zzso information about depth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in different visual cortical areas using pattern zzso zzso We found that zzso responses in zzso visual area zzso were more zzso when disparity and zzso zzso signaled depth, in line with the predictions of cue zzso zzso by relating zzso and zzso tests of integration, we observed a close association between depth judgments and activity in this zzso Finally, using a zzso transfer test, we found that zzso responses evoked by one cue afford zzso of responses evoked by the zzso This reveals a generalized depth representation in zzso visual zzso that combines zzso different information in line with 3-D zzso
