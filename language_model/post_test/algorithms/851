zzso zzso scattering zzso experiments were performed on zzso zzso zzso zzso prepared in heavy water by zzso through zzso filters with 500 A zzso The data obtained at zzso degrees C were evaluated using a zzso function model of the zzso coherent zzso scattering length density, three different approximate form factors describing scattering from zzso and different methods of evaluation of the experimental zzso It is shown that the results obtained from the zzso data in the range of scattering zzso values zzso zzso zzso zzso are not sensitive to the zzso form factor, nor to the evaluation zzso Using the hollow sphere model of zzso convoluted with the zzso distribution of their sizes, a constrained zzso polar region thickness of 9 A and a zzso zzso volume of zzso zzso it was possible to obtain from the experimental data the zzso surface area as zzso zzso the zzso thickness as zzso A and the number of water molecules as zzso per zzso located in the zzso polar zzso
