zzso sitting is one of the first motor skills an infant zzso and thus sitting zzso control provides an early window into the zzso motor zzso Early identification of infants with motor zzso zzso such as infants with cerebral zzso allows for early therapeutic intervention by physical zzso Early intervention is thought to produce better zzso due to greater neural plasticity in younger zzso zzso zzso as measured by a force plate, can be used to zzso and zzso characterize infant motor control during zzso zzso such as cerebral zzso may alter the zzso properties of motor zzso Often zzso time series data, including infant sitting zzso sway data, is zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis zzso is useful to characterize the zzso nature of time series data because it is does not assume zzso of the zzso In this study we found that suitable selection of the order of the zzso function improves the performance of the zzso algorithm, with a higher order zzso zzso better able to distinguish infant sitting posture time series data from Brown noise zzso zzso and first order zzso better able to distinguish infants with motor delay zzso zzso from infants with typical zzso
