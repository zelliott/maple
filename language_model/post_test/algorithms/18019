Here we demonstrate a zzso positioning method on a continuous crystal zzso Three different models for the light distribution were zzso Diagnosis of the zzso showed that the zzso model fits the experimental data better than zzso and zzso models in our particular experimental zzso Based on the correlation between the spread and the peak value of the light distribution model with the depth of interaction zzso we were able to estimate the three-dimensional position of a zzso zzso On our continuous miniature crystal element zzso detector module with 8 zzso thick zzso zzso the intrinsic spatial resolution is zzso zzso at the center and zzso zzso at the corner using a zzso zzso zzso method and the zzso zzso The zzso resolution (full zzso at half zzso is estimated to be approximately zzso zzso The positioning method using the zzso model outperformed the zzso and zzso models, in both zzso and weighted zzso zzso fitting zzso The key feature of this technique is that it requires very little zzso of the zzso but still retains high resolution and high zzso
