New zzso techniques such as the analysis of zzso transfer or diffusion have provided evidence for subtle progressive zzso in tissue integrity prior to focal leakage of the zzso barrier zzso as part of plaque formation in multiple zzso Since inflammation is capable of modulating the zzso we investigated the hypothesis that changes in the local zzso might be one of the earliest signs of zzso zzso 20 patients with zzso zzso multiple sclerosis were zzso with regard to cerebral blood volume, cerebral blood flow, mean transit time and apparent diffusion zzso zzso as well as conventional zzso zzso on monthly follow-up zzso Among 89 zzso zzso we selected 18 that developed during the study and met strict inclusion zzso In these, changes of zzso parameters were zzso not only prior to the zzso breakdown, but also prior to increases in the zzso Our data indicate that inflammation is accompanied by altered local zzso which can be detected prior to zzso of the zzso
