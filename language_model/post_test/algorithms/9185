A method is presented to improve computer aided detection zzso results for masses in zzso by fusing information obtained from two views of the same zzso It is based on a previously developed approach to link potentially suspicious regions in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Using correspondence between regions, we extended our zzso scheme by building a zzso zzso system, in which the last stage zzso zzso of an initially detected region conditional on the existence and similarity of a linked candidate region in the other zzso We compared the zzso detection system with the zzso detection method using zzso receiver operating characteristic zzso analysis and cross zzso The zzso used in the evaluation consisted of zzso zzso zzso including 412 cancer cases with a mass, architectural zzso or zzso A statistically significant improvement was found in the zzso based detection zzso At a false positive zzso rate of zzso zzso the zzso sensitivity improved from zzso to zzso Case based sensitivity did not zzso
