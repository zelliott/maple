This paper describes the design, construction and evaluation of a two-dimensional ultrasound phased array to be used in the treatment of benign zzso zzso With two-dimensional phased zzso the focal point position can be controlled by changing the electrical power and phase to the individual elements for focusing and zzso steering in a three-dimensional zzso The array was designed with a steering angle of zzso degrees in both zzso and zzso zzso A zzso ceramic zzso was used as the material of the zzso since it can handle the high power needed for tissue zzso and a matching layer was used for maximum acoustic power transmission to zzso Analysis of the zzso ceramic and cable zzso has been designed for high power transfer with minimal zzso and zzso For this initial prototype, the final construction used magnet compatible housing and zzso for future application in a clinical magnetic resonance imaging system for temperature mapping of the focused zzso To verify the capability of the zzso for focusing and zzso zzso was performed and the results correlated well with the calculated zzso zzso zzso experiments were performed and indicated the capability of the zzso to zzso tissue using short zzso For zzso with exposure time of 10, 15 and 20 zzso the zzso size was roughly zzso zzso and zzso zzso in diameter, respectively, which indicates the feasibility of this zzso
