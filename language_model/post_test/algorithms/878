zzso vascular strain imaging has limited strain dynamic range because zzso wall zzso only exhibit small strains under zzso zzso A zzso zzso ultrasound zzso scanning procedure was performed to apply external force, comparable to the force generated in measuring a zzso blood pressure, to achieve higher strains by zzso the internal zzso baseline zzso When the applied pressure matched the internal baseline zzso pressure, zzso strain and strain rate increased by a factor of 10 over a cardiac zzso zzso zzso strain was assessed within the vessel wall over the entire deformation procedure using a zzso zzso zzso zzso The feasibility of this technique to assess vascular zzso elastic properties is demonstrated in an ex zzso experiment and further supported by in zzso zzso With some uncertainty associated with the elastic properties of surrounding zzso an elastic zzso reconstruction procedure was developed to estimate the zzso elastic properties of the vascular zzso
