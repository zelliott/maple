The aim of this research was to obtain an absolute zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels in zzso white matter by means of zzso magnetic resonance zzso in a group of multiple sclerosis patients (27 with the zzso form and 13 with the secondary progressive zzso These values were compared with those of a group of 12 zzso healthy control zzso A significant decrease in the zzso concentration was found in zzso white matter of frontal and zzso brain areas in multiple sclerosis patients compared with the same areas in control zzso This reduction was more evident in progressive zzso The decrease in the zzso concentration in zzso white matter significantly correlated with the Expanded zzso zzso and the zzso zzso No significant change was found in the concentration of zzso or zzso This finding concurs with previous evidence of zzso in the multiple sclerosis pathological process which is not confined to the zzso and involves not only zzso but also zzso even in white matter which appears normal on zzso
