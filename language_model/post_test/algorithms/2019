zzso weighted zzso can provide zzso information that is specific to zzso zzso So far, in human brain, apparent diffusion zzso zzso of only the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been zzso High field MR at 7 T allows the collection and analysis of diffusion weighted zzso data of additional zzso of interest such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are of interest due to their different zzso and role in brain zzso In this study, we performed zzso diffusion weighted zzso at 7 T using a zzso PRESS sequence in zzso white matter zzso zzso 6) and zzso zzso matter zzso zzso zzso Data were analyzed using the zzso zzso could reliably be obtained of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and white matter, and zzso zzso zzso in white zzso zzso differences in zzso values were observed between zzso and white matter for all zzso zzso in zzso matter were consistently lower than in white zzso These differences can probably be attributed to different zzso as well as to the differential impact of diffusion time on zzso of different molecules under conditions of restricted zzso
