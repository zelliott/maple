A zzso zzso for a dotted surface zzso a surface defined by point coordinates in three zzso is zzso The individual zzso are generated on the basis of a hierarchy of strategies according to increasing surface zzso While for small molecules an elementary zzso is sufficient to zzso the surface, large zzso zzso need all steps of the zzso Although this program has been developed with the aim of zzso molecular surfaces, it can in principle be applied to any surface defined by zzso point zzso
