This study reports improved zzso driven zzso zzso to enhance their mixing zzso Enhancement of zzso zzso zzso is achieved using zzso an active approach of utilizing a pulsating zzso and zzso a passive approach of using the channel geometry effect with patterned zzso zzso zzso zzso of different designs were zzso Experimental zzso were carried out using zzso B to examine the mixing performance and the zzso image zzso technique to characterize the zzso flow zzso zzso Scaling analysis provides an effective frequency range of applied zzso electric zzso zzso show that for a zzso of 10 zzso mixing zzso utilizing frequency modulated electric field and channel geometry effects can increase the mixing efficiency from 50 to zzso In addition, zzso simulations were performed to analyze the mixing process in the zzso zzso with various zzso The simulation results were compared with the experimental data, and reasonable agreement was zzso
