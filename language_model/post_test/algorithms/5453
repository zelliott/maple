zzso an zzso for capturing number, size, location, and zzso of zzso and for defining and flagging discrepancies to ensure data zzso 

The proportion of zzso with no assumption or zzso the proportion of patient records eligible for determining the zzso detection rate zzso and the number of patients with zzso zzso 

Only 50% of zzso removed during this period were perfectly zzso with no assumption or zzso Records from only zzso and zzso of eligible patients could be used to determine the zzso and the number of patients with zzso zzso zzso 

Rates of missing reports may have been higher in the early phase of establishment of the zzso 

This study highlights the impediments in collecting zzso data in a zzso registry and provides useful parameters for evaluating the quality and accuracy of data obtained from such zzso
