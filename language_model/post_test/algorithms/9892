We have previously reported on the equivalent zzso size, zzso zzso and zzso strain properties of zzso plaque ex zzso Since plaque structure and composition may be damaged during a carotid zzso zzso characterization of in zzso properties of zzso plaque is zzso The relatively shallow depth of the carotid artery and plaque enables zzso evaluation of carotid plaque utilizing high frequency zzso zzso We investigate the ability of the zzso zzso and equivalent zzso size parameters to differentiate between zzso and zzso plaque zzso zzso plaques especially zzso rich and those with a thin zzso cap are more prone to zzso and can be classified as unstable or vulnerable zzso zzso results were obtained from 10 human patients whose carotid artery was scanned in zzso to evaluate zzso plaque prior to a carotid zzso zzso Our results indicate that the equivalent zzso size obtained using zzso scattering theory for zzso regions are in the zzso zzso range while zzso regions have larger equivalent zzso size distribution in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso for zzso regions as expected is significantly higher than that for zzso zzso In the frequency bandwidth ranging from zzso to zzso zzso the zzso zzso for zzso regions lies between zzso and zzso zzso while that for zzso regions lies between zzso and zzso zzso
