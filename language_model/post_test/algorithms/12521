We analyzed a teaching institution's experience with zzso zzso zzso and zzso retrograde zzso zzso and established an zzso for their timing and zzso The records of all patients undergoing zzso during a five year period were zzso Patients with a history of zzso or zzso abnormal zzso alkaline zzso serum zzso zzso or zzso evidence suggestive of zzso were considered zzso zzso for common zzso duct stones zzso The remaining patients were considered to be at low zzso zzso was attempted on zzso patients during the study period and successfully completed on zzso zzso of the zzso The major complication rate was zzso and the common zzso duct injury rate zzso Eighty eight zzso patients underwent zzso 67 in the zzso period and 19 in the zzso zzso zzso was attempted in 272 zzso patients and completed in 234 for a success rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso retrograde zzso zzso were equivalent in the detection of zzso Twelve of the 21 patients zzso with zzso positive for stones underwent successful zzso clearance of the common zzso and did not require zzso zzso No patients were converted to an open procedure for common zzso duct zzso Because zzso zzso was zzso successful in clearing the common zzso zzso for retained common zzso duct stones was not zzso zzso is an alternative procedure to zzso for patients at risk with zzso zzso or clinical evidence of zzso The zzso of zzso in low-risk patients is zzso a risk that does not warrant routine zzso zzso zzso is recommended in cases of zzso unresponsive to zzso suspicion of zzso and zzso zzso unresponsive to supportive zzso Although zzso leads to a similar percentage of zzso studies as zzso zzso it often allows for one procedure zzso
