zzso an zzso zzso was introduced as the zzso matching layer between silicon and water for zzso applications zzso acoustic zzso zzso performances, including the acoustic zzso wave zzso and zzso of the zzso matching layer, were characterized at a frequency of 1 zzso at room zzso The gain in echo characterization with a zzso zzso and with different zzso zzso made of zzso and zzso zzso zzso around 35 zzso between silicon and water was characterized as being above 10 zzso in each zzso With the increase of concentration of zzso in zzso based zzso from 0 to 30 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso increased from about 3 to 6 zzso zzso The zzso zzso in the zzso is between zzso and zzso zzso The most efficient matching was obtained with the zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso with which the enhanced loss is about zzso zzso as the zzso is about zzso zzso This type of matching layer has potential applications in zzso technology for high frequency zzso or in the fabrication of high frequency zzso
