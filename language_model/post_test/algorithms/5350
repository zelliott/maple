The zzso of zzso as second zzso in living cells is achieved by a rich spectrum of zzso cellular concentration zzso zzso release from internal storage compartments plays a key role in shaping zzso zzso zzso Deciphering this signaling mechanism is essential for a deeper understanding of its zzso function and general concepts of cell zzso Here, we review recent experimental findings demonstrating the zzso of zzso zzso and its relevance for modeling zzso zzso The zzso arises by the zzso signal structure that carries molecular fluctuations of single channels onto the level of the cell leading to a zzso medium as theoretically zzso The result contradicts the current opinion of zzso being a cellular zzso We demonstrate that cells use array enhanced zzso resonance to form rather regular zzso signals and that the zzso carry information despite the involved zzso The knowledge on the underlying mechanism also allows for determination of intrinsic properties from global zzso In the second part of the paper, we briefly survey different modeling approaches with regard to the experimental zzso We focus on the dependence of the standard zzso on the mean period of the zzso It shows that limit cycle zzso cannot describe the experimental data and that generic models have to include the spatial aspects of zzso zzso
