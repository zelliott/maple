The automated structure zzso of organic molecules from zzso obtained properties is extended by an entirely new zzso A genetic zzso is implemented that uses molecular constitution structures as zzso With this approach, the structure of organic molecules can be zzso to meet experimental criteria, if in addition a fast and accurate method for the prediction of the used physical or chemical features is zzso This is demonstrated using zzso zzso spectrum as readily zzso zzso By means of artificial neural networks a fast and accurate method for calculating the zzso zzso spectrum of the generated structures zzso The method is implemented and tested successfully for organic molecules with up to 18 zzso zzso
