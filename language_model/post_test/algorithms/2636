A new zzso zzso is developed for reconstructing the three-dimensional zzso intensity of a zzso biological zzso from many zzso measured zzso two-dimensional X-ray laser zzso patterns, each for an unknown zzso The first step is zzso of the two-dimensional patterns into groups according to the similarity of direction of the incident zzso with respect to the zzso and an averaging within each group to reduce the zzso The second step is detection of common zzso circles between the zzso two-dimensional patterns to identify their mutual location in the three-dimensional zzso zzso The newly developed zzso enables one to detect a signal for zzso in noisy experimental zzso data with as low as zzso photons per effective zzso The zzso of such a limiting zzso determines the zzso structural zzso From this fact, the resolution limit due to the quantum noise zzso by this new method of analysis as well as two important experimental zzso the number of two-dimensional patterns to be measured (the load for the zzso and the number of pairs of two-dimensional patterns to be zzso (the load for the zzso are derived as a function of the incident X-ray intensity and quantities characterizing the target zzso
