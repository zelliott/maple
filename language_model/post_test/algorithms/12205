The zzso of zzso Acid Red 27 zzso a zzso zzso zzso was studied in the ultraviolet radiation zzso alone and zzso plus hydrogen zzso zzso zzso The experimental results indicated that the zzso of both zzso processes fit well by zzso order zzso The reaction rate was sensitive to the operational parameters and increased with increasing zzso concentration and light zzso The reaction orders of zzso concentration and light intensity in both processes were obtained with linear zzso zzso A zzso model was developed for zzso order rate constant zzso as a function of the zzso and zzso light zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso As a result of two opposing effects of zzso concentration at low and high zzso zzso has a value of zzso and zzso and zzso has a value of 3 zzso zzso and zzso for the regions of 0 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 650 zzso zzso and 650 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1500 zzso zzso zzso zzso is the initial dye concentration correlation index for developing of model for different initial zzso of zzso This rate expression can be used for predicting zzso at different conditions in zzso alone and zzso zzso The results show that zzso alone cannot be an efficient method for zzso of zzso in comparison with zzso process, therefore the first term of the model can be zzso
