The problem of projecting zzso data into lower dimensions has been pursued by many researchers due to its potential application to data analysis of various zzso This paper presents a novel zzso projection technique based on least square zzso The approximations zzso the coordinates of a set of projected points based on the coordinates of a reduced number of control points with defined zzso We name the technique zzso Square zzso zzso From an initial projection of the control points, zzso defines the positioning of their neighboring points through a zzso solution that aims at preserving a similarity relationship between the points given by a metric in zzso In order to perform the projection, a small number of distance calculations is necessary and no repositioning of the points is required to obtain a final solution with satisfactory zzso The results show the capability of the technique to form groups of points by degree of similarity in zzso We illustrate that capability through its application to mapping collections of zzso documents from varied sources, a strategic yet difficult zzso zzso is faster and more accurate than other existing high quality methods, particularly where it was mostly tested, that is, for mapping text zzso
