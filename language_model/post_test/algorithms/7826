For the analysis of zzso DNA in disaster victim identification zzso and criminal zzso single zzso zzso zzso have been recognized as promising markers mainly because they can be analyzed in short sized zzso Most zzso are zzso and are thereby ineffective to detect zzso which may lead to incorrect zzso We developed an zzso to find zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso We selected 31 potential zzso zzso with a minor zzso frequency of at least zzso The zzso nature was confirmed for 15 zzso residing on 14 different zzso zzso zzso zzso were developed, and the zzso zzso of 16 zzso were determined among 153 Dutch and 111 Netherlands zzso reference zzso Using these multiplex zzso zzso the presence of a mixture of two DNA samples in a ratio up to zzso could be recognized zzso Furthermore, we compared the zzso efficiency of the zzso zzso markers and short tandem repeat zzso markers by analyzing artificially zzso DNA and DNA from 30 approximately zzso bone and zzso zzso In both types of zzso DNA samples, the larger sized zzso zzso failed to amplify whereas the zzso zzso markers still provided valuable zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso markers are suited for the analysis of zzso DNA and enable the detection of a second DNA source in a zzso
