A personal computer-based technique was developed that reduces the extent of human efforts in obtaining data, like zzso density of profiles on area, describing the distribution of specific features of zzso zzso zzso density of synaptic profiles or of zzso reaction products in specified tissue zzso The procedure consists of zzso marking the objects to be zzso zzso recording the zzso of zzso tissue zzso of interest, and zzso allocating the marked objects to the corresponding zzso zzso This automatic sorting of objects into defined tissue zzso is achieved by an zzso operating on two sets of zzso zzso coordinates of points that constitute the boundary of tissue zzso zzso points) and zzso coordinates of points marking the particular objects to be zzso The principle of the sorting calculation is to construct zzso of the loop by lines parallel to the zzso which pass through zzso perimeter zzso The zzso to be sorted are classified by the sign of marker flags allocated to each point depending on which side of the perimeter segment they are zzso zzso and zzso procedures are zzso repeated along the entire perimeter of each domain specified by the operator which may result during the procedure in multiple changes of the sign of the zzso The internal or external location of each item finally is represented by the last sign of its zzso zzso allocated to zzso can be counted and processed further for zzso density zzso
