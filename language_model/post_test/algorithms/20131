In many zzso controlled trials the outcome of interest is a time to event, and one measures on each subject baseline zzso and zzso zzso until the subject either zzso the time to event is observed, or the end of study is zzso The goal of such a study is to assess the zzso effect of the treatment on the survival zzso We present a targeted maximum likelihood zzso of the zzso effect of treatment on survival fully utilizing all the available zzso information, resulting in a double robust locally efficient substitution zzso that will be consistent and zzso linear if either the zzso mechanism is consistently estimated, or if the maximum likelihood based zzso is already zzso In particular, under the independent zzso assumption assumed by current methods, this zzso is always consistent and zzso linear so that it provides valid confidence intervals and zzso Furthermore, we show that when both the zzso mechanism and the initial maximum likelihood based zzso are zzso and thus inconsistent, the zzso exhibits stability when inverse probability weighted zzso and double robust zzso equation based methods break down The zzso is used to analyze the zzso study, a study designed to evaluate the zzso zzso and development of drug resistance of six different zzso zzso zzso Most zzso this paper presents a general zzso that may be used to create targeted maximum likelihood zzso of a large class of parameters of interest for general zzso data zzso
