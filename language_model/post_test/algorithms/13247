In this paper, we first describe an optimum signal constellation design algorithm, which is optimum in zzso called zzso for channel capacity achieving source zzso zzso we introduce a feedback channel capacity inspired optimum signal constellation design zzso to further improve the performance of zzso inspired by the fact that feedback channel capacity is higher than that of systems without zzso The zzso obtained by zzso are, however, zzso zzso The zzso is jointly performed together with regular zzso zzso zzso zzso code zzso Such obtained zzso zzso in combination with zzso is suitable as both 400 zzso and zzso optical transport enabling zzso Using large zzso zzso code, we demonstrate by zzso Carlo simulations that a zzso signal zzso obtained by zzso zzso previously proposed zzso zzso zzso signal constellation by zzso zzso at zzso of zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso at the same zzso
