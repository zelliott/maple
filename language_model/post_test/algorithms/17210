zzso mathematical zzso is important in the development of zzso image reconstruction zzso for electrical zzso zzso zzso In such schemes the forward problem of calculating the electric potential from Neumann boundary data is solved many zzso One aspect of this problem which has received some attention is the mathematical zzso of the zzso used in the zzso In this paper we describe an integral equation zzso of a boundary value problem associated with this tissue and we indicate some of the ways in which this zzso can be used to obtain zzso and zzso zzso
