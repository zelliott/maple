We describe an approach to brain extraction from zzso MR volumes that uses a hierarchy of masks created by different models to form a consensus zzso The zzso zzso incorporates zzso extraction via zzso zzso zzso masking with connectivity constraints, and zzso masking with zzso zzso Volume and boundary metrics were zzso to evaluate the zzso and accuracy of zzso against manual brain extraction on 38 scans from normal and zzso zzso zzso masks were zzso across six repeat scans of a normal subject and were significantly more accurate than the masks produced by any of the individual zzso zzso
