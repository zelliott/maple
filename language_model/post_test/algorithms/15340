Identification of zzso factor binding sites (also called zzso zzso in DNA sequences is a basic step in understanding genetic zzso Although many successful programs have been developed, the problem is far from being solved on account of diversity in gene zzso and the low specificity of binding zzso zzso zzso have their own constraints zzso high time or space complexity for finding long zzso low precision in identification of weak zzso or the zzso zzso one occurrence of the motif instance per zzso which limit their scope of zzso 

In this paper, we present a novel and fast zzso we call zzso It is based on community detection from a graph and is used to discover long and weak zzso motifs under the zzso constraint zzso one or multiple zzso of the motif zzso per zzso where zzso is the length of a motif and d is the maximum number of zzso between a motif instance and the motif zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso motif search in sequences to focus on the discovery of dense zzso within a zzso It identifies these zzso using a fast community detection method for obtaining zzso candidate zzso Next, it greedily zzso these candidate motifs towards the true motif within their own zzso zzso studies on synthetic zzso zzso samples have shown that zzso is very efficient zzso it can find true zzso zzso zzso 8) motifs within 30 zzso More importantly, the zzso has succeeded in rapidly identifying motifs in a large data set of zzso promoters generated from the zzso coli database zzso The zzso has also accurately identified motifs in zzso data sets for 12 mouse zzso factors involved in zzso cell zzso and zzso 

Our novel zzso algorithm, zzso is able to quickly identify nearly exact matches for long and weak zzso zzso motifs in DNA sequences under the zzso zzso It is also capable of finding motifs in real zzso The source code for zzso can be obtained from zzso
