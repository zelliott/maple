Reading is one of the most important skills human beings can zzso but has proven difficult to study zzso using functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso We introduce a novel zzso Reading zzso zzso approach that enables reliable zzso of the neural zzso of zzso processing during reading of rapidly presented narrative text zzso zzso Application to an zzso experiment in which subjects read coherent narratives and made no overt responses revealed widespread effects of zzso zzso zzso and semantic variables on brain zzso zzso variables predicted activity in classical language areas as well as the zzso visual word form area, specifically supporting a role for the latter in mapping visual forms onto zzso or acoustic zzso Additional analyses demonstrated that zzso results replicate across experiments and predict reading zzso The zzso approach represents a powerful and extremely flexible new approach for studying reading and language behavior with zzso
