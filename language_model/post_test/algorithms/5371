One of the major challenges in zzso is to understand the function of gene products from their zzso zzso zzso methods are needed for the zzso prediction of the function of proteins from their zzso zzso zzso that identify active sites are important for understanding and zzso the function of zzso Traditional methods exploiting either sequence similarity or structural similarity can be unreliable and cannot be applied to proteins with novel folds or low zzso with other zzso Here, we present a zzso application that combines zzso zzso zzso and pocket geometric information for zzso prediction of zzso zzso zzso features consist of our zzso theoretical microscopic anomalous zzso curve shapes zzso zzso data, enhanced with zzso zzso information from zzso and zzso pocket information from zzso Our zzso input features are zzso with an additional zzso the theoretical buffer zzso With the integration of the three different types of zzso each of which performs admirably on its own, significantly better performance is achieved than that of any of these methods by zzso This combined method achieves zzso zzso and zzso recall of zzso functional zzso at 5, 8, and zzso zzso rates, zzso
