Prevention of zzso following zzso coronary procedures with zzso based zzso sources is currently under clinical trial zzso Systems utilizing fixed length source trains limit the zzso ability to increase the radiation source length as zzso A technique known as zzso zzso is used when the segment of artery requiring radiation is longer than the available fixed length source zzso In this instance, tandem positioning of the fixed length source is used to treat the longer length of zzso The aim of this study was to examine the zzso of the junction region associated with pull back treatments using a commercially available zzso zzso based zzso zzso source zzso zzso profiles were zzso using the zzso Carlo code zzso at zzso distances of zzso zzso and zzso zzso for pull back techniques using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso spaced source zzso zzso at the protocol prescription radius of 2 zzso showed a junction dose elevated zzso above prescription for zzso zzso overlapping source zzso For zzso zzso spaced trains, this figure falls to zzso below prescription zzso In contrast, zzso source trains exhibited only a zzso depression below prescription dose in the junction zzso The reference point dose rate per unit activity of this source was found to be consistent with previous zzso
