This study aims to evaluate changes on cardiac chambers size, induced by zzso zzso During zzso flight, seven subjects underwent zzso zzso zzso at three different gravity zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso and 0 zzso zzso zzso borders were detected applying a zzso zzso procedure based on level set zzso zzso cavity area was zzso frame-by-frame for a whole cardiac cycle during each gravity zzso zzso modifications in zzso area with different gravity were zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso areas were significantly zzso reduced of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, compared to 1 zzso values, while they were increased of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso during 0 zzso zzso area change was zzso of zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso while it remained unchanged at 0 zzso compared with 1 zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso filling due to zzso contraction was increased at 0 zzso of 39 zzso zzso
