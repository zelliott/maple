The development of zzso sequencing technologies has enabled novel methods for detecting structural zzso zzso Current methods are typically based on depth of coverage or zzso mapping zzso However, most of these only report an approximate location for each zzso rather than exact zzso 

We have developed zzso informed split mapping zzso a method that identifies zzso and their precise zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso uses a zzso approach informed by the mapping of zzso reads, hence enabling zzso identification of multiple zzso types, including zzso zzso deletions and tandem zzso Comparisons to previous zzso and simulation experiments illustrate zzso high sensitivity, while zzso zzso of zzso results, including previously zzso zzso indicate an overall precision of zzso
