zzso is a novel, zzso compound that was evaluated in this study for its ability to inhibit A and B strain influenza virus zzso in zzso zzso and influenza virus replication in cell zzso zzso effectively inhibited influenza A zzso zzso and zzso and B strain zzso with inhibitor constant zzso values between zzso and zzso zzso These values were comparable to or lower than the zzso values measured for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso except for the zzso zzso that were found to be the most sensitive to zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity observed with zzso is likely due to its very low rate of zzso from the active site of zzso The half times for zzso of zzso from zzso and zzso zzso influenza virus zzso of 10 to 12 h are significantly slower than the half times measured for zzso zzso zzso to 60 zzso zzso inhibited the replication of several laboratory strains of influenza virus in cell culture with zzso that were comparable or superior to those for zzso zzso and zzso except for the zzso viruses that were found to be two- to fourfold more susceptible to zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibited comparable zzso against a panel of zzso and zzso influenza virus clinical zzso but zzso was found to be significantly more potent than zzso zzso against the B strain zzso The favorable in zzso results relative to other clinically effective agents provide strong support for the further investigation of zzso as a potential therapy for influenza virus zzso
