In our effort to zzso the systems biology of the model zzso zzso coli, we have developed a mathematical model that simulates the zzso regulation for zzso zzso zzso starting from zzso To achieve this goal, we used zzso a zzso language extension that describes zzso mechanisms for the mathematical modeling of zzso zzso These mechanisms are converted by zzso into ordinary differential equations zzso zzso by zzso In this paper, we describe a more flexible model in zzso which zzso the zzso Wyman, zzso zzso model for zzso zzso regulation to allow for multiple zzso zzso and inhibitor binding zzso Furthermore, we have developed a model that describes the behavior of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso This model predicts the partition of zzso activities in the steady state which zzso a way for a more generalized prediction of the behavior of zzso zzso
