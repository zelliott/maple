zzso phase relationship of zzso zzso in zzso pressure condition is still quite zzso Here, we report a theoretical prediction on a previously zzso stable structure of zzso with an unexpected zzso zzso zzso This phase, more stable than the zzso structure, a previously zzso zzso phase, was discovered to stabilize at 640 zzso through a careful structure search by means of zzso zzso density functional zzso over various structure zzso This is the first zzso result of the zzso phase transition to the zzso structure among all dioxide zzso The crystal structure consists of closely packed, fairly regular zzso zzso zzso prisms with a significantly compact zzso Additional investigation further zzso large effects of this phase change in zzso on the stability of zzso and zzso at zzso zzso A zzso phase of zzso breaks down at zzso zzso along an assumed zzso of zzso and yields zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the other hand, directly zzso into zzso and metallic zzso skipping a zzso zzso zzso zzso and temperature phase zzso of zzso zzso and zzso indicate that the zzso zzso could be one of the dominant components in the deep zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso of gas zzso
