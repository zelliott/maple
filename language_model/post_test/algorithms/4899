zzso pattern analysis approaches toward detection of brain regions from zzso data have been gaining attention zzso In this study, we introduce an zzso zzso zzso for detection of zzso in functional zzso zzso data with task relevant zzso In each iteration of the algorithm, a linear programming problem is solved and a sparse weight zzso is subsequently zzso The final weight zzso is the mean of those obtained in all zzso The characteristics of our zzso are as zzso 1) the weight zzso zzso is zzso 2) the magnitude of each entry of the weight zzso represents the significance of its corresponding variable or feature in a zzso or zzso problem; and 3) due to the convergence of this algorithm, a stable weight zzso is zzso To demonstrate the zzso of our zzso and illustrate its application, we apply the zzso to the Pittsburgh Brain zzso zzso Competition 2007 functional zzso zzso for selecting the zzso which are the most relevant to the tasks of the zzso Based on this zzso the aforementioned characteristics of our zzso are zzso and a comparison between our method with the zzso zzso statistical zzso mapping is zzso Using our method, a combination of zzso are selected based on the principle of zzso representation of a zzso Data analysis results in this paper show that this combination of zzso is suitable for decoding tasks and demonstrate the effectiveness of our zzso
