zzso features from zzso gene expression data is a critically important task for monitoring and predicting patients' diseases, or for knowledge discovery in zzso molecular zzso The features need to capture the essential characteristics of the data to be zzso zzso Moreover, the essential features usually lie in small or extremely zzso zzso and it is crucial to find them for knowledge discovery and pattern zzso We present a zzso method for zzso small or even extremely zzso zzso for zzso feature screening and gene expression analysis using sparse zzso zzso After we transform the feature screening problem into a convex zzso problem, we develop an efficient zzso zzso method zzso for solving large-scale zzso The effectiveness of our method is confirmed by our experimental zzso The computer programs will be publicly zzso
