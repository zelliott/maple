zzso cancer is the second most common female cancer zzso The ability to zzso zzso and zzso changes in the zzso is not only useful in the diagnosis of cervical zzso but also important in aiding the design of cost-effective detection systems for use in developing countries that lack well-established screening and diagnostic zzso We assessed the capability of a diffuse zzso zzso technique to identify contrasts in optical zzso that vary with different grades of cervical zzso zzso zzso from normal cervical zzso The technology consists of an optical probe and an instrument (with broadband light source, zzso element, and zzso and a zzso Carlo zzso to extract optical zzso contributions including total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and reduced scattering zzso from the measured zzso Among 38 patients and 89 sites zzso 46 zzso normal sites, 18 zzso 1, and 15 zzso zzso sites were included in the zzso Total zzso was statistically higher in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso compared with normal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas scattering was significantly reduced in zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not significantly altered in zzso zzso compared with normal and zzso zzso The difference in total zzso is likely because of zzso zzso whereas decreased scattering can be attributed to breakdown of collagen network in the cervical zzso
