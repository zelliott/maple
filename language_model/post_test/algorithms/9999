The visibility zzso has been recently introduced as a mapping between time series and complex zzso This procedure allows us to apply methods of complex network theory for characterizing time zzso In this work we present the horizontal visibility algorithm, a zzso simpler and zzso zzso version of our former algorithm, focusing on the mapping of random series zzso of independent zzso distributed random zzso After presenting some properties of the algorithm, we present exact results on the zzso properties of zzso associated with random series, zzso the degree distribution, the zzso zzso and the mean path zzso We show that the horizontal visibility zzso stands as a simple method to discriminate randomness in time series since any random series maps to a graph with an exponential degree distribution of the shape zzso independent of the probability distribution from which the series was zzso zzso visibility zzso with other zzso are related to zzso zzso zzso simulations confirm the accuracy of the zzso for finite zzso In a second part, we show that the method is able to distinguish chaotic series from independent and zzso distributed zzso theory, studying the following situations: zzso zzso zzso chaotic series, zzso zzso noisy chaotic series, even in the presence of large amounts of noise, and zzso zzso chaotic series zzso map zzso without needs for additional techniques such as surrogate data or noise reduction zzso Finally, zzso arguments are given to explain the zzso properties of chaotic series, and several sequences that are zzso to be random are zzso
