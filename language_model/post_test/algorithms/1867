The utility of DNA zzso for identifying representative specimens of the zzso tree zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso We examined the genetic zzso of several zzso suggested in zzso DNA zzso protocols such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a large worldwide sample of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was further assessed in search for a potentially variable and useful zzso The results of the study suggest that the proposed zzso zzso alone or in zzso cannot fully discriminate among species because of the generally low rates of substitution in the zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso zzso was the best performing zzso but genetic zzso discrimination was moderately successful and only resulted in the separation of the samples at the zzso zzso Use of the zzso approach was better than the zzso tree reconstruction method with zzso Kimura's zzso rates of zzso but allowed for the correct identification of only less than half of the species zzso Such rates are substantially lower than the success rate required for a zzso zzso zzso zzso the current zzso zzso are inadequate to fully discriminate zzso zzso Given that a low rate of substitution is common among the zzso zzso of trees, the use of the plant zzso zzso zzso may not be suitable for the safe identification of tree species below a generic or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the nuclear zzso and alternative solutions are proposed and zzso
