In the present work we report, for the first time, a novel difference in the molecular mechanism of the zzso step of zzso reaction between the class I and class II zzso zzso zzso zzso The observed difference is in the mode of zzso attack by the oxygen atom of the zzso group of the zzso zzso acid zzso to the zzso atom of zzso zzso zzso The zzso oxygen atom of the zzso group attacks the zzso atom zzso of zzso in all class I zzso (except zzso investigated, while the anti oxygen atom attacks in the case of class II zzso The class I zzso investigated are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and class II zzso investigated are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The variation of the electron density at bond critical points as a function of the zzso of the attacking oxygen atom measured by the zzso angle zzso zzso zzso proves zzso The result shows that the strength of the interaction of zzso oxygen and zzso is stronger than the interaction with the anti oxygen for class I zzso This indicates that the zzso oxygen is the most probable candidate for the zzso attack in class I zzso The result is further supported by the zzso of the variation of the zzso interaction energies between zzso atom and anti oxygen as well as zzso oxygen in class I and II zzso zzso The difference in mechanism is explained based on the analysis of the zzso potential of the AA and zzso which shows that the relative arrangement of the zzso with respect to the AA is opposite in class I and class II zzso which is correlated with the organization of the active site in respective zzso A comparative study of the reaction mechanisms of the zzso step in a class I zzso zzso zzso zzso and in a class II zzso zzso zzso zzso is carried out by the transition state zzso The atoms in zzso analysis of the interaction between active site zzso or zzso and zzso are carried out in the zzso state and the transition zzso The result shows that the observed novel difference in the mechanism is correlated with the organizations of the active sites of the respective zzso The result has implication in understanding the zzso observed different modes of zzso binding in the two classes of zzso
