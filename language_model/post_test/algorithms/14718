A great deal of work has been done to develop techniques for odor analysis by electronic nose zzso These analyses mostly focus on identifying a particular odor by comparing with a known odor zzso However, in many situations, it would be more practical if each individual zzso could be determined zzso This paper proposes two methods for such odor components analysis for electronic nose zzso First, a zzso neighbor zzso local weighted nearest neighbor zzso zzso is proposed to determine the components of an zzso According to the component analysis, the odor training data is zzso zzso into several groups, each of which is represented by its zzso The examined odor is then classified as the class of the nearest zzso The distance between the examined odor and the zzso is calculated based on a weighting zzso which captures the local structure of each zzso zzso To further determine the concentration of each zzso odor models are built by zzso Then, a weighted and constrained zzso zzso method is proposed to estimate the component zzso zzso were carried out to assess the effectiveness of the proposed zzso The zzso zzso is able to zzso mixed zzso with different mixing ratios, while the zzso method can provide good estimates on component zzso
