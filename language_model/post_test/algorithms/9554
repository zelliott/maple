To zzso and zzso movement patterns correctly can be a difficult zzso Nevertheless, movement analysts are working on it on a daily zzso zzso we have developed and evaluated a method to do the zzso by using contact forces during hopping in a zzso zzso Here, experiments showed that zzso of different subjects on a sliding zzso could be divided into four major zzso These types are zzso zzso zzso zzso positive zzso zzso zzso negative zzso zzso zzso and zzso associated with plateau formation zzso zzso Up until now, an exact determination of these types was not zzso However, the new method helps to approximate those four types with well established mathematical zzso With this approach, the measured zzso will be reproduced by particular zzso zzso the zzso are subjected to a zzso The result is a three-dimensional zzso which allows the zzso of the actual zzso on the one of the four zzso
