The increasing growth in generation of electronic waste zzso motivates a variety of waste reduction zzso Printed circuit boards zzso are an important zzso of the overall zzso stream due to the high value of the materials contained within them and potential zzso This work explores several environmental and economic metrics for zzso the recovery of materials from zzso zzso A weighted sum model is used to investigate the zzso among economic value, energy saving zzso and zzso zzso show that given equal weights for these three zzso criteria gold has the highest recovery priority, followed by copper, zzso aluminum, tin, lead, zzso nickel, zzso and zzso However, recovery priority will change significantly due to variation in the composition of zzso choice of ranking zzso and weighting factors when scoring multiple zzso These results can be used by waste management zzso to zzso the value and environmental savings potential for recycling technology development and zzso They can also be extended by zzso to inform possible penalties for zzso zzso or exporting to the informal recycling zzso The importance of weighting factors when examining recovery zzso particularly for policies regarding zzso collection and recycling are explored zzso
