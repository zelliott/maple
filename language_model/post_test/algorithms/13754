We reconstructed three-dimensional zzso surface images from data from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso in 29 patients with Parkinson's disease, 16 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 11 normal control zzso In patients with zzso Parkinson's disease, zzso defects were frequently found in the zzso cortical region at a threshold value of zzso In zzso Parkinson's disease patients, zzso defects were frequently noted at threshold of zzso and were more marked in the bilateral zzso and zzso zzso In Alzheimer's disease, zzso defects were similar to those found in zzso Parkinson's zzso These results suggest that zzso in Parkinson's disease is related to the zzso reduction of the zzso cortex, and may support the view that Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease overlap in some zzso A zzso display of an zzso brain zzso may be useful for detecting cortical zzso in patients with zzso or cognitive zzso
