In this paper, an zzso cell image zzso zzso using zzso zzso transform magnitude zzso as class features is zzso The cluster zzso of the magnitude zzso are obtained by the zzso zzso method and used as representative class zzso The initial image zzso zzso only those image zzso whose surrounding closely matches a class zzso The subsequent procedure zzso zzso the remaining image zzso by combining their spatial distance from the regions already segmented and the similarities between their corresponding magnitude zzso and the cluster zzso Experimental results of the proposed zzso for zzso real cell images are zzso
