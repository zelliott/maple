We have obtained relationships for frequency shifts resulting from the interference of spectral components for the magnitude mode zzso zzso The approximation of a weak zzso of well resolved zzso has been zzso Both the low- and zzso limits for zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso operation have been zzso We have found that the shifts can be either negative or positive, depending on the initial phase and/or the choice of the zzso zzso The magnitude of shifts generally does not exceed the peak zzso In the approximation of small zzso the shifts produced by multiple zzso are zzso We have compared theoretical results with experimental shifts for zzso clusters of multiply charged zzso Up to 1 zzso frequency variations were zzso observed for the insulin zzso charge state, consistent with theoretical zzso The peak interference is of particular significance in the case of zzso mass zzso having a large number of zzso and covering a considerable dynamic range zzso relative zzso We conclude that the common mass measurement procedure based on the location of the magnitude mode zzso of well resolved zzso can result in systematic mass measurement zzso The relationships obtained provide corrections for the frequency shifts and thus improve the mass measurement zzso
