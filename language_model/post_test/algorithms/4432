Recent advances in high zzso experiments and zzso via published literature have provided a wealth of interaction maps of several zzso networks, including zzso zzso and zzso interaction zzso The architecture of these molecular networks reveals important principles of cellular organization and molecular zzso zzso such networks, zzso discovering dense regions in the network, is an important way to identify protein complexes and functional zzso This task has been formulated as the problem of finding heavy zzso the zzso zzso Problem zzso which itself is zzso However, any method based on the zzso requires the zzso k and an exact solution of zzso may still end up as a zzso heavy zzso thus reducing its zzso in analyzing large scale biological zzso We proposed a new zzso called the zzso and two zzso systems to approximate its zzso In addition, a novel zzso called the Standard zzso and Mean zzso zzso is proposed for use in zzso heavy zzso to automate the discovery by setting a fixed zzso zzso results on both the simulated zzso and biological networks have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of our zzso
