zzso excel at zzso information about zzso scenes from their zzso images projected on the zzso using a wide range of depth zzso One example of such zzso is the tendency for observers to perceive lighter image regions as zzso This zzso behavior could have an ecological basis because zzso regions tend to be lighter in natural zzso zzso Here, we show that an analogous association exists between the relative zzso and zzso disparity preferences of zzso in zzso primary visual zzso The joint coding of relative zzso and zzso disparity at the zzso population level may be an integral part of the neural mechanisms for zzso zzso of depth from zzso
