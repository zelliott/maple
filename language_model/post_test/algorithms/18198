A fuzzy neural network zzso was trained on a zzso of 177 zzso zzso zzso with zzso measured zzso zzso A set of zzso was selected to build zzso quantitative zzso zzso A genetic zzso zzso was implemented to zzso the architecture of the fuzzy neural network used to predict biological activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso methods were used to apply feature selection zzso to this zzso zzso obtained on an external test set of 21 zzso with and without feature selection, were zzso zzso feature selection to the zzso resulted in a more accurate prediction of biological zzso zzso zzso rules were extracted from the zzso zzso In the future the developed models are expected to be useful in the rational design of novel zzso zzso for zzso zzso
