The aim of this paper is to investigate the acoustic performance of sound absorbing materials through a zzso wave based prediction zzso The final goal of this work is to get insight into the acoustic behavior of a combination of sound absorbing zzso In order to address a wide frequency range, a model based on the zzso approach is zzso In this approach, the dynamic field variables are expressed in terms of global wave function expansions that satisfy the governing dynamic equations zzso zzso approximation errors are associated only with the boundary conditions of the considered zzso This results in a zzso efficient zzso The main advantage of this method is the fact that the sound absorbing patches do not have to be locally zzso In this article, the wave based method is described and zzso validated for the case of normal zzso sound zzso identification in a standing wave zzso zzso the method is applied to simulate some interesting zzso of absorbing zzso
