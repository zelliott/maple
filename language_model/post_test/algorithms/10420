The traditional approach to functional image analysis models images as zzso of raw zzso intensity zzso Although such a representation is widely zzso and heavily entrenched both within zzso and in the wider data mining community, the strong interactions among space, time, and zzso modes such as subject and experimental task inherent in functional imaging yield a zzso with zzso structure, which zzso models are incapable of zzso zzso across all of these modes of data zzso requires a zzso model capable of representing relationships between all modes of the data in zzso We thus propose to model functional zzso data using zzso which are zzso zzso of zzso equivalent to zzso zzso or data zzso However, several unique challenges exist in the zzso analysis of functional medical zzso zzso zzso models are incapable of exploiting zzso locality patterns, standard zzso analysis techniques exhibit poor efficiency, and zzso of zzso and zzso modes of data are very often present in zzso zzso zzso the problem of image zzso as a form of zzso zzso Analysis and using the zzso zzso as a zzso we propose a comprehensive hybrid zzso and zzso framework for zzso concept discovery, and zzso of functional medical images which successfully addresses these zzso Our approach reduced zzso and zzso size on a zzso finger opposition motor task zzso zzso by up to zzso while exhibiting improved zzso zzso relative to standard zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our zzso technique was capable of automatically zzso between the frontal areas of the brain responsible for zzso zzso and the motor regions responsible for executing the motor task, in contrast to a widely used zzso analysis program, zzso which only detected the latter zzso Furthermore, our approach discovered zzso concepts suggestive of subject zzso nearly zzso faster than standard zzso These results suggest that a zzso model is an integral component to accurate zzso functional zzso
