The purpose of this report is to describe our recent experience using a zzso paddle zzso free zzso zzso for reconstruction of the zzso anterior zzso zzso and to present a zzso zzso based on the extent of lip and mental skin zzso 

zzso review of 10 consecutive patients with zzso anterior zzso zzso 

Outcomes that were examined included methods of reconstruction based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rate, and donor site zzso 

Seven patients were reconstructed with a zzso For lip zzso two patients were also zzso reconstructed with zzso or lip advancement zzso Three patients were reconstructed with both a zzso free zzso and a second free zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 2 zzso thigh zzso The zzso dimensions of the zzso were as great as 15 zzso None of the patients developed a zzso All free tissue transfers were zzso One patient developed partial loss of the zzso skin paddle used for zzso skin zzso 

zzso is a safe and reliable way to reconstruct an anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso for using a zzso are 1) a zzso zzso that lies at or below the plane of the reconstructed zzso 2) a zzso zzso of the oral zzso and zzso zzso that does not exceed 15 zzso (the approximate distance from the zzso to the anterior zzso and 3) a lip zzso that, if present, can be reconstructed with local zzso
