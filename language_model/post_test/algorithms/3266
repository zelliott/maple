In this paper, the problem of generalized outer synchronization between two completely different complex zzso networks is zzso With a zzso control zzso a sufficient criterion for this generalized outer synchronization is derived based on zzso zzso Two zzso are also zzso which contains the situations studied in two lately published papers as special zzso zzso simulations further demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the theoretical zzso
