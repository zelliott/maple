zzso zzso biomass zzso was found to be most potent zzso for the removal of copper from its zzso zzso zzso zzso was noted within pH range zzso and the process follows zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso process is very fast initially and reaches equilibrium very quickly following zzso second order rate zzso zzso zzso and zzso groups present on the cell surface of the biomass are involved in chemical interaction with copper zzso as revealed from zzso and zzso study and also by blocking zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso revealed the formation of metal zzso on the biomass surface due to copper zzso zzso surface modification indicates the major involvement of zzso functional group for the binding probably through the zzso zzso zzso can be zzso from the zzso biomass with zzso zzso zzso
