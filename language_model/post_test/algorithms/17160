Crawford zzso cells are often used to expose cell cultures or small animals in order to study the effects caused by zzso zzso They are zzso zzso zzso that provide a rather homogeneous field distribution in a large area around its center, corresponding approximately to zzso zzso However, a number of conditions must be met if such zzso cells are intended to be used for in zzso zzso For instance, poor interaction with the incident field must be maintained to avoid significant field disturbances in the zzso zzso This is best achieved with zzso zzso when the zzso zzso is normal to the investigated cell layer lining the bottom of a synthetic zzso zzso In addition, zzso provides the most homogeneous field distribution of all zzso within the entire layer of zzso In this paper, we present a detailed zzso assessment for 60 and 100 zzso zzso dishes as well as for a zzso zzso plate at zzso zzso The zzso was performed by using zzso zzso The modeling and the zzso are validated by a second zzso technique and by experimental zzso For thin liquid zzso an approximation formula is provided with which the induced field strength for many other experiments conducted in zzso dishes can be assessed zzso
