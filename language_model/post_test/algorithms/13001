The so-called zzso zzso are those proteins in a zzso interaction network system that have remarkably higher interaction relations (or zzso than the zzso zzso the information of hub proteins can provide very useful insights for selecting or zzso targets during drug zzso In this paper, by combining the zzso method with the zzso spectrum analysis and zzso algorithm, a novel simulator for identifying the hub proteins from membrane protein interaction networks is zzso As a demonstration of using the simulator, two hub membrane zzso zzso and zzso were identified from a complicated network system consisting of 1500 membrane zzso Meanwhile, along with the two identified hub zzso their molecular functions, biological zzso and cellular components were also zzso It is anticipated that the zzso may become a very useful tool for system biology and drug development, particularly in deciphering unknown protein functions, determining protein complexes, and in identifying the key targets from a complicated disease zzso
