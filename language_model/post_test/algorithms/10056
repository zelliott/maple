A common method to eliminate unwanted power line interference in zzso laboratories where sensitive electronic signals are measured is with a notch zzso However a zzso notch filter cannot remove all power line noise contamination since inherent frequency and phase variations exist in the zzso zzso One way to overcome the limitations of a zzso notch filter is with zzso noise zzso zzso noise cancellation is an active approach that uses feedback to create a signal that when summed with the contaminated signal zzso interferes with the noise component leaving only the desired zzso We have implemented an zzso least mean square zzso noise cancellation zzso on a low-cost 16 zzso zzso zzso to zzso cancel periodic 60 zzso zzso In our zzso we achieve between 20 and 25 zzso of cancellation of the fundamental 60 zzso noise zzso
