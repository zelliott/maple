Many zzso zzso procedures rely on fast imaging sequences for providing images in real-time with a precise relation between the target position in the image and its true zzso zzso imaging zzso methods are very fast but prone to geometric zzso Here, we propose a correction method designed for real-time conditions, adapting existing approaches based on dual zzso acquisition with varying echo zzso The method is demonstrated with zzso for guiding zzso zzso The proposed approach zzso a small penalty in acquisition speed but adds negligible zzso to data processing, an important element for interventions of mobile zzso
