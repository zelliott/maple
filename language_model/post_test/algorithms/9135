zzso zzso to zzso are processed in a zzso manner, with either zzso or resonant response zzso These types of filtering play a key role in the zzso information flow in zzso zzso While the generation of resonance by specific zzso zzso is well investigated, less attention has been paid to the spatial distribution of the zzso zzso across a zzso In zzso zzso - one of the major zzso zzso in the zzso brain - a steep zzso of zzso zzso with a zzso increase towards zzso zzso has been demonstrated zzso Because the zzso trees of these cells are large, spatial zzso of resonant properties can be zzso Here, we use mathematical descriptions of zzso extended zzso to investigate the consequences of such a zzso zzso zzso of zzso for signal zzso While zzso with short zzso do not exhibit a pronounced zzso of zzso zzso the filter properties of zzso and zzso are similar, we find that zzso with longer zzso zzso see zzso space zzso can show distinct filtering of zzso and zzso zzso due to zzso zzso Moreover, we show that for such zzso experimental zzso as resonant versus zzso can be misleading when based on zzso recordings, because for these zzso a zzso resonance could easily be zzso when using zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso zzso zzso caused by zzso resonance can zzso to the zzso where they can be recorded, hence contrasting with the zzso filtering at the zzso We conclude that zzso zzso of active zzso can zzso differential filtering of synaptic input in zzso with zzso extended zzso like zzso zzso bearing relevance for the zzso targeting of synaptic input pathways to these zzso
