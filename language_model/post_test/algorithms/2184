This paper reviews recent developments by the zzso groups for the study of anatomical shape in the emerging new discipline of zzso zzso zzso representations of anatomical variation for zzso anatomy are zzso restricted to the assumption of small zzso The generation of zzso operators for zzso measures of anatomical variation on zzso zzso is formulated as an empirical zzso zzso of brains are mapped to common coordinate systems, from which template coordinate systems are constructed which are closest to the population of zzso in a minimum distance zzso Variation of several one-, two- and three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso surfaces and brain volumes are examined via zzso measures with mean and zzso estimated directly from maps of templates to zzso zzso are presented for zzso the zzso of zzso fields from a family of zzso generated zzso posed as generalized spectrum zzso zzso over the zzso zzso zzso is made zzso analogous to zzso zzso by introducing small deformation linear operators for constraining the spectrum of the zzso
