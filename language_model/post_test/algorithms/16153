Over the past decade, a number of researchers in systems biology have sought to relate the function of biological systems to their zzso zzso of the most important players and the zzso interactions between zzso Both for large networks (in which statistical analysis is often framed in terms of the abundance of repeated small zzso and for small networks which can be analyzed in greater detail (or even zzso in zzso and subjected to zzso revealing the relationship between the zzso of small zzso and their biological function has been a central zzso We here seek to pose this revelation as a statistical task, illustrated using a particular setup which has been constructed zzso and for which zzso models of zzso regulation have been studied zzso The question zzso does function follow zzso is here zzso by identifying which zzso attributes correlate with the diverse possible zzso tasks which a zzso regulatory network can zzso The resulting method reveals one zzso relationship which had earlier been predicted based on zzso results, and reveals a second for which we can provide an zzso zzso zzso source code is distributed via zzso
