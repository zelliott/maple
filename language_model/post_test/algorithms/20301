In the zzso human breast cancer cell line, several patterns of zzso networks are observed, depending on the zzso zzso Our hypothesis is that architectural variations of zzso networks depend on local tensions or forces appearing spontaneously in the zzso The aim of this work was to discriminate between the different patterns and to zzso these zzso 

Image analysis procedures were developed to extract zzso filament networks zzso by zzso and zzso zzso Two methods were used to segment sets of zzso zzso The first, the zzso based on classical methods of mathematical zzso takes into account global network zzso The second, the zzso zzso is meant to account for individual element zzso These methods and their combination allow the zzso of several features at two levels of zzso global zzso zzso and local zzso zzso 

Variations in zzso networks are characterized by their zzso density, mesh structure, and filament zzso The connectivity and the density of a network describe its location in a local zzso zone or in a zzso zzso The mesh structure characterizes the zzso zzso of the zzso Moreover, the filament shape reflects the zzso zzso and the occurrence of a zzso zzso 

These features permitted the zzso of differences within the network patterns and within the specific filament shapes according to the zzso zzso Further experiments on cells submitted to external forces will test the hypothesis that the architectural variations of intermediate filaments reflect zzso zzso
