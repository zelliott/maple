The zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso may exist in an oxidized state and should be converted into reduced zzso for biological zzso Such zzso changes can be efficiently achieved by zzso electron transfer zzso through a series of aromatic zzso in the zzso Here, we report our complete characterization of zzso dynamics of zzso with zzso zzso With various zzso zzso we identified all possible electron donors in the zzso and determined their zzso zzso The excited zzso behaves as an electron sink to draw electron flow from a series of zzso aromatic molecules in three distinct layers from the active site in the center to the protein zzso The dominant electron flow follows the zzso zzso zzso in a hopping zzso across the layers with multiple zzso zzso These zzso dynamics occur zzso in less than 150 zzso and are strongly coupled with local protein and zzso zzso The reverse electron flow from the zzso is slow and in the zzso range to ensure high reduction zzso With 12 zzso determined elementary zzso steps and 6 zzso reaction pairs, the zzso exhibits a distinct zzso zzso along the same aromatic zzso with favorable reorganization energies to drive a highly zzso electron flow toward the zzso center from the protein zzso
