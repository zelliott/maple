zzso is an zzso able to scan multiple zzso or zzso in order to identify putative zzso zzso regions, and align these regions using genes as zzso The zzso zzso zzso an adjusted zzso zzso for detection of zzso and zzso that extends the original software by incorporating 14 utility programs for zzso of results and additional downstream zzso zzso of zzso to several zzso plant zzso and gene families are shown as zzso zzso can be used to effectively analyze zzso structural changes, and reveal the history of gene family expansions that might contribute to the adaptation of lineages and zzso An integrated view of various modes of gene zzso can supplement the traditional gene tree analysis in specific zzso The source code and documentation of zzso are freely available at zzso
