zzso blood flow zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is technically difficult because of the high zzso between regions of interest, especially due to the long zzso zzso We sought to develop a new zzso to reduce the zzso in zzso blood activity curves, using zzso weighted zzso zzso 

Fourteen volunteers underwent imaging with both zzso zzso zzso and zzso PET at rest and during pharmacological zzso Whole left zzso zzso zzso zzso was estimated using a zzso model, including a zzso zzso correction to estimate the corresponding blood input function zzso Regional zzso values were calculated using this uniform global input function, which zzso equations and enables robust zzso of zzso To assess the zzso of the modified algorithm, zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was compared with a previously established zzso 

Whole zzso correlation of zzso zzso with zzso zzso was better zzso zzso zzso with the modified zzso correction method zzso zzso zzso vs r zzso zzso The modified method also yielded significantly improved zzso zzso of regional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus the established method zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A uniform global input function can suppress zzso zzso into the zzso blood input function, resulting in improved precision for zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso
