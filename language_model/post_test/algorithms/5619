zzso and protein lateral mobility is essential for biological zzso Our theoretical understanding of this mobility can be traced to the seminal work of zzso and zzso who predicted a zzso dependence of the protein diffusion zzso zzso on the inverse of the size of the protein and zzso on the zzso zzso for zzso of finite size zzso zzso zzso M (1975) zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso Although the experimental proof of the first prediction is a matter of debate, the second has not previously been thought to be zzso zzso Here, we construct just such a zzso confined membrane by forming zzso zzso zzso of controlled zzso connected to giant zzso We followed the diffusion of individual molecules in the zzso membrane using single particle tracking of quantum dots coupled to lipids or zzso zzso channels zzso while changing the membrane tube radius from approximately 250 to 10 zzso We found that both zzso and protein diffusion was slower in zzso zzso with smaller zzso The protein diffusion zzso decreased as much as zzso compared to diffusion on the effectively flat membrane of the giant zzso Both zzso and protein diffusion data are consistent with the predictions of a zzso theory that extends the work of zzso and zzso to zzso zzso This study therefore provides strong experimental support for the ubiquitous zzso theory and zzso the role of membrane geometry and size in regulating lateral zzso
