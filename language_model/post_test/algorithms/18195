With the popularity of DNA zzso technology, multiple groups of researchers have studied the gene expression of similar biological zzso Different methods have been developed to integrate the results from various zzso studies, though most of them rely on zzso zzso such as the zzso based, zzso model, or zzso model zzso However, often the sample size for each individual zzso experiment is zzso zzso in this paper we present a zzso zzso approach for combining data from independent zzso studies, and illustrate its application on two independent zzso zzso studies that compared the gene expression of zzso from kidney transplant recipients with chronic zzso zzso zzso to those with normal functioning zzso 

The simulation study comparing the zzso zzso approach to a commonly used zzso based approach shows that the zzso approach has better sensitivity and zzso For the application on the two CAN studies, we identified 309 distinct genes that expressed differently in zzso By applying zzso exact test to identify enriched zzso pathways among those genes called zzso zzso we found 6 zzso pathways to be zzso among the identified zzso We used the expression zzso of the identified genes as zzso to predict the class labels for 6 additional biopsy samples, and the predicted results all zzso to their pathologist diagnosed class zzso 

We present a new approach for combining data from multiple independent zzso zzso This approach is zzso and does not rely on any zzso zzso The rationale behind the approach is logically intuitive and can be easily understood by researchers not having advanced training in zzso Some of the identified genes and pathways have been reported to be relevant to zzso zzso Further study on the identified genes and pathways may lead to better understanding of CAN at the molecular zzso
