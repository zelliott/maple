We consider the problem of zzso detailed zzso structure from a single still image of an zzso zzso Our goal is to create zzso models that are both zzso accurate as well as visually zzso For each small homogeneous patch in the image, we use a zzso Random Field zzso to zzso a set of zzso zzso that capture both the zzso location and zzso orientation of the zzso The zzso trained via supervised learning, models both image depth cues as well as the relationships between different parts of the zzso Other than assuming that the environment is made up of a number of small planes, our model makes no explicit assumptions about the structure of the scene; this enables the zzso to capture much more detailed zzso structure than does prior art and also give a much richer experience in the zzso zzso created using zzso zzso even for scenes with significant zzso zzso Using this approach, we have created zzso correct zzso models for zzso percent of 588 images downloaded from the zzso We have also extended our model to produce large-scale zzso models from a few zzso
