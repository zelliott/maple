zzso ultrasound contrast agents have aroused attention for their significant promise in zzso zzso imaging, targeted therapy and echo particle imaging zzso However, zzso acoustic properties of zzso zzso gas bubbles for zzso applications are still not clearly zzso In this paper, zzso acoustic zzso characteristics from zzso bubbles were examined using a zzso zzso The modified zzso equation incorporating zzso acoustic radiation, zzso effects and zzso shell was used to study single bubble zzso Further, a size integration method, shown previously to be useful in prediction of zzso zzso from groups of bubbles, was applied to zzso response from a bubble zzso We show that bubbles with zzso zzso zzso produce significant zzso and zzso components of the zzso spectrum, while smaller bubbles zzso zzso provide substantial second harmonic zzso Additionally, zzso bubbles zzso zzso produce very low zzso zzso and thus may not be useful with the use of current ultrasound zzso zzso optimal ultrasound driving pressures and bubbles size ranges for zzso zzso and zzso signals showed that zzso and zzso mode zzso imaging methods may be potentially competitive for larger size bubbles zzso zzso in providing proper zzso signal zzso
