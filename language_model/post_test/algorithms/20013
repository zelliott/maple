To develop a tumor growth zzso model for adult diffuse zzso zzso zzso able to describe tumor size evolution in patients treated with chemotherapy or zzso 

Using zzso mean tumor diameter zzso data from 21 patients treated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso chemotherapy, we formulated a model consisting of a system of differential zzso incorporating zzso and zzso parameters that reflect the response of zzso and zzso tumor tissue to zzso The model was then applied to the analysis of zzso tumor size data in 24 patients treated with zzso zzso zzso chemotherapy and in 25 patients treated with zzso zzso 

The model successfully described the zzso dynamics of zzso before, zzso and after zzso zzso Using the same model structure, we were also able to successfully describe the zzso dynamics in zzso patients treated with zzso chemotherapy or zzso zzso parameters were found to be consistent across the three treatment zzso The model is robust to sensitivity analysis, and preliminary results suggest that it can predict treatment response on the basis of zzso tumor size zzso 

Using zzso data, we propose a tumor growth zzso model able to describe zzso tumor size evolution in patients treated with chemotherapy or zzso In the future, this model might be used to predict treatment efficacy in zzso patients and could constitute a rational tool to conceive more effective chemotherapy zzso
