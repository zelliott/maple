zzso zzso zzso of zzso factor zzso occupancy have emerged as a powerful, zzso method to understand zzso regulation, especially on a global zzso This has led to great interest in the underlying zzso mechanisms that direct zzso zzso with the ultimate goal of zzso predicting a zzso occupancy profile in any cellular zzso In this study, we examined the influence of various potential zzso of zzso binding on a much larger scale than previously zzso We used a zzso model of zzso zzso called zzso to analyze 45 zzso data sets from zzso embryonic zzso We built a zzso framework that compares a baseline model, based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso to more complex models where binding by secondary zzso is hypothesized to influence the primary zzso zzso Candidates interacting zzso were chosen based on zzso expression data from the time point of the zzso zzso We found widespread evidence of both cooperative and zzso effects by secondary zzso and explicitly zzso these zzso We were able to identify multiple classes of zzso including zzso long-range interactions between primary and secondary motifs zzso by zzso zzso suggestive of indirect effects such as zzso zzso zzso short-range interactions with specific zzso spacing zzso suggestive of direct physical zzso and zzso overlapping binding sites suggesting competitive zzso Furthermore, by factoring out the previously reported strong correlation between zzso occupancy and DNA accessibility, we were able to categorize the effects into those that are likely to be zzso by the secondary zzso effect on local accessibility and those that zzso zzso zzso Finally, we conducted in zzso pull-down zzso to test zzso predictions of short-range cooperative zzso and found that seven of the eight zzso pairs tested physically interact and that some of these interactions mediate cooperative binding to zzso
