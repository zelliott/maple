The conventional wisdom is that certain classes of zzso peptides have specific structural features that zzso their particular zzso zzso predictions of zzso have focused on particular subgroups, such as zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso peptides may share more general features, and assessed this by contrasting the zzso power of existing zzso zzso as well as a novel general zzso zzso across different classes of zzso observed that existing zzso zzso had reasonable zzso power to identify peptides of certain other classes zzso toxin and zzso zzso We trained two general zzso of zzso zzso one focused on short peptides zzso zzso zzso and one focused on long peptides zzso 20 zzso zzso These general zzso had performance that was typically as good as, or better than, that of specific zzso We noted some striking differences in the features of short zzso and long zzso predictions, in particular, high scoring short peptides zzso zzso This is consistent with the hypothesis that short and long peptides have different functional constraints, perhaps reflecting the difficulty for typical short peptides in supporting independent zzso zzso conclude that there are general shared features of zzso peptides across different functional classes, indicating that zzso prediction may accelerate the discovery of novel zzso peptides and aid in the improved design of existing zzso across many functional zzso An zzso of the zzso method, zzso may be used to identify among a set of peptides those that may be more likely to be zzso
