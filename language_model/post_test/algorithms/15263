Although vascular smooth muscle cells zzso are pivotal in physiology and pathology, there is a lack of detailed zzso data on these zzso The objective of this study was to determine dimensions zzso and zzso and orientation of zzso coronary zzso and to develop a zzso zzso model of active zzso The dimensions, spatial aspect ratio and orientation angle of zzso measured at zzso state were found to follow continuous normal (or zzso zzso zzso The zzso aligned off zzso direction of blood vessels with symmetrical polar angles zzso zzso zzso and the local zzso deformation was zzso with zzso zzso A zzso active zzso model was developed to predict the zzso zzso of coronary media, based on experimental zzso of geometrical and deformation features of zzso The results revealed that the zzso active response of blood vessels is associated with zzso contraction as well as zzso zzso zzso The present zzso database is essential for developing accurate structural models and is seminal for understanding the zzso of muscular zzso
