A zzso smoothing model is developed to zzso describe the smoothing action of polishing tools that use zzso zzso These materials flow to conform to the zzso shape of the zzso yet behave as a rigid solid for short duration caused by tool motion over surface zzso The smoothing effect naturally zzso the zzso frequency errors on the zzso while a large polishing lap still removes large scale errors effectively in a short zzso zzso the smoothing effect allows improvements in efficiency for finishing large precision zzso We define zzso smoothing factor zzso which can be described with two zzso A series of experiments using a conventional pitch tool and the rigid zzso zzso lap was performed and compared to verify the zzso smoothing zzso The linear trend of the zzso function was clearly zzso Also, the limiting minimum ripple magnitude zzso from the smoothing actions and zzso function slope change due to the total zzso zzso of the whole tool were zzso These data were successfully fit using the zzso smoothing zzso
