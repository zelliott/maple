A new molecular mathematical model is developed by considering the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso the process of zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso in liver, and the dynamics of the insulin signaling zzso The new model can zzso reproduce the experimental zzso and insulin zzso It also enables us to use the zzso criterion about the existence of periodic orbits of a two-dimensional zzso system to zzso predict that the zzso of zzso and insulin are not caused by liver, instead they would be caused by the mechanism of insulin zzso from pancreatic beta zzso zzso it enables us to conduct a zzso sensitivity zzso The analysis shows that both zzso and insulin are most sensitive to the rate constant for conversion of zzso to zzso the zzso factor modulating the rate constant for conversion of zzso to zzso the zzso factor that zzso insulin zzso zzso rate, and the maximum zzso of zzso Moreover, the sensitivity analysis predicts that an increase of the apparent zzso of zzso a combination of elevated zzso rate of zzso to the plasma membrane and an extended duration of zzso on the plasma zzso will result in a decrease in the needs of plasma zzso On the other hand, an increase of the zzso zzso rate results in an elevated demand of insulin to stimulate the zzso of zzso from the zzso store to the plasma zzso
