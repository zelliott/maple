The problem of determining zzso from zzso has gained considerable prominence in the research zzso Here the focus is on determining sets of zzso values on individual zzso since such information captures the genetic causes of zzso The most efficient zzso tool for zzso is based on perfect zzso zzso A drawback of this method is that it cannot be applied in situations when the data contains zzso (multiple zzso of the same zzso or zzso Recently, Song et zzso ( 2005 ) studied the two zzso zzso via imperfect zzso with a single zzso and via zzso networks with one zzso In Gupta et zzso ( 2010 ), we have shown that the zzso via zzso networks is zzso even if we restrict to the case when every zzso contains at most 3 zzso We present a zzso zzso for zzso via zzso networks with simple zzso (each having two zzso for zzso zzso which satisfy a natural condition which is implied by presence of at least one 1 in each column that contains a zzso In the end, we give the experimental results comparing our zzso with zzso on simulated zzso
