zzso zzso of the zzso wave propagation is important for zzso Heath Monitoring and System zzso zzso In order to develop intelligent and zzso structures with embedded damage detector and zzso mechanisms, detailed understanding of scattered wave fields due to anomaly in the structure is inevitably zzso A detailed understanding of the problem demands a good zzso of the wave propagation in the problem geometry in virtual zzso zzso efficient zzso zzso or zzso zzso techniques are zzso In recent years a zzso zzso technique called zzso Point zzso zzso zzso is being used for zzso various zzso zzso and electromagnetic wave field zzso In the conventional zzso approach point sources are placed along the zzso faces, problem boundaries and zzso to model incident and scattered zzso Every point source zzso energy in all directions zzso zzso strengths of these 360 degrees radiation sources are obtained by satisfying interface and boundary conditions of the zzso In conventional zzso zzso approach it is assumed that the shadow zone does not require any special zzso 360 degrees zzso point sources should be capable of properly zzso shadow zones because all boundary and interface conditions are zzso In this paper it is investigated how good this assumption is by introducing the zzso zzso concept at the point source level and comparing the results generated by the conventional zzso and by this modified approach where the conventional 360 degrees radiation point sources are replaced by the Controlled Space zzso zzso zzso
