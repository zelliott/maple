This paper explores relationships between classical and zzso measures of graph (or zzso zzso Classical measures are based on zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso measures, on the other hand, are constructed by using information functions to assign probabilities to the zzso The zzso established in this paper relating classical and zzso measures lay a foundation for systematic zzso of zzso measures of graph zzso
