A new light zzso scheme to increase imaging depth in zzso zzso imaging was designed and evaluated by in zzso simulations and tested by in zzso zzso A relatively large portion of the light energy shining into the body of a human reflects off the skin zzso Collecting the reflected light and zzso it onto skin surfaces will increase the effective input energy, resulting in an increase of light penetration depth for the same light zzso Its performance in PA imaging was evaluated using a finite element zzso zzso simulation model composed of four zzso In the in zzso experiments with the light catcher, PA image of multiple targets at different locations exhibited an enhancement both in uniformity and in depth of the light zzso
