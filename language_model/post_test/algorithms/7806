We zzso sequential zzso zzso zzso for populations with demographic zzso for a bottleneck model, a zzso model, and for a zzso model with zzso The sequential zzso zzso method is an approximation to the zzso suggested by zzso and zzso and by zzso and zzso Within this zzso we zzso for two individuals randomly sampled from the population, the correlation between times to the most recent common zzso and the linkage probability corresponding to two different zzso with zzso rate R between zzso These quantities zzso the linkage between the two zzso in zzso We find that the sequential zzso zzso method zzso the zzso well in general in models with demographic zzso An exception is the case where individuals are sampled from populations separated by reduced gene zzso In this situation, the correlations may be significantly zzso We explain why this is the zzso
