This paper presents the zzso under a minimal set of zzso of a general expression for the zzso fractional modification of an zzso protein involved in four different schemes of zzso zzso cascade zzso From this general expression we zzso as particular cases, other, simpler expressions by applying additional assumptions and which have, therefore, a smaller range of zzso Some of these particular expressions coincide with those already obtained in previous contributions on zzso zzso We discuss the relationships between the kinetic parameters and the zzso needed for the zzso of the additional zzso The goodness of the analysis was tested by reference to the shape in the zzso of the simulated time progress zzso obtained by zzso zzso
