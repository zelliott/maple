The structural analysis of protein zzso binding sites can provide information relevant for assigning functions to unknown zzso to guide the drug discovery process and to zzso relations among distant protein zzso Previous approaches to the comparative analysis of binding pockets have usually been focused either on the zzso or the protein zzso Even though several useful observations have been made with these approaches they both have zzso In the former case the analysis is restricted to binding pockets interacting with similar zzso while in the latter it is difficult to systematically check whether the observed structural similarities have a functional zzso 

Here we propose a novel methodology that takes into account the structure of both the binding pocket and the zzso We first look for local similarities in a set of binding pockets and then check whether the bound zzso even if completely different, share a common zzso that can account for the presence of the structural zzso Thanks to this method we can identify structural motifs whose functional significance is explained by the presence of shared features in the interacting zzso 

The application of this method to a large zzso of binding pockets allows the identification of recurring protein motifs that bind specific zzso fragments, even in the context of molecules with a different overall zzso In addition some of these motifs are present in a high number of zzso unrelated zzso
