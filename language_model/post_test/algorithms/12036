This study was undertaken to develop and test a zzso zzso zzso for real-time detection of P waves and zzso R waves zzso in zzso patient zzso zzso zzso event discrimination in right zzso zzso has been a problem resulting in improper zzso sensing in zzso zzso potentially requiring clinical evaluation and device zzso A zzso zzso zzso was first evaluated with zzso recorded from 25 dual chamber zzso implant zzso A digital signal processing zzso system was designed to implement the zzso and test real-time zzso In the second phase, the zzso zzso was evaluated in 13 zzso zzso and zzso zzso were processed in real-time following zzso training performed in the first few seconds for each zzso zzso were later manually zzso for comparative zzso The sensitivity for zzso detection in the zzso zzso during zzso analysis was zzso zzso zzso and the positive zzso value was zzso zzso zzso zzso P wave detection using a zzso system had a sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso and a positive zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso detection had a sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso and a positive zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso tested can accurately detect both P waves and zzso in right atrium zzso Advanced signal processing techniques can be applied to zzso detection and may eventually improve zzso reduce zzso interventions, and improve zzso and bipolar lead zzso
