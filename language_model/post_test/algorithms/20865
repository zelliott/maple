zzso zzso have been considered as attractive drug targets for zzso therapy due to the correlation of their zzso with a wide variety of zzso As a method for the discovery of novel zzso of zzso zzso we have evaluated the zzso drug design protocol involving the zzso modeling of zzso and virtual screening with the two zzso zzso zzso and the modified zzso program implementing the effects of zzso zzso in the scoring zzso The zzso modeling with the X-ray crystal structure of zzso as a template provides a high-quality structure of zzso that enables the zzso inhibitor zzso Of the two zzso programs under consideration, zzso is found to be more accurate than zzso in terms of scoring putative zzso A detailed binding mode analysis of the known zzso shows that they can be stabilized in the active site of zzso through the simultaneous establishment of the multiple hydrogen bonds and the zzso zzso The present study demonstrates the usefulness of the modified zzso program as a zzso tool for virtual screening of new zzso zzso zzso as well as for binding mode analysis to zzso the activities of known zzso
