The purpose of this study was to compare exposure of patient and operator to zzso radiation during zzso zzso performed under combined zzso zzso zzso and zzso guidance or zzso guidance zzso 

With the collaboration of our physics department, we measured exposure on ten patients undergoing zzso with combined CT and zzso guidance and on ten undergoing zzso with zzso guidance zzso 

Mean operator dose was approximately zzso zzso during zzso done with combined CT and zzso guidance and zzso zzso in procedures with zzso guidance zzso Mean patient dose was approximately 6 zzso for combined guidance and 8 zzso for zzso guidance, a difference that was not found to be statistically zzso 

Although combined CT and zzso guidance is normally preferred for difficult areas such as the cervical and upper zzso zzso to ensure operator radiation protection, the technique should also be considered for areas normally treated under zzso guidance zzso However, a larger patient series is needed to correctly evaluate the real contribution of zzso CT to patient zzso
