The zzso control of the zzso function is often studied from the analysis of zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso Whereas zzso in the cavernous zzso zzso anatomical and technical difficulties, zzso levels can be easily assessed from jugular zzso However, plasma levels result from a zzso process due to clearance effects when zzso enters the general zzso zzso zzso comparing zzso levels in the cavernous zzso and jugular blood have revealed clear differences in the pulse shape, the zzso and the zzso Besides, experimental sampling occurs at a relatively low frequency (typically every 10 zzso with respect to zzso highest frequency release (one pulse per zzso and the resulting zzso zzso are zzso by both experimental and zzso zzso As a result, the pattern of plasma zzso may be not so clearly zzso Yet, reliable information on the zzso zzso zzso is a prerequisite to study precisely the steroid feedback exerted on the zzso zzso zzso there is a real need for robust zzso detection zzso In this article, we present an zzso for the monitoring of zzso pulse frequency, basing ourselves both on the available zzso knowledge on zzso pulse zzso and duration with respect to the frequency zzso and synthetic zzso data generated by a simple zzso We make use of synthetic data to make clear some basic notions underlying our zzso zzso We focus on explaining how the process of sampling affects drastically the original pattern of zzso and especially the zzso of the zzso zzso We then describe the zzso in details and perform it on different sets of both synthetic and experimental zzso time zzso We further comment on how to diagnose possible zzso from the series of zzso which is the main output of the zzso
