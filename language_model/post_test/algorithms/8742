We evaluate residual zzso among simultaneously excited and acquired slices in slice accelerated zzso zzso echo zzso imaging zzso No zzso zzso were used in order to maximize and evaluate achievable slice acceleration factors at 3 zzso We propose a novel leakage zzso factor to zzso the effects of signal leakage between simultaneously acquired zzso With a standard zzso receiver zzso at 3 zzso we demonstrate that slice acceleration factors of up to eight zzso with zzso controlled zzso in parallel imaging zzso in the absence of zzso zzso can be used routinely with acceptable image quality and integrity for whole brain zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso time series demonstrate that zzso fluctuations due to both zzso and zzso sources were distinguishable and comparable up to zzso factors of nine zzso The increased zzso efficiency could be employed to zzso within a given acquisition period, higher spatial resolution, increased zzso statistical power, multiple zzso faster sampling of zzso events in a resting state zzso time series, increased sampling of zzso in diffusion imaging, or more quiet time during a zzso
