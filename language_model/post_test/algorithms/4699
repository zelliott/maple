In many shape analysis applications, the ability to find the best rotation that zzso two models is an essential first step in the analysis zzso In the past, methods for model alignment have either used zzso techniques, such as zzso zzso or have performed an exhaustive search over the space of rotation to find the best optimal zzso While zzso techniques have the advantage of efficiency, providing a quick method for registering two shapes, they are often imprecise and can give rise to poor zzso zzso exhaustive search is guaranteed to provide the correct answer, but, even using efficient signal processing techniques, this type of approach can be zzso zzso In this paper, we present a new method for aligning two zzso zzso We show that the method is markedly faster than existing approaches based on efficient signal processing and we provide registration results demonstrating that the alignments obtained using our method have a high degree of precision and are markedly better than those obtained using zzso
