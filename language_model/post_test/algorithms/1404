Care must be taken to zzso select settings for zzso table feed, and reconstruction zzso for successful zzso CT and associated special application such as CT zzso Thus, prospective planning is critical for optimal 3-D zzso Generally, one wishes to minimize all of these parameters to maximize zzso zzso however, one must be aware of the tradeoffs associated with these zzso Pixel noise increases with decreasing zzso zzso the table feed to a value equal to the zzso zzso of zzso limits broadening of the effective slice thickness associated with the table motion but also limits the scan zzso Generally, one may accept a table feed up to twice the zzso zzso of zzso on modern equipment with current zzso Reconstruction intervals should also be selected to satisfy the clinical zzso When zzso and 3-D imaging is zzso the reconstruction zzso should be selected such that at least two slices are generated per table zzso
