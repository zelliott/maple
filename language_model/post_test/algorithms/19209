A compensation method based on reference zzso is developed to obtain high-resolution zzso zzso under an unstable magnetic zzso It is shown that the zzso of the original zzso method is limited for small zzso and a process what may be called phase reconstruction is proposed to compensate large field zzso We demonstrate the method using a probe with a zzso that can generate a fluctuation field zzso A high-resolution zzso zzso spectrum of zzso was obtained under the unstable field after compensation with this zzso
