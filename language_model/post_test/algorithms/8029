The evolution of bacterial populations has recently become considerably better understood due to large-scale sequencing of population zzso It has become clear that DNA sequences from a multitude of zzso as well as a broad sample coverage of a target population, are needed to obtain a relatively unbiased view of its genetic structure and the patterns of ancestry connected to the zzso However, the traditional statistical methods for evolutionary zzso such as zzso analysis, are associated with several difficulties under such an extensive sampling scenario, in particular when a considerable amount of zzso is anticipated to have taken zzso To meet the needs of large-scale analyses of population structure for bacteria, we introduce here several statistical tools for the detection and representation of zzso between zzso Also, we introduce a zzso description of the shape of a population in sequence space, in terms of its molecular zzso and affinity towards other zzso zzso real data from the zzso zzso are zzso to demonstrate the potential of an approach where these population genetic tools are combined with an zzso zzso The statistical tools introduced here are freely available in zzso zzso software, which can be downloaded from zzso
