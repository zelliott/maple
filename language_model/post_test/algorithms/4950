Given a set of zzso we consider an zzso problem which seeks a subset of clusters that zzso the zzso zzso This optimal value can be used as an evaluation measure of the goodness of zzso For arbitrarily overlapping zzso finding the optimal value is zzso We claim that a greedy approximation zzso yields the global optimal solution for clusters that overlap only by zzso We present a mathematical proof of this claim by zzso For a family of zzso clusters containing a total of N objects, this zzso has an zzso zzso time complexity and zzso space zzso
