In this study, we aimed to analyze the displacement field and the level of stability for a human zzso that had zzso distraction zzso The zzso was fitted with various zzso zzso tooth zzso bone zzso and zzso zzso zzso finite element analyses were performed to study differences between the nominal zzso of the device and the actual zzso zzso Furthermore, displacement fields of the zzso arch evaluated with and without zzso forces were compared to determine the level of stability of each zzso 

zzso zzso scan images of the zzso were processed to create the finite element model, which was completed by modeling the distraction zzso Three cases were zzso the distraction device attached to the first zzso and the first zzso zzso zzso to the canine and zzso bones zzso or only to the zzso bone zzso zzso The nominal zzso of each device was 2 zzso zzso zzso in the zzso phase were analyzed in the case of unilateral zzso on the second zzso 

zzso and hybrid devices allow zzso to better control the effective displacement transferred to the zzso by the zzso zzso of the zzso arch were closer to the nominal zzso of the zzso than in the case of the zzso zzso zzso devices were more stable under functional zzso However, zzso zzso of the zzso arms caused by zzso might counteract the benefits of zzso
