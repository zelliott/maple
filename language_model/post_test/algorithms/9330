zzso understanding of tear dynamics may help in developing better zzso drug delivery vehicles and dry eye zzso This paper attempts to develop a comprehensive model that can predict the effect of zzso parameters on various issues related to tear zzso 

The model is based on mass balances of water and zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso The mass balances require models for the drainage of fluid through the zzso and the transport of tears and zzso through the zzso The model parameters are obtained by simulating zzso zzso The differential equations for the unsteady balances are solved zzso 

The model predicts that under normal conditions, the tear volume, tear zzso and potential are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The model also predicts that the zzso is zzso and contributes about zzso of the total tear zzso We also predict the effect of evaporation on tear physiology and show that an increase in evaporation increases zzso reduces tear volume, and increases zzso zzso Additionally, the new tear dynamics model helps assess the effect of zzso of the instilled zzso zzso of zzso plugs and use of moisture chamber as treatments for dry zzso Furthermore, the model is used to predict the effect of zzso of specific transport zzso which is proposed as a potential remedy for dry eyes, on zzso zzso and total tear zzso 

Most of the predicted results agree with the reported experimental results, at least zzso However, some predictions disagree with experiments suggesting that further improvements in the model are zzso The model developed in this paper can improve our understanding of tear dynamics and also serve as a tool to evaluate the efficacy of various zzso at treating dry zzso
