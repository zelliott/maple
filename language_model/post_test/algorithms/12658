In this paper, a novel fast method for modeling zzso by deterministic zzso coding approach to detect the presence of zzso which are early signs of breast cancer, is zzso The modeled mammogram obtained using zzso zzso method is visually similar to the original image containing zzso and therefore, when it is taken out from the original zzso the presence of zzso can be zzso The limitation of zzso image modeling is the tremendous time required for zzso In the present work, instead of searching for a matching domain in the entire domain pool of the image, three methods based on mean and zzso dynamic range of the image blocks, and mass center features are zzso This reduced the zzso time by a factor of 3, 89, and 13, respectively, in the three methods with respect to the conventional zzso image coding method with zzso tree zzso The zzso obtained from The zzso Image Analysis Society database zzso truth zzso gave a total detection score of zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the conventional and the proposed three methods, zzso
