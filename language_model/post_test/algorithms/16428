To determine the prevalence and the relative benefits zzso by selective and spontaneous reduction of one or more fetuses in zzso zzso zzso zzso on time to zzso 

zzso cohort zzso 

Academic medical zzso 

zzso patients with zzso zzso triplets between January 1998 and December zzso 

zzso 

zzso length at time of zzso 

Selective reduction to twins was used in 87 of the 153 zzso zzso zzso that did not spontaneously reduce prior to zzso weeks, and was associated with longer gestation zzso zzso with a fourfold greater likelihood of delivery at zzso 34 zzso gestation zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso not undergoing selective zzso Compared with ongoing zzso spontaneous reduction at zzso zzso gestation zzso zzso was associated with longer gestation zzso zzso and significantly greater likelihood delivering at or after 34 zzso gestation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Selective reduction of one fetus was used in zzso of patients in this zzso Early spontaneous reduction zzso weeks) and selective reduction to twins each zzso similar benefits by extending time to delivery and increasing the likelihood of delivery at or after 34 zzso zzso
