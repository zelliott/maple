A general in zzso magnetic resonance zzso editing technique is presented to detect zzso coupled spin systems through zzso while preserving zzso through addition, and is applied to the specific brain zzso zzso acid zzso at zzso zzso The new method uses double spin echo zzso zzso and is based on a constant echo time difference zzso approach employing zzso of two zzso echo zzso which is normally only zzso to strongly coupled spin zzso By utilizing flip angle reduction of one of the two zzso zzso in the PRESS zzso we demonstrate that this difference method may be extended to zzso coupled systems, thereby providing a very simple yet effective editing zzso The difference method is first illustrated zzso using a simple two spin zzso coupled spin zzso The technique was then demonstrated for the zzso zzso resonance of zzso which is obscured by the strong zzso peak of zzso in zzso Full zzso simulations, as well as phantom and in zzso experiments were zzso The difference method used two zzso PRESS zzso with a constant total echo time of 131 zzso and a reduced 120 degrees final pulse, providing zzso zzso yield upon zzso compared to two short echo standard PRESS zzso Phantom and in zzso results from human brain demonstrate efficacy of this method in agreement with zzso zzso
