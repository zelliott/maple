zzso parameters for a random zzso model of growth in zzso beef cattle were constructed using existing zzso Information for zzso along ages was provided by parameters used for routine zzso zzso zzso and information on correlations among different ages was provided by random zzso model estimates from literature studies involving zzso zzso Both sources of information were combined into zzso estimates; corrected for zzso zzso and general agreement with literature estimates; and zzso to 730 zzso zzso functions using standardized zzso zzso were fit for the following zzso additive genetic zzso and zzso and animal and maternal permanent zzso zzso zzso at different ages were fitted using linear zzso with three zzso Fit was by least zzso The order of zzso was varied from third to zzso zzso the fit beyond cubic provided small improvements in zzso and increased the number of small zzso of zzso zzso especially for the additive zzso zzso for a random zzso model in beef cattle can be constructed with negligible artifacts from literature zzso zzso can easily be modified for other types of zzso and zzso
