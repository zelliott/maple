The objective of this work was to develop and characterize zzso topical zzso containing zzso zzso zzso or zzso The zzso and spontaneous zzso methods were used to prepare the zzso suspensions and the zzso The zzso diameters were 282 zzso for the zzso zzso zzso for the zzso and 191 zzso for the zzso containing zzso The zzso efficiencies were close to zzso in all cases and pH values ranged between zzso and zzso Each zzso zzso zzso was incorporated in zzso zzso zzso The zzso dosage forms showed zzso glossy and homogeneous aspect after the incorporation of the zzso suspensions and zzso The recovery of zzso and the pH values for the gels containing zzso zzso or zzso remained constant during storage zzso zzso For all zzso the zzso exhibited a zzso behavior presenting zzso characteristics and zzso zzso The zzso were adjusted to zzso model showing zzso zzso higher than zzso None zzso phenomenon was zzso detected under the test conditions for all zzso
