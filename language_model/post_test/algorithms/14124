One of the most important achievements in understanding the brain is that the emergence of complex behavior is guided by the activity of brain zzso To fully apply this theoretical approach fully, a method is needed to extract both the location and time course of the activities from the currently employed zzso The spatial resolution of zzso received great attention, and various zzso methods of analysis have previously been proposed for the zzso zzso Here, we briefly outline a new approach to data analysis, in order to extract both spatial and zzso activities from zzso recordings, as well as the pattern of causality between zzso This paper presents a completely zzso analysis method that applies both independent components analysis zzso and the zzso causality test zzso performed in two separate zzso First, zzso is used to extract the independent functional zzso zzso the zzso is applied to the independent component zzso most correlated with the zzso to indicate its zzso relation with other zzso We therefore propose this method as a promising zzso tool for the detection of cognitive zzso relationships in zzso zzso
