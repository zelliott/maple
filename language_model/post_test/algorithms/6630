A method has been developed to calculate and represent the geometry of zzso of membrane zzso zzso parameters are zzso from coordinate files in the protein data zzso The axis of the zzso is determined from the local zzso of zzso units of the zzso The method provides lower and upper zzso values of the distance between backbone atoms zzso zzso and zzso for allocation of a hinge in a zzso The method zzso other geometrical parameters like the length of zzso twist per zzso height per zzso zzso and swivel zzso zzso of zzso of zzso is represented by relative angles of inclination and distance zzso The parameters are useful in quantitative descriptions of structural features of membrane zzso zzso zzso of the organization of the zzso bundle in zzso by zzso axis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso center zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of centers the three zzso zzso indicates zzso end of a zzso
