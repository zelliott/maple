In previous work, we presented zzso an approach to motif zzso that uses a genetic zzso zzso zzso is designed specifically to find putative zzso regulatory motifs in zzso regions of divergent species, and is designed to allow for analysis of long zzso zzso In this work, we compare zzso performance when run with its original fitness function (a simple count of the number of zzso and when run with information content, as well as several variations on these zzso zzso indicate that information content does not identify highly zzso regions, and thus is not the appropriate metric for this task, while variations on information content as well as the original metric succeed in identifying putative zzso zzso
