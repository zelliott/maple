Control of zzso release through the zzso of zzso has been identified as a potential target for the treatment of inflammatory and zzso zzso We have employed structure based virtual screening scheme to identify lead like zzso from zzso zzso zzso models of zzso zzso were developed based on the crystal structures of four zzso The efficiency of the zzso model has been validated at different zzso zzso of known zzso library revealed the possible binding mode of zzso Besides, the zzso sequence analyses results indicate the responsibility of zzso in zzso zzso based virtual screening of zzso database has yielded 277 zzso Top scoring 75 compounds were selected and purchased for the zzso zzso zzso zzso From the combined approach of virtual screening followed by biological zzso we have identified six novel compounds that can work against zzso in which 1 compound had highest zzso rate zzso at 10 zzso and zzso zzso zzso and 5 compounds had zzso zzso
