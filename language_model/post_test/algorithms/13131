The interest in risk prediction using zzso profiles has surged zzso A proper interpretation of effect size measures in association studies is crucial to accurate risk zzso In this study, we clarified the relationship between the odds ratio zzso relative risk and zzso rate ratios in the context of genetic association zzso We demonstrated that under the common practice of sampling prevalent cases and controls, the resulting zzso approximate the zzso rate zzso Based on this result, we presented a framework to zzso the disease risk given the current age and follow-up period (including lifetime zzso with consideration of competing risks of zzso We considered two zzso One is correcting the zzso rate to reflect the zzso alive and zzso the other is converting prevalence to zzso zzso The methodology was applied to an example of breast cancer zzso We observed that simply zzso the OR by the average lifetime risk estimates yielded a final estimate zzso zzso while using our method that accounts for competing risks produces an estimate of zzso zzso We also applied the method to risk prediction of Alzheimer's disease in Hong zzso We recommend that companies offering zzso genetic testing employ more rigorous prediction zzso considering competing zzso
