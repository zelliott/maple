One of the major challenges for contemporary zzso is the analysis and accurate zzso of zzso zzso to enable extraction of useful information about the functional role of DNA zzso This article describes a novel zzso statistical approach to the detection of specific DNA sequence motifs based on similarities between the promoters of similarly expressed zzso This new zzso zzso is especially designed for use with large zzso such as those generated by publicly accessible whole zzso and zzso zzso zzso uses a task farming zzso to exploit all available zzso zzso within a shared memory zzso We demonstrate the robust nature and zzso of the proposed zzso It is zzso for use with a wide range of zzso databases for any species of zzso 

zzso is available at zzso
