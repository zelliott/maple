zzso zzso used for the study of zzso motion of brine solution in porous zzso and sandstone rocks, have been obtained without the influence of Nuclear zzso zzso zzso relaxation times, zzso and zzso These spin relaxation mechanisms normally result in a loss of signal that varies depending on the displacement zzso of the flowing zzso thereby preventing the acquisition of quantitative zzso zzso The full relaxation zzso of the system under flow needs to be zzso to enable the zzso of a true quantitative zzso zzso zzso correlations of zzso and zzso are used in combination to provide the flow zzso without relaxation zzso zzso correlations cannot be used due to the loss of zzso information during the displacement observation time zzso Here the moments of the zzso are extracted by statistical analysis of the full zzso zzso The measured zzso zzso zzso are seen to correlate with the expected mean zzso for long observation times zzso The higher order moments of the zzso determined by this method indicate those obtained previously using a correction were zzso
