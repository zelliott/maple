zzso results using zzso for CT of the head showed satisfactory zzso and objective imaging quality with a zzso radiation dose zzso The aim of our study was to compare the influence of zzso and zzso zzso on zzso parameters at standard and lowered doses of zzso 

Forty patients with unilateral carotid zzso zzso zzso placement referred for follow-up zzso were divided into 2 groups zzso currents were 100 zzso in group A and 80 zzso in group zzso zzso were reconstructed with zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of gray matter, white matter, and zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso means and zzso were evaluated by using linear regression, and qualitative imaging scores were compared across the 2 zzso 

The mean effective radiation dose of group B zzso zzso was approximately zzso lower than that of group A zzso zzso zzso for zzso in the dynamic zzso images were significantly higher than those for the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso for zzso zzso and zzso across the 2 zzso were moderate zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in gray matter rather than the zzso zzso predicted increasing zzso in all zzso zzso and zzso zzso Two cases of significant zzso were confirmed in both zzso zzso zzso and zzso imaging scores did not differ significantly across zzso or zzso 

Lower dose zzso zzso below normal zzso without zzso can effectively identify zzso tissue in zzso zzso zzso does not alter the absolute values or increase the zzso of zzso zzso Other methods should be attempted to improve zzso in settings with low tube zzso
