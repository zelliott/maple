zzso conditions for zzso zzso fuzzy discrete systems based on a single zzso zzso function or a weighting dependent zzso function have been mentioned in lots of zzso The existence of a common zzso P is required in the former, and r zzso zzso positive zzso satisfying zzso zzso zzso are necessary in the zzso In this paper, the weighting dependent zzso function is used zzso zzso according to the idea of the firing rule group and the distance zzso between two successive states of the system, the relaxed stability criterion of zzso fuzzy discrete system is zzso
