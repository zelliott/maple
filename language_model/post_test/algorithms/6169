We present three-dimensional zzso yield zzso of a tissue phantom in a zzso zzso imaging zzso The method employs zzso zzso with modulated light and frequency domain zzso zzso made on the zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso is used to handle the zzso and zzso demanding inverse image reconstruction zzso zzso images of fluorescent targets buried at 1-2 zzso depths from the zzso surface demonstrate the feasibility of zzso zzso from zzso zzso in clinically relevant tissue zzso
