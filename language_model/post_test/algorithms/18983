Genome zzso is an important area in zzso biology and zzso The zzso operation is one of the popular operations for zzso zzso It was proved that computing the unsigned zzso distance is zzso In this paper, we present a zzso + zzso zzso for computing unsigned zzso distance which improves upon the best known zzso The running time of our zzso is zzso + zzso square root zzso zzso where zzso is the total number of genes in the zzso
