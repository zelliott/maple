We find that discrete noise of zzso zzso molecules can greatly delay the extinction of plasmids in a zzso replication system: a zzso zzso regulatory zzso We calculate the probability distribution of the zzso state of the plasmids and show in this example that the reaction rate equations may fail in predicting the average number of regulated molecules even when this number is large, and the time is much shorter than the mean extinction zzso
