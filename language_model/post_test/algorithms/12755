Compared with serum zzso levels zzso those zzso have been shown to increase mortality in chronic heart failure zzso Expert opinions suggest that serum zzso levels zzso may be harmful in zzso However, little is known about the safety of serum zzso zzso 

Of the zzso chronic zzso patients in the zzso Investigation Group trial, zzso had serum zzso zzso Of these, zzso had mild zzso zzso and zzso had zzso zzso zzso scores for mild zzso were used to assemble a balanced cohort of zzso patients with mild zzso and zzso patients with zzso Cox zzso models were used to estimate hazard ratios zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso for association between mild zzso and mortality during a median follow-up of zzso 

zzso mortality occurred in zzso and 38% of matched patients with zzso and mild zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for mortality associated with mild zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had no association with cardiovascular or zzso mortality or zzso or cardiovascular zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is optimal and zzso appears relatively safe in zzso Despite lack of an intrinsic association , the zzso association of zzso with mortality suggests that it may be useful as a zzso of poor prognosis in zzso
