We propose a new measure zzso zzso to estimate the direction of information flux in zzso time zzso This measure zzso is insensitive to zzso of independent sources, zzso gives meaningful results even if the phase spectrum is not zzso and zzso properly weights contributions from different zzso These properties are shown in extended simulations and contrasted to zzso causality which yields highly significant false zzso for zzso of independent zzso An application to zzso data zzso zzso reveals a clear zzso information zzso
