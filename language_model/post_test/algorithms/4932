This study describes a large-scale manual zzso of data samples in the Gene zzso zzso zzso using variables and values derived from the National Cancer Institute zzso A framework is described for creating an zzso scheme for various diseases that is flexible, comprehensive, and zzso The zzso structure is evaluated by measuring coverage and agreement between zzso 

There were 12,500 samples zzso with approximately 30 zzso in each of six disease categories - breast cancer, colon cancer, inflammatory zzso disease zzso zzso arthritis zzso systemic lupus zzso zzso and Type 1 diabetes zzso zzso The zzso provided excellent variable coverage, with known values for over zzso of three critical zzso disease state, zzso and sample zzso There was zzso strict zzso agreement and zzso agreement when using semantic and partial similarity zzso 

We show that it is possible to perform manual zzso of a large zzso in a reliable zzso
