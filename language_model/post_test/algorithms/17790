Recently novel classes of functional zzso most prominently the zzso have been discovered, strongly suggesting that further types of functional zzso are still hidden in the recently completed zzso DNA zzso Only few techniques are known, however, to survey zzso for such zzso zzso When sufficiently similar sequences are not available for comparative approaches the only known remedy is to search directly for structural zzso 

We present here efficient zzso for computing locally stable zzso structures at zzso zzso Both the minimum energy structure and the complete zzso of base pairing probabilities can be zzso in zzso zzso zzso time and zzso + zzso memory in terms of the length N of the zzso and the size L of the largest secondary structure motifs of zzso In practice, the 100 zzso of the complete zzso of zzso zzso can be folded within about half a day on a modern PC with a search depth of L zzso zzso This is sufficient example for a survey for zzso 

The software described in this contribution will be available for download at zzso as part of the Vienna zzso zzso
