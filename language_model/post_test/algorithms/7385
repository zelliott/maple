The internal cavities of proteins are dynamic structures and their dynamics may be associated with zzso changes which are required for the functioning of the zzso In order to study the dynamics of these internal protein zzso appropriate tools are required that allow rapid identification of the cavities as well as assessment of their zzso zzso 

In this paper, we present such a tool and give results that illustrate the zzso for the analysis of molecular dynamics zzso Our zzso consists of a zzso step where the structure of the cavity is zzso from the zzso zzso of the van der zzso spheres based on coordinate sets from the molecular dynamics zzso The zzso step is followed by an interactive stage, where the user can zzso select and zzso the dynamic zzso zzso the tool we discuss here allows the user to analyze the zzso changes of the components of the cavity zzso An overview of the cavity dynamics is derived by rendering the dynamic cavities in a single image that gives the cavity surface colored according to its zzso zzso 

The zzso approach used here enables the user to perform accurate zzso of the geometry of the internal cavities in zzso For the first time, it is possible to zzso dynamic molecular paths that have a zzso minimum zzso zzso To illustrate the usefulness of the tool for understanding protein zzso we probe the dynamic structure of internal cavities in the zzso zzso zzso
