A new methodology for the zzso of the zzso part of phase zzso without recourse to any experimental information is zzso A central element is a procedure for deciding whether formation of zzso solid solution zzso can take place in the chemical zzso Via global exploration of the zzso landscapes for many different compositions in the system, candidates for ordered zzso and zzso solid solution zzso are zzso Next, their free zzso are zzso at zzso zzso level and a zzso phase zzso is zzso As examples, the zzso phase zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso
