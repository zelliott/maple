The most widely spread measure of performance, zzso suffers from a zzso zzso models with a given level of accuracy may have greater zzso power than models with higher zzso Despite zzso zzso error rate, high accuracy models may fail to capture crucial information transfer in the zzso zzso We present evidence of this behavior by means of a zzso analysis where every possible contingency zzso of 2, 3 and 4 classes zzso are depicted on the zzso triangle, a more reliable zzso tool for zzso zzso zzso by this, we develop from first principles a measure of zzso performance that takes into consideration the information learned by zzso We are then able to obtain the zzso accuracy zzso a pessimistic estimate of the expected accuracy with the influence of the input distribution factored out, and the zzso information transfer factor zzso a measure of how efficient is the transmission of information from the input to the output set of zzso The zzso is a more natural measure of zzso performance than accuracy when the zzso to maximize is the transfer of information through the zzso instead of zzso error zzso The zzso factor measures the effectiveness of the learning process in zzso and also makes it harder for them to zzso using techniques like zzso while also promoting the zzso of zzso Their use is demonstrated in a mind reading task competition that aims at decoding the identity of a video stimulus based on zzso zzso We show how the zzso and the zzso factor reject rankings based in zzso choosing more meaningful and zzso zzso
