zzso zzso zzso imaging techniques are used to measure zzso properties of zzso As clinical diagnoses are mainly based on the evaluation of contrast in MR images, relaxation times assume a fundamental role providing a major source of zzso Moreover, they can give useful information in cancer zzso In this paper we present a statistical technique to estimate relaxation times exploiting zzso MR zzso Working in the complex domain instead of the zzso one allows us to consider the data zzso zzso distributed, and thus to implement a simple zzso Square zzso zzso on the available complex zzso The proposed zzso results to be simple, accurate and zzso
