Recent progress in the development of zzso zzso zzso maps within genes and across the zzso provides a valuable tool for zzso and has led to the suggestion of zzso association studies to search for zzso zzso for complex zzso Test statistics for zzso association studies that consider a single marker at a time, ignoring the linkage zzso between zzso are zzso In this study, we present a generalized zzso statistic for association studies of complex traits, which can zzso multiple zzso markers simultaneously and considers the effects of multiple zzso zzso This generalized zzso statistic is a zzso to that originally developed for zzso analysis and has a close relationship to zzso analysis and common measure of genetic zzso We evaluate the power of the generalized zzso statistic and show that power to be greater than or equal to those of the traditional zzso test of association and a similar zzso zzso Finally, examples are given to evaluate the performance of the proposed zzso statistic for association studies using simulated and real zzso
