This work shows that multiple zzso must be considered zzso to explain a zzso zzso impressive mechanical performance and zzso The considerations of zzso interactions alone cannot explain the fracture strength observed in biological zzso Instead, the fracture strength of a fiber depends strongly on the zzso of zzso including a zzso sensitivity with respect to cracks and other zzso
