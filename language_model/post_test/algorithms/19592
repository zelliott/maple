The zzso significance of zzso zzso zzso zzso at the time of zzso valve replacement is unknown, as is the potential role for zzso zzso zzso 

We performed a cohort comparison of patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso rhythm zzso zzso zzso zzso undergoing zzso valve surgery between 1993 and zzso patients were matched for age, zzso and left zzso ejection zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso were late cardiac and zzso zzso as well as major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular zzso 

Patients with zzso zzso presented with more severe zzso heart failure zzso zzso zzso and more often had significant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso They also had worse late survival zzso ratio zzso for death zzso zzso p zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso survival rates substantially reduced at zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for those in zzso versus zzso zzso and zzso for patients in zzso rhythm zzso zzso in zzso had a greater probability of subsequent zzso intervention zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and more frequently developed zzso heart failure zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso and stroke zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso By multivariable analysis, zzso zzso was an independent predictor of late adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, but not late zzso 

Performance of zzso zzso surgery in patients undergoing zzso valve surgery may reduce late zzso however, its potential impact on late mortality in this high-risk subset of patients remains zzso
