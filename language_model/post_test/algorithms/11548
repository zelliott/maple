An zzso of decomposition of protein zzso zzso into components was zzso The spectral shape of components is described by a zzso zzso zzso Rise of certainty and accuracy of resolution of widely overlapping smooth spectral components (a typical zzso reverse zzso was achieved using several zzso factors: zzso the set of experimental zzso used were measured at several zzso zzso zzso the functional being zzso along with the root mean square zzso of zzso the term depending on the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso an extra information is zzso number of experimental values greatly exceeds the number of parameters to be zzso The minimum of functional is determined by a consecutive setting of all possible combinations of component spectral zzso values, which allows to avoid sticking in the local zzso of noisy zzso The real experimental noise restricts the decomposition into not more than three zzso The decomposition error does not exceed the experimental zzso The zzso functioning is illustrated by resolution of zzso zzso zzso of zzso into one, two, and three zzso
