The goal of this analysis was to test an zzso that identifies zzso zzso zzso lead problems before clinical failure and/or inappropriate zzso 

The zzso lead failures typically present as inappropriate shock zzso zzso lead failures before their clinical presentation may prevent patient discomfort, improve device zzso and avoid zzso zzso 

We tested an zzso that uses two measures of zzso and one measure of abnormal zzso to detect a lead zzso The zzso measures consisted of a counter for zzso intervals zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso episodes with mean zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso measure tracked lead zzso every day and each zzso zzso zzso was defined as a decrease in zzso or an zzso value compared with zzso Lead failures were identified when both zzso measures were met or abnormal zzso and one zzso measure zzso The stored data from zzso patients with an zzso were analyzed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the zzso to detect lead zzso 

zzso patients demonstrated clinical lead failures with an average of 6 zzso 9 inappropriate shocks per zzso The two zzso measures used in the zzso predicted zzso (21 of 29) of the lead zzso zzso at least two of the three zzso and zzso measures, the sensitivity of our zzso was zzso (24 of 29) with a zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso combined with abnormal zzso trends may be used to identify zzso lead failures with high sensitivity and very high zzso
