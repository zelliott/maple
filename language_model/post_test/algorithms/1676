zzso distinguishing between zzso and zzso chaotic dynamics from time series is a contemporary problem in zzso zzso In this work, we propose different measures based on recurrence properties of recorded zzso which characterize the underlying systems from both geometric and dynamic zzso The zzso of the individual measures for discriminating zzso and zzso chaotic zzso are zzso A detailed zzso analysis is performed for the chaotic zzso system, which displays both types of chaos as one control zzso is zzso and the zzso system as an example of a zzso system with zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that especially geometric measures from recurrence network analysis are well suited for tracing transitions between zzso and zzso chaos, a common route from zzso to zzso chaos also found in other zzso zzso A detailed explanation of the observed behavior in terms of zzso geometry is zzso
