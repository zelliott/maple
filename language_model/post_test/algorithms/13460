This study uses the zzso center zzso property of zzso zzso to detect cardiac and respiratory motion using raw zzso zzso Using the motion information, zzso cardiac imaging is zzso The data acquisition process requires neither zzso triggering nor patient zzso Using physiology motion information, this zzso method zzso the zzso data into groups corresponding to cardiac and respiratory zzso The zzso zzso of the same groups are combined to produce zzso high-resolution zzso This approach reduces the potential zzso of the zzso data and the zzso artifacts in the reconstructed image because all zzso in a group are acquired at consistent cardiac and respiratory zzso The study concludes that zzso zzso cardiac imaging is feasible using zzso zzso It is a potentially practical tool for zzso cardiac zzso
