In order to find more effective zzso drugs, the zzso National Cancer Institute zzso screens a large number of compounds in zzso against 60 human cancer cell lines from different zzso of zzso About 70,000 compounds have been tested in the program since 1990, and each tested compound can be characterized by a zzso zzso zzso of 60 zzso activity, or zzso zzso zzso is the concentration required to inhibit cell growth by 50% compared with zzso zzso Although cell growth zzso activity for a single cell line is not very zzso activity patterns across the 60 cell lines can provide incisive information on the mechanisms of action of screened compounds and also on molecular targets and zzso of activity within the cancer zzso Various statistical and artificial intelligence methods, including principal component analysis, zzso cluster analysis, zzso linear regression, zzso zzso neural network zzso and genetic function zzso among others, can be used to analyze this large activity zzso Mining the database can provide useful information: zzso for the development of zzso zzso zzso for a better understanding of the molecular pharmacology of zzso and zzso for improvement of the drug discovery zzso
