A number of zzso head fixation systems have become commercially available or developed in-house to perform zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The uncertainty usually quoted for the target repositioning in zzso is over 2 zzso more than twice that of zzso zzso zzso zzso This setup uncertainty is usually accounted for at treatment planning by outlining extra target margins to form the planning target volume zzso It was, however, shown by Lo et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 34, zzso zzso that these extra margins partly offset the zzso advantages of zzso The present paper considers dose calculations in zzso and shows that the dose predictions could be made at least as accurate as in zzso with no extra margins zzso It is shown that the dose distribution from zzso can be calculated using the same zzso as in zzso with the measured zzso ratios zzso replaced by zzso zzso These are obtained by zzso the probability density distribution of the zzso positions zzso to be zzso and the original zzso An additional output correction factor has also been introduced accounting for the zzso dose reduction zzso for a 7 zzso zzso due to the zzso zzso Another correction factor zzso for the reduced (by zzso for 6 zzso zzso dose rate at the zzso due to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Mean dose profiles and the standard zzso of the dose zzso were obtained through simulating zzso treatment by a combination of normally distributed zzso These dose zzso were compared with those calculated using the zzso zzso zzso of the dose zzso was within zzso Since standard zzso reduces with the number of zzso zzso as zzso zzso the planning predictions in zzso zzso zzso can be made more accurate than in zzso by increasing N and using zzso zzso along with corrected dose zzso
