zzso zzso zzso is a toxic gas that is released by both natural and industrial zzso zzso selectively targets the zzso system in humans and zzso The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the distribution of zzso zzso pathology is correlated with the location of zzso areas within the upper respiratory zzso To investigate whether the location of the zzso zzso is dependent on regional gas zzso patterns, a comparison was made between zzso locations and regions of high zzso flux predicted using a zzso zzso accurate zzso fluid dynamics zzso model of rat zzso zzso zzso were exposed by inhalation to 0, 10, 30, or 80 zzso zzso for 6 zzso for 70 zzso The regional zzso of zzso zzso and predicted zzso flux were determined at the zzso zzso and the middle portion of the zzso zzso and their rank correlation was zzso At these 2 levels, regions lined by respiratory zzso were predicted to exhibit the highest mass flux values; however, zzso exposure zzso little or no response in this zzso In contrast, regions lined by zzso zzso showed a close correlation between zzso flux and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for both the 30 and zzso exposure zzso These results indicate that zzso patterns of zzso zzso within the inherently sensitive zzso zzso play an important role in the distribution of zzso zzso and should therefore be taken into consideration when zzso from zzso zzso in rats to estimates of risk to human zzso
