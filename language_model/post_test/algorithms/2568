zzso zzso from zzso as well as from zzso are promising drug targets for zzso infections and systemic human diseases, zzso Many zzso and irreversible zzso of this very large class of proteins have been zzso Among others, molecules with a zzso zzso which is a group that is susceptible to a zzso attack by the zzso have been identified as good zzso Although it is known that the zzso group binds zzso to zzso there are no reports about the zzso involved in the mechanism of this zzso zzso density functional theory and quantum zzso calculations were conducted in order to study the molecular recognition of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso reported in this paper suggest an interaction that starts with a zzso attack from the zzso to the inhibitor followed by a zzso transfer from zzso Only one transition state was zzso however, we found the existence of an energy plateau in the potential energy zzso Based on the proposed zzso some structural features that could improve the biological activity of zzso molecules toward zzso zzso are zzso
