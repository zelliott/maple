Fetal heart rate zzso values in the averaged format that are provided by commercial zzso zzso analysis systems may be zzso for special analysis zzso 

I developed a communication software program to obtain any measured values of fetal monitors for individual analysis of zzso zzso 

The software program was used to study the data continuity of zzso zzso values as an experiment for chaos theory and power spectrum zzso The results indicated that the signal loss was recognized at a precision of zzso 

The described method of digital communication with fetal monitors was found to be useful for individual purposes in the field of zzso zzso zzso
