A zzso to 3-D zzso zzso registration method is proposed in which the alignment of zzso brain sections with a zzso brain zzso is zzso First, sparsely cut brain sections were zzso matched with an zzso slice automatically extracted from the zzso Second, a zzso surface alignment was employed in order to match each section with its corresponding image zzso on a zzso within the zzso For the latter, a zzso registration technique was developed that is driven by a local zzso similarity zzso We demonstrate the method and evaluate its performance with simulated and real data zzso An zzso zzso of mouse zzso zzso complex, retrieved from the Mouse Brain Library zzso database, is demonstrated with the proposed zzso
