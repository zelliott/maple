Given multiple zzso tests, such as repeated application of a blind screening test to each individual in a sample, we attempt to estimate the zzso sensitivity and specificity of the test without knowing the true disease status of those tested zzso zzso This problem is equivalent to finding the mixing distribution of a mixture of zzso zzso We suggest a new method to determine the number of zzso zzso Our simulations show that the coverage probabilities of the zzso confidence intervals of our estimates are zzso Our methods are illustrated by examples from published medical zzso
