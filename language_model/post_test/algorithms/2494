zzso interactions are critical molecular zzso of zzso channel function and emerging targets for pharmacological zzso Yet, current zzso for the rapid detection of zzso channel zzso complexes are still zzso In this study we have adapted a zzso zzso zzso zzso for detecting the assembly of the zzso zzso zzso channel zzso and the zzso zzso growth factor 14 zzso a functionally relevant component of the zzso zzso that controls gating and targeting of zzso channels through direct interaction with the channel zzso In the zzso two complementary zzso and zzso fragments of the zzso zzso were zzso respectively, to a zzso of the zzso zzso segment and the zzso of zzso channel zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in live cells led to a robust assembly of the zzso zzso complex, which was attenuated by introducing zzso zzso at the predicted zzso channel zzso To evaluate the dynamic regulation of the zzso zzso complex by signaling zzso we investigated the effect of zzso zzso on the complex zzso Through a platform of counter zzso we show that the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso BAY zzso reduce the zzso zzso zzso highlighting a potential role of the zzso and the zzso pathways in controlling zzso zzso through zzso zzso We envision the methodology presented here as a new valuable tool to allow functional evaluations of zzso complexes toward probe development and drug discovery targeting zzso channels implicated in human zzso
