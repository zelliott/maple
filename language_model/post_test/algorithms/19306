The zzso growth and death of animal cells are accompanied by changes in the chemical composition of the surrounding zzso zzso and their microscopic environment constitute therefore a cellular zzso whose zzso determines processes of interest for either biology zzso animal zzso and medicine zzso tumor zzso immune zzso In this paper, we consider a general zzso model of the interplay between cells and environmental cellular zzso zzso may be either zzso or zzso in sustaining cell zzso growth and death, the state of the niches depending on the state of the zzso Under the hypothesis of random zzso between the state of the environmental niche and the state of the cell, the zzso model reduces to a set of four zzso differential zzso The biological meaning of the model is studied and illustrated by fitting experimental data on the growth of zzso tumor zzso A detailed analysis of the zzso model, of its deterministic limit, and of normal fluctuations is zzso
