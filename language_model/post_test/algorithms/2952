There is considerable variation in the standard of initial burn management, particularly burn surface area assessment and application of resuscitation zzso Early aggressive management of major burns improves zzso Internationally, the zzso formula employing zzso zzso solution is used for fluid zzso This study aimed to assess whether zzso fluid resuscitation tables could improve the accuracy of initial fluid requirement zzso 

The burn size had first to be determined for an adult and a child using a zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso requirements then had to be calculated using the conventional zzso zzso The burn size had to be similarly calculated for two further cases and fluid requirements calculated using resuscitation zzso The study had a sample size of 50, consisting of plastic surgery zzso zzso and burn nurse zzso 

All the participants found the resuscitation tables to be quicker and easier to zzso The burn size was correctly calculated in zzso of zzso zzso resuscitation requirements were correct in only zzso when using the zzso zzso The use of resuscitation tables improved the accuracy in calculating fluid requirements to zzso 

The use of zzso fluid resuscitation tables can improve accuracy and ease of calculation of fluid resuscitation zzso
