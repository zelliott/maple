In this paper, we propose a zzso zzso iris image zzso scheme that incorporates a quality filter to quickly eliminate images without an eye, employs a zzso zzso scheme to improve the overall efficiency, uses a direct least squares fitting of zzso method to model the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and develops a window zzso method to remove noise in the iris zzso A remote iris acquisition system is set up to collect zzso iris video zzso An objective method is used to zzso evaluate the accuracy of the zzso zzso The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this zzso The proposed method would make zzso iris recognition or iris surveillance zzso
