Variation in drug response results from a combination of factors that include differences in zzso ethnicity, and environment, as well as genetic variation that may result in differences in zzso and protein zzso This article presents two zzso zzso approaches that make use of both zzso zzso and zzso expression data available on the same set of zzso a zzso zzso approach and a comprehensive analysis using sparse zzso correlation analysis zzso In addition to applying standard zzso we present a novel modification of zzso which allows different weighting for the various zzso relationships in the zzso These zzso approaches are illustrated with both simulated data and data from a zzso study of the drug zzso zzso from these analyses found little overlap in terms of genes zzso possibly detecting different biological zzso In addition, we found the proposed weighted zzso to outperform its zzso counterpart in detecting associations between the zzso features and zzso Further research is needed to develop and assess new zzso methods for zzso studies, as these types of analyses may uncover novel insights into the relationship between zzso variation and drug zzso
