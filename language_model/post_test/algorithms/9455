We present a hybrid zzso method for simulating the dynamics of zzso in solution which couples a zzso solver for the fluctuating zzso zzso equations with molecular dynamics to describe the zzso The two models interact through a zzso zzso term first introduced by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 111, zzso zzso We show that our method correctly captures the zzso and zzso properties of zzso chains as predicted by the zzso zzso In particular, we show that the zzso zzso are best described when the ratio zzso where zzso is the zzso length zzso and b is the zzso bond zzso We also find that the zzso of the Rouse zzso zzso function is better described with an zzso correction suggested by zzso and zzso Our FH solver permits us to treat the fluid equation of state and transport parameters as direct simulation zzso The expected independence of the chain dynamics on various choices of fluid equation of state and bulk zzso is recovered, while excellent agreement is found for the temperature and zzso zzso dependence of center of mass diffusion between simulation results and predictions of the zzso zzso We find that zzso model approximations start to fail when the Schmidt number zzso zzso or approximately zzso Finally, we investigate the importance of fluid fluctuations and show that using the zzso approximation for the zzso zzso leads to around zzso error in the diffusion zzso for a zzso chain when the fluid zzso size is greater than 50 zzso
