Many genetic regulatory networks zzso have the capacity to reach different stable zzso This capacity is defined as zzso which is an important regulation zzso Multiple time delays and multivariable regulation functions are usually inevitable in such zzso In this paper, zzso of zzso is analyzed by applying the control theory and mathematical zzso This study is to provide a theoretical tool to facilitate the design of synthetic gene circuit with zzso in the perspective of control zzso By transforming such zzso into a new and uniform mathematical zzso we put forward a general zzso regulation function that is capable of zzso the regulation effects in a more precise zzso By resorting to up-to-date techniques, a novel zzso functional zzso is introduced for achieving delay dependence to ensure less zzso New conditions are then proposed to ensure the zzso of a zzso in the form of linear zzso zzso zzso that are dependent on the zzso Our zzso conditions are zzso to several frequently used regulation functions especially the multivariable zzso Two examples are employed to illustrate the zzso and usefulness of the developed theoretical zzso
