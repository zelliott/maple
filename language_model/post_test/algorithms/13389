zzso and zzso horizontal gene transfer enabled by bacterial zzso systems is a powerful mechanism for bacterial zzso zzso The type IV zzso system of zzso coli, zzso by the F zzso enables zzso contact and subsequent DNA transfer known as zzso zzso is compromised by zzso infection that specifically targets the zzso zzso zzso the use of zzso to regulate the spread of zzso such as acquired zzso resistance or as general zzso agents, has gained zzso To predict the potential zzso the competition zzso must first be zzso Using quantitative zzso to zzso zzso zzso in a zzso batch culture, we zzso the infection zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and its impact on zzso in the absence of selection pressure zzso zzso Modeling the resulting experimental data reveals the cellular growth rate to be reduced to zzso upon zzso zzso We also find a maximum zzso infection rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso which is only 1 order of magnitude slower than the maximum zzso rate zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting zzso must be in significant abundance to be effective zzso to horizontal gene zzso In the regime where the number of susceptible cells zzso and zzso are equal upon initial infection, we observe the spread of the zzso zzso throughout the cell population despite zzso infection, but only at zzso of the zzso zzso This has interesting evolutionary zzso as even in the absence of selection pressure, cells maintain the ability to zzso despite zzso vulnerability and the associated growth zzso
