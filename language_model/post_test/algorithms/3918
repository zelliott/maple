This work studies a fundamental problem in blood zzso zzso how the cell proliferation or death zzso the stress response and the zzso extension or zzso We develop a one-dimensional zzso model of blood zzso zzso under zzso friction with surroundings, analyze its solution properties, and simulate various growth patterns in zzso The mathematical model treats the cell density as the growth pressure zzso a zzso response from the cells, which again zzso extension or zzso of the zzso zzso analysis captures two cases when the biologically meaningful solution exists: zzso the cell density decreases from root to tip, which may occur in vessel zzso zzso the cell density is zzso and is of small variation along the zzso which may occur in zzso extension without zzso The linear analysis with zzso in cell density due to proliferation or death predicts the global biological solution exists provided the change in cell density is sufficiently slow in zzso Examples with zzso are captured by zzso approximations and the global solutions are recovered by slow growth zzso which validate the linear analysis zzso zzso simulations demonstrate this model can reproduce zzso experiments under several biological conditions including blood vessel extension without proliferation and blood vessel zzso
