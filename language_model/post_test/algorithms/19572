zzso spin resonance zzso zzso and the zzso Carlo zzso technique were jointly applied to the physical dose reconstruction of the accident that occurred on 2 December 2001 in zzso Three people were exposed to two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Following this exposure, the two most seriously affected victims exhibited severe zzso injuries zzso in the back as well as a zzso zzso The information concerning the circumstances of the accident in terms of sequences of zzso and the exposure time was not clearly zzso The physical dose reconstruction of the accident was performed for one victim, treated in France, using both zzso simulations and zzso zzso made on one vertebra and two rib samples removed from the victim for medical zzso The complementary nature of the two tools made it possible to estimate the dose distribution within the body with reasonable accuracy and helped to develop the treatment zzso
