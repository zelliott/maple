The harmonic dynamics of normal modes of zzso DNA in a viscous fluid are zzso The model DNA consists of two zzso DNA strands zzso around a common zzso axis with base zzso sugar zzso zzso hydrogen zzso and zzso zzso interactions assigned values based on published zzso Assuming that the DNA bases are zzso from direct zzso by the zzso zzso solutions are zzso The dissipation and fluctuation of the normal modes of the bases moving along the spirals display the effect of the medium indirectly through interactions with the zzso The dynamics of the backbone are found to be zzso with the characteristic zzso times extending to the zzso region for zzso in position and to the zzso region for zzso in zzso In addition to the dynamic mode of a rigid rod, the motions of the bases are coupled to the motions of the backbone with comparable zzso for zzso in zzso For zzso in zzso however, the bases are effectively at rest, not being able to follow the motions of the zzso The angular zzso of the zzso zzso zzso identified as the ringing modes of the bases with the backbone effectively at rest, are insensitive to the zzso and lie in the low frequency region of the zzso zzso These findings indicate that the backbone of DNA plays a significant role in modulating the dynamics of zzso DNA in an zzso zzso This zzso of the dynamics of the motions of the bases in DNA by environmental impediments to molecular motion is briefly discussed in connection with zzso and zzso DNA interactions as well as gene zzso
