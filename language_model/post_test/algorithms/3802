In functional imaging of the brain, the difficulty of a task may be critical for the pattern of zzso Increased task difficulty could lead to increased zzso in zzso regions or to zzso of zzso zzso zzso A previous study with functional zzso zzso zzso zzso showed no evidence that increased difficulty in word retrieval leads to a recruitment of areas zzso to zzso zzso The question remains how the brain zzso increasing task zzso Because of limitations of zzso method, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso in this zzso We manipulated word retrieval difficulty in healthy subjects zzso zzso zzso to determine whether the classical zzso brain regions are activated with increasing difficulty in word zzso zzso demonstrated that with increased task difficulty zzso the zzso of zzso brain zzso remained constant, zzso no additional zzso of zzso regions of the dominant hemisphere, nor of zzso regions of the zzso hemisphere, was zzso zzso additional zzso was found in right zzso zzso zzso associated with sustained attention and executive zzso Thus, increased difficulty in word retrieval leads to zzso of distinct brain areas, working together in a large cognitive network, rather than to increased zzso of typically zzso zzso
