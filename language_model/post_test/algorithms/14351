A potential target for a cancer vaccine would be zzso such as zzso which are over expressed on zzso zzso Using computer aided motif predictions for possible zzso class I zzso we have identified peptides from zzso that should bind with a range of affinities to zzso No direct correlation between predicted values and actual binding affinities was zzso zzso the programs did produce a number of false zzso two zzso were predicted that bound with relatively high affinity when compared with an influenza zzso We have previously identified a zzso zzso and shown that it was only zzso when we zzso preferred zzso acids at key anchor zzso to increase binding zzso In this study we used a similar approach to generate modified zzso When zzso transgenic mice were zzso with zzso zzso killing of the target cells was only achieved when the wild type zzso was presented at moderate zzso Moreover, the efficiency of zzso was increased when we linked zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso should therefore be employed in the use of both reverse zzso and anchor modification of zzso zzso in the identification of zzso zzso for cancer zzso
