The sample size for a trial depends on the type I and type II error rates and on the minimum relevant clinical difference, all of which are known, and on the anticipated, but unknown, value of a measure of variation for the key zzso This measure is the overall response rate when the key response is zzso distributed, or the residual zzso in each treatment group when the key response is continuous and normally zzso Since the true value of the measure is unknown, it must be guessed or estimated from previous zzso We describe approaches to determine an appropriate value for it, both before the trial begins and after it has begun, for use in calculating the final sample zzso These approaches differ from previously described zzso zzso methods in not requiring zzso of the treatment assignments in the zzso They preserve the power and do not affect the type I error rate zzso The approaches can be applied to zzso studies where the rate of change over time is the response of interest, and to group sequential zzso
