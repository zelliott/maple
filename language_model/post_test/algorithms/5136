Recent zzso drugs have been made larger to pass selectively through tumor vessels and stay in the zzso zzso drug movement in association with its size at the zzso level and zzso the time needed to reach the targeted organ is indispensable for zzso drug delivery because single zzso therapy is the ongoing zzso This report describes the tracking of single solid zzso in tumor zzso and the zzso of arrival zzso 

zzso zzso measuring 20, 40, and 100 zzso were injected into the tail vein of the female zzso zzso mice bearing human breast cancer on their zzso The movements of the zzso were zzso through the zzso zzso chamber with the high-speed zzso zzso that we zzso 

An analysis of the particle zzso revealed diffusion to be zzso related to the particle size and position in the zzso whereas the zzso of the directed movement was related to the zzso The difference in the zzso was the greatest for zzso particles in the zzso to the zzso zzso difference zzso zzso zzso The arrival time of individual zzso at tumor cells was zzso The estimated times for the zzso zzso and zzso particles to reach the tumor cells were zzso zzso and zzso minutes, respectively, after zzso 

This result suggests that the particle size can be individually designed for each zzso These data and methods are also important for understanding drug zzso Although this method may be subject to interference by surface molecules attached on the zzso it has the potential to zzso the zzso involved in constructing novel zzso systems involving zzso zzso
