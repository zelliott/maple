Image fusion is of utmost importance for many applications in image zzso Particularly in medical imaging, images of different zzso are necessary because they provide complementary information that must be merged for an optimal zzso The fusion of these images, which can be achieved through a registration process, makes it possible to zzso all available information on the same zzso In many cases, a rigid transformation is sufficient to align correctly the zzso However, there are cases where a zzso transformation is zzso geometrical zzso present in one image, zzso motion, zzso The purpose of this paper is to propose a generic method to account for these zzso in case of zzso zzso We have applied the zzso in the particular context of zzso medical images and present results on simulated and real zzso
