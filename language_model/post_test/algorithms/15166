Upon zzso primary zzso cultures form an interconnected network based on zzso outgrowth and zzso in which spontaneous electrical activity zzso zzso of network activity allows zzso of zzso health and zzso A fluorescent indicator was used to monitor secondary calcium zzso after the occurrence of action zzso allowing us to examine activity of zzso cultures via zzso live cell zzso zzso nuclear zzso with zzso allows accurate cell zzso To analyze the calcium recording in a zzso zzso manner, we implemented an automated zzso and zzso zzso and validated it against a zzso interactive zzso Both methods yielded similar results on the emergence of synchronized activity and allowed robust quantitative measurement of acute and chronic zzso of drugs on network zzso Both the number of days in zzso zzso and zzso of nerve growth factor zzso have a significant effect on zzso burst frequency and zzso Acute effects are demonstrated using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis allowed measuring additional features, such as peak zzso times and bursting frequency of individual zzso Based on zzso cell cultures in zzso plates and accurate calcium recordings, the analysis method allows development of an integrated zzso screening zzso Because molecular biological techniques can be applied to assess the influence of genes on network activity, it is zzso for zzso or zzso screening as well as development of in zzso disease models zzso for example, zzso manipulation or zzso
