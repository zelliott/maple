A zzso pressure sensor zzso is modeled for accurate zzso of applied pressure using a novel artificial neural network zzso The proposed functional link ANN zzso is a zzso efficient zzso network and is capable of complex zzso mapping between its input and output pattern zzso The zzso is introduced into the zzso by passing the input pattern through a functional expansion zzso Three different zzso such as, zzso zzso and power series have been employed in the zzso The zzso offers zzso advantage over a zzso zzso zzso for similar performance in modeling of the zzso The prime aim of the present paper is to develop an intelligent model of the zzso involving less zzso complexity, so that its zzso can be economical and zzso It is shown that, over a wide temperature variation ranging from zzso to 150 degrees C, the maximum error of zzso of pressure remains within zzso zzso With the help of computer zzso the performance of the three types of zzso models has been compared to that of an zzso based zzso
