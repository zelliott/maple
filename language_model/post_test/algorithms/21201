To develop a novel application of a tool for zzso volume zzso and adapt it for analysis of fetal cardiac cavities and vessels from heart volume zzso 

We studied zzso virtual cardiac volume cycles obtained with zzso image correlation zzso from six fetuses with zzso confirmed diagnoses: four with normal hearts between 19 and 29 completed zzso weeks, one with zzso of the great arteries and one with zzso left heart zzso The volumes were analyzed zzso using a commercially available zzso zzso designed for zzso zzso Using this software, individual zzso in a zzso volume are selected and assigned individual colors in zzso and in zzso views, and their dimensions zzso and zzso can be zzso 

Individual segments of fetal cardiac cavities could be zzso adjacent segments merged and the resulting electronic casts studied in their spatial zzso Volume zzso could also be zzso zzso images and interactive zzso showing the segmented digital casts were zzso 

The approach presented here is an important step towards an automated fetal volume zzso It has the potential both to help in obtaining a correct structural diagnosis, and to generate exemplary visual displays of cardiac anatomy in normal and structurally abnormal cases for consultation and zzso
