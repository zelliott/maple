zzso of zzso zzso in the atmosphere has been essential for the evaluation of aviation zzso We therefore calculated these zzso by performing zzso Carlo simulation of zzso propagation in the atmosphere using the zzso zzso The accuracy of the simulation was well verified by experimental data taken under various conditions, even near sea zzso Based on a comprehensive analysis of the simulation results, we proposed an zzso model for zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and photons zzso to any location in the atmosphere at zzso below 20 zzso Our model, named zzso enables us to calculate the zzso radiation doses rapidly with a precision equivalent to that of the zzso Carlo zzso which requires much more zzso zzso With these properties, zzso is capable of improving the accuracy and efficiency of the zzso exposure dose zzso not only for zzso but also for the public on the zzso
