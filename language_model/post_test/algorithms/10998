Transfer of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso aims to restore function and relieve pain in chronic Achilles zzso zzso zzso The goal of the present study was to investigate the clinical and zzso outcomes of zzso transfer to the AT and to compare the zzso technique to the zzso zzso We hypothesized that the type of technique would have a notable impact on zzso 

Forty patients zzso zzso were zzso reviewed and divided into group 1 zzso technique, 22 zzso zzso and group 2 zzso technique, 18 zzso zzso zzso parameters included the American zzso Foot & zzso Society zzso zzso score, Victorian Institute of Sports zzso zzso score, Foot zzso Index zzso and Short zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging of the lower leg was performed preoperatively to assess muscle quality and fatty zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strength was assessed using a zzso zzso 

In group 1 zzso 73 zzso age, 52 zzso the zzso score improved from 66 points to 89 points zzso zzso zzso with average values for the zzso of 76 points, zzso pain zzso and zzso function zzso In group 2 zzso 35 zzso age, 56 zzso the zzso score increased from 59 points to 85 points zzso zzso zzso with mean values for the zzso 76 points, zzso pain zzso and zzso function zzso At zzso the average zzso score in group 1 was zzso and in group 2 was zzso zzso testing at 30 zzso in group 1 revealed notable weakness in the operated ankle averaging zzso zzso zzso of zzso and in group 2 the average was zzso zzso zzso of zzso No statistically significant differences were found between the zzso 

The hypothesis was zzso Both techniques for zzso transfer to zzso zzso and zzso provided good to excellent clinical and functional outcome in the treatment of zzso AT zzso 

Level III, retrospective comparative zzso
