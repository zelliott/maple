zzso complex detection usually provides the fundamentals to automated zzso zzso zzso In this paper, a new approach of zzso complex detection without the stage of noise suppression was developed and zzso which was based on the combination of two zzso matched filtering and triangle character zzso zzso a template of zzso complex was selected automatically by the triangle character in zzso and then it was zzso after removing its direct current zzso zzso matched filtering was implemented at low zzso cost by finite impulse response, which further enhanced zzso complex and attenuated zzso regions containing zzso zzso and various noise zzso zzso triangle zzso threshold decision was processed to detect zzso zzso And zzso intervals and triangle structures were further analyzed for the reduction of zzso and zzso zzso Finally, the performance of the proposed zzso was tested on all 48 records of the zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrated that the detection rate reached zzso zzso the sensitivity got zzso zzso and the positive prediction was zzso zzso In addition, the proposed method was able to identify zzso complexes reliably even under the condition of poor signal zzso
