An zzso to simulate the effects of zzso hearing impairment on speech reception was zzso Like that described by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 62, zzso zzso this simulation employs automatic gain control in independent frequency bands to reproduce the elevated zzso thresholds and zzso recruitment that are characteristic of this type of zzso In the present zzso band gains are controlled in an effort to simulate zzso recruitment directly, using recruitment functions that depend only on the magnitude of hearing loss in the zzso In a preliminary zzso two zzso subjects listened to the simulation matched to hearing losses studied previously zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 82, zzso zzso with zzso zzso This evaluation indicated that the present automatic gain control simulation yielded scores roughly similar to those of both the zzso listeners and the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso the performance of three listeners with severe zzso hearing loss on several speech zzso tests was compared to that of zzso subjects listening to the output of the zzso These tests included zzso syllable identification and sentence zzso identification for several combinations of zzso ratio, zzso zzso and overall zzso Generally, the simulation zzso reproduced speech zzso well, though there was a clear trend for the simulation to result in better zzso than observed for impaired listeners when zzso emphasis placed more of the speech spectrum above threshold at higher zzso Also, the zzso listener with the greatest loss showed the largest discrepancies with the zzso Overall, however, the simulation provides a very good approximation to speech reception by zzso zzso The results of this study, together with previous studies of zzso zzso suggest that threshold zzso and zzso which are necessary features of a simulation of cochlear hearing loss, can also be largely sufficient for simulating the zzso performance of listeners with moderate to severe hearing zzso
