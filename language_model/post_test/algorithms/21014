The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a unique zzso structure zzso the zzso zzso the zzso is made up of at least six prominent zzso zzso 36, 31, 28, 24, and 15 zzso of which only two have been sequence identified, as well as many less prominent zzso As an ongoing process in unveiling the protein composition of the zzso we have uncovered the sequence identity of the prominent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis obtained by zzso degradation suggested that zzso is a zzso zzso This was zzso by mass zzso analyses of zzso fragments of zzso identifying zzso of the zzso zzso as the best sequence zzso zzso analysis identified zzso sequence coverage between zzso and bull, human, zzso or rabbit zzso Since a zzso search only identified two zzso zzso members, zzso and zzso the zzso sequence coverage of zzso provides assurance that this protein is zzso and not a new zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, commercial zzso zzso raised against zzso fragments in the unique zzso region of zzso specifically labeled zzso on Western zzso analysis of zzso zzso These zzso zzso along with immune serum that we raised and affinity zzso against isolated zzso demonstrated at both light and electron microscope levels that zzso is associated with the periphery of the growing zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso and cap zzso of zzso and consequently assembled as part of the zzso This pattern of zzso assembly is reminiscent of the zzso used by zzso zzso another prominent and exclusive zzso zzso indicating a common route for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins are involved in zzso transport between the zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso Our study suggests an unprecedented direction of zzso zzso transport in zzso during zzso zzso from the zzso of the zzso apparatus to the nuclear zzso
