We have previously used the rat 4 day Complete zzso zzso zzso model to screen compounds with potential to reduce zzso zzso The aim of this study was to identify genes altered in this model of zzso pain and use this information to zzso zzso potential of compounds based on their own gene expression profiles using the zzso zzso zzso 

Using zzso we identified zzso expressed genes in zzso and zzso zzso root zzso zzso from rats that had received zzso zzso for 4 days compared to zzso zzso control zzso Analysis of these data indicated that the two groups were distinguishable by differences in genes important in immune responses, nerve growth and zzso This list of zzso expressed genes defined a zzso zzso We used the zzso zzso approach to identify zzso agents in the Broad Institute zzso database that had gene expression signatures that were zzso related zzso zzso with our zzso zzso To test the zzso nature of the zzso zzso methodology, we tested zzso (an alpha zzso zzso zzso - one of the most zzso connected compounds identified in this database - for zzso activity in the zzso zzso Our results indicate that at 10 zzso zzso demonstrated analgesia comparable to that of zzso in this zzso 

zzso of zzso analgesia in the current study lends support to the utility of the zzso zzso approach for identifying compounds with zzso properties in the zzso zzso
