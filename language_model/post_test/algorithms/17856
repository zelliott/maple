The zzso of large zzso zzso modeled as repulsive and attractive zzso zzso zzso is characterized in several modified water liquids using the zzso model as the reference water zzso We find that small amounts of attraction between the zzso particle and any model fluid result in zzso of the zzso zzso However, significant differences are found among the modified and zzso water models and the critical distances in which they zzso the zzso surfaces of pairs of repulsive zzso zzso We find that the zzso trends for repulsive zzso particles in the various model liquids correlate directly with their surface zzso the zzso of the zzso they form, and the openness of their network zzso The largest critical zzso are found in liquids with the smallest surface tensions and the broadest zzso as measured by the zzso zzso
