zzso zzso zzso is an zzso protein with zzso expression in obesity and zzso zzso Several potentially regulatory single zzso zzso zzso within the zzso gene promoter region have been associated with circulating zzso zzso None of them have been functionally characterized in zzso zzso zzso we investigated three zzso zzso zzso and zzso for their influence on zzso promoter activity and their association with circulating zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso promoter activity of different zzso combinations zzso was analyzed in zzso zzso using zzso reporter gene zzso and DNA binding studies comparing all possible zzso zzso This functional approach was zzso with analysis of zzso zzso data of zzso participants of the zzso zzso cohort and zzso participants from the zzso zzso cohort for zzso and zzso association with circulating zzso zzso 

Major to minor zzso replacements of the three zzso revealed significant effects on promoter activity in zzso zzso zzso a minor zzso in zzso resulted in reduced zzso and zzso promoter activity and zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso with the minor zzso in all three zzso showed a complete loss of promoter activity, and no subject carried this zzso in either of the zzso samples zzso P value for statistically significant difference from a random sample was zzso 

Our results clearly demonstrate that promoter zzso associated with zzso in humans substantially affect zzso promoter activity in zzso Our combination of functional experiments with zzso data overcomes the drawback of each approach zzso
