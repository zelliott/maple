The paper belongs to the studies that deal with the effectiveness of the particular zzso sampling scheme compared to the conventional periodic sampling as a zzso In the present study, the zzso sampling according to a constant energy of sampling error is zzso This criterion is suitable for applications where the energy of sampling error should be bounded zzso in building automation, or in greenhouse climate monitoring and zzso Compared to the integral sampling criteria, the error energy criterion gives more weight to extreme sampling error zzso The proposed sampling principle extends a range of zzso sampling schemes and makes the choice of particular sampling criterion more flexible to application zzso In the paper, it is proved zzso that the proposed zzso sampling criterion is more effective than the periodic sampling by a factor defined by the ratio of the maximum to the mean of the cubic root of the signal zzso square in the analyzed time zzso Furthermore, it is shown that the sampling according to energy criterion is less effective than the zzso scheme but more effective than the sampling according to integral zzso On the other hand, it is indicated that higher effectiveness in sampling according to the selected zzso criterion is obtained at the cost of increasing the total sampling error defined as the sum of errors for all the samples zzso
