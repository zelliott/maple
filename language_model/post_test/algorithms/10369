Physical zzso techniques are routinely employed (during sample preparation zzso for segregating the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso In spite of these efforts, several zzso studies focusing on bacterial and zzso populations have reported the presence of zzso zzso sequences in zzso data zzso zzso sequences originate not only from zzso of zzso species but also from zzso of zzso zzso host zzso The latter scenario usually occurs in the case of zzso zzso Identification and removal of zzso sequences is important, since these sequences not only impact estimates of microbial diversity but also affect the accuracy of several downstream zzso Currently, the zzso techniques used for identifying zzso zzso zzso being alignment based, are slow, inefficient, and require huge computing zzso In this article, we present zzso an zzso zzso that can rapidly identify zzso sequences zzso zzso data zzso zzso results indicate that on a zzso with modest hardware zzso the zzso zzso is able to rapidly segregate DNA sequence fragments of zzso and zzso origin, with high zzso A Web server for the zzso zzso is available at zzso
