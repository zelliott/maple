Several formulas for zzso zzso rate zzso zzso based on serum zzso or zzso C, have been zzso We assessed the impact of some of these equations on estimated zzso zzso and chronic kidney disease zzso zzso and on the association with cardiovascular risk factors, in a general population sample characterized by a young mean zzso 

We studied zzso individuals from three Alpine villages enrolled into the zzso zzso zzso was obtained with the zzso and zzso zzso study zzso the zzso zzso and with the three zzso formulas for zzso zzso C, and the combination of zzso and zzso zzso We assessed the zzso between quantitative zzso levels, zzso zzso and in terms of association with total, LDL, and HDL zzso 

The highest and lowest zzso levels corresponded to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso prevalence varied from zzso zzso to zzso zzso The zzso based on zzso showed the highest agreement with all other zzso zzso between methods was higher at lower zzso levels, older age, and in the presence of diabetes and zzso zzso estimates of zzso were associated with total and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso The opposite was observed for the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is strongly affected by the chosen zzso zzso are more pronounced in healthy and younger zzso To identify zzso risk factors, the choice of the equation is of secondary importance to the choice of the zzso used in the zzso If zzso is not zzso to a gold standard zzso in the general population, reports about zzso prevalence should be considered with zzso
