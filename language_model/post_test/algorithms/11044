Model selection and zzso zzso are complex problems that have yet to be fully addressed in systems zzso In contrast with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both the zzso means and their standard zzso (or full zzso zzso thus yielding important information on the extent to which the data and the model zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso 

We report on the application of zzso zzso a statistical approach to computing the zzso evidence zzso to the zzso of zzso and the zzso of log Z in an established model of zzso zzso A zzso difference in the zzso of variation between degradation and zzso parameters is zzso We further show that the uncertainty remaining in the zzso values is reduced by the analysis of increasing numbers of zzso cycles of data, up to 4 cycles, but is unaffected by sampling the data more zzso Novel zzso for calculating the likelihood of a model, and a zzso of the performance of the zzso sampling zzso are also zzso The methods we develop considerably improve the zzso efficiency of the likelihood zzso and of the exploratory step within zzso zzso 

We have demonstrated in an zzso zzso model that the estimates of zzso zzso zzso (as zzso by zzso means and standard zzso are influenced predominately by the length of the time series, becoming more narrowly constrained as the number of zzso cycles considered zzso We have also shown the utility of the zzso of variation for discriminating between zzso and zzso constrained zzso
