zzso interactions networks are most often generated from physical zzso interaction zzso zzso also known as zzso profiles, is an alternative source of information for generating protein interaction zzso zzso methods generate interaction networks among proteins that are gained or lost together through zzso zzso is a particularly useful technique in the compact bacteria zzso Prior studies in zzso suggest that the zzso of zzso interaction networks generated from physical interaction zzso can offer important insight into protein zzso Here, we zzso that in bacteria, the zzso of protein interaction networks derived via zzso information could similarly improve methods for predicting protein zzso Since the zzso of bacteria zzso zzso interaction networks has not previously been studied in depth, we first perform such an analysis for zzso networks in zzso coli zzso Next, we demonstrate one way in which network connectivity measures and global and local function distribution can be exploited to predict protein function for previously zzso zzso 

Our results zzso like most biological networks, our bacteria zzso zzso interaction networks had zzso zzso Our results indicated that some properties of the physical zzso interaction network hold in our bacteria zzso networks, such as high connectivity for essential zzso However, the high connectivity among protein complexes in the zzso physical network was not seen in the zzso network which uses all bacteria as the reference zzso We found that the distribution of zzso connectivity varied by functional category and could be zzso for function zzso By zzso of functional information from different zzso sources and using the network zzso we were able to zzso function for zzso zzso 

zzso networks based on zzso can contain information distinct from networks based on physical or other interaction zzso Our study has shown zzso based networks to exhibit a scale free zzso as expected for biological zzso We also revealed ways that connectivity in our networks can be zzso for the functional characterization of zzso
