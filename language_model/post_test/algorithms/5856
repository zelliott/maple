Our objective was to zzso evaluate the ability of zzso zzso zzso zzso to detect previous zzso zzso zzso and to correlate necrosis with the status of coronary arteries zzso the zzso zzso After having clinically evaluated zzso patients referred for zzso zzso of the coronary zzso 30 previous zzso were identified in 29 patients (9 recent and 21 zzso zzso data were evaluated zzso and zzso by measuring zzso values and wall thickness within the zzso region and normal adjacent zzso Each zzso was also assigned to the distribution territory of a coronary vessel, and zzso data were combined with zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to detect zzso zzso showing an overall sensitivity and specificity of 83 and zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in zzso values between normal and zzso regions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Regional wall thinning was observed in chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and not in patients with recent event zzso zzso vs zzso zzso In zzso cases, zzso zzso findings showed the presence of suspicious critical zzso narrowing zzso previous coronary zzso zzso and surgical zzso zzso in the zzso zzso During a single examination, zzso might provide comprehensive imaging of zzso offering a combined zzso and zzso zzso
