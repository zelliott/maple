We study the problem of finding the maximum zzso zzso in a zzso This problem is related to the Double zzso Problem of DNA physical zzso We show that the complexity of an zzso of Wang is zzso We also present a linear zzso of our zzso We study the case when the edges of the tree is weighted as zzso An zzso with complexity zzso is zzso
