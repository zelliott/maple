Continuous zzso zzso consists of zzso the user zzso throughout a session with the goal of detecting and protecting against session zzso zzso While the accuracy of the detector is central to the success of CA, the detection delay or length of an individual zzso period is important as well since it is a measure of the window of vulnerability of the zzso However, high accuracy and small detection delay are conflicting requirements that need to be balanced for optimum zzso In this paper, we propose the use of sequential sampling technique to achieve optimum detection by trading off adequately between detection delay and accuracy in the CA zzso We illustrate our approach through CA based on user command line sequence and zzso zzso zzso zzso Experimental evaluation using the Greenberg data set yields encouraging results consisting of a false acceptance rate zzso of zzso and a false rejection rate zzso of zzso with an average command sequence length zzso detection zzso of 37 zzso When using the zzso zzso data set, we obtain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
