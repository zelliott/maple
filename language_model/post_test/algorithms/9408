The functioning of natural microbial zzso is determined by zzso zzso which are in turn influenced by zzso environmental zzso zzso experimental manipulation of such conditions can be used to purposefully drive zzso toward exhibiting desirable zzso When a set of environmental conditions can be manipulated to be present at a discrete number of levels, finding the right combination of conditions to obtain the optimal desired effect becomes a typical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are a class of robust and flexible search and zzso techniques from the field of computer science that may be very suitable for such a zzso To verify this idea, zzso containing growth levels of the total microbial community of four different natural microbial zzso in response to all possible combinations of a set of five chemical supplements were zzso zzso the ability of a genetic zzso to search this zzso space for combinations of supplements driving the microbial communities to high levels of growth was compared to that of a random search, a local search, and a zzso algorithm, three intuitive alternative zzso zzso The results indicate that a genetic zzso is very suitable for driving microbial zzso in desirable directions, which opens opportunities for both fundamental ecological research and industrial zzso
