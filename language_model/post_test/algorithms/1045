We review the derivation of the fast zzso search algorithm, first proposed by zzso with emphasis on its application to the problem of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso New aspects of the zzso not previously considered are zzso One of these is the application of the zzso to estimate zzso zzso of a zzso zzso process with zzso zzso when multiple zzso of the said process are zzso Computer simulations were also performed to characterize the statistical properties of the zzso The results show that even for shorter time series the zzso works well and zzso good estimates of the zzso zzso zzso characterization indicates that the standard zzso of the estimates decreases as 1 square root N (N being the length of the time zzso a typical behavior of zzso zzso Another key aspect of the approach, which has previously been considered, is its direct extension to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso terms can be added to the model and the same zzso can be applied to effectively estimate their associated zzso Using chaotic time series generated from the Lorenz zzso the zzso produces a model that captures the zzso structure of the data and exhibits the same chaotic zzso as that of the original zzso
