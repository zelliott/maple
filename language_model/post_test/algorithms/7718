Bone loss in zzso commonly observed in zzso women and the elderly, is caused by an imbalance in activities of zzso zzso and zzso zzso To treat osteoporosis and increase bone mineral density zzso physical activities and drugs are often zzso Complex systems dynamics prevent an intuitive prediction of treatment strategies, and little is known about an optimal sequence for the zzso use of available zzso In this study, the authors built a mathematical model of bone zzso and developed a treatment strategy for mechanical loading and zzso a synthetic chemical agent that enhances bone formation and prevents bone zzso The model formulated a zzso zzso change of a zzso whole skeleton in response to zzso mechanical loading and administration of zzso zzso swarm zzso was employed to zzso a performance index (a function of zzso and treatment zzso to find an ideal sequence of zzso The best treatment was found to start with mechanical loading followed by zzso As treatment costs increased, the sequence started with no treatment and usage of zzso became zzso The treatment strategy will depend on individual needs and costs, and the proposed model is expected to contribute to the development of zzso treatment zzso
