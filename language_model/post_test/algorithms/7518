zzso accurate anatomical zzso is critical for medical image zzso Although many zzso features have been proposed for correspondence detection in various registration applications, no features are general enough to work well for all image zzso Although many zzso methods have been developed to help selection of best features for guiding correspondence detection across subjects with large anatomical variations, they are often limited by requiring the known zzso zzso presumably estimated by certain registration zzso as the ground truth for zzso To address this zzso we propose using an zzso deep learning approach to directly learn the basis filters that can effectively represent all observed image zzso Then, the zzso by these zzso basis filters in representing the particular image patch can be regarded as the zzso signature for correspondence detection during image zzso Specifically, a stacked zzso zzso network is constructed to seek for the zzso representations for each image patch, where the high-level features are zzso from the responses of the low-level zzso By replacing the zzso features with our zzso zzso features for image zzso we achieve promising registration results, which demonstrates that a general approach can be built to improve image registration by using zzso features through zzso deep zzso
