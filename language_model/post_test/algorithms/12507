The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso might serve as an objective zzso of Parkinson disease zzso zzso Thirty-one subjects with zzso zzso and 75 normal subjects underwent continuous intravenous infusion of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging to estimate the zzso zzso binding site density with equilibrium zzso zzso Parkinson disease patients were evaluated clinically in the practically defined zzso state with the zzso Parkinson Disease zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the Schwab and England zzso of Daily Living zzso zzso In normal subjects there was age-related decline in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso In zzso subjects, specific zzso binding was reduced in the zzso nucleus zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso ratio of binding was reduced significantly in zzso zzso zzso binding was also reduced by approximately 50% in the zzso zzso zzso zzso binding reductions correlated significantly with zzso duration and zzso scores, but not with zzso stage or with zzso motor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding was zzso in zzso subjects, with greatest reductions zzso to the most clinically affected zzso There was significant correlation between asymmetry of zzso binding and clinical asymmetry measured with the zzso In zzso stage 1 and zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso binding zzso to the clinically unaffected body side was reduced by zzso indicating substantial zzso zzso pathology in zzso We conclude that zzso imaging displays many properties necessary of a zzso zzso
