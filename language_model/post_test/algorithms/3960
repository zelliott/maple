We employed deep zzso sequencing of two parents and 12 of their offspring to estimate the zzso rate per site per generation in a zzso family of zzso zzso recently sampled from a natural zzso Sites that were zzso for the same zzso in the parents and zzso in one or more offspring were zzso as candidate zzso and subjected to detailed zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso sites from 12 individuals, we confirmed six single zzso zzso We estimated the false negative rate in the experiment by generating synthetic zzso using the empirical zzso of numbers of zzso bases at zzso sites in the zzso The proportion of synthetic zzso at zzso sites that we failed to detect was zzso zzso that the false negative rate was extremely zzso Our estimate of the point zzso rate is zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso per site per generation, which is at the low end of the range of previous estimates, and suggests an effective population size for the species of zzso zzso zzso At one site, point zzso were present in two individuals, indicating that there had been a zzso zzso zzso although surprisingly one individual had a zzso transition and the other a zzso zzso possibly associated with zzso mismatch zzso We also detected three short deletion zzso and no zzso giving a deletion zzso rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso - 11 zzso zzso
