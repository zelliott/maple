Several efforts are under way to develop and test methods for prospective drug safety monitoring using large, electronic claims zzso Prospective monitoring systems must incorporate zzso zzso and techniques to mitigate zzso in order to minimize false positive and false negative signals due to chance and zzso 

The aim of the study was to describe a zzso targeted active safety monitoring system and apply the framework to three empirical zzso 

We performed zzso targeted safety monitoring in three known zzso event zzso zzso zzso zzso gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Data on new users of the drugs of interest were extracted from the zzso Integrated Research zzso New users were matched by propensity score to new users of zzso drugs in each zzso zzso were conducted zzso to emulate prospective zzso Two zzso zzso maximum sequential probability ratio test and an effect zzso zzso applied to zzso matched zzso to identify signals within the zzso 

zzso were identified for all three examples: zzso bleed in the seventh monitoring cycle, within 2 calendar years of sequential zzso zzso in the second cycle, within the first monitoring year; zzso in the tenth cycle, within the fifth zzso 

In this proof of concept, our targeted, active monitoring system provides an alternative to systems currently in the zzso Our system employs a zzso propensity zzso framework and zzso rules for prospective drug safety monitoring and identified signals for all three adverse drug reactions zzso
