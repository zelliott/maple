The vascular space occupancy zzso method was recently proposed as a functional zzso zzso method that is capable of detecting zzso changes in blood volume zzso without the need for a zzso contrast zzso In the present work we introduce a new zzso zzso technique that is based on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and spin zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence employs a zzso correction scheme for zzso Maxwell zzso which is necessary to avoid zzso artifacts that may occur due to violation of the zzso zzso condition for zzso zzso zzso with 6 zzso of zzso stimulation were performed on eight zzso At P zzso zzso average percent signal change and zzso for visual stimulation were zzso and zzso zzso zzso in left and right motor zzso and supplementary motor area was detected with zzso and zzso zzso zzso and signal changes are comparable to those of zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso as indicated by additional zzso experiments zzso and zzso The method makes it possible to perform zzso cognitive zzso studies based on zzso zzso
