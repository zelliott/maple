Recently zzso recording has allowed us to observe patterned zzso zzso zzso and global state transitions in the zzso networks of central nervous zzso We propose a learning zzso based on the process of information zzso in a zzso network, which we call zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso information retention and thereby zzso information loss through time in a zzso We find that feeding in external zzso consisting of information obtained from photographs of natural scenes into an zzso model of a zzso network results in the appearance of zzso selectivity quite similar to that existing in simple cells of the primary visual zzso We find that without external zzso this network exhibits cell zzso and zzso zzso spontaneous activity as well as a critical zzso zzso In addition, we find that zzso zzso zzso input zzso firing patterns to the network so that it spontaneously reproduces these patterns after zzso zzso provides a simple framework to explain a wide range of phenomena observed in in zzso and in zzso zzso networks, and it will provide a novel understanding of experimental results for zzso activity and plasticity from an zzso point of zzso
