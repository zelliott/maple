zzso the utility of a proposed zzso in allowing safe, efficient zzso in mechanically zzso patients using both a zzso zzso zzso zzso and heated zzso zzso 

A prospective study using an zzso to chose zzso devices based on physical examination and zzso zzso 

All patients admitted to the surgical zzso 

One hundred zzso consecutive patients requiring mechanical ventilation zzso were zzso 

Patients were examined by the attending respiratory care practitioner and given either an zzso or zzso If patients demonstrated any of the zzso or tenacious secretions, core temperature zzso 32 degrees C, or bloody zzso were given an zzso All others used an zzso If any of the above conditions occurred during zzso use, the patient was given an zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso of zzso pneumonia, zzso circuit zzso and mortality were determined for patients in each zzso Cost of zzso devices, number of zzso procedures per day, and volume of saline solution instilled were also zzso Initially, 27 percent zzso of patients used an zzso and 73 percent zzso used an zzso During the study, ten patients required changing to an zzso during zzso zzso Patients in the zzso group were more likely to have zzso lung disease and had a longer duration of ventilation zzso zzso 21 zzso and higher mortality (21 zzso Patients in the zzso group were more likely to be zzso had shorter zzso of ventilation zzso zzso 14 zzso and lower mortality (9 zzso There was no difference in the zzso of zzso pneumonia between the two groups (9 percent vs 6 percent) and zzso tube zzso did not occur in either zzso Circuit colonization was common in the zzso group zzso percent) but rate in the zzso group (5 zzso Cost per day was significantly less for the zzso group ($4 vs zzso Patients who required a change from zzso to zzso did so at a mean of 5 zzso 

The proposed zzso resulted in zzso and safe application of zzso devices in patients in the surgical zzso
