Better predictions of each zzso duration would reduce operating room labor costs and patient waiting zzso A barrier to using historical case duration data to predict the duration of future cases is the absence for some cases of previous data for the same scheduled procedure from the same zzso The authors examined sample size requirements for pooling case duration data from several facilities to create a zzso chance of having case duration data for almost all zzso 

Four academic medical centers provided data, totaling zzso cases classified by the scheduled Current zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso of cases in which procedures occurred once or twice accounted for zzso of procedures or combinations of zzso When a procedure was being performed for the first time at a facility, that same procedure had been performed previously at least once at one or more of the other three facilities only zzso of the zzso More than 1 million cases would be needed to have a zzso chance of having at least 3 cases for each procedure observed in the original zzso zzso However, with N zzso zzso cases in our initial data set, we observed less than one third of the estimated total number of possible zzso 

The lack of historical case duration data for scheduled procedures is an important cause of inaccuracy in predicting case zzso However, millions of cases probably would be required to provide historical case duration data for almost all zzso
