The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the ability of three similarity measures to register a template in a sequence of zzso eye zzso Three measures are zzso the zzso correlation zzso zzso the sum of absolute valued differences zzso and a relatively new technique based on a sign change zzso called the zzso sign change criterion zzso Performance is measured in terms of the zzso ability to track the zzso center derived from fitting a general zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso using zzso eye images indicate that zzso is not a reliable similarity zzso zzso both zzso and zzso show enough potential to merit an investigation into their performance in tracking dynamic eye zzso It is anticipated that zzso and zzso can accommodate a range of eye movements spanning at least 60 degrees zzso and 40 degrees zzso
