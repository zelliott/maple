To investigate movement zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso during two zzso tasks with varying movement duration zzso versus zzso 

Twelve subjects performed or zzso imagined the indicated movement zzso or right hand zzso for 1 s zzso or 5 s zzso while zzso zzso were recorded using 16 zzso covering the zzso zzso of the brain according to the modified zzso zzso 

zzso zzso differences were found between zzso and zzso area in zzso zzso zzso zzso and beta zzso during both brief and continuous conditions, showing zzso dominance of zzso and beta zzso and zzso dominance of zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a significant zzso dominance only in the brief zzso Movement imagery duration influenced the zzso of zzso zzso beta zzso and beta zzso but not zzso zzso 

The results of this study will aid in clarifying zzso zzso in association with imagery tasks under varying movement zzso 

For designing an zzso zzso interface zzso for people with severe zzso zzso movement zzso zzso can play a key role in utilizing zzso tasks as a control or communication zzso
