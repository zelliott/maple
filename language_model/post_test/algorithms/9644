Based on the inequality analysis, zzso theory and spectral theory, a class of general periodic neural networks with delays and impulses is zzso Some sufficient conditions are established for the existence and globally exponential stability of a unique periodic zzso Furthermore, the results are applied to some typical impulsive neural network systems as special cases, with a real-life example to show feasibility of our zzso
