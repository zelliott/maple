A major contributor to poor blood pressure zzso control is zzso to therapy, which remains poorly recognized by zzso The prevention of zzso changes in zzso wall, namely increased zzso zzso and peripheral vascular resistance, is a reasoned adequate zzso of hypertension zzso zzso measurement of these zzso factors can be derived from the analysis of 24-hour Ambulatory zzso Monitoring (24 zzso This pilot study evaluated the association between zzso therapy adherence and 24 zzso parameters in zzso zzso 

We studied 42 zzso patients zzso zzso in chronic zzso zzso Patients were divided according to the zzso Medication zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The Ambulatory zzso zzso Index zzso and its zzso calculation zzso were derived from 24 zzso A zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed to evaluate the zzso value of zzso for increased zzso zzso above the zzso 

zzso group zzso showed higher zzso compared to zzso group zzso The two groups were similar in terms of zzso burden at the 24 zzso zzso were zzso related to zzso zzso resulted a predictor for both increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After adjustment for zzso age and nocturnal zzso zzso reduction, zzso persisted as an inverse predictor only of increased zzso zzso was also related to the zzso vs zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso 

Low adherence to zzso therapy seems to be associated with increased standard zzso In this setting, zzso could represent an additional information derived from the 24 zzso in zzso patient zzso
