To compare objective and zzso image quality in neck CT images acquired at different tube zzso products zzso zzso and 340 zzso and reconstructed with zzso zzso and zzso statistical zzso reconstruction zzso 

zzso study with zzso approval and waiver of informed zzso 66 consecutive patients were randomly assigned to undergo zzso neck CT at a standard zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Data sets were reconstructed with zzso and 2 levels zzso zzso of zzso blending at 340 zzso and 275 zzso Two zzso assessed zzso image quality in a blinded and zzso zzso Volume CT dose index zzso zzso zzso effective dose, and objective image noise were zzso zzso ratio zzso was zzso as mean zzso in a region of interest in the zzso muscle divided by image zzso 

Compared with zzso zzso resulted in a reduction of image noise at both 340 zzso and 275 zzso Reduction of tube current from 340 zzso to 275 zzso resulted in an increase in mean objective image noise zzso and a decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso when images were reconstructed with zzso However, when the 275 zzso images were reconstructed using zzso the mean objective image noise and zzso were similar to those of the standard 340 zzso CT images reconstructed with zzso zzso zzso image noise was ranked by both zzso as either average or zzso irrespective of the tube current and zzso reconstruction zzso 

zzso zzso into neck CT protocols reduced effective dose by zzso without compromising image zzso
