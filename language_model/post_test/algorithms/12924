In zzso zzso imaging zzso has played a more and more important role in biomedical research of small zzso zzso zzso zzso further translates the zzso optical information into three-dimensional zzso source distribution, which could greatly facilitate applications in related zzso Although the diffusion approximation zzso is one of the most zzso forward models, zzso approximations are still needed for in zzso small animal zzso In this work, as a relatively accurate and zzso approximation theory, the performance of the simplified zzso zzso approximation zzso in BLT is evaluated zzso in zzso small zzso In the zzso zzso the zzso based results demonstrate better imaging quality compared with diffusion approximation zzso under various source locations over wide optical zzso Although the evaluation for the effects of the optical property mismatch indicates the sensitivity of zzso is similar with zzso model in the source zzso it may offer improved performance with much less zzso In what zzso zzso experimental BLT reconstructions using in zzso mouse further evaluate the capability of the zzso method for practical biomedical zzso
