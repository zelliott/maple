zzso cells can zzso the strength of parallel fiber zzso in their firing by using 2 fundamentally different mechanisms, either as pauses or as linear increases in firing zzso It is not clear which of these 2 zzso mechanisms is used by the zzso We used the zzso capacity of zzso cells based on the zzso theory of zzso learning to evaluate the suitability of the linear zzso for zzso information zzso Here, we demonstrate the simplicity and versatility of pattern recognition in zzso cells zzso zzso the strength of parallel fiber zzso in their firing zzso In contrast to zzso patterns with pauses, zzso cells using the linear zzso could recognize a large number of both zzso and zzso input patterns in the presence or absence of zzso synaptic zzso Under all conditions, the number of patterns recognized by zzso cells using the linear zzso was greater than that achieved by zzso information in zzso Linear zzso of information also allows zzso of deep zzso zzso to use a simple averaging mechanism to significantly increase the zzso capacity of the zzso We propose that the virtues of the linear zzso mechanism make it well suited for zzso zzso
