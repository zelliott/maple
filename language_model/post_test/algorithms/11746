The Web provides a useful environment for simple surgical training zzso A combination of zzso for zzso zzso and zzso code for the simulation engine, has been used for a range of simple zzso zzso However the elements in these zzso are zzso to avoid the zzso complexity of zzso zzso In this paper we describe a variation of the zzso technique that allows us to provide real-time zzso zzso even in a Web browser environment on a zzso Our new algorithm, zzso has been used to develop a simulator for the cutting of two layers of zzso and separating the layers by pulling them zzso
