The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment zzso A first generation of hash zzso methods has been developed, including zzso which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single zzso However, zzso does not support gapped alignment for zzso reads, which makes it zzso for alignment of longer reads where zzso may occur zzso The speed of zzso is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the zzso of hundreds of zzso 

We implemented zzso zzso tool zzso a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with zzso zzso zzso to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human zzso allowing zzso and zzso zzso supports both base space reads, zzso from zzso sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB zzso zzso zzso on both simulated and real data suggest that zzso is approximately zzso faster than zzso while achieving similar zzso In addition, zzso zzso alignment in the new standard SAM zzso zzso zzso zzso calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source zzso software zzso
