Two statistical image processing zzso involving the zzso concept and zzso analysis are zzso zzso imaging zzso of the zzso are formulated by zzso for the purpose of performance evaluation and easy zzso the zzso descent method for the solution of zzso concept and the expectation zzso technique for the solution of zzso zzso zzso evaluation and comparison of the convergence performance of the zzso zzso on computer generated ideal and experimental zzso phantom imaging noisy data are zzso The study concludes that the zzso zzso can zzso relatively fast, but it is very sensitive to noise in measured data due to the zzso nature of inverse problems and its lack of ability to consider the statistics of data zzso while the zzso zzso zzso zzso even with noisy data and has the advantage of considering both the a zzso source distribution information and the statistical fluctuation of measured zzso
