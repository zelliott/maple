zzso parallel DNA sequencing technologies are zzso zzso by making it possible to generate billions of relatively short zzso sequence reads at very low zzso Whereas such data can be readily used for a wide range of biomedical applications, it has proven difficult to use them to generate high-quality de zzso zzso zzso of large, zzso zzso zzso To date, the zzso zzso generated from such data have fallen far short of those obtained with the older (but much more expensive) zzso sequencing zzso Here, we report the development of an zzso for zzso zzso zzso and its application to zzso parallel DNA sequence data from the human and mouse zzso generated on the zzso zzso The resulting draft zzso zzso have good zzso short-range zzso long-range zzso and coverage of the zzso In particular, the base accuracy is high zzso and the scaffold sizes zzso size zzso zzso zzso for human and zzso zzso for zzso approach those obtained with zzso zzso The combination of improved sequencing technology and improved zzso methods should now make it possible to increase dramatically the de zzso sequencing of large zzso The zzso program is available at zzso
