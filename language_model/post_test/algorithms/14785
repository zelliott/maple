This paper presents a non invasive method for zzso the energy efficiency of induction zzso used in industrial zzso This method is innovative because it is only based on the measurement of the external field zzso by the zzso The paper describes the sensors used, how they should be placed around the machine in order to zzso the external field components generated by both the air gap flux and the winding zzso The study emphasizes the influence of the zzso currents flowing in the zzso frame on the sensor zzso A method to estimate the zzso from the external field use is zzso The zzso are transmitted by a wireless module zzso and they are zzso and stored on a PC zzso
