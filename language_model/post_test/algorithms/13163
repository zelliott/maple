Experimental observation of a permanent zzso symmetry breaking zzso is reported for a zzso three-dimensional zzso Based on flow zzso a first zzso from the trivial steady zzso state to a steady zzso state is characterized at zzso The zzso state becomes unsteady after a second zzso at zzso It is found that this zzso regime is persistent at large Reynolds numbers and is responsible for a zzso turbulent zzso
