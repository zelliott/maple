The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential of low frequency analysis of valve opening sounds in order to detect the presence of single leg separation of the outlet zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Single leg separation is believed to zzso outlet zzso zzso zzso zzso of 28 patients with zzso zzso valves were recorded and filtered to limit the frequency bandwidth between 90 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients had zzso valves that were presumably zzso and four patients had zzso valves with single leg zzso zzso analysis consisted of computing the power spectrum for 30 opening sounds for each patient using a fast zzso transform zzso zzso on an zzso compatible zzso For each patient, the power zzso of the selected opening sounds were averaged and zzso in zzso on a zzso linear zzso A ratio of the high to the low frequency area of the averaged power zzso was zzso and evaluated as a diagnostic feature to identify the valves with single leg zzso Six zzso zzso serving to distinguish between high and low frequency areas of the zzso were zzso 400, 450, 500, zzso zzso and 650 zzso The results showed that the zzso frequency area ratios tested were all able to identify valves with single leg zzso The correct zzso performance was zzso The sensitivity to detect valves with single leg separation was zzso and the specificity was zzso The positive zzso value was zzso and the negative zzso value zzso The study confirmed the potential of low frequency analysis of valve opening sounds to detect single leg separation of the outlet zzso of zzso valves implanted in zzso
