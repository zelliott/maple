This paper presents a complete system capable of zzso a large number of zzso that are missing due to zzso or damage in an zzso input zzso These missing zzso may zzso to the zzso background or zzso motions of the captured zzso Our system employs zzso video layer zzso while the main processing in video repair is fully zzso The input video is first zzso into the color and zzso zzso The necessary zzso consistency is maintained by zzso voting in the zzso zzso Missing colors and zzso of the background are zzso by applying image zzso Finally, the zzso motions are zzso by zzso alignment of collected samples at multiple zzso We experimented on our system with some difficult examples with variable zzso where the capturing camera can be stationary or in zzso
