Large databases provide a wealth of information for researchers, but identifying patient zzso often relies on the use of current procedural zzso zzso zzso In particular, studies of zzso surgery have been limited by the accuracy of zzso codes in identifying and zzso zzso procedures from zzso zzso It is important to make this distinction because the prevalence of complications associated with zzso formation and reversal differ dramatically between types of zzso Natural language processing zzso is a process that allows text-based zzso The zzso zzso zzso is an zzso software that allows investigators to design and perform zzso document zzso In this study, we evaluated the role of zzso codes and zzso in zzso zzso from zzso zzso 

Using zzso codes, we conducted a retrospective study that identified all patients undergoing a zzso procedure at a single institution between January 2005 and December zzso All operative reports during this time were reviewed manually to abstract the following zzso formation or reversal and zzso or zzso zzso and specificity for validation of the zzso codes against the zzso surgery schedule were zzso zzso reports were evaluated by use of zzso to differentiate zzso from zzso zzso zzso and specificity for identifying patients with zzso or zzso procedures were calculated for zzso codes and zzso for the entire zzso 

zzso codes performed well in identifying zzso procedures zzso zzso specificity zzso A total of zzso zzso procedures were identified by zzso codes between 2005 and zzso The zzso codes were adequate in identifying zzso formation zzso zzso specificity zzso and zzso reversal zzso zzso specificity zzso but they were inadequate in identifying zzso zzso zzso specificity zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso performed with greater sensitivity, zzso and accuracy than zzso codes in identifying zzso procedures and zzso zzso Major differences where zzso outperformed zzso included identifying zzso zzso zzso sensitivity zzso and accuracy zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso codes can identify effectively patients who have had zzso procedures and are adequate in distinguishing between formation and zzso however, zzso codes cannot differentiate zzso from zzso zzso can be used to differentiate between zzso and zzso zzso The role of zzso in conjunction with electronic medical records in data retrieval warrants further zzso
