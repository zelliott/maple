In this paper, we improve the first step in the arrival time zzso used for zzso wave speed recovery in transient zzso In transient zzso a zzso wave is initiated at the boundary and the interior displacement of the zzso zzso wave is zzso with an ultrasound zzso imaging zzso The first step in the arrival time zzso finds the arrival times of the zzso wave by cross zzso displacement time traces (the time history of the displacement at a single zzso with a reference time trace located near the zzso wave zzso The second step finds the zzso wave speed from the arrival zzso In performing the first step, we observe that the wave pulse zzso as it travels through the zzso which leads to inaccurate estimates of the arrival times and ultimately to blurring and artifacts in the zzso wave speed zzso In particular, wave zzso accounts for much of this zzso Here we remove most of the zzso by allowing the reference wave pulse to spread during the cross zzso This dramatically improves the images obtained from arrival time zzso We illustrate the improvement of this method on phantom and in zzso data obtained from the laboratory of Mathias zzso at zzso zzso
