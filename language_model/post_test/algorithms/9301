The purpose of this article was to investigate how exceeding specified zzso wall zzso constraints impacts on the risk of late zzso bleeding by using zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso of the zzso wall of 250 patients with prostate cancer were zzso All patients were treated by three-dimensional zzso radiation therapy, receiving mean target doses of 80 zzso To study the main features of the patient population, the average and the standard zzso of the distribution of zzso were zzso The mean dose zzso generalized equivalent uniform dose zzso zzso modified equivalent uniform dose zzso zzso and normal tissue complication probability zzso zzso were also zzso The zzso set was then zzso into eight classes on the basis of the exceeding or the fulfilling of three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Comparisons were made between them by zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

The zzso calculations suggest that late zzso toxicity is mostly influenced by zzso The zzso and zzso are risk factors of toxicity always zzso with zzso inside each zzso zzso The mean dose, although a reliable index, may be misleading in critical zzso 

Both in three-dimensional zzso radiation therapy and particularly in zzso radiation therapy, it should be known what the relative importance of each specified zzso constraint is for each organ at zzso This requires a greater awareness of zzso properties of zzso and zzso zzso may help to gradually become aware of this zzso
