zzso functional theory zzso and zzso zzso fine structure zzso zzso are complementary tools for the zzso study of active sites in zzso zzso is used to zzso zzso multiple scattering zzso zzso factors, which are then employed in genetic zzso fitting process to obtain a global fit to the zzso in the space of fitting zzso zzso sites, which serve important functions as zzso switches in zzso finger proteins and zzso zzso previously have proven intractable by this zzso here these limitations are zzso In this work we evaluate optimal zzso zzso zzso and basis sets for determining optimal zzso and zzso zzso of states of mixed zzso zzso zzso zzso results are compared to experimental zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the literature and tabulated for zzso
