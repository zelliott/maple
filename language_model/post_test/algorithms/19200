A central problem in the emerging field of zzso is how to identify the compounds zzso a chemical mixture of biological zzso zzso zzso can greatly assist in this identification process, by means of zzso correlation zzso particularly total correlation zzso zzso This Communication demonstrates how zzso zzso zzso zzso provides an efficient means of data reduction and zzso of zzso zzso for the identification of unique traces representing the zzso zzso of individual zzso The method is applied to a zzso mixture whose compounds could be zzso identified by peak matching of zzso components against the zzso zzso zzso
