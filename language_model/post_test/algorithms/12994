In this paper a novel variable selection method based on zzso zzso zzso zzso neural networks and genetic zzso is zzso The fuzzy means zzso is zzso as the training method for the zzso networks, due to its inherent speed, the deterministic approach of selecting the hidden zzso centers and the fact that it involves only a single tuning zzso The zzso between the accuracy and zzso of the produced model is handled by using Final zzso zzso zzso based on the zzso training and validation zzso as a fitness function of the proposed genetic zzso The tuning zzso required by the fuzzy means zzso is treated as a free variable by the genetic zzso The proposed method was tested in benchmark data sets stemming from the scientific communities of zzso prediction and medicinal chemistry and produced promising zzso
