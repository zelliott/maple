A recent article by Yang and Hoffman zzso zzso zzso Hoffman, zzso zzso zzso 181 zzso zzso presents a zzso zzso zzso in which the alpha and beta zzso of an zzso double resonance zzso spectrum can be zzso This represents one instance of a family of zzso sequences which have no initial zzso inversion pulse, and which can reveal information about nuclear relaxation rates and the signs of zzso zzso zzso Here we discuss the more general set of such zzso which we refer to as zzso zzso zzso and show how signal sensitivity can be zzso within the context of this new zzso Through simulations, we compare its performance to other techniques based on Davies zzso and zzso illustrate its properties using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, we suggest a protocol for zzso both the magnitude and sign of the zzso zzso using a combination of zzso zzso
