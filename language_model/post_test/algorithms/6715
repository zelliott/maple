zzso zzso often require baseline removal before further data analysis can be zzso Manual zzso zzso baseline determination and removal is a common technique used to perform this zzso Currently, little data exists that details the accuracy and precision that can be expected with manual baseline removal zzso This study addresses this current lack of zzso One hundred zzso of varying zzso ratio zzso zzso ratio zzso baseline zzso and spectral congestion were constructed and zzso were zzso by 16 volunteers who were zzso as being either experienced or inexperienced in baseline zzso In total, 285 baseline zzso were zzso The general level of accuracy and precision that can be expected for manually determined zzso from zzso of varying zzso zzso baseline zzso and spectral congestion is zzso Furthermore, the effects of user experience on the accuracy and precision of baseline determination is zzso The interactions between the above factors in affecting the accuracy and precision of baseline determination is zzso Where possible, the functional relationships between zzso precision, and the given spectral characteristic are zzso The results provide users of manual baseline determination useful guidelines in establishing limits of accuracy and precision when performing manual baseline determination, as well as highlighting conditions that confound the accuracy and precision of manual baseline zzso
