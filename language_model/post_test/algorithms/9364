zzso zzso the vast amount of zzso information contained in complete zzso zzso and is rapidly becoming the standard for reliably zzso species zzso There are, however, fundamental differences between the ways in which zzso approaches like gene content, zzso zzso and zzso integrate the zzso information from separate zzso zzso Furthermore, they all depend on the method by which the zzso groups are initially zzso Here, we systematically compare these four zzso approaches, in parallel with three approaches for large-scale zzso zzso zzso zzso cluster zzso and zzso zzso 

Including various zzso methods, we apply a total of 54 fully automated zzso procedures to the zzso the zzso zzso with the largest number of zzso zzso for which we retrieved a golden standard zzso from the zzso zzso trees based on gene content show, relative to the other methods, a bias in the tree zzso that parallels convergence in lifestyle among the species zzso indicating convergence in gene zzso 

Complete zzso are no guarantee for good or even consistent zzso However, the large amounts of data in zzso enable us to carefully select the data most suitable for zzso zzso In terms of performance, the zzso approach, combined with restrictive zzso is the most successful in recovering a zzso zzso that agrees with current zzso views, and allows us to obtain a high-resolution zzso We provide solid support for what has grown to be a common practice in zzso during its advance in recent zzso 

zzso data are available at zzso zzso
