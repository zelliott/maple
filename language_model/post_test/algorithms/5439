The purpose of this research is to determine the accuracy and reliability of zzso obtained from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for different head zzso 

zzso steel wires were fixed to a dry skull at different zzso The skull was scanned by using zzso in the centered and 5 other zzso zzso and zzso reliability tests were performed by using 6 landmarks identified on the virtual zzso skulls by 2 zzso Two methods were used to determine the accuracy of zzso on the virtual zzso skull scanned in different zzso In the first method, 12 linear distances were compared on the physical skull and the zzso virtual skull in the centered and the other scanning zzso In the second method, registration of each of the 5 positions on the centered position was done zzso and coordinates of 11 landmarks were identified in each position and compared with the centered zzso Data gathered from the 2 methods were compared zzso 

zzso correlation and zzso correlation zzso values were almost zzso in all the comparisons zzso zzso high zzso and zzso zzso zzso very high zzso between the physical skull and the zzso zzso zzso zzso very high zzso between zzso of the centered position in relation to those obtained from the different skull zzso and zzso registration of the skulls in the different positions showed high zzso with the highest values between the centered and zzso positions, and the lowest with the complex zzso 

zzso and reliability of zzso zzso are not affected by changing the skull zzso Thus, the zzso and chin rests should not be considered absolute requirements during zzso imaging if a stable head position is zzso
