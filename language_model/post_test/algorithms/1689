Period adding zzso have been observed zzso in the dynamics of zzso and pancreatic cells, zzso electric zzso chemical zzso oceanic internal waves, and also in air zzso We show that the period adding zzso appearing in bubbling from a zzso submerged in a viscous liquid can be reproduced by a simple model, based on some zzso principles, dealing with the time evolution of two zzso bubble position and pressure of the air chamber, through a system of differential equations with a rule of detachment based on force zzso The model further reduces to an zzso one-dimensional map giving the pressures at the zzso where time between bubbles come out as an zzso of the zzso The model has not only good agreement with experimental data, but is also able to predict the influence of the main parameters involved, like the length of the hose connecting the air supplier with the needle, the needle radius and the needle zzso
