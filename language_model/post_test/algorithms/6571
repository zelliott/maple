An important application of zzso experiments is to identify zzso expressed zzso Because zzso data are often not distributed according to a normal distribution zzso methods were suggested for their statistical zzso Here, the zzso test, a novel and powerful test based on ranks, is investigated and compared with the zzso zzso as well as with two other zzso tests zzso rank sum test, zzso zzso zzso recently recommended for the analysis of gene expression zzso 

zzso studies show that an exact zzso test based on the zzso statistic B is preferable to the other three zzso It is less conservative than the zzso test and more powerful, in particular in case of zzso or heavily zzso zzso When the underlying distribution is zzso the differences in power between the tests are relatively zzso Thus, the zzso is recommended for the usual situation that the underlying distribution is a zzso zzso
