zzso are a ubiquitous secondary structure motif in zzso zzso Despite their simple structure, there is some debate over whether they fold in a two-state or zzso zzso We have studied the folding of a small zzso hairpin using a serial version of replica exchange molecular dynamics on a distributed computing zzso On the basis of these simulations, we have identified a number of zzso that are consistent with experimental zzso We also find that folding is not simply the reverse of zzso unfolding and suggest that this may be a general feature of zzso zzso
