The blood volume that has to be exchanged for zzso and/or zzso during acute zzso zzso zzso in order to reach a zzso target zzso concentration zzso is usually predicted by the zzso and Smith formula developed in zzso This formula systematically zzso the zzso zzso blood volume zzso a fact that may potentially endanger patients because the target zzso will be missed and the zzso anemia might turn out to be more severe than a zzso zzso Our objective was to develop a more accurate mathematical model of zzso zzso and to validate this new model in animals and in patients undergoing zzso 

Twenty-two zzso beagle dogs and 18 patients under balanced zzso underwent zzso zzso with zzso starch zzso zzso 200 zzso to a target zzso of 7 g zzso or 9 g zzso zzso zzso blood volume predicted by use of the different mathematical models was compared with the blood volume actually exchanged to meet the zzso target zzso 

zzso of zzso by the zzso and Smith formula zzso + zzso systematically overestimated the volume actually exchanged zzso dogs zzso patients zzso whereas our new zzso model predicted zzso zzso more reliably zzso dogs zzso patients zzso In both cases zzso + S differed significantly from the zzso 

zzso blood volume is predicted more accurately by the new zzso model than by the zzso and Smith zzso The zzso model leads to an improvement in patient safety and provides a zzso adequate basis for future studies investigating the efficacy of zzso in reducing zzso blood zzso
