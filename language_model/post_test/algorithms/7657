The zzso is instrumental in zzso many vital functions ranging from speech and balance to eye zzso The effect of zzso pathology on these functions is frequently examined using zzso studies that depend on consistent and accurate zzso however, no existing automated methods adequately delineate the zzso zzso In this work, we describe a method we call the Automatic zzso of zzso zzso Algorithm using zzso zzso evolution zzso A multiple object geometric zzso model zzso enables each boundary surface of each individual zzso to be evolved under different level set zzso An important innovation described in this work is that the speed for each zzso boundary is derived from a zzso trained specifically to identify that zzso We compared our method to zzso obtained using the zzso and zzso fusion techniques, and demonstrate zzso superior zzso
