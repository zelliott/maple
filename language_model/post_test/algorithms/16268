Random walk particle tracking zzso to simulate zzso transport of conservative species constitute an attractive alternative for their zzso efficiency and absence of zzso zzso Yet, problems stemming from the reconstruction of zzso from particle zzso have typically prevented its use in zzso transport zzso The zzso problem mainly arises from the need to first reconstruct the zzso of zzso from a discrete number of zzso which is an error prone process, and then computing a spatial functional of the zzso and/or its derivatives zzso spatial or zzso Errors are then zzso so that common strategies to reconstruct this functional require an zzso amount of particles when dealing with zzso zzso transport zzso In this context, this article presents a methodology to directly reconstruct this functional based on kernel density zzso The methodology zzso the error propagation in the evaluation of the functional by avoiding the prior zzso of the actual zzso of zzso The zzso kernel associated with the corresponding functional depends on the size of the support volume, which defines the area over which a given particle can influence the zzso The shape of the kernel functions and the size of the support volume determines the degree of zzso which is zzso to obtain the best unbiased predictor of the functional using an zzso plug-in support volume zzso We applied the methodology to directly reconstruct the reaction rates of a zzso problem involving the mixing of two different waters carrying two zzso species in chemical equilibrium and moving through a randomly zzso porous zzso
