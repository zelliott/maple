An automatic buffer capacity model building zzso was zzso The objective of this zzso is to characterize multiple buffer systems from experimental zzso zzso Starting from a simple mathematical model that incorporates the available prior knowledge on the buffer system, the model is zzso extended by incorporating additional zzso buffer zzso To select the most appropriate model from the resulting set of automatically built models, a model structure selection technique was constructed from existing zzso
