zzso shape matching is a fundamental issue in computer vision with many applications such as shape zzso zzso object recognition, and zzso However, shape matching with noise, zzso and clutter is a challenging zzso In this paper, we analyze a family of zzso maps including harmonic zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso maps with regards to zzso shape zzso As a result, we propose a novel and zzso efficient shape matching framework by using zzso zzso zzso According to zzso geometry theory, each zzso surface with disk zzso can be mapped to a zzso domain through a global zzso and the resulting map is a zzso zzso zzso and zzso This allows us to simplify the zzso zzso problem to a zzso zzso problem, by comparing the resulting zzso zzso zzso which are stable, insensitive to resolution changes and robust to zzso and zzso zzso highly accurate and efficient zzso shape matching zzso can be achieved by using the above three zzso zzso Finally, the zzso of zzso zzso maps is evaluated and analyzed zzso in zzso shape matching with zzso noise, and resolution zzso In order to further demonstrate the performance of our proposed method, we also conduct a series of experiments on two computer vision applications, zzso zzso face recognition and zzso zzso surface alignment and zzso
