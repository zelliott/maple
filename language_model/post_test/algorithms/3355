zzso heart rate zzso has been found in infants who later succumb to the sudden infant death syndrome zzso To determine whether respiratory zzso zzso a major component of heart rate zzso is also reduced in zzso victims, nighttime portions of zzso zzso recordings of zzso and zzso from infants who later died of zzso and 52 recordings from control infants were assessed using spectral zzso Two aspects of respiratory zzso zzso were zzso zzso (the absolute heart rate variation at the respiratory zzso and zzso (the degree to which heart rate follows zzso regardless of the absolute amount of zzso Respiratory parameters were used to zzso each zzso zzso as quiet sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, zzso or indeterminate zzso Median extent and zzso values across the night were then zzso for each zzso zzso zzso zzso X zzso repeated measures analysis of zzso tests were then used to compare respiratory zzso zzso values for 13 zzso victims and 13 control infants matched by zzso age, birth weight, sex, and zzso zzso zzso of respiratory zzso zzso was significantly lower in the zzso victims across all zzso states, a finding that persisted after adjusting for heart zzso zzso values did not differ zzso These results suggest that even before the time of zzso risk for the syndrome, zzso victims, as a group, differ from controls in the extent to which cardiac and respiratory activity couple, and this difference is independent of zzso heart zzso
