A zzso network approach was performed to characterize significant patterns of influenza A virus zzso zzso and to further identify potentially valuable targets for zzso and therapeutic zzso zzso analysis demonstrated a strong tendency for zzso to interplay with highly connected and central proteins located in sparsely connected zzso Additionally, functional analysis based on biological process revealed a number of functional groups overrepresented for zzso zzso in which regulation of cell death and zzso and zzso zzso process is the most highly zzso In order to investigate whether these zzso and biological features are significant enough to distinguish zzso targets from human zzso a discrimination model was constructed based on these features using support zzso machine coupled with genetic zzso The average result of overall prediction accuracy is zzso by zzso across validation zzso The zzso zzso was then applied to zzso human zzso As a result, zzso novel genes were identified from human zzso some of which were zzso validated by others' works to be important for zzso zzso The findings presented in this study might be important in discovering new drug targets for therapeutic treatments as well as revealing zzso features and functional properties specific for viral zzso
