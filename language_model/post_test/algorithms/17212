Heart zzso zzso in the duration of the zzso active state of cardiac cells, the action potential, are an important zzso of lethal heart rhythm zzso The relationship between action potential duration and heart rate can be zzso as a zzso one-dimensional zzso zzso of the map over a range of zzso relevant heart rates produces complex changes in action potential zzso including period doubling zzso chaos and period doubling zzso We present a computer zzso that zzso over the same range of heart rates, uniform state variable values zzso potential zzso by application of small zzso stimuli at appropriate zzso The zzso succeeds, even though the only zzso in the system (the heart zzso is zzso Control of the dynamics is achieved by exploiting the zzso of the cardiac cells immediately after zzso This zzso may have applications for the prevention of cardiac rhythm zzso
