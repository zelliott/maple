This study examined the effect of body segment zzso zzso zzso on joint moments calculated using an inverse dynamics procedure and muscle forces calculated using zzso muscle control zzso during zzso zzso zzso segment mass, center of mass location zzso and inertia zzso of the left zzso shank and foot of a scaled musculoskeletal model were zzso These zzso started from their nominal value and were adjusted to zzso in steps of zzso for both individual as well as combined zzso in zzso For all zzso an inverse dynamics procedure calculated the ankle, knee and hip moments based on an identical inverse zzso zzso Furthermore, the effect of applying a residual reduction zzso zzso was zzso Muscle zzso and resulting muscle forces were calculated using zzso The results show only a limited effect of an individual zzso zzso on the calculated moments, where the largest effect is found when zzso the shank com zzso the ratio of absolute difference in zzso and relative zzso zzso is zzso zzso N m for hip zzso zzso The additional influence of zzso two parameters simultaneously is small zzso is zzso zzso N m for hip zzso zzso zzso made small changes to the model to increase the dynamic consistency of the simulation (after zzso zzso is zzso zzso N zzso zzso results show large differences in muscle forces when zzso are zzso These result from the underlying forward integration of the dynamic zzso
