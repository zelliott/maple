zzso operator has long been used in image and signal processing with great success to detect significant zzso In this paper we show that differentiation can enhance certain features of brain zzso signals, contaminated with noise, artifacts, and acquisition zzso leading to efficient detection of those zzso zzso zzso method has been very successful in detecting seizure onset in the brain zzso zzso In this paper we have combined these two powerful methods under the name of differential windowed zzso zzso zzso to automatically detect seizure zzso in almost real time, in continuous zzso zzso signals of zzso zzso The main advantages of the method are simplicity of zzso and zzso We have tested the zzso on zzso h of zzso zzso as well as 59 h of seizure zzso of 15 zzso zzso It detected all but six zzso zzso zzso with an average delay of zzso s after the onset with a maximum false detection of three in 24 h of zzso zzso Eight novel empirical measures have been introduced to avoid false zzso To ascertain the reliability of the detection method a novel methodology, called zzso zzso curve analysis has been zzso zzso has been compared with a difference filter based sharp transient zzso detection zzso
