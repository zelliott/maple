Previously, we determined a planning target volume zzso margin recipe for geometrical errors in zzso equal to zzso zzso 2 zzso + zzso zzso with zzso and zzso standard zzso describing systematic and random zzso zzso In this paper, we investigated margins for zzso at risk zzso yielding the so-called planning organ at risk volume zzso 

For critical zzso with a maximum dose zzso zzso we calculated margins such that zzso in the zzso is equal to the motion averaged zzso in the zzso clinical target volume zzso We studied margins for the spinal zzso in 10 zzso cases and 10 lung cases, each with two different clinical zzso For critical zzso with a zzso zzso we also investigated whether a margin recipe was zzso 

For the 20 spinal cords considered, the average margin recipe found was: zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso with variations for systematic and random errors of zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso The variations were due to differences in shape and position of the dose zzso with respect to the zzso The recipe also depended significantly on the volume definition of zzso For critical zzso with a zzso zzso the zzso concept appears even less useful because a margin around, zzso the zzso changes the volume in such a manner that zzso constraints stop making zzso 

The concept of zzso for planning of zzso is of limited zzso zzso alternative ways should be developed to include geometric uncertainties of zzso in zzso zzso
