The present study describes the application of zzso to investigate the interaction between a zzso zzso and different metal zzso This study aims at zzso the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using the effective zzso mobility as a zzso for calculation of the reaction association constant zzso For this purpose, the zzso zzso of zzso at different metal zzso zzso in zzso buffer pH zzso were zzso A mathematical model to calculate the association constant between zzso and metal zzso was zzso The results showed that a strong change in the zzso zzso mobility was observed by increasing the metal zzso zzso The results revealed that by increasing the concentration of metal zzso in the running buffer the degree of zzso increases zzso On the basis of the results, the strength of the interaction of zzso with the investigated metal zzso follows the order zzso The association constant of the investigated reactions ranged from zzso to zzso zzso The results indicate that it is possible to characterize the interaction between zzso and metal zzso zzso using zzso
