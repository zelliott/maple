The rapid increase in volume of protein structure literature means useful information may be hidden or lost in the published literature and the process of finding relevant material, sometimes the zzso factor in new research, may be arduous and zzso 

We describe the zzso Active Site zzso Acquisition zzso system, which addresses these problems by performing automatic extraction of information relating to the roles of specific zzso acid zzso in protein molecules from online scientific articles and zzso Both the zzso recognition and extraction capabilities of the system have been extensively evaluated against manually zzso data and the results compare zzso with state-of-the-art results obtained in less challenging zzso zzso is the first information extraction zzso system developed for the protein structure domain and one of the most thoroughly evaluated zzso system operating on biological scientific text to zzso 

zzso makes its extraction results available via a zzso front end: zzso The evaluation resources zzso zzso zzso are also available through the zzso zzso
