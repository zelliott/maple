A three-dimensional laser scanning device was developed allowing surface zzso of musculoskeletal and soft tissue structures under different zzso zzso zzso were formulated for image zzso These were used to determine displacement mapping and then surface zzso Various validation experiments were zzso zzso was obtained on a test cylinder after rigid rotation and on a silicon cylinder compressed in four loading zzso The system accuracy (including the scanning and the data zzso was zzso strain in vertical and zzso strain in zzso and zzso direction for the rigid rotation exhibiting the zzso zzso Silicon cylinder zzso showed that the accuracy was best for small zzso whereas strains zzso evoked a slight zzso increasing further with higher strains zzso of zzso for zzso vertical zzso It was possible to increase the accuracy by performing the strain zzso via zzso This had a remaining error of zzso for zzso vertical zzso A further experiment was carried out in order to acquire the surface strain of a human zzso zzso disc while it was forced to zzso and zzso This study introduced a zzso scanning method to obtain soft tissue surface zzso It is important to know the strain distribution of musculoskeletal structures and soft zzso This could help to better understand the mechanical loading of biological structures zzso the processes in fracture zzso These data could also be used to assist in the validation process for zzso zzso
