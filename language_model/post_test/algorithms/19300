zzso methodology and a statistical zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso proposed as an alternative method to the zzso eye irritation zzso This methodology has been successfully applied to a set of 46 neutral organic zzso which have been defined as zzso zzso or zzso The model allow to categorize correctly 37 out of 46 compounds, showing an accuracy of zzso Specifically, this model demonstrates the existence of a good categorization average of zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso compounds, zzso zzso of the model was carried out using two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showing a global predictability of the model of zzso and zzso zzso The average of coincidence of the predictions between zzso studies and train set were zzso zzso out of 46 zzso (41 out of 46 zzso proving the zzso of the model zzso zzso zzso distribution zzso is carried out in order to determine the intervals of the property where the probability of finding an zzso compound is zzso relating to the choice of find a false zzso zzso It seems that, until today, the present model may be the first zzso linear zzso equation able to discriminate between eye zzso and zzso zzso
