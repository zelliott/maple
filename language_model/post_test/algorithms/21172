zzso resonance diffusion zzso imaging zzso has been extensively applied to the spinal zzso for depicting its architecture and for assessing its integrity following spinal zzso However, zzso is limited in representing complex white matter architecture, notably in the presence of crossing zzso Recently, zzso imaging zzso has been proposed as a new method for recovering complex white matter zzso We applied this technique to both ex zzso and in zzso spinal cords of cats using a zzso zzso For the purpose of comparison, zzso have been applied in 55 and 100 zzso directions and zzso varied from 800 to zzso zzso As a result, zzso was able to retrieve crossing zzso information, where the zzso approach was constrained in a unique diffusion zzso To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the benefits of zzso for detecting the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the spinal zzso It is a first step towards in zzso characterization of the healthy and injured human spinal zzso using high angular resolution diffusion imaging and zzso
