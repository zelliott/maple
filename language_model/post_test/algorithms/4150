Joint zzso of zzso sensitivities and output image zzso is a promising approach that improves the reconstruction of parallel magnetic resonance imaging zzso However, when acceleration factor increases, the signal to noise ratio zzso of zzso reconstruction decreases as quickly as that of the conventional zzso Although sparse constraints have been used to improve the zzso reconstruction in recent years, these constraints only use the zzso of the output image, which cannot fully exploit the prior information of zzso In this paper, we use the zzso of zzso images, instead of the output image, to exploit more prior information for zzso zzso zzso phantom and in zzso experiments demonstrate that the proposed method has better performance than the zzso method and the constrained zzso method using the zzso of the output image zzso
