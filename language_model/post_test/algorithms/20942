From an external perspective, cognitive agent behavior can be described by specifying zzso correlations of a certain complexity between stimuli zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso From an internal perspective the agent's dynamics can be characterized by direct zzso zzso relations between internal and mental states of the zzso The latter type of specifications can be represented in a relatively simple, zzso format, which enables different types of analysis of the agent's zzso In particular, simulations of the agent's behavior under different zzso circumstances can be zzso Furthermore, by applying zzso techniques, automated analysis of the consequences of the agent's behavior can be carried zzso To enable such types of analysis when only given an external behavioral zzso this has to be transformed first into some type of zzso zzso An automated procedure for such a transformation is proposed in this zzso The application of the transformation procedure is demonstrated for a number of cases, showing examples of the types of analysis as mentioned for different forms of zzso
