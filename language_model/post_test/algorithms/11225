zzso and validation of zzso zzso targets are essential for understanding functions of zzso in gene zzso zzso zzso zzso allows direct identification of a huge number of zzso target sequences that contain zzso binding zzso By zzso data from zzso studies, we identified a comprehensive list of zzso zzso and target structure features that are essential for target binding by zzso in the 3' untranslated region zzso zzso coding sequence zzso region and zzso untranslated region zzso zzso of target zzso zzso zzso The total energy of zzso zzso a measure of target structural accessibility, is the only essential feature common for both seed and zzso sites in all three target zzso Furthermore, evolutionary conservation is an important discriminating feature for both seed and zzso zzso These features enabled us to develop novel statistical models for the predictions of both seed sites and broad classes of zzso zzso Through both zzso validation and zzso zzso our approach showed major improvements over established zzso for predicting seed sites and a class of zzso zzso Furthermore, we observed good performance from zzso zzso suggesting that our prediction framework can be valuable for broad application to other zzso species and zzso zzso binding site predictions enabled by our approach will greatly complement the available zzso data, which only cover small zzso of zzso and known zzso due to zzso levels of zzso Software and database tools based on the prediction models have been developed and are available through zzso web server at zzso
