zzso zzso produce analgesia in part by decreasing zzso neurotransmitter release from primary zzso zzso an effect that may be due to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether zzso decrease zzso currents (I zzso ) in primary zzso zzso identified by their response to the zzso agent zzso 

I was recorded from acutely isolated rat zzso root zzso zzso using the whole cell patch clamp technique before, zzso and after application of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was applied to each cell at the end of the zzso 

zzso reduced I zzso in a greater proportion of zzso cells (62 of zzso zzso than zzso cells (2 of 15, zzso P zzso zzso Among zzso cells, the decrease in I zzso was 38 zzso zzso zzso zzso 36, 1 zzso zzso in zzso cells just 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso 15, 1 zzso zzso P zzso zzso in zzso zzso Among zzso cells, I zzso zzso more rapidly in zzso cells zzso 52 zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso than in zzso cells zzso zzso 14 zzso zzso zzso 24; P zzso zzso This was not due to differences in the types of zzso channels expressed as the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso components of I zzso were zzso 

The results show that zzso zzso channels are expressed by very few zzso zzso but by more than half of zzso zzso The identity of the remaining zzso (and therefore presumed zzso zzso that express zzso zzso channels is unknown but may represent a potential target of future zzso therapies for acute zzso
