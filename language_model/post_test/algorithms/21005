X-ray zzso evolution in the imaging process plays a key role for zzso zzso zzso In this work we present a zzso zzso for the zzso zzso The theory is reformulated in terms of the zzso density and associated zzso zzso The zzso zzso enables an explicit and quantitative account of partial zzso effects on zzso zzso The presented formulas for zzso spectral density at the detector can be used for performing accurate phase retrieval and zzso the zzso zzso The concept of zzso zzso length derived from this zzso zzso zzso the spatial zzso requirement for zzso imaging with incoherent zzso The theory has been applied to zzso zzso zzso imaging as zzso The peak zzso condition derived reveals new insights into zzso zzso imaging and zzso zzso zzso zzso
