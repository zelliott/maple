The natural immune system provides an effective defense mechanism against foreign substances via complex interactions among various cells and zzso zzso introduced the immune network theory to model the relation between immune cells and zzso The immune system like the neural system is able to learn from zzso In this paper, a zzso immune network model is zzso The proposed model is zzso with Learning zzso zzso zzso and fuzzy set theory to present a new supervised learning zzso The new method is called zzso zzso zzso Network based on zzso approach zzso To evaluate the performance of the proposed method several experiments on benchmark zzso problems are carried out and the results are compared with two prominent zzso zzso as well as several versions of the zzso zzso The results of the experiments reveal that the proposed method yields a zzso zzso that can zzso data more accurately and more zzso
