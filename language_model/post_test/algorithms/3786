A new potential energy surface for the zzso + zzso system in the lowest zzso state is built using zzso zzso data calculated by Rogers et zzso zzso zzso zzso A 104, zzso zzso and the double zzso expansion zzso It incorporates a zzso model of long-range zzso which should play an important role at low collision zzso zzso zzso trajectory results at zzso zzso collision energy, show that the deeper van der zzso region described in this new surface translates into a four times higher cross section than that of zzso zzso zzso To confirm this hypothesis, a second surface was zzso The two surfaces are fitted with zzso zzso and differ mainly on the depth of the van der zzso zzso That difference in the van der zzso region zzso to a zzso lower cross section of the less deep surface, which is still three times higher than the equivalent results from zzso zzso zzso This study reflects the importance of a correct description of van der zzso forces on potential energy zzso
