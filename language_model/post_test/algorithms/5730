zzso valve zzso zzso has been described as one of the most common cardiac zzso abnormalities in zzso countries, and can result in sudden zzso This study focused on various feature selection mechanisms that might improve the zzso power of a zzso to diagnose zzso The experiment included selection mechanisms using classical greedy feature selection approaches zzso selection and backward zzso a genetic zzso zzso approach and a cellular zzso zzso zzso The main aim of this latest approach is to use CA with zzso for the data transformation phase of the knowledge discovery zzso The zzso approach produced better results than the classical greedy zzso The zzso of features produced by the zzso and CA approaches were most appropriate for the decision tree zzso for diagnosing zzso with the highest overall class zzso More importantly, the CA and zzso approaches were also capable of zzso some important knowledge concerning zzso zzso
