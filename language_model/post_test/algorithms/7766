zzso zzso lung zzso can be zzso by zzso into several tumor types, including zzso and zzso cell zzso The need for a uniform method of zzso lung zzso is growing as clinical trials reveal treatment and side effect differences associated with zzso zzso Diagnosis is primarily performed by zzso zzso However, the increased use of needle biopsy has diminished the amount of tissue available for zzso These changes in how lung zzso are diagnosed and treated suggest that the development of improved zzso zzso tools could improve patient zzso We used a zzso surgical zzso lung zzso retrospective cohort from a regional hospital to assess the association of a large number of proteins with zzso type by zzso Five of these zzso targeting the proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were combined into one test using a weighted zzso trained to discriminate zzso from zzso cell zzso zzso zzso on 600 zzso tissue array zzso with the zzso test was compared to standard zzso evaluation on surgical specimens in three independent lung zzso zzso zzso population of zzso zzso In addition, the zzso test was tested against the zzso panel zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Both the zzso test and zzso panel had similarly low zzso rates on the validation zzso compared to zzso diagnosis zzso vs zzso However the percentage of patients remaining zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was twice that of the zzso test zzso zzso zzso zzso The results of this study suggest the zzso test may have an immediate function in the clinic for helping zzso distinguish lung zzso zzso zzso The results also suggest that if validated in zzso defined clinical trials this zzso might identify candidates for targeted therapy that are overlooked with current diagnostic zzso
