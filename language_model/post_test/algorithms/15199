Copy number variation zzso an important source of diversity in zzso structure, is frequently found in clusters called zzso regions zzso zzso are strongly associated with zzso zzso zzso but the composition of these complex repetitive structures remains zzso 

We conducted zzso analysis of all mouse zzso using the high-speed and zzso search zzso zzso For eight zzso we identified various types of large zzso as zzso patterns within the zzso zzso A complex arrangement of diagonal split lines in the zzso indicated the presence of large zzso repetitive zzso We focused on one zzso on zzso 13 zzso and developed zzso a zzso zzso zzso method, to extract longer repetitive elements and to characterize repetitive structures in this zzso Analysis using zzso showed the existence of 60 core zzso which were expected to be the basic units that form zzso within the repetitive structure of zzso The demonstration that sequences zzso to the core elements zzso zzso covered approximately zzso of the zzso region indicated that our method can characterize the repetitive structure of zzso zzso Core elements were composed largely of fragmented repeats of a previously identified type, such as long zzso nuclear elements zzso together with partial zzso zzso Comparative zzso zzso array analysis showed that whereas 42 core elements were components of zzso that varied among mouse zzso 8 did not vary among strains zzso zzso and the status of the others could not be zzso The zzso core elements contained significantly larger proportions of long terminal repeat zzso types of zzso than the zzso core zzso which had no zzso The higher divergence rates observed in the zzso core elements than in the constant type indicate that the zzso core elements have a longer evolutionary history than zzso core elements in zzso 

Our methodology for the identification of repetitive core sequences zzso characterization of the structures of large zzso and detailed analysis of zzso The results of detailed structural and quantitative analyses in this study might help to zzso the biological role of one of the zzso on zzso zzso
