A novel method is presented to extract phase distribution from zzso zzso with unknown tilt phase zzso The proposed method can estimate the tilt phase shift between two zzso zzso zzso with high zzso by extending the zzso optical flow method with the spatial image processing and frequency zzso zzso With all the estimated tilt phase shifts, the phase component zzso in the zzso can be extracted by the zzso zzso Both simulation and experimental results have fully proved the feasibility of the proposed zzso zzso a zzso zzso optical element with zzso surface is tested by the proposed method with introduction of considerably large tilt phase shift amounts zzso the highest estimated tilt phase shift amount between two consecutive frame reaches zzso The phase extraction result is in good agreement with that of zzso zzso software under zzso testing conditions, and the residual difference between them is zzso In comparison with the previous methods, the proposed method not only has relatively little restrictions on the amounts or zzso of the tilt phase shifts, but also works well with zzso including open and closed fringes in any zzso
