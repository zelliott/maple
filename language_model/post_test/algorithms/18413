zzso zzso is a major problem zzso the mapping of disease genes responsible for complex genetic traits via linkage zzso A common feature of several available methods to account for zzso is that they involve maximizing a zzso likelihood to obtain maximum likelihood zzso The high zzso of the likelihood surface may be due to multiple zzso zzso zzso linkage zzso and/or zzso zzso corresponding to multiple zzso Here, we focus on this zzso zzso aspect of incorporating zzso by considering several likelihood zzso procedures, including the expectation zzso zzso zzso and the zzso expectation zzso zzso zzso The wide zzso of these procedures is demonstrated first through a general zzso of accounting for zzso and then by applying them to two specific zzso Furthermore, our simulation studies as well as an application to the zzso Analysis Workshop 12 asthma zzso show that, among other zzso zzso performs better than zzso As an aside, we illustrate a limitation of the popular zzso approach for incorporating zzso proved zzso We also show how to obtain standard errors zzso for zzso and zzso estimates, using methods available in the zzso These zzso can then be combined with the corresponding estimates to provide confidence intervals of the zzso
