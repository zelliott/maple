We investigate the chromatic zzso properties of silicon channel slot zzso in a broad spectral region centered at zzso zzso The variation of the zzso profile as a function of the slot fill factor, zzso the ratio between the slot and zzso zzso is zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso are zzso In general, two different zzso regimes are zzso Furthermore, our analysis shows that the zero and/or the peak zzso zzso can be tailored by a careful control of the geometrical zzso parameters including the zzso area, the slot fill factor, and the slot asymmetry zzso
