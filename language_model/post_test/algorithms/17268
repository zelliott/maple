The present study employs a computer simulation of the timing of normal and abnormal zzso zzso according to a re-entry zzso A wide variety of zzso patterns similar to those obtained in clinical settings may be simulated by using an zzso which is based on parameters such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso period, the zzso zzso between normal zzso and re-entry and the zzso zzso between one re-entry and a subsequent re-entry zzso By varying zzso and zzso the results of the simulation may show transition between different types of zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and more widely separated zzso zzso beats such as in concealed zzso The zzso provides a basis for the study of zzso a major mechanism in the genesis of zzso zzso
