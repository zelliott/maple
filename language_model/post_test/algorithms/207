The aim of the present study was to evaluate factors contributing to the differences between the overall stability zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The experiments were performed using zzso zzso method in wide pH zzso The overall stability zzso zzso were determined using the zzso zzso zzso zzso of eight different zzso with six zzso and zzso metal zzso were investigated in this zzso The authors employed a zzso zzso analysis, fixed effect model to describe the influence of particular variables affecting the stability of the analyzed complex zzso Four different variables were set at different levels zzso The zzso number zzso was the first zzso zzso determined the number of zzso molecules in the complex structure, and could take the values 1, 2 or zzso The second factor zzso was connected with the type of the metal zzso bonded in the zzso Since six different metal zzso were zzso the Me factor was described with six zzso The number of hydrogen or hydroxide groups zzso into the complex zzso was the third variable zzso with many levels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso f and zzso The last factor zzso described the type of the zzso used for complex zzso All variables analyzed here were statistically significant zzso value lower than zzso which indicates that all of them strongly affect the zzso zzso zzso interactions zzso zzso zzso and zzso between variables were also zzso which suggests that the effects of these variables were higher than we could calculate based on the effect of each variable zzso The zzso analysis has shown that the following factors Me, zzso and zzso were the most important for the stability of the zzso zzso zzso It was also found that according to the zzso factor zzso of zzso zzso all analyzed zzso formed stable complexes with zzso It was proved that the application of zzso for the entire zzso profile of analyzed zzso with zzso metal zzso was a valid technique for detecting the statistically significant differences in the zzso zzso Such information may be very useful for better understanding and interpretation of differences in zzso of zzso and their interactions with zzso and other zzso zzso
