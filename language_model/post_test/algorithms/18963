zzso zzso I hypersensitive zzso sites is an accurate method of identifying the location of genetic regulatory zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and locus control zzso We employed zzso sequencing and zzso tiled array strategies to identify zzso I HS sites within human primary zzso T zzso Combining these two technologies, we have created a comprehensive and accurate zzso open zzso zzso Surprisingly, only zzso of the identified zzso zzso I HS sites are found in promoters or first zzso of known zzso but nearly half of the most open sites are in these zzso In conjunction with zzso zzso and zzso zzso data, we find evidence of zzso zzso including the ability to identify zzso start sites and locations of different zzso marks zzso in these zzso In addition, and unexpectedly, our analyses have uncovered detailed features of zzso zzso
