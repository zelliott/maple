Here we propose an approach to include global structural information in the secondary structure prediction procedure based on hidden zzso models zzso of protein zzso We first identify the correct fold or zzso of a protein by means of the zzso of zzso families of zzso Then the most likely structural model for that protein is used to modify the sequence of secondary structure states previously obtained with a prediction zzso Our goal is to investigate the effect on the prediction accuracy of including global structural information in the secondary structure prediction zzso by means of the zzso We find that when the zzso of the predicted zzso of a protein is used to adjust the secondary structure sequence predicted originally with the zzso method, the zzso prediction accuracy zzso improves by zzso The zzso is correctly predicted in zzso of the zzso We conclude that this zzso based approach is a promising tool for effectively incorporating global structural information in the secondary structure prediction zzso
