In 1994, a collaborative zzso was set up between the University of zzso and the Chilean Air Force to design and build a low-cost 50 zzso zzso with zzso capable of monitoring the distribution and concentration of zzso zzso particularly over Chilean zzso This resulted in the joint design and development of the zzso monitoring experiment zzso which was flown on board the zzso zzso zzso launched in July 1998 into an 820 zzso altitude zzso zzso The zzso zzso measures the solar ultraviolet light zzso from the atmosphere in four spectral zzso From these raw zzso data, total column ozone zzso can be zzso Since the zzso a series of zzso zzso have been made over Chilean scientific stations, while continuous zzso zzso have been used to provide global zzso To date, the University of zzso has concentrated on these global zzso and has used a simplified ozone retrieval zzso to check the results zzso against ozone maps produced by NASA's Earth zzso Total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These initial results look promising, with apparently good correlation between the two zzso A novel, zzso retrieval zzso has been applied to the high-resolution data, and early results have shown agreement with the zzso
