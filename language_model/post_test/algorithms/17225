This paper describes a method for selecting a small, highly diverse subset from a large pool of zzso The method has been employed in the design of zzso synthetic libraries for use in zzso screening for pharmaceutical lead zzso It zzso diversity in terms of the main factors relevant to zzso zzso namely the three-dimensional arrangement of zzso bulk and of polar zzso and molecular zzso The method was used to select a set of 20 zzso suitable for use as zzso precursors in a zzso zzso The method depends on estimates of various zzso parameters involved in zzso zzso experiments examined the sensitivity of the method to these zzso This paper compares the diversity of randomly and rationally selected zzso zzso the results suggest that careful design of synthetic zzso libraries may increase their effectiveness zzso
