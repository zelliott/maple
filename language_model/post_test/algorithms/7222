The detection and zzso of anomalous behaviors in crowded scenes is considered, and a joint detector of zzso and spatial anomalies is zzso The proposed detector is based on a video representation that accounts for both appearance and zzso using a set of mixture of dynamic textures zzso These models are used to implement 1) a zzso zzso zzso detector that produces spatial zzso scores, and 2) a model of normal behavior that is learned from training data and produces zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso anomaly maps are then defined at multiple spatial zzso by considering the scores of these operators at progressively larger regions of zzso The zzso scores act as zzso of a conditional random field that guarantees global consistency of the anomaly zzso A data set of densely crowded pedestrian walkways is introduced and used to evaluate the proposed anomaly zzso zzso on this and other data sets show that the latter achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection zzso
