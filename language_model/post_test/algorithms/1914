This paper presents a zzso change detection framework for detecting relevant modifications in diffusion zzso with application to zzso zzso zzso and multiple sclerosis zzso The core problem is to identify image regions that are significantly different between two zzso The proposed method is based on zzso statistical testing which was initially introduced for zzso population zzso We use this method in the context of zzso change detection by considering several strategies to build sets of zzso characterizing the zzso of each zzso These strategies make use of the zzso existing in the diffusion weighted images zzso to a zzso zzso or in the spatial neighborhood of the considered zzso or a combination of zzso zzso on synthetic evolutions and on real data are zzso Interestingly, experiments on zzso patients highlight the ability of the proposed approach to detect changes in the zzso white matter zzso to conventional zzso that are related with physical status zzso zzso on zzso patients highlight the ability of the proposed approach to detect changes in evolving and zzso zzso zzso to conventional zzso These findings might open promising prospects for the follow-up of zzso and zzso zzso
