zzso zzso of growth hormone zzso has been observed in healthy controls as well as zzso zzso In healthy adults, highly regulated zzso zzso of zzso occur zzso times within 24 zzso This episodic pattern of zzso seems to be related to the optimal induction of zzso effects at the peripheral zzso In contrast to normal subjects, zzso patients demonstrate an irregular pattern of excessive zzso zzso This pattern of zzso is responsible for many systemic effects, such as the stimulation of zzso tissue growth, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, diabetes zzso and zzso Standard methods for the analysis of zzso patterns of hormone zzso did not consistently separate the zzso dynamics of zzso release in healthy controls and zzso patients under various study zzso Using the cutting edge technology of artificial neural networks for time series zzso we were able to achieve significant separation of both groups under various conditions by means of the predictability of their zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso results by using a more refined system of multiple neural networks acting in parallel zzso zzso of local zzso we found that this system performed a zzso zzso of hormone zzso It separated zzso of zzso bursts and zzso without any prior knowledge of the form of a zzso pulse or a model of zzso Comparing the zzso results for the zzso dynamics with those for zzso zzso zzso we were able to define the irregular pattern of zzso zzso in zzso as a random autonomous zzso The introduction of neural networks to the analysis of dynamic zzso systems might help to expand the existing zzso approaches beyond counting frequency and zzso of hormone zzso
