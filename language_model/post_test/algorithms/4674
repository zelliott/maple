The numbers of finished and ongoing zzso projects are increasing at a rapid rate, and providing the catalog of genes for these new zzso is a key zzso zzso a set of zzso genes is a basic requirement in the initial steps of any zzso zzso zzso An accurate set of genes is needed in order to learn about zzso properties, to train zzso programs, and to validate automatic zzso Unfortunately, many new zzso projects lack comprehensive experimental data to derive a reliable initial set of zzso 

In this study, we report a zzso method, zzso zzso zzso Genes zzso zzso for building a highly reliable set of gene zzso in the absence of experimental zzso We define a set of zzso protein families that occur in a wide range of zzso and present a mapping procedure that accurately identifies their zzso structures in a novel zzso zzso zzso includes the use of zzso zzso models to ensure the reliability of the gene zzso Our procedure allows one to build an initial set of reliable gene zzso in potentially any zzso zzso even those in draft zzso 

Software and data sets are available online at zzso
