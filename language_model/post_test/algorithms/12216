zzso zzso sludge blanket zzso reactor that was seeded with zzso sludge zzso to zzso was used to investigate the feasibility of zzso zzso of synthetic wastewater containing zzso zzso with additional zzso as carbon zzso Two sets of zzso zzso were operated at one zzso But the seeded sludge for the two zzso was different and zzso I was seeded with the sludge that was zzso to zzso completely for half a year, and zzso II was seeded with the mixed sludge that was zzso for half a year to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The degradation of zzso and the operation fee treating the wastewater are affected by the concentration of zzso zzso easily zzso zzso So the confirmation of the suitable ratio of zzso and zzso was the key factor of treating the wastewater containing zzso economically and zzso During the experiment, the synthetic wastewater with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso could be treated steadily in the experimental zzso zzso The removal efficiency of zzso was more than zzso and the removal efficiency of zzso was up to zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso was less than zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso could affect proper zzso zzso of zzso range in zzso that was required for maintenance of steady running of the experimental reactor with a zzso retention time zzso from 20 to 22 zzso zzso in zzso would directly affect the necessary zzso in zzso when the zzso reactor ran normally and treated the wastewater containing zzso When zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso respectively, zzso in zzso had to be controlled about zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to maintain the zzso reactor steady running normally and zzso ensure that zzso and zzso in zzso were less than 300 and zzso zzso zzso zzso With the increase of zzso in zzso the range of variation of zzso in zzso endured by the zzso reactor was zzso The ratios of zzso and zzso in zzso could affect removal efficiency of zzso and zzso the concentration of total volatile fatty acids zzso in zzso zzso quantity and methane content in zzso zzso in zzso was zzso or zzso correlated to zzso in zzso when zzso in zzso was zzso zzso zzso and so was the relationship between zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso when zzso in zzso was zzso or zzso zzso zzso less than the maximum permissible zzso The sources of seeded zzso the way of sludge zzso and the characteristics of zzso sludge could all affect the zzso reactor capacity treating zzso When zzso were less than zzso zzso zzso for zzso I and zzso zzso zzso for zzso II, the variation of zzso in zzso had little effect on the zzso reactor volume gas production rate and zzso gas production zzso And zzso and pH value in zzso were affected a zzso Volume zzso production rate and zzso zzso production rate of the zzso reactor were only affected by zzso and loading rate in zzso But when zzso was more than zzso zzso zzso for zzso II, the zzso production fell quickly and was over 3 days zzso zzso in zzso from zzso II increased up to zzso zzso zzso quickly and the pH value fell to less than zzso zzso II could not run zzso The component of zzso accumulated quickly was mainly zzso (above zzso With zzso increased from zzso to zzso zzso zzso gradually in zzso the methane content in zzso from zzso II decreased from zzso to zzso but the reactor could still run zzso Then as for zzso II, the content of methane have fallen from zzso to zzso or so zzso And zzso II could not run zzso So the conclusion could be zzso that too high zzso in zzso for zzso reactor mainly inhibited the activity of zzso bacteria cultures utilizing the zzso
