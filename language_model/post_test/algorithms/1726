zzso dynamics simulations have been performed to investigate the behavior of the zzso zzso liquid for conditions similar to those of zzso zzso To study the physics of zzso zzso a large system composed of approximately zzso zzso pairs was placed inside a platinum zzso and zzso zzso zzso and electrical zzso were calculated and compared with literature values, showing good agreement and zzso the use of a constrained dynamics model with a zzso zzso An electric field was applied to the system in the zzso direction and the fraction of zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso The threshold electric field for particle zzso was found to be zzso zzso consistent with other reported zzso
