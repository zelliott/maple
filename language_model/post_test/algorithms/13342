zzso motion characteristics of liver such as, zzso and zzso motion zzso difference in motion within different locations in the organ, and their complex relationship with the breathing cycles are particularly important for zzso liver zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate such motion characteristics based on zzso markers tracked with the zzso projections of the zzso scans, taken immediately prior to the zzso 

Twenty liver zzso patients were zzso Each patient had three zzso markers zzso zzso zzso implanted around the gross zzso The prescription ranged from 2 to 8 zzso per zzso The zzso projections data for each fraction zzso zzso for each patient, were analyzed and the zzso positions of the markers were extracted using an in-house zzso In total, zzso zzso zzso projections were analyzed from 85 zzso zzso From the zzso extracted positions, a zzso motion trajectory of the markers was constructed, from each zzso scans, resulting in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso location information of the markers with zzso zzso data zzso The authors then analyzed the zzso and zzso liver motion zzso within different locations in the organ, and as a function of the breathing zzso The authors also compared the motion characteristics against the planning zzso and the zzso zzso Medical Systems, Palo Alto, zzso breathing zzso Variations in the appropriate gating window zzso as the percent of the maximum range at which 50% of the marker positions are zzso between zzso were calculated as zzso 

The range of motion for the 20 patients were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the planning zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the treatment zzso for zzso zzso and zzso directions, zzso The range of respiratory period was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso s during the zzso simulation and the zzso scans, zzso The authors found that zzso zzso and zzso motions are highly zzso That is, all markers moved zzso also moved zzso and vice versa, irrespective of the zzso The zzso motion had a more variable relationship with the zzso motions, and appeared random with respect to the zzso That is, when the markers moved toward zzso direction, zzso of the markers moved to the zzso zzso of the markers moved to the zzso and zzso of the markers had zzso zzso The absolute difference in the motion magnitude between the zzso in different locations within the liver, had a positive correlation with the absolute distance between the markers zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gating window varied significantly for some patients, with the largest having zzso range between zzso 

This study analyzed the liver motion characteristics of 20 patients undergoing zzso A large variation in motion was observed, zzso and zzso and that as the distance between the markers increased, the difference in the absolute range of motion also zzso This suggests that zzso in closest proximity to the target be zzso
