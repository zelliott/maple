In this paper, it is shown that for a class of reaction networks, the discrete zzso nature of the reacting species and reactions results in qualitative and quantitative differences between the mean of exact zzso simulations and the prediction of the corresponding deterministic zzso The differences are independent of the number of molecules of each species in the system under zzso These reaction networks are open systems of chemical reactions with no zzso reaction zzso They are characterized by at least two stationary points, one of which is a zzso stable point, and one unstable trivial solution zzso based on a linear stability analysis of the deterministic zzso Starting from a zzso initial condition, the deterministic system never reaches the zero stationary point due to its unstable zzso In contrast, the result presented here proves that this zzso is a stable stationary state for the discrete zzso system, and other finite states have zero probability of existence at large zzso This result zzso previous theoretical studies and simulations of specific systems and provides a theoretical basis for analyzing a class of systems that exhibit such inconsistent zzso This result has implications in the simulation of infection, zzso and population zzso as it can be shown that for certain models the zzso simulations will always yield different predictions for the mean behavior than the deterministic zzso
