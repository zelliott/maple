A systematic approach to zzso water network has traditionally been zzso to exam and plan water conservation in industrial zzso In the present case study, zzso technology was used to analyze and zzso the water network of a steel plant near China's zzso zzso A system design was developed and a limiting constraint zzso zzso was identified based on investigations of water quality then the minimum freshwater and wastewater targets were determined without considering water zzso The analysis was then extended by calculating the additional input of freshwater required to balance the actual water zzso A zzso zzso zzso was used to distribute the freshwater and recycled water among each of the plant's zzso The results showed that with some reconstruction of the water network, the flow rates of freshwater and wastewater could be decreased by zzso and zzso zzso
