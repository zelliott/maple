The purpose of this study was to evaluate the evolution of zzso infected patients and to bring out some significant factors associated with this zzso The main criteria revealing the State of illness is viral load measurement zzso However the zzso zzso also represent an important marker as these reflect the State of the immune zzso Many studies have been carried out in this field and different models have been proposed with a view to a better understanding of this zzso zzso State zzso models defined in terms of zzso counts, or in terms of viral load, have proved to be very useful tools for zzso zzso disease zzso The model we have developed in this study is based on both the zzso zzso counts and zzso zzso models are characterized by transition zzso In this paper we explored several structures in zzso First, we used a homogeneous continuous time zzso process with four states defined by crossed values of zzso and zzso in a given patient at a given zzso Then, the effect of certain zzso on the infection process was introduced into the model via the transition intensity functions, as with a Cox zzso zzso Since the hypothesis of zzso may be unrealistic in certain cases, we also considered zzso homogeneous zzso zzso Finally, the effects of zzso and time were combined in a zzso homogeneous model with a zzso We applied these methods to data from zzso zzso patients included in the zzso zzso
