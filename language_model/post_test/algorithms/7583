Up to now, a zzso scheme that is robust against zzso attacks zzso is still a grand zzso Most image zzso zzso schemes in literature can survive individual global zzso zzso zzso zzso translation, and other zzso zzso but few are resilient to challenging cropping and local zzso The main reason is that robust features for zzso synchronization are only globally zzso rather than locally zzso In this paper, we present a blind image zzso zzso scheme against local transform zzso First, we propose a new feature transform named local zzso feature transform zzso which is not only globally but also locally zzso Then, the zzso space zzso zzso tree is used to partition the zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso tree, the location of each zzso is fixed under global zzso local zzso and zzso Lastly, the zzso sequence is embedded bit by bit into each leaf zzso of the zzso tree by using the zzso zzso index zzso zzso embedding zzso zzso results show that the proposed zzso scheme can survive numerous kinds of zzso including common zzso attacks, local and global zzso and zzso zzso
