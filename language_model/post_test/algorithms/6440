zzso segregation to stacking faults and coherent twin boundaries has been investigated in a zzso zzso zzso zzso heat-treated at temperatures of zzso 400 and 550 degrees C, using zzso gun transmission electron zzso Silicon enrichment was observed at the stacking fault plane and decreased zzso with increasing zzso zzso This increase in the concentration of zzso at the fault is due to the stacking fault energy being lowered at higher values of the zzso ratio of the zzso From a McLean zzso the binding energy for segregation was calculated to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Hardly any segregation was observed to coherent twin boundaries in the same zzso This is because a twin has a lower zzso energy than a stacking fault, so that the driving force for segregation is zzso
