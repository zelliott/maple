We present a fast zzso zzso method for the prediction of local zzso in zzso The program, zzso selects zzso fragments from a computer-generated database zzso zzso all possible zzso fragments up to twelve zzso acids zzso Each zzso is defined by a representative set of eight straight zzso pairs, obtained zzso from a trial set by calculating how fragments generated from them represent the protein zzso zzso zzso percent zzso of length five fragments in crystal structures, with a resolution better than zzso A and less than zzso identity, have a zzso in the database with less than 1 A zzso zzso zzso In order to select segments from zzso zzso uses a set of simple zzso zzso thus reducing the number of potential zzso to a manageable zzso This reduced set is scored and sorted using zzso fit to the anchor regions and a zzso energy function dependent on the sequence to be zzso The best scoring fragments can then be zzso by zzso of contact zzso and zzso fit to the core zzso The quality of the prediction made by zzso is evaluated by calculating both the differences in zzso and backbone zzso angles between the final model and the native zzso The average zzso ranges from zzso A for three zzso zzso to zzso A for eight zzso zzso
