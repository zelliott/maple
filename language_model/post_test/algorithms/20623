A zzso equation of the zzso type for mean firing rate is derived from the conventional membrane dynamics of a neural network with lateral zzso and zzso zzso selection mechanisms employed by the competitive neural network receiving external zzso are studied with zzso and zzso zzso A remarkable findings is that the strength of lateral zzso relative to that of zzso is crucial for determining the steady states of the network among three zzso different types of zzso Equal strength of both types of zzso connections leads the network to the well-known zzso zzso If, however, the lateral zzso is weaker than the zzso a certain number of zzso are activated in the steady states or the number of winners is in general more than one (the zzso zzso On the other hand, if the zzso is weaker than the lateral one, only one zzso is zzso but the winner is not necessarily the zzso receiving the largest zzso It is suggested that our simple network model provides a mathematical basis for understanding neural selection zzso
