During zzso zzso maturation in humans and flies, zzso and zzso cut the precursor transcript, thereby producing a short zzso zzso One strand of this duplex becomes a functional component of the zzso zzso Complex zzso while the other is zzso While zzso asymmetry of the duplex ends appears to play a decisive role in the strand selection process, the details of the selection mechanism are not yet zzso 

Here, we assess zzso strand selection bias in humans and fruit flies by analyzing the sequence composition and relative expression levels of the two strands of the precursor duplex in these zzso We find that the sequence elements associated with preferential zzso strand selection and/or rejection differ between the two zzso Further, we identify another feature that zzso human and fly zzso processing zzso the relative accuracy of the zzso and zzso zzso 

Our result provides clues to the zzso aspects of zzso strand selection in humans and other zzso Further, it indicates that human and fly zzso processing pathways are more distinct than currently zzso Finally, the observed strand selection zzso are instrumental in the rational design of efficient zzso expression zzso
