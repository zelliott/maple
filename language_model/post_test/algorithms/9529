Recent advances in zzso experimental methods for the identification of protein interactions have resulted in a large amount of diverse data that are somewhat incomplete and zzso As valuable as they are, such experimental approaches studying protein zzso have certain limitations that can be zzso by the zzso methods for predicting protein zzso In this review we describe different approaches to predict protein interaction partners as well as highlight recent achievements in the prediction of specific zzso zzso zzso zzso We discuss the zzso of zzso methods to different types of prediction problems and point out limitations common to all of zzso
