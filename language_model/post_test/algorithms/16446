In many important zzso problem settings, zzso simulations are zzso Examples are the reduction of zzso artifacts in magnetic resonance imaging and techniques, zzso the zzso currents interact with the biological system, like the zzso of the zzso due to zzso magnetic stimulation zzso zzso has become an important tool for the diagnosis and treatment of neurological diseases and psychiatric zzso A widely applied method for simulating the zzso currents is the zzso method zzso However, this method has to contend with an ill zzso problem and consequently a long convergence zzso When dealing with optimal design problems and sensitivity control, the convergence rate becomes even more crucial since the zzso solver needs to be evaluated in an zzso zzso zzso we introduce an independent IM zzso which improves the zzso and speeds up the zzso zzso This paper shows how zzso is based on IM and what are the zzso Moreover, the method is applied to the efficient simulation of zzso The proposed zzso achieves superior convergence properties with high time efficiency, compared to the traditional IM and is therefore a useful tool for accurate and fast zzso zzso
