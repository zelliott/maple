We have automated the determination of the placement location of the zzso zzso chamber within zzso zzso zzso fields, as part of streamlining the entire zzso quality assurance zzso This paper describes the mathematical zzso techniques to arrive at the appropriate measurement locations within the zzso dose maps of the zzso zzso A specific spot within the found region is identified based on its zzso radiation zzso location, area, and the avoidance of the zzso zzso The techniques used include applying a zzso zzso zzso region zzso and measurement point selection based on three zzso the size of the erosion operator, the zzso and the importance of the area of a region versus its zzso These three parameters are adjustable by the zzso However, the first one requires zzso in extremely rare occasions, the zzso requires rare adjustments, and the last zzso needs occasional zzso This zzso has been tested in over 50 zzso In about zzso of cases, the zzso does not find a measurement point due to the extremely steep and narrow regions within the zzso zzso In such cases, manual selection of a point is allowed by our code, which is also difficult to zzso since the zzso map does not yield itself to an appropriate measurement point zzso
