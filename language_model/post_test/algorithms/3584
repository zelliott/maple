zzso analysis based on high order statistics, introduced recently as a technique for revealing zzso relationships among interacting noisy zzso has been used to study the nature of the zzso between cardiac and respiratory zzso zzso blood flow signals recorded simultaneously by zzso zzso on both legs and arms were zzso zzso between cardiac and respiratory activity was also checked by use of zzso data and zzso of the zzso between the zzso and respiratory zzso zzso were made on six healthy males aged zzso zzso zzso were taken during spontaneous breathing (20 zzso and during paced zzso at zzso both lower and higher than that of spontaneous zzso zzso two or three recordings with a constant frequency in the zzso between zzso and zzso zzso At each paced frequency recordings were taken for 12 zzso It was confirmed that the dynamics of blood flow can zzso be considered in terms of coupled zzso and demonstrated that interactions between the cardiac and respiratory processes are weak and zzso and that they can be zzso zzso zzso was revealed to exist during both spontaneous and paced zzso When present, it was detected in all four blood flow signals and in the zzso between the zzso and respiratory zzso The episodes with zzso zzso were detected in 11 out of 22 recordings and lasted between 19 s in the case of high frequency zzso zzso and 106 s in the case of low frequency paced zzso zzso zzso
