zzso zzso zzso is induced by the zzso zzso zzso It results in an embryonic mortality occurring when infected males mate with zzso zzso The mechanism involved is currently unknown, but the mod zzso model allows interpretation of all observations made so zzso It zzso the existence of two bacterial zzso modification zzso and rescue zzso The mod function acts in the zzso zzso before zzso are shed from maturing zzso If zzso is affected by zzso zzso development will fail unless zzso is expressed in the zzso Interestingly, zzso is also observed in crosses between infected males and infected females when the two partners bear different zzso zzso demonstrating that mod and zzso interact in a specific zzso Two zzso strains are compatible with each other only if they harbor the same zzso zzso Here we focus on the evolutionary process involved in the emergence of new zzso types from ancestral zzso We argue that new zzso types are likely to evolve under a wider range of conditions than previously thought, through a zzso zzso First, new mod zzso can arise by zzso and spread by zzso This is possible because mod is expressed in males and zzso is transmitted by zzso Second, once such a mod zzso achieves a certain frequency, it can create the conditions for the deterministic invasion of a new zzso zzso allowing the invasion of a new mod zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that a stable zzso might be maintained in natural zzso allowing the long-term existence of zzso zzso zzso
