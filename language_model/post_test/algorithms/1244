Learning to store information over extended time intervals by zzso zzso takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, zzso error zzso We briefly review zzso (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, zzso method called long short-term memory zzso zzso the zzso where this does not do harm, zzso can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 zzso steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error zzso within special zzso zzso gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error zzso zzso is local in space and time; its zzso complexity per time step and weight is zzso Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, zzso and noisy pattern zzso In comparisons with real-time zzso learning, back propagation through time, zzso cascade zzso zzso zzso and neural sequence zzso zzso leads to many more successful runs, and learns much zzso zzso also zzso complex, artificial zzso tasks that have never been solved by previous zzso network zzso
