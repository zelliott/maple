The transport of water and zzso through zzso formed from carbon zzso ranging in diameter from 6 to 11 A is studied using molecular dynamics simulations under zzso pressure and equilibrium zzso zzso incorporating carbon zzso are found to be promising candidates for water desalination using reverse zzso and the size and uniformity of tubes that is required to achieve a desired salt rejection is zzso By calculating the potential of mean force for zzso and water zzso we show that zzso face a large energy barrier and will not pass through the zzso tubes studied zzso and zzso zzso type zzso but can pass through the wider zzso and zzso zzso Water, however, faces no such impediment due to the formation of stable hydrogen bonds and crosses all of the tubes studied at very large zzso By measuring this zzso rate under a zzso pressure difference, we show that zzso incorporating carbon zzso can, in principle, achieve a high degree of desalination at flow rates far in excess of existing zzso
