zzso zzso duration zzso is associated with increased mortality after zzso zzso zzso Only little data exist about its zzso ability and relationships to clinical variables in the present era of active treatment of zzso zzso and cardiac zzso We investigated whether zzso in high-resolution methods and standard zzso predict zzso events and cardiac death in zzso patients with cardiac dysfunction and how it relates to clinical zzso with a special emphasis on history of previous zzso 

Patients zzso zzso zzso with acute zzso and cardiac dysfunction had zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso registered at zzso Patients with a previous zzso had significantly longer zzso although their left zzso function was almost similarly zzso During the mean follow-up of 50 zzso 15 zzso zzso months, 32 patients died and 17 zzso of the deaths were classified as zzso zzso patients had an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso were significant zzso of zzso events and cardiac death, whereas zzso in zzso predicted only cardiac zzso In zzso analysis, zzso in zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso predicted only zzso events, whereas zzso in zzso was an independent predictor of cardiac zzso 

zzso zzso in zzso and zzso are powerful indicators of the zzso zzso in zzso patients with cardiac dysfunction, whereas prolonged zzso in standard zzso associates with increased risk of cardiac zzso
