The effectiveness of crossover in accelerating evolution in genetic zzso zzso is studied with a zzso finite population of bit zzso A zzso fitness landscape is zzso There is a single bit sequence zzso that is significantly more advantageous than all the zzso We study the time until domination of the advantageous zzso zzso Evolution proceeds with appearance, spread, and domination of the advantageous zzso The most important process determining zzso is the appearance zzso of the advantageous zzso zzso helps this creation process and enhances the rate of zzso To study this effect, we first establish an zzso method to estimate zzso with or without zzso Then, we conduct a zzso analysis using the frequency zzso representation of the population with the recurrence relations formulated after zzso zzso Finally, we carry out direct computer simulations with simple zzso operating on a population of zzso strings directly prepared in the computer memory to examine the performance of the two zzso zzso It is shown that zzso is reduced greatly by crossover with a mildly high rate when the zzso rate is adjusted to a moderate value and that an advantageous zzso has a fairly larger order (the number of zzso From these zzso we can determine zzso criteria for zzso which are useful when we are applying zzso to engineering problems having a conspicuously zzso fitness zzso
