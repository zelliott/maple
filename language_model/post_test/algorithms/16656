We extend the recently developed zzso zzso method to include an arbitrary number of zzso zzso assumes that the zzso and fields respond zzso to the density, without zzso The central task in zzso is the solution of the zzso equation for every time step, which is here done by a zzso zzso method which handles any zzso zzso The optical response of any zzso system can now be studied very efficiently in the near field zzso The improved zzso method is first applied to simple benchmark zzso a gold zzso in vacuum and embedded in zzso The surface zzso in these systems and their dependence on the zzso are reproduced in the new zzso zzso As a further application, we study a silver zzso structure for the optical detection of a zzso zzso zzso layer in water, where the layer is wrapping around part of the metallic zzso We show the zzso zzso shift in the spectrum due to the presence of the layer, for both zzso and zzso zzso systems with various zzso
