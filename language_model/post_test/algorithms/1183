Reconstruction zzso for transmission zzso have generally assumed that the photons reaching a particular detector bin at a particular angle originate from a single point zzso In this paper, we highlight several cases of extended transmission sources, in which it may be useful to approach the zzso of zzso zzso as a problem involving multiple transmission point zzso Examined in detail is the case of a fixed transmission line source with a zzso zzso This geometry can result in zzso images that have significant zzso zzso zzso it is also zzso zzso that extended transmission sources can result in biased estimates of the average zzso and an explanation is zzso The finite zzso resolution of the transmission line source zzso is modeled within zzso reconstruction using an zzso zzso that was previously derived for zzso zzso zzso from single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The same zzso is zzso to both problems because both can be thought of as involving multiple transmission zzso It is shown that modeling zzso blur within reconstruction removes the bias in the average estimated zzso and substantially improves the zzso resolution of zzso zzso
