The application of a zzso neural network zzso and a zzso zzso zzso for online identification of generator dynamics in a zzso power system are compared in this zzso An zzso model of an zzso which communicates information via the zzso zzso is zzso The neural network identifiers are used to predict the speed and terminal zzso zzso one zzso ahead of generators in a zzso power zzso The zzso is developed in two steps: zzso zzso centers determined by zzso zzso zzso and zzso output weights obtained by online zzso The sensitivity of the zzso to the zzso centers determined in the first step is evaluated on generators of different ratings and zzso Performances of the zzso and zzso are compared to evaluate zzso on the identification of generator dynamics under small and large zzso and to illustrate that zzso are capable of learning zzso dynamics of complex zzso
