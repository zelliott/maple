To evaluate the relative role of left and right zzso zzso and describe the functional anatomy of zzso during zzso tasks, we zzso the 128 papers of a former zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Of these, 59 articles reported zzso zzso providing 105 zzso language contrasts including 218 zzso compared to zzso on the left, a proportion reflecting the zzso language zzso To describe zzso zzso in each of the language contrasts involving both zzso we distinguished between unilateral and bilateral peaks, zzso having zzso zzso in the zzso in the same zzso We also calculated the proportion of bilateral zzso in the zzso While the majority of zzso zzso were unilateral zzso a reversed pattern was observed in the zzso this demonstrates that, in contrast to the zzso the zzso works in an zzso zzso To analyze the regional pattern of zzso zzso these unilateral and bilateral zzso were zzso clustered for each language zzso Most zzso zzso clusters corresponded to bilateral recruitment of auditory and motor zzso zzso the motor representation of the mouth and zzso working memory areas were exclusively zzso supporting the idea that the zzso does not host zzso zzso Right frontal participation was not specific for the language component involved and appeared related to the recruitment of zzso and working memory zzso The fact that zzso participation during zzso tasks was limited to these executive zzso is compatible with the hypothesis that active zzso is exerted from the zzso during the processing of zzso Only during zzso processing tasks a specific unilateral zzso involvement was noted, likely related to context zzso These results are consistent with zzso studies that found that the zzso has a limited zzso with no zzso abilities but active involvement in the processing of zzso
