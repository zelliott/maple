The authors sought to compare different zzso for dose reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coronary zzso zzso in a phantom zzso 

zzso CT dose index zzso was measured by using an zzso phantom in spiral cardiac mode (retrospective zzso zzso at five pitch values adapted with two zzso zzso pulsing windows using four zzso narrow pulsing window, with tube current reduction to zzso zzso and zzso zzso of peak current outside the pulsing zzso wide pulsing window, with tube current reduction to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Each zzso was applied at different heart rates zzso 60, 75, 90, 120 zzso 

Mean zzso volume zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for A, B, C and D, zzso zzso dose reduction was observed with protocols applying the zzso tube current reduction (B and zzso Using the conversion zzso for the chest, the mean effective dose was the highest for C zzso zzso and the lowest for B zzso zzso zzso pitch values zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the use of zzso zzso pulsing windows provided a significant decrease in the zzso with progressively higher heart rates zzso 60, 75, 90, 120 zzso despite using wider pulsing zzso 

zzso exposure with zzso using a narrow pulsing window significantly decreases when compared with a wider pulsing zzso When using a protocol with reduced tube current to zzso the radiation dose is significantly zzso
