Using bovine serum zzso zzso as the model zzso normal zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein were systematically studied for the first time using both solution and the drop coating deposition zzso zzso sampling zzso The zzso zzso zzso are dominated by the zzso zzso features that are strongly pH zzso Current zzso detection sensitivity obtained with a zzso zzso zzso is 45 zzso in terms of total protein consumption and zzso zzso at laser zzso zzso Unlike the zzso solution zzso zzso where the zzso zzso features are zzso concurrent zzso zzso and zzso zzso is observed in the zzso zzso of zzso While the zzso zzso zzso follows a single exponential zzso function with a time constant independent of the zzso labeling ratio, the zzso background zzso is much more complicated and it depends strongly on the zzso labeling ratio and sample zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso is believed to be due to zzso reaction of the zzso molecules in the zzso excited zzso The zzso zzso zzso involves both concentration zzso and zzso zzso and the latter may involve a zzso intermediate that is zzso inactive but zzso zzso
