zzso are fundamental for the degradation of zzso zzso having a key role in several important zzso and signaling zzso in the cell cycle and in zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso are widely used in molecular biology and zzso We developed a model, zzso zzso modeling zzso that describes the zzso of specific protein fragments generated by zzso zzso in different conditions, once the zzso zzso strengths are zzso zzso was tested on a variety of data available in the literature as well as on new degradation experiments performed with zzso of different sequences and zzso The comparison between in zzso and in zzso experiments was used to zzso the effect on degradation of the sequence and the length of target zzso of the presence of regulatory molecules such as zzso and of the type of zzso zzso zzso or zzso The model showed that the effect of the zzso regulatory zzso results in a modification of the gating functions of the zzso core zzso zzso zzso experiments suggested that this form of zzso which is involved in generating zzso I zzso presents modified zzso and gating zzso Our analysis improves the current understanding of the zzso of zzso zzso and provides a tool to zzso and predict the effect of key parameters during in zzso zzso zzso is publicly available on the web zzso
