zzso zzso zzso surface coils used in simultaneous zzso imaging are currently disregarded in PET zzso correction zzso since their position and individual geometry are unknown in zzso patient zzso The zzso of PET zzso data due to the presence of zzso surface coils has been investigated by several research groups but so far no automatic approach for the incorporation of zzso surface coils into PET zzso has been zzso In this work, an zzso is presented and evaluated which automatically determines the position of multiple zzso surface coils and zzso for their zzso of the PET zzso zzso 

The presented zzso zzso registers zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso templates of zzso surface coils into zzso maps used for PET zzso Transformation parameters are obtained by zzso zzso landmark registration of marker positions in the zzso zzso templates of the zzso surface coils to marker positions in the current MR images of the zzso The use of different marker patterns enables the registration zzso to distinguish multiple partly overlapping zzso surface zzso To evaluate the registration algorithm, two different PET zzso scans of a zzso standard body phantom with six active zzso and of a large zzso body phantom were performed on an integrated zzso zzso zzso The zzso were scanned with and without one zzso phantom zzso or three zzso body phantom zzso flexible zzso zzso surface coils placed on zzso Additionally, the accuracy and performance of the zzso were evaluated on volunteer scans zzso and on a patient scan using a typical clinical setup of three zzso surface zzso 

zzso loss of true counts due to the presence of the zzso surface coils was zzso for the zzso zzso zzso for the large body zzso and zzso for the patient zzso zzso local zzso of measured activity concentration up to zzso in the top part of the zzso and zzso for a zzso near the body surface of the patient was measured close to the high attenuating hardware components of the zzso zzso The zzso maps generated by the registration zzso reduced the zzso errors due to the zzso surface coils to values ranging from zzso to zzso zzso the volunteer zzso the zzso templates of the three zzso surface coils were registered to their correct positions with an overall accuracy of about 3 zzso 

The presence of flexible zzso surface coils leads to considerable local errors in the simultaneously measured PET activity concentration up to zzso especially in regions close to the zzso The presented automatic zzso accurately and reliably reduces the PET zzso errors caused by multiple partly overlapping flexible zzso surface coils to values of zzso or zzso
