We present an application of interactive global zzso and zzso zzso reality to architectural daylight modeling that allows designers to explore alternative designs and new technologies for improving the zzso of their zzso Images of a model in the real world, captured by a camera above the scene, are processed to construct a virtual zzso zzso To achieve interactive rendering rates, we use a hybrid rendering technique, leveraging zzso to simulate the zzso between diffuse patches and shadow volumes to generate zzso direct zzso The rendered images are then projected on the real model by four zzso projectors to help users study the zzso zzso The virtual zzso is a physical design environment in which multiple designers, a designer and a client, or a teacher and students can gather to experience animated zzso of the natural zzso within a proposed design by controlling the time of day, season, and zzso Furthermore, participants may zzso redesign the geometry and materials of the space by manipulating physical design elements and see the updated lighting zzso
