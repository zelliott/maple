Nerve zzso could be monitored by comparing zzso image zzso in time, as zzso muscles display increased signal intensity in STIR zzso In this study long-term zzso of STIR image intensity was assessed under clinical conditions and the required image intensity zzso correction was improved by using phantom scans obtained at multiple zzso 

zzso image intensity zzso was investigated in phantom zzso Next, over a three-year period, 190 clinical STIR hand scans were obtained using a standardized acquisition zzso and corrected for intensity zzso by using the results of phantom zzso The results of correction with 1, 3, and 11 phantom scans were zzso The image zzso in zzso tubes close to the hands were measured every time to determine the zzso of our zzso 

With zzso the zzso of STIR image intensity improved from zzso to zzso Image intensity zzso correction with 11 phantom scans gave significantly better results than correction with 1 or 3 zzso 

The image zzso in clinical STIR images acquired at different times can be compared directly, provided that the acquisition protocol is standardized and that zzso correction is zzso zzso correction is preferably based on multiple phantom zzso
