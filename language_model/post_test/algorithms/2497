zzso local field zzso in response to zzso presented tone bursts were recorded from the zzso zzso zzso of the inferior zzso zzso An oddball stimulus paradigm was used to study the sensitivity of ensembles of zzso in the zzso to novel zzso Our recordings indicate that zzso ensembles in the zzso display zzso adaptation when a large contrast in both frequency and probability of occurrence exists between the two tone bursts used for generating an oddball zzso A local field potential evoked by a tone burst presented as a zzso stimulus has a larger zzso than that evoked by the same sound presented as a standard zzso The difference between the two responses occurs after the initial rising zzso of their zzso zzso The degree of zzso adaptation increases with the rate of sound presentation up to zzso the highest rate used in this zzso A comparison between our results and those from previous studies suggests that differences exist between responses to oddball zzso in the zzso and those in the primary auditory cortex, a major source of projection to the zzso These differences suggest that local mechanisms exist in the zzso for suppressing neural responses to frequently presented sounds and enhancing responses to rarely presented zzso Thus, the zzso may serve as an important component of an zzso circuit in the brain for detecting novel sounds in the acoustic zzso
