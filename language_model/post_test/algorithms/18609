In this paper, the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium point and absolute stability of a class of neural networks with partially zzso continuous zzso functions are zzso The neural networks contain both variable and zzso zzso Using the zzso property, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium point of the neural networks is zzso By constructing proper zzso zzso functions and zzso zzso zzso involving both variable delays and zzso zzso using zzso theory, sufficient conditions for absolutely exponential stability are zzso
