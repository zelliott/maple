The zzso are a group of heart muscle diseases which can be inherited zzso zzso potential zzso proteins is important to understand mechanisms of zzso Experimental identification of zzso is costly and zzso In contrast, zzso approach has a competitive advantage over experimental zzso Based on zzso by zzso analysis, we zzso candidate proteins involving in human zzso We first built weighted human zzso zzso interaction networks for three zzso of zzso using the known disease proteins from Online zzso zzso in Man as zzso We then developed a method in zzso disease candidate proteins to rank candidate proteins in the network based on zzso by zzso zzso It was found that most candidate proteins with high scores shared zzso pathways with disease seed zzso These top ranked candidate proteins were related with the corresponding disease zzso and were potential zzso zzso zzso and comparison with other methods indicated that our approach could be used for the identification of potentially novel disease zzso which may provide insights into zzso mechanisms in a more comprehensive and integrated zzso
