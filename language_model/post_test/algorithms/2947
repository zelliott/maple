Noise abounds in different signal zzso zzso Even though the noise effects are extensively zzso the indirect influence of noise on other zzso section is seldom zzso In this work, the calcium signal induced and zzso by zzso release noise is zzso zzso results prove that the signal is more sensitive to the zzso zzso than to the often discussed zzso zzso This is an important finding for signal zzso in complex zzso which suggests that frequency fluctuations in the signaling cascade may have greater influence than the zzso zzso
