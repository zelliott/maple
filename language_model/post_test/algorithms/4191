A precise detection of volume change allows for better zzso the biological behavior of the lung zzso zzso tools with automated zzso zzso and zzso analysis of lung zzso may zzso zzso processes and give additional confidence to the zzso 

To compare two different zzso software zzso zzso zzso Median zzso zzso zzso in CT zzso measurement and to analyze the effect of soft zzso and hard reconstruction filter zzso on automated volume zzso 

Between January 2010 and April 2010, 45 patients with a total of 113 pulmonary zzso were zzso The CT exam was performed on a zzso zzso CT scanner zzso zzso Siemens, zzso zzso with the following zzso zzso zzso pitch, zzso zzso zzso reference tube zzso zzso zzso zzso measurement of each lung zzso was performed with the two different zzso zzso based on two reconstruction filters zzso and zzso The average relative volume measurement difference zzso and the limits of agreement between two methods were used for zzso 

At soft reconstruction filters the zzso system produced mean zzso volumes that were zzso zzso larger than those by zzso zzso The zzso was zzso with a limit of agreement between zzso and zzso volume measurement with soft filters zzso was significantly larger than with hard filters zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso respectively (both with zzso zzso measured greater volumes with both zzso zzso for soft and zzso for hard zzso respectively zzso and zzso 

There is a substantial zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso in lung zzso volume zzso therefore, it is mandatory to use the same equipment with the same reconstruction filter for the follow-up of lung zzso zzso
