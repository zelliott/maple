Recent advances in zzso technologies have provided an excellent opportunity to determine the complete biological characteristics of zzso zzso resulting in improved diagnosis and selection of zzso To accomplish this objective, it is important to establish a sophisticated zzso that can deal with large quantities of data such as gene expression profiles obtained by DNA zzso zzso 

Previously, we developed the zzso zzso resonance theory zzso filtering method as a gene filtering zzso This is one of the zzso methods that can select specific genes for each zzso In this study, we applied the zzso filtering method to analyze zzso data that were obtained from soft tissue zzso zzso patients for the extraction of zzso zzso The performance of the filtering method was evaluated by comparison with other widely used methods, such as zzso significance analysis of zzso and nearest zzso zzso In addition, various combinations of filtering and modeling methods were used to extract essential zzso zzso The combination of the zzso filtering method and zzso zzso zzso the highest zzso Seven genes among the 15 genes that are frequently selected by this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso known zzso marker genes for other zzso These genes are candidate marker genes for the diagnosis of zzso zzso analysis was performed to extract marker genes that were not selected by zzso Sixteen genes among those extracted are also known zzso marker genes for other tumors, and they could be candidate marker genes for the diagnosis of zzso 

The procedure that consisted of two steps, such as the zzso and the correlation analysis, was zzso The results suggest that novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets for zzso can be extracted by a procedure that includes the zzso filtering zzso
