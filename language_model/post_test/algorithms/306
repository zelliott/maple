zzso has become a de facto tool for zzso However, it suffers from a fundamental problem of poor contrast with increasing depth, as the illuminating light gets attenuated and scattered and hence can not penetrate through thick zzso The resulting zzso of light intensity due to zzso and scattering varies zzso across the zzso The classical space zzso zzso approaches alone are not suitable for the restoration of uneven zzso in zzso zzso In this paper, we present a novel zzso field theoretical approach to solve the contrast degradation problem of light zzso zzso We have confirmed the effectiveness of our technique through simulations as well as through real field zzso
