This paper is concerned with zzso robust stability for uncertain systems with zzso zzso The proposed method employs a suitable zzso functional for new zzso zzso Then, based on the zzso method, a zzso robust criterion is devised by taking the relationship between the terms in the zzso formula into zzso By developing a delay decomposition approach, the information of the delayed plant states can be taken into full consideration, and new zzso sufficient stability criteria are obtained in terms of linear zzso zzso zzso which can be easily solved by various zzso zzso zzso examples are included to show that the proposed method is effective and can provide less conservative zzso
