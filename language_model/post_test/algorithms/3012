zzso and zzso of fluorescent signals in relation to other zzso structures is an important task in various biological zzso Many methods for analysis of zzso zzso image data are limited to zzso As cells are in fact zzso structures, there is a growing need for robust methods for analysis of zzso zzso This article presents an approach for detecting zzso fluorescent signals and analyzing their zzso zzso Cell zzso are delineated using zzso zzso zzso watershed zzso zzso object and background seeds are given as zzso and zzso information defines merging and splitting zzso zzso signals are detected using a modified stable wave detector and localized in relation to the nuclear membrane using distance zzso The method was applied to a set of biological data studying the zzso of zzso protein complexes in relation to the nuclear zzso zzso complexes appear as early as 1 zzso after stimulation while the highest signal concentration is observed 45 zzso after zzso followed by a concentration zzso The robust zzso signal detection and concentration measures obtained using the proposed method agree with previous observations while also revealing new information regarding the complex zzso
