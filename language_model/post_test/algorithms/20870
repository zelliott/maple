The isolation of single units in zzso recordings involves zzso zzso lower zzso allows a constant threshold to be applied in order to identify and extract action potential zzso However, standard methods such as zzso zzso filtering perform this frequency zzso at a cost of zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we apply zzso decomposition and reconstruction as a filter for zzso data and demonstrate its ability to better preserve spike zzso For the majority of cells, this approach also improves spike zzso ratio zzso and increases cluster zzso Additionally, the described technique is fast enough to be applied zzso
