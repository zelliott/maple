Analysis of zzso flow zzso data is traditionally based on the judgment of an expert, generally time zzso sometimes incomplete and often zzso in zzso In this article, we investigate another statistical method using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to identify regions of interest between two groups of zzso flow zzso zzso The metric used to differentiate between the groups of zzso zzso in zzso is the zzso distance zzso zzso The performance of the zzso is evaluated by applying it to a known zzso data set looking at zzso of zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso treatment and comparing the results to the expert zzso The zzso is then applied to a zzso data set used to study the effects of zzso human zzso zzso on several zzso bone zzso zzso zzso was used to identify regions of interest in the data and results compared to expert analysis and the current state-of-the-art statistical method, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was then performed to identify zzso responding differently to zzso Expert analysis, zzso and zzso identified regions in the data that showed zzso of zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso In the zzso treated data sets, the expert and zzso identified a dose responsive expansion of only the zzso precursor zzso In contrast, zzso resulted in identification of regions of interest both in the zzso precursors as well as in other bone zzso zzso zzso within the regions of interest defined by zzso resulted in identification of four zzso of zzso precursors that are zzso distinct and show a differential response to zzso zzso Greatest expansion is seen in the zzso and zzso zzso populations with zzso Identification of populations of interest can be performed using zzso in less zzso time efficient, biologically zzso manner that corroborates with the expert zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso cells or their immediate precursors are an important target for the effects of zzso in zzso bone zzso The zzso zzso of the method described in the article, both experimental data and other supplemental materials are freely available at zzso
