zzso resonance assignment is one of the key steps in solving an zzso protein zzso The assignment process links resonance zzso to individual zzso of the target protein zzso providing the prerequisite for establishing zzso and zzso spatial relationships between zzso The assignment process is tedious and zzso which could take many zzso Though there exist a number of computer programs to assist the assignment process, many zzso labs are still doing the assignments manually to ensure zzso This paper presents a new zzso method based on our recent work towards zzso the assignment process, particularly the process of backbone resonance peak zzso We formulate the assignment problem as a constrained weighted zzso matching zzso While the problem, in the most general situation, is zzso we present an efficient solution based on a zzso zzso with effective zzso techniques and a greedy filtering zzso for reducing the search zzso Our experimental results on 70 instances of zzso real zzso data derived from 14 proteins demonstrate that the new solution runs much faster than a recently introduced zzso zzso zzso and recovers more correct peak assignments than the zzso zzso
