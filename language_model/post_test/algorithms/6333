The incorporation of prior phase information into a zzso zzso has been shown to strengthen model zzso However, the currently available likelihood refinement target using prior phase information has zzso the zzso refinement target considers experimental phase information indirectly and zzso in the form of zzso zzso Furthermore, the current refinement target implicitly assumes that the prior phase information is independent of the calculated model structure zzso This paper describes the derivation of a zzso likelihood function that overcomes these shortcomings and directly incorporates experimental phase information from a zzso anomalous zzso zzso zzso This function, which simultaneously zzso zzso and model zzso has been implemented in the refinement program zzso The zzso function used in conjunction with the automated zzso procedures of zzso leads to a successful solution when current likelihood functions fail in a test case zzso
