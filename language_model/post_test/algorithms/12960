In this paper, I systematically investigated zzso zzso zzso zzso a novel technique for zzso detection of chemical molecular zzso I first derive the zzso enhancement factor and noise characteristics of the technique using a generic theoretical model, followed by zzso analysis of a design example using zzso glass zzso zzso zzso for sensor material selection and device design are formulated based on the theoretical zzso The zzso analysis shows that this technique features a record zzso enhancement factor of zzso with respect to conventional zzso zzso infrared zzso zzso and is capable of detecting zzso chemical vapor molecules down to the zzso level with a moderate cavity quality factor of zzso and a pump laser power of zzso zzso Such performance qualifies this technique as one of the most sensitive methods for chemical vapor zzso zzso
