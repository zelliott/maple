The aim of this study was to investigate the local zzso and zzso target efficiency of zzso zzso zzso dry powder inhalation zzso by comparing lung zzso lining fluid zzso and plasma zzso levels after zzso administration zzso with those after intravenous zzso Twelve rats were divided into two groups, one of which was given zzso zzso (20 zzso via the trachea and the other was given the same dose zzso by intravenous injection zzso zzso each group was subdivided into two zzso The concentration of zzso in the zzso was determined by zzso in one group while the concentration of zzso in plasma was determined in the other zzso After zzso zzso (20 zzso was given via the zzso zzso achieved a high local concentration in zzso and reached a zzso at zzso h in zzso After the same dose zzso was given by zzso zzso reached a zzso in zzso at zzso zzso The zzso ratio zzso after zzso differed significantly from the ratio zzso observed after intravenous administration zzso zzso zzso All these results indicate that zzso zzso can be delivered to a specific targeted site and achieve high target efficiency in zzso zzso could be a useful drug delivery system for zzso therapy of pulmonary zzso
