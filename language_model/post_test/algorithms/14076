It is now quite well accepted that the evolutionary past of certain species is better represented by zzso networks as opposed to zzso For example, zzso are typically thought to have resulted through zzso and duplication, processes that are probably not best represented as zzso zzso zzso Based on the knowledge of a zzso tree relating collection of zzso we present a zzso construction of a zzso network that exhibits the zzso In addition, we prove that the resulting network is in some zzso sense a minimal network having this zzso
