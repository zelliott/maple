zzso regulation often controls key branch points in zzso zzso zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso produces zzso using zzso and zzso The proposed chemical mechanism in zzso with other zzso zzso involves multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A is an zzso and zzso a zzso association zzso protein known to regulate zzso zzso is an zzso inhibitor of zzso Steady state zzso using zzso to study the first half and the full zzso cycle suggested that the regulators act at different steps in the overall zzso To explore the modes of regulation and to test the effects on individual zzso steps, we performed circular zzso zzso studies using a zzso zzso analog and determined the distribution of zzso zzso zzso during the steady state of the zzso reaction using one-dimensional zzso zzso carbon zzso single quantum zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso A acts as a mixed V and K type zzso and predominantly affects the zzso zzso zzso does not inhibit the formation of the zzso analog and does not affect the zzso of the zzso zzso intermediate derived from zzso however, it decreases the abundance of the product zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Thus, the two regulators act on different halves of the zzso cycle in an unusual regulatory zzso
