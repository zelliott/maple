In the absence of a zzso structure of the target zzso to propose the zzso requirements for a small zzso to exhibit a particular zzso one must supply both a zzso zzso and a zzso rule for every active zzso Our strategy identifies both zzso We first generate and zzso all low-energy zzso by any suitable zzso For each zzso we then use zzso to calculate the location of points to be considered as part of the zzso These points include atoms in the zzso and projections from the zzso to zzso donors and zzso or charged groups in the binding zzso These positions and the relative energy of each zzso are the input to our new program zzso It uses a zzso method to find zzso that contain at least one zzso of each zzso and zzso numbers of point types and zzso zzso is zzso for example, it takes about 1 zzso CPU to propose zzso from 21 zzso of seven zzso We typically run zzso several times to compare alternative zzso zzso For zzso zzso zzso zzso shows that the newer zzso fit the traditional zzso Using site points correctly identifies the zzso zzso of zzso to compare with zzso whereas using only zzso points leads to selecting the inactive zzso for the zzso zzso In addition, zzso reproduces zzso maps of zzso in the literature and proposes subtle zzso Our experience suggests that zzso methods will find many applications in zzso chemistry and zzso molecular zzso
