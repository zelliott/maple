zzso zzso zzso zzso prostate needle biopsy requires registering zzso zzso zzso or MR image, in which tumors and other suspicious areas are visible, to zzso zzso zzso zzso Such image registration is time-consuming while its real-time zzso is yet to be zzso To bypass this registration step, robotic needle biopsy systems can be used to place the US probe at the same position relative to the prostate during the zzso and zzso image acquisition to ensure similar prostate zzso To have such similar zzso only visual feedback is not sufficient as such feedback can be used to only guarantee that the whole prostate is within the field of view irrespective of the zzso zzso As such, contact pressure feedback can be zzso to ensure consistent minimum contact between the probe and zzso 

A robotic system is proposed where a zzso probe with pressure sensor array is zzso The contact pressure can be measured during imaging and used to provide feedback in conjunction with an zzso zzso for consistent probe zzso The robotic system is driven by the feedback to position the probe such that pressure pattern of the sensors during zzso image acquisition is similar to the pressure pattern during zzso image zzso The proposed method takes into account the patient's body movement expected during image zzso In this study, an in zzso phantom is used where the simulated contact pressure distribution required in the zzso zzso is obtained using a prostate finite element zzso 

Starting from an arbitrary position where the probe contacts the zzso this position was varied systematically until a position corresponding to maximum pressure pattern similarity between contact pressure patterns corresponding to the zzso and zzso imaging was achieved zzso 

zzso obtained from the in zzso phantom study indicate that the proposed technique is capable of ensuring having only minimal relative prostate deformation between zzso image acquisition and zzso imaging used for guiding needle zzso paving the way for faster and more accurate zzso
