Most available ultrasound imaging simulation methods are based on the spatial impulse response zzso The execution speed of such a simulation is of the order of days for one zzso frame using zzso zzso For some applications, the accuracy of such rigorous simulation approaches is not zzso This work outlines a much faster 3-D ultrasound imaging simulation approach that can be applied to tasks like simulating 3-D ultrasound images for zzso The increased speed of the proposed simulation method is based primarily on the approximation that the point spread function is set to be zzso zzso which is a reasonably good approximation when using polar coordinates for simulating images from phased zzso with constant zzso zzso images are found as the zzso of the zzso and an object of sparsely distributed zzso The zzso are passed through an zzso filter before zzso into a regular zzso grid to reduce the bandwidth and significantly reduce the amount of zzso A comparison with the well-established simulation software package Field II has been zzso A simulation of a zzso image using the same input object was found to be in the order of zzso times slower than the presented zzso Following these considerations, the proposed simulation method can be a rapid and valuable tool for working with 3-D ultrasound imaging and in particular 3-D zzso
