One of the most important issues in power system restoration is zzso caused by zzso zzso These zzso might damage some equipment and delay power system zzso This paper presents a zzso basis function neural network zzso to study zzso switching zzso To achieve good zzso capability for developed zzso equivalent parameters of the network are added to zzso zzso The developed zzso is trained with the worst-case scenario of switching angle and zzso flux and tested for typical zzso The simulated results for a partial of zzso New England test system show that the proposed technique can estimate the peak values and duration of switching zzso with good zzso
