The zzso lifetimes of zzso zzso complexes of zzso zzso zzso zzso are substantially longer than those of their zzso counterparts in room temperature zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso of the longer lived species by the shorter lived species may be studied by analyzing the zzso profile following zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments were carried out for three zzso pairs of zzso complexes (where X zzso zzso zzso and zzso For the zzso system in zzso it was determined that energy transfer was occurring between the zzso and zzso zzso Although the rate constant of energy transfer was too fast to measure zzso it could be bracketed as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For this reaction it was possible to measure an equilibrium constant which was very near zzso For zzso in zzso it was also established that energy transfer was occurring and rate zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined by a zzso zzso For zzso zzso in zzso no energy transfer was observed, which implies that the rate constant is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Because these zzso reactions represent zzso energy transfer and are thus zzso we are able to analyze the results using Marcus theory and draw some conclusions about the relative importance of nuclear reorganization and electronic factors in the overall zzso
