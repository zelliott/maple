zzso of a zzso structure from its zzso acid sequence is a key issue in molecular zzso While zzso performed in the space of two-dimensional contact zzso zzso the necessary zzso search, it may also lead to maps that do not zzso to any real three-dimensional zzso To remedy this, an efficient procedure is needed to reconstruct three-dimensional zzso from their contact zzso 

We present an efficient zzso to recover the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its contact map zzso We show that when a physically zzso map is used as target, our method generates a structure whose contact map is essentially similar to the zzso zzso the reconstructed and original structures are similar up to the resolution of the contact map zzso Next, we use zzso target zzso obtained by zzso a physical one; in this case, our method essentially recovers the underlying physical map and zzso zzso our zzso will help to fold zzso using dynamics in the space of contact zzso Finally, we investigate the manner in which the quality of the recovered structure degrades when the number of contacts is zzso 

The procedure is capable of assigning quickly and reliably a three-dimensional structure to a given contact zzso It is well suited for use in parallel with dynamics in contact map space to project a contact map onto its closest physically allowed structural zzso
