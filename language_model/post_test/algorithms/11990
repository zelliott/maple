We apply a linear zzso model to zzso failure time zzso zzso of the zzso parameters involves the zzso method in an zzso zzso Carlo zzso algorithm, wherein the zzso Carlo zzso is implemented using the zzso zzso From simulation studies, this approach compares favorably with the marginal independence approach, especially when there is a strong zzso zzso
