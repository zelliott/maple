zzso evaluating statistical independence among random variables is a key element of independent component analysis zzso In this letter, we employ a zzso zzso of mutual information as an independence measure and give its zzso zzso Our basic idea is to estimate the ratio of probability zzso directly without going through density zzso thereby avoiding the difficult task of density zzso In this density ratio approach, a natural zzso procedure is available for zzso zzso Thus, all tuning parameters such as the kernel zzso or the zzso zzso can be zzso zzso This is an advantage over recently developed zzso independence measures and is a highly useful property in zzso learning problems such as zzso Based on this novel independence measure, we develop an zzso algorithm, named zzso independent component zzso
