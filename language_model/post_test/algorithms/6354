The purpose of the study was to design and investigate the zzso zzso system zzso with a mean zzso pressure zzso controller in zzso zzso zzso consists of a zzso PC, a blood pressure sensor and an infusion zzso The C language computer program sets the zzso infusion rate based on an empirical zzso including zzso component to maintain the measured zzso more closely to the target zzso zzso of patient standard zzso The zzso zzso were calculated by the zzso model differential equations solving every zzso zzso was used in 214 zzso zzso patients, aged zzso undergoing various zzso zzso The mean target zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The measured and target zzso difference did not exceed zzso zzso The zzso index varied from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a variation of the zzso site effect concentration ranging from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso It was a closed negative correlation zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso between the zzso site effect and the zzso during the initial period of zzso There were not any significant changes in the blood zzso level during the zzso The recovery time was zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso of patients were zzso in the operating zzso
