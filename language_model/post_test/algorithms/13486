zzso continuous zzso monitoring zzso sensors are still at an early stage of development, but, in the near future, they could become particularly appealing in diabetes zzso zzso Monitoring AG zzso zzso has proposed an approach for zzso based on a zzso concept, embedding primarily zzso zzso and optical zzso This concept requires a mathematical model able to estimate zzso levels from the 150 channels directly measured through the zzso A zzso zzso linear zzso model (with order and parameters common to the entire population of subjects) was proposed for such a scope zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The aim of this work is to evaluate the accuracy in the zzso of zzso levels and trends that the zzso zzso platform can achieve by exploiting different techniques for model zzso zzso ordinary least squares, subset variable selection, partial least squares and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator zzso Data collected in human beings monitored for a total of 45 study days were used for model identification and model zzso Several metrics of standard use in the diabetes scientific community to measure point and clinical accuracy of zzso sensors were used to assess the zzso zzso indicate that the zzso technique is superior to the others shrinking many channel weights to zero thus leading to zzso zzso profiles and resulting in a more robust model to possible artifacts in the zzso zzso zzso as expected, the performance of the zzso system with the zzso model is not yet comparable with that of zzso needle zzso sensors, zzso trends are zzso zzso Considering the zzso nature of the zzso platform, this result can have an immediate impact in the current clinical practice, zzso to integrate sparse zzso of blood zzso data with an indication of the zzso trend to aid the diabetic patient in dealing with, or even preventing in the short time scale, the threats of critical events such as zzso
