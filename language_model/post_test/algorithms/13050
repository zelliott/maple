The near infrared zzso zzso of zzso zzso are fully interpreted here by applying a method developed for efficient automatic zzso of both the infrared wave numbers and the zzso The employed procedure uses parallel zzso multiple window zzso interaction wave functions, the zzso zzso algorithm, which incorporates both the mechanical and the electric zzso zzso It is shown that inclusion of zzso is crucial for correctly assigning the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the infrared spectrum of the target system, for which conflicting assignments are found in zzso
