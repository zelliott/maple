The peripheral nervous system carries sensory and motor information that could be useful as command signals for function restoration in areas such as neural zzso and functional electrical stimulation zzso Nerve cuff zzso provide a robust and safe technique for recording nerve zzso However, a method to separate and recover signals from individual zzso is zzso Prior knowledge of the zzso geometry was used to develop an zzso which assumes neither signal independence nor detailed knowledge of the zzso zzso and is zzso to any zzso zzso zzso When used to recover zzso activities from simulated nerve cuff recordings in a realistic human zzso nerve model, this zzso zzso separates signals as close as zzso zzso with zzso zzso R zzso zzso zzso zzso Ten simultaneous signals could be recovered from individual zzso with only a zzso decrease in R compared to a single zzso At high noise levels zzso sources were localized to 180 zzso 170 zzso in the 12 zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso sources and using the resulting positions in the recovery zzso yielded R zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso noise for five simultaneous zzso signals from synergistic zzso These recovered signals should allow natural, zzso zzso control of multiple zzso prosthetic devices and zzso zzso
