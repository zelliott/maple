During zzso zzso the fluctuation of the force output of muscles increases as the muscle zzso and the contraction is sustained to zzso We analyzed motor unit firing data from the zzso zzso muscle to investigate which motor unit control parameters were associated with the increased force zzso zzso performed a sequence of zzso zzso zzso sustained at zzso zzso force, each spaced by a zzso rest zzso The zzso were performed until the mean value of the force output could not be maintained at the desired zzso zzso zzso signals were detected with a zzso zzso zzso The zzso signals were zzso to identify all of the zzso of several motor units by using an artificial zzso set of zzso We were able to follow the behavior of the same motor units as the endurance time zzso The force output of the muscle was filtered to remove contributions from the tracking zzso The zzso of variation of the force was found to increase with endurance time zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We calculated the zzso of variation of the firing rates, the synchronization of pairs of motor unit zzso the zzso value of the firing rates of pairs of motor units, the zzso of the firing rates of motor units and the force, and the number of motor units recruited during the zzso Of these zzso only the zzso of the firing rates zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the number of recruited motor units zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased significantly with endurance time for grouped zzso A significant increase zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of the firing rates and force was also zzso It is suggested that the increase in the zzso of the firing rates is likely due to a decrease in the sensitivity of the zzso feedback from the zzso
