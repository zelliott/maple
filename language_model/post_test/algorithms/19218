Most commonly drug zzso is evaluated with a reference dosing given on separate zzso The assumption that no change in drug disposition is taking place between the drug administrations is often violated resulting in errors in the zzso A novel zzso method is presented which exactly compensates for a change in drug zzso The method is based on a model independent disposition zzso zzso The distribution function is obtained from an zzso administration by disposition zzso This distribution function is assembled together with the elimination zzso containing the zzso clearance to construct the zzso disposition function in the subsequent disposition zzso zzso The zzso zzso response is finally zzso using the corresponding zzso disposition zzso It is shown that the zzso clearance can be obtained from the zzso terminal disposition phase once the distribution function has been obtained from an zzso zzso The proposed method is implemented in an zzso and computer program zzso and demonstrated using human zzso drug level data from an zzso and oral zzso The usage of zzso is identical to zzso previously zzso It requires only regular sums of zzso to be fitted to drug level zzso Such fittings are routinely done in zzso thereby enabling zzso to be implemented very zzso
