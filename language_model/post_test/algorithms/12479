This work shows zzso aspects of zzso pattern recognition in auditory evoked zzso A linear and a zzso transformation based on zzso transform are zzso They result in a statistical error model and an zzso function related to the Gibbs function and describe changes in zzso auditory evoked zzso induced by general zzso The same transformations were calculated using 12 common zzso We present a method to compare the two defined zzso with respect to their ability to discriminate two defined states which is responsive and unresponsive depending on the zzso used for the zzso zzso evoked zzso of 60 patients undergoing general zzso were zzso We propose the defined statistical error model and the zzso function as a very robust measure of changes in auditory evoked zzso The influence of the zzso suggest that for each zzso the goodness of the zzso should be zzso
