We are using zzso zzso zzso zzso to image structure and function of the developing embryonic heart in avian zzso Fast zzso imaging produces very large zzso zzso + zzso and zzso zzso volumes + zzso data sets, which greatly challenge ones ability to zzso zzso Noise in zzso images poses additional zzso We created an zzso with a zzso data set specific zzso for reduction of both shot and zzso noise and applied it to zzso zzso and image zzso in zzso When compared to baseline zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso basic zzso zzso a panel of experts judged the new zzso to give much improved volume renderings concerning both noise and zzso zzso Specifically, the zzso provided a better zzso of the zzso and zzso surfaces, and the interaction of the embryonic heart tube with surrounding zzso zzso evaluation using an image quality figure of merit also indicated superiority of zzso new zzso Noise reduction aided zzso zzso image zzso as zzso evaluated using a zzso distance measure with respect to an expert segmented zzso In conclusion, the noise reduction zzso should be quite useful for zzso and quantitative zzso zzso heart volume, stroke volume, contraction zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso With its zzso data set specific zzso we believe that the zzso can be applied to zzso images from other zzso
