Here we propose a simple statistical zzso for rapidly scoring zzso associated with disease or traits due to zzso zzso or deletions using zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso data in unrelated zzso This zzso identifies zzso by defining zzso segments of the zzso present at significantly different zzso between cases and zzso We found that false positive zzso could be effectively removed from the output of this procedure by applying different physical size thresholds for the zzso zzso This procedure is then conducted zzso using random zzso until the number of selected zzso zzso We demonstrate this method in a publicly available data set for Alzheimer's disease and identify 26 candidate risk zzso in the 22 zzso In this data set, these zzso can explain zzso of the genetic risk zzso of the zzso
