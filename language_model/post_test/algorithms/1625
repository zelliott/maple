This paper presents a new zzso method for spectral zzso that performs decimation by any factor, it makes use of the full set of data and brings further apart the poles under consideration, while imposing almost no constraints to the size of the zzso zzso zzso zzso as decimation zzso It is compared against two previously proposed techniques for spectral zzso (along with derived zzso zzso that lie among the most promising methods in the field of zzso where accuracy of zzso zzso is of utmost zzso Moreover, it is compared against a state-of-the-art purely zzso method proposed in zzso zzso performed on simulated zzso signals prove the new method to be more zzso especially for low zzso zzso
