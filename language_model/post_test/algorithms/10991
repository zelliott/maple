This study aims to investigate the clinical performance of three-dimensional zzso zzso fast zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso with topical administration of sterile saline solution for the assessment of the zzso drainage system zzso 

A total of 13 healthy volunteers underwent both zzso zzso and two-dimensional zzso recovery zzso fast zzso zzso zzso after topical administration of sterile saline solution, and 31 patients affected by primary zzso zzso impairment or zzso zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso and conventional zzso and zzso zzso All patients underwent zzso zzso or surgery, which served as a standard of reference for confirming the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso detected more zzso superior and inferior zzso and zzso duct than zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso showed more zzso segments per zzso although the difference was not statistically zzso zzso improvements in the inferior zzso and zzso duct visibility grades were achieved using zzso zzso zzso zzso had zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity for detecting zzso zzso In 51 out of the 62 zzso that were zzso a zzso agreement was noted between the findings of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in detecting the obstruction zzso 

zzso zzso combined with topical administration of sterile saline solution is a simple and zzso method of obtaining detailed zzso and functional information on the zzso Overall, zzso zzso could be used as a reliable diagnostic method in many patients with zzso prior to zzso
