A model that contains both fixed and random linear zzso is described for analyzing test day records of dairy zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso for this model was achieved by zzso methods utilizing the Gibbs zzso to generate samples from the marginal zzso zzso A zzso model was applied to yields of milk, fat, and protein of first zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso yields were zzso zzso and zzso for milk, fat, and zzso zzso zzso of daily yields were greater than for zzso yields and varied from zzso to zzso for milk yield, zzso to zzso for fat yield, and zzso to zzso for protein zzso The highest zzso were within the first 10 d of zzso for all zzso zzso correlations between daily yields were higher as the zzso between tests zzso and correlations of daily yields with zzso yields were greatest during zzso
