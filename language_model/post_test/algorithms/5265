zzso zzso zzso both in the zzso and the zzso mode, is an appropriate technique to study the properties of complexes between heavy metal zzso and zzso substances zzso which play a key role in the distribution of metal species in the zzso Unfortunately, room temperature zzso zzso of zzso complexes with aromatic and zzso zzso acids - model compounds of HS binding sites - are too broad to fully exploit their potential zzso information zzso It is shown that under zzso conditions zzso zzso is zzso and the highly resolved zzso provide detailed information on the zzso Ten model zzso were zzso Total zzso zzso zzso were recorded, using the zzso transition for zzso and the zzso and zzso transitions for zzso The energy of the zzso transition depends on the zzso involved and the structure and composition of the zzso For most zzso zzso in the high-resolution zzso indicated that more species, zzso distinct complex structures, zzso in the zzso Selective zzso was performed to measure the zzso zzso zzso times zzso The latter strongly depend on nearby OH zzso from zzso water molecules or zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the asymmetry ratios zzso defined as the intensity ratio of the zzso and zzso zzso were calculated and the variation of the zzso energy zzso with the splitting of the zzso zzso zzso was determined, which yielded the crystal field strength zzso zzso as well as the crystal field parameters zzso and zzso An in-depth analysis of the results is zzso providing detailed information on the number of zzso complexes, their zzso the number of water molecules in the first coordination sphere and their geometry zzso point zzso
