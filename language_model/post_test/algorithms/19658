In order to reduce the acquisition time of zzso zzso zzso of biological zzso projected zzso (or in other words, zzso sampled in polar zzso can be zzso Their standard processing involves a regular zzso of the projections followed by a zzso zzso a zzso zzso In this communication, we show that a zzso discrete zzso transform can be implemented in polar coordinates to obtain directly a frequency domain zzso zzso due to local violations of the zzso sampling zzso gives rise to base line zzso but the peak zzso are not distorted as in most reconstruction zzso The sampling scheme is not linear and the data points in the time domain should thus be weighted accordingly in the polar zzso however, artifacts can be reduced by additional data weighting of the zzso zzso This processing does not require any zzso tuning and is straightforward to zzso The zzso written for polar sampling can be adapted to any sampling scheme and will permit to investigate better compromises in terms of experimental time and lack of zzso
