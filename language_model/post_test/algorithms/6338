zzso interpretation of zzso difference distance zzso is suggested as a means of dividing a protein into structural zzso on the basis of zzso differences between different zzso Two zzso of zzso zzso zzso codes zzso zzso et zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 3, zzso in the inactive state with and without a zzso analogue bound are zzso in order to demonstrate the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso domain are detected as structural zzso that move with respect to each zzso zzso a relative movement between the zzso and zzso zzso is detected although both structures of zzso zzso are in the zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that zzso a zzso zzso located in the zzso lobe of the zzso domain, structurally belongs to the zzso zzso The movement of this zzso together with the zzso lobe upon zzso binding leads to the loss of a salt bridge between zzso and zzso a zzso in the zzso domain, providing an explanation for the increased mobility of the zzso zzso
