zzso can be instilled into the pulmonary airways during medical procedures such as zzso replacement therapy, partial liquid zzso and pulmonary drug zzso For all cases, understanding the dynamics of liquid distribution in the lung will increase the efficacy of zzso A recently developed imaging technique for the study of real-time liquid transport dynamics in the pulmonary airways was used to investigate the effect of respiratory rate on the distribution of an instilled liquid, zzso in a rat zzso Twelve excised rat lungs were suspended zzso and a single zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Ross Laboratories, Columbus, zzso mixed with zzso zzso was instilled as a plug into the zzso The lungs were zzso with a zzso tidal volume for 20 breaths at one of two respiratory zzso 20 or 60 zzso The motion of zzso zzso was zzso at 30 zzso with a zzso X-ray source and an image zzso zzso of zzso distribution were zzso for each image by use of distribution statistics and a zzso zzso We found that the liquid distribution depended on the time to liquid plug zzso which depends on ventilation zzso At 20 zzso liquid was localized in the zzso region of the zzso At 60 zzso the liquid coated the zzso providing a more vertically uniform liquid zzso
