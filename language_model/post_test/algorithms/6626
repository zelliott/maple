zzso models aim to describe different components of a process in different zzso This makes sense when the corresponding knowledge to be represented is different as zzso In this way, the most efficient representations can be chosen and, thus, the model performance can be increased zzso From the various possible zzso of hybrid model, three are selected which were applied for important zzso zzso two of them from existing production zzso The examples show that hybrid models are powerful tools for process zzso monitoring and zzso
