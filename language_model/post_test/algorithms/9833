We have investigated the potential application of elastic light zzso zzso zzso as an zzso tool for zzso rapid detection of brain tumors and zzso of the tumor from the surrounding normal zzso zzso were performed on 29 excised tumor specimens from 29 zzso There were 21 instances of zzso tumors and eight instances of high-grade zzso zzso gray matter and white matter brain tissue specimens of four zzso patients were used as a control zzso One zzso and one high-grade tumor were zzso as normal brain zzso Of the low- and high-grade tumors, 20 out of 21 and 7 out of 8 were correctly classified by the zzso system, zzso One normal white matter tissue margin was detected in a high-grade zzso and three normal tissue margins were detected in three zzso tumors using zzso data analysis and confirmed by zzso The spectral slopes were shown to be positive for normal white matter brain tissue and negative for normal gray matter and tumor zzso Our results indicate that signs of spectral slopes may enable the discrimination of brain tumors from surrounding normal white matter brain tissue with a sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso
