Brain tissue zzso has been an active area of research for zzso Brain matter does not follow the zzso relations for common materials and loads applied to the brain turn into stresses and strains depending on tissue local zzso In this work, a zzso zzso zzso law is used for zzso brain injury zzso Thanks to a zzso zzso zzso this zzso accounts for zzso features and zzso of the tissue zzso to different zzso zzso The novelty of the work is the correlation of the material mechanical zzso with fractional zzso zzso from diffusion zzso zzso zzso zzso models are used to investigate the influence of the zzso distribution for different loading zzso In the case of zzso zzso the comparison between experiments and simulations highlights the zzso of the proposed zzso zzso zzso alignment affects the deformation predicted by zzso models and, when the strain in the zzso direction is large with respect to the maximum principal strain, decreased maximum zzso are zzso It is concluded that the introduction of zzso zzso information into the zzso law of brain tissue affects the zzso of the zzso
