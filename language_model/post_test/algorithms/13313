The authors present the application of graphics processing unit zzso programming for real-time three-dimensional zzso zzso domain optical zzso zzso zzso imaging with zzso of flow zzso zzso One of the limitations of zzso is data processing time, which is generally longer than data acquisition zzso zzso additional zzso such as zzso analysis, further increases zzso zzso The general purpose computing on zzso zzso has been used successfully for structural zzso imaging, but real-time 3-D imaging of flows has so far not been zzso We have developed software for structural and zzso zzso processing capable of zzso of two-dimensional zzso data (2000 zzso zzso zzso per zzso with an image refresh rate higher than 120 zzso The 3-D imaging of zzso zzso data is performed at a rate of about 9 volumes per zzso We describe the software architecture, organization of zzso and zzso Screen shots recorded during real-time imaging of a flow phantom and the human eye are zzso
