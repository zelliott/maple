zzso zzso are widely employed in face representation to decompose face images into their zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso however, introduces very high zzso zzso To reduce this zzso uniform sampling of zzso features has traditionally been zzso Since uniform sampling equally treats all the features, it can lead to a loss of important features while retaining trivial zzso In this paper, we propose a new face representation method that employs zzso zzso selection of zzso zzso The proposed method is based on the local statistics of the zzso features and is implemented using a zzso zzso zzso zzso features that zzso to important face regions are automatically selected and sampled finer than other zzso The zzso extracted zzso features are then classified using principal component analysis and/or linear zzso analysis for the purpose of face zzso To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments have been conducted on benchmark face image databases where the images vary in zzso zzso pose, and zzso Compared with the methods that use the original zzso image with zzso data and uniform sampling with zzso data, the proposed method results in a significantly higher recognition rate, with a substantial lower dimension of around zzso The experimental results also show that the proposed method works well not only when multiple sample images are available for training but also when only one sample image is available for each zzso The proposed face representation method has the advantages of low complexity, low zzso and high zzso
