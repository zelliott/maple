Breast cancer screening is currently performed by zzso which is limited by zzso anatomy and dense breast zzso zzso detection zzso systems can serve as a double reader to improve zzso zzso In this paper, we have applied a novel approach to zzso of suspicious region by mammogram and zzso based on hybrid features with learning zzso We formulated differentiation of zzso from normal tissue as a supervised learning problem, and applied this learning method to develop the zzso zzso The zzso has been verified with zzso zzso in the mini zzso Image Analysis Society zzso The experimental results show that the detection method has a sensitivity of zzso at zzso false zzso per zzso The efficiency of zzso is measured using free receiver operating characteristics curve and the results are zzso We conclude that zzso technology with learning zzso has the potential to help zzso with the task of discriminating between zzso and normal zzso
