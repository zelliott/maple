We have developed a zzso model of spatial orientation zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso The model attempts to capture the mechanics of zzso organ zzso of zzso linear forces and the zzso zzso performed on these sensor signals to yield zzso orientation of the vertical direction relative to the zzso Our model differs from other treatments that involve computing the zzso force zzso zzso in three independent zzso The zzso component of our model embodies the idea that the central nervous system processes zzso and zzso stimuli as if they were produced by a zzso zzso equal to zzso even when it differs in zzso because in the course of evolution living creatures have always experienced gravity as a zzso We determine just two independent angles of head orientation relative to the vertical that are zzso dependent, the third angle being derived from the first two and being zzso zzso zzso stimulation is used to resolve our zzso zzso ambiguity of the zzso zzso Our zzso mechanical model takes into account recently established zzso behavior of the zzso relationship of the zzso and possible zzso zzso that are not zzso with the direction of the input force zzso The free parameters of our model relate entirely to the mechanical zzso zzso They were determined by fitting the integrated zzso model to zzso indications of the vertical obtained during pitch and roll body tilts in zzso and zzso force backgrounds and during recumbent zzso tilts in zzso The complete data set was fit with very little residual zzso A novel prediction of the model is that background force magnitude either lower or higher than zzso will not affect zzso vertical judgments during recumbent zzso zzso These predictions have been confirmed in recent zzso flight zzso
