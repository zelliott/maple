Deep sequencing of zzso has become an indispensable tool for biology, enabling expression levels for thousands of genes to be compared across multiple zzso Since transcript counts scale with sequencing depth, counts from different samples must be zzso to a common scale prior to zzso We analyzed zzso existing and novel zzso for zzso transcript counts, and evaluated the effectiveness of the resulting zzso For this purpose we defined two novel and mutually independent zzso zzso the number of zzso genes zzso whose zzso expression levels have a sufficiently low zzso of zzso and zzso low zzso correlation between zzso expression profiles of gene zzso We also define four novel zzso one of which explicitly zzso the number of uniform zzso and compared the performance of all zzso zzso The two most commonly used methods zzso to a fixed total value, or zzso the expression of certain zzso zzso yielded particularly poor results, surpassed even by zzso based on randomly selected gene zzso zzso seven of the zzso approached what appears to be optimal zzso Three of these zzso rely on the identification of zzso zzso genes expressed in all the samples zzso but never at very high or very low zzso We demonstrate that these include a zzso of genes expressed in many zzso in a mutually consistent pattern, which is suitable for use as an internal zzso zzso The new methods yield robustly zzso expression values, which is a prerequisite for the identification of zzso expressed and zzso genes as potential zzso
