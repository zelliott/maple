zzso experiments are often performed to detect differently expressed genes among different clinical zzso The method used to calculate the appropriate sample size for this purpose differs from the sample size calculation used for general clinical experiments, because zzso include tens of thousands of zzso We proposed a sample size calculation method that considers zzso among an entire gene set and used the zzso correction to address the zzso zzso Specifically, by adjusting for the zzso problem, the existing equation for sample size calculation was modified based on the zzso zzso By zzso cluster analysis, the zzso across all genes can be divided into several groups with similar values, and the sample sizes for each group were subsequently calculated and zzso The results of this study show that the sample size was related to the number of genes on a zzso The weighted sample size, calculated by the proposed method, preserved the Type I error for selection of significant genes within a zzso data zzso
