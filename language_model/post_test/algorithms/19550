To evaluate the ability to detect change in standard automated zzso data using 4 different methods for calculating the glaucoma change probability zzso 

A database of stable visual fields, collected within 1 week from 35 glaucoma patients and within 6 months from 15 normal patients, was used to determine confidence intervals for zzso using 4 different zzso The methods classified visual field locations on the basis of either zzso or mean zzso and used zzso data or zzso data to determine values for the confidence zzso The specificity of the 4 methods was measured using zzso locations artificially generated to simulate stable visual field zzso The sensitivity of the methods was measured using zzso artificially generated locations that decreased in either a zzso zzso or zzso fashion by 2, 3, or 4 zzso per year on zzso 

Using zzso with confidence intervals built using the methods described in the literature (on the basis of zzso and zzso zzso resulted in a higher specificity than techniques based on mean zzso However, the zzso methods were more sensitive at detecting a decrease in a zzso Building confidence intervals using the difference between a baseline and the current measurement zzso rather than zzso differences, also improved the detection of visual field zzso 

zzso baseline visual field zzso based on zzso and zzso as described in the literature results in an unusually high zzso zzso accuracy in zzso the same stable data that generated the zzso confidence zzso rather than the expected zzso zzso By zzso zzso based on mean zzso and using zzso rather than zzso differences to build zzso confidence zzso sensitivity is increased by zzso This increase in sensitivity comes with a corresponding zzso decrease in zzso
