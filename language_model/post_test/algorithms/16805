The structure and distribution of the sources underlying the generation of evoked zzso zzso is often very zzso In an effort to improve zzso accuracy of the auditory zzso zzso response occurring around zzso zzso zzso we analyzed 13 zzso of zzso zzso obtained from normal subjects using an zzso independent component analysis procedure which allowed us to detect a clear zzso component in each single trial and to study gross changes in component zzso across zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso was most often negative in zzso as expected, but occasionally exhibited a marked reversal to become zzso The average zzso however, showed the typical negative zzso in all zzso Based on this zzso we separated the processed single trials in two groups of typical and zzso responses, and from each group, we zzso a partial zzso that was used to zzso the underlying zzso zzso Additionally, we localized the classical ensemble average zzso Before processing, the zzso sources were identified correctly in the primary auditory zzso in only four zzso while after processing, all 13 zzso yielded correct zzso and the confidence volume of the sources improved by about zzso Further analysis demonstrated that in nine zzso the improvement was mostly due to the typical responses, while the zzso responses had an zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso responses should not be included in source zzso especially when zzso brain mapping is intended as a clinical zzso
