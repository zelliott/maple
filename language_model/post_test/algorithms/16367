The need to estimate the distance from an individual to a service provider is common in public health zzso However, estimated distances are often imprecise and, we suspect, biased due to a lack of specific residential location zzso In many cases, to protect subject zzso data sets contain only a zzso Code or a zzso 

This paper describes an algorithm, known as zzso zzso sampling zzso zzso which was used to create a distribution of estimated distances to a health facility for a person whose region of residence was known, but for which demographic details and zzso were known for smaller areas within the zzso From this distribution, the median distance is the most likely distance to the zzso The algorithm, using zzso Carlo sampling methods, drew a zzso sample of all the smaller areas zzso blocks) within each zzso reported region zzso zzso weighting these areas by the number of residents in the same age group as the zzso To test the zzso we used data from a large zzso study that screened women at a clinic for intimate partner violence zzso We had data on each woman's age and zzso Code, but no precise residential zzso We used the zzso to select a sample of census blocks, then calculated network distances from each census zzso zzso to the closest zzso facility, resulting in a distribution of distances from these locations to the zzso locations of known zzso zzso We selected the median distance as the most likely distance traveled and zzso confidence intervals that describe the shortest and longest distance within which any given percent of the distance estimates zzso We compared our results to those obtained using two other zzso zzso We show that one method overestimated the most likely distance and the other underestimated zzso Neither of the alternative methods produced confidence intervals for the distance zzso The zzso was implemented in R zzso 

The zzso has a number of benefits over traditional zzso zzso This methodology improves the precision of estimates of geographic access to services when complete residential address information is unavailable and, by computing the expected distribution of possible distances for any respondent and associated distance confidence limits, sensitivity analyses on distance access measures are zzso zzso or imprecise distance measures may compromise decisions about service location and zzso scarce zzso
