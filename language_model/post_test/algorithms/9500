The influence of the zzso zzso on zzso zzso relaxation is investigated for an zzso group in solid proteins in powder form under zzso This contribution is determined to be typically zzso of the overall zzso relaxation rate, at zzso and zzso zzso zzso The improved treatment is used to analyze the internal dynamics in the protein zzso in the frame of a zzso model of diffusion in a zzso using the explicit average sum zzso zzso variations with respect to the determined dynamics parameters are observed when properly accounting for the contribution of zzso zzso zzso In general, the fit of experimental data including zzso led to the determination of diffusion times zzso which are longer than when considering only an zzso zzso relaxation zzso zzso zzso is shown to play little or no role in zzso zzso in direct contrast to the liquid state zzso
