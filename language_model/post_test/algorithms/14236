zzso zzso zzso is a zzso adverse drug reaction caused by zzso As zzso is common in hospitalized patients receiving zzso it would be useful to have a clinical scoring system that could differentiate patients with zzso from those with other reasons for zzso 

To compare zzso the diagnostic utility of a clinical score for zzso in two different clinical zzso 

The zzso clinical scoring system, the zzso zzso was used to zzso 100 consecutive patients referred for possible zzso in one hospital (Hamilton General Hospital, zzso into high, zzso and low probability zzso This system was also used to zzso likewise 236 patients by clinicians in Germany referring blood for diagnostic testing for zzso in zzso zzso The clinical scores were correlated with the results of laboratory testing for zzso zzso using the zzso criteria for zzso with high diagnostic zzso 

In both centers, patients with low scores were unlikely to test positive for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients with intermediate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or high scores zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were more likely to test positive for clinically significant zzso zzso The positive zzso value of an intermediate or high clinical score for clinically significant zzso zzso was higher at one center zzso 

A low zzso clinical score for zzso seems to be suitable for ruling out zzso in most situations zzso zzso zzso The implications of an intermediate or high score vary in different clinical zzso
