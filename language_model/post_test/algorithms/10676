To construct a zzso flexible and simplified mathematical model of the patient flow through the Eye Clinic at the zzso Diabetes Centre zzso in order to enable rational zzso and assess the effects of zzso 

Patient data were drawn from the Eye Care database at the zzso A simple patient flow model was constructed, allowing simultaneous adjustments of all zzso and the model was zzso Two scenarios were zzso zzso adjusting the zzso that assigns the follow-up zzso and zzso increasing the population size to include all patients with diabetes in Copenhagen zzso 

The model can describe the patient flow under steady state conditions, but is less precise in predicting transient changes with the present zzso zzso all simulations were run for a substantial number of zzso The two scenarios illustrate the usefulness of the model by calculating the required photographic examination capacity for the specific population, thereby allowing better zzso of future zzso of the zzso 

The study presents a patient flow model that can be used to illustrate the effects of proposed changes prior to their zzso specifically with respect to the capacity of the zzso
