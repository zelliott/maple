We prove that the slope zzso of the ordinary least squares zzso of zzso independent contrasts zzso conducted through the origin is identical to the slope zzso of the method of generalized least squares zzso zzso under a zzso motion model of zzso This zzso has several zzso zzso zzso the structure of the linear model for zzso zzso provides insight into when and why zzso is important in comparative zzso zzso The limitations of the zzso zzso analysis are the same as the limitations of the zzso zzso In particular, zzso zzso applies only to the response variable in the zzso and the explanatory variable should be regarded as zzso zzso of zzso for explanatory variables should be treated as a mathematical zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Since the zzso zzso is the best linear unbiased zzso zzso the slope zzso estimated using zzso is also zzso zzso If the slope is estimated using different branch lengths for the explanatory and response variables in the zzso algorithm, the zzso is no longer the zzso so this is not zzso Finally, we discuss whether or not and how to accommodate zzso zzso in zzso zzso particularly in relation to the problem of zzso zzso This discussion is from both zzso and zzso zzso
