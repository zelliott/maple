A kinetic method is described for the zzso of zzso density as well as the rate zzso for association and zzso of rapidly zzso zzso The method is exemplified by zzso zzso zzso zzso of the human brain using zzso a D 2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso Using a linear non zzso algorithm, regional binding characteristics were calculated and displayed zzso by zzso in brain zzso Data from repeated experiments on the same subject with different amounts of the zzso zzso were zzso The binding characteristics were determined according to a two step procedure in which the time course of the free zzso concentration was estimated from a reference region considered to be free of specific zzso binding zzso Alternative methods to determine the concentration of free zzso are zzso
