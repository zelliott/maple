This chapter reviews zzso reconstruction zzso for diffusion magnetic resonance imaging zzso and provides some initial comparative results for two such zzso zzso imaging and zzso on data from a typical clinical diffusion zzso zzso The chapter highlights the problems with standard approaches, such as zzso zzso to motivate a recent set of alternative zzso The review concentrates on the software zzso of the new zzso zzso of the preliminary comparison show that zzso recovers the principal directions of simple test functions more consistently than zzso imaging and produces zzso better results on the test data zzso Further simulations suggest that a moderate increase in data quality allows zzso which is much faster to run, to recover directions with consistency comparable to that of zzso on the test zzso
