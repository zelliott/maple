We simulate a three-dimensional optical zzso zzso experiment in which zzso is achieved by illuminating the object with zzso waves generated by a zzso We show that accounting for multiple scattering between the object and the zzso interface is mandatory to obtain zzso zzso Because the Born approximation leads to poor results, we propose a zzso inversion method for retrieving the map of zzso of the object from the scattered far zzso We analyze the sensitivity to noise of our zzso and point out the importance of using incident zzso waves together with zzso waves to improve the zzso of the reconstruction without losing the zzso
