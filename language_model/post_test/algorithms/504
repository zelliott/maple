zzso a gene regulatory network zzso from high zzso biological data is often an zzso problem and is a challenging task due to the following reasons: zzso thousands of genes are involved in one living zzso zzso complex dynamic and zzso relationships exist among zzso zzso a substantial amount of noise is involved in the data, and zzso the typical small sample size is very small compared to the number of zzso We zzso we can enhance our understanding of gene interactions in important biological processes zzso cell cycle, and development, zzso and improve the zzso accuracy of a zzso by zzso incorporating prior biological knowledge into the zzso zzso zzso zzso multiple biological data sources, and zzso zzso the zzso problem into smaller network zzso 

This study presents a novel zzso zzso method by zzso gene expression data and gene functional category zzso The zzso is based on module network model that consists of two zzso the module selection part and the network zzso zzso The former determines the optimal zzso through fuzzy zzso zzso zzso and by incorporating gene functional category information, while the latter uses a hybrid of particle swarm zzso and zzso neural network zzso methods to zzso the underlying network between zzso Our method is tested on real data from two zzso the development of rat central nervous system zzso and the zzso cell cycle zzso The results are evaluated by comparing them to previously published results and gene zzso zzso zzso 

The reverse engineering of zzso in time course gene expression data is a major obstacle in system biology due to the limited number of time zzso Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can address this challenge zzso zzso zzso gene expression data zzso zzso and missing value zzso to reduce the data zzso zzso zzso genes based on gene expression data and gene functional category information to identify biologically meaningful zzso thereby reducing the zzso of the zzso zzso modeling zzso with the zzso method between the zzso to capture their zzso and dynamic zzso The method is shown to lead to biologically meaningful zzso and networks among the zzso
