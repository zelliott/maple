The zzso interference zzso zzso can be exploited using short hairpin zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of optimal target sites is notoriously inaccurate and current approaches applied to zzso show weak correlations with virus zzso In contrast, using a zzso model for zzso pre-existing zzso structure in the zzso zzso as achievable using high-resolution SHAPE zzso zzso zzso analyzed by primer zzso chemical probing information, we discovered strong correlations between zzso of zzso production in a quantitative zzso zzso and very simple zzso features in the target zzso zzso zzso occurs at zzso target sites that both have an accessible zzso zzso and, unexpectedly, are structurally accessible in a newly identified downstream zzso zzso We then used these simple rules to create a new set of zzso and achieved zzso of zzso production of zzso or greater for up to zzso of designed zzso These zzso inhibit zzso replication in zzso T cells and show no or low zzso The remarkable success of this straightforward zzso approach emphasizes that zzso is zzso in significant part, by very simple, predictable rules reflecting the underlying zzso structure and illustrates principles likely to prove broadly useful in understanding zzso biological recognition and zzso involving zzso
