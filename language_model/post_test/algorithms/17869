Contemporary pathology involves an emerging role for molecular zzso Current tissue handling procedures zzso zzso fixation and zzso zzso zzso have their origin in the aim to obtain good tissue zzso and optimal results within zzso Unfortunately, zzso is notorious for its poor zzso conservation zzso In this study, we have examined the impact of the individual steps in tissue handling processes on the zzso zzso quality, and zzso for zzso zzso chain zzso It was found that a prolonged zzso time zzso the time between tissue dissection and zzso has a measurable impact on zzso integrity when analyzed with the zzso zzso Surprisingly, however, the deteriorated zzso quality hardly had any consequences for zzso zzso chain reaction zzso Furthermore, we assessed the optimal fixation time for zzso preservation, and we found that an zzso heating step, preceding copy DNA zzso significantly increases the zzso template zzso Finally, we provide a protocol for zzso isolation from zzso stained zzso tissue zzso Thus, by applying zzso to tissue handling procedures, archival zzso zzso become well suitable for zzso molecular zzso
