To zzso the effect of zzso threshold load zzso on breathing, all previous work studied loads that were much greater than would be encountered under zzso zzso We hypothesized that mild zzso from zzso to 20 zzso is sufficient to modify control and sensation of zzso The study was performed in healthy zzso The results demonstrated that with mild zzso 1) zzso difficulty sensation could be perceived at an zzso of zzso zzso 2) tidal volume increased without change in breathing frequency, resulting in zzso and 3) although additional time was required for zzso pressure to attain the threshold before zzso flow was zzso the total zzso muscle contraction time remained zzso This resulted in zzso of the available time for zzso flow, so that the tidal volume was maintained or increased by significant increase in mean zzso zzso On the basis of computer zzso we conclude that the mild zzso is sufficient to increase breathing sensation and alter breathing control, presumably aiming at maintaining a certain level of ventilation but minimizing the energy consumption of the zzso zzso
