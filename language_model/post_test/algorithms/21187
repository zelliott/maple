To investigate and compare the diagnostic accuracy of the zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso diagnostic zzso and establish whether they are affected by zzso disc size and glaucoma zzso 

zzso zzso evaluation of diagnostic zzso 

Two hundred zzso eyes from 139 normal subjects and 103 zzso patients classified by the presence of a zzso visual field zzso zzso 

zzso were zzso by the zzso The diagnostic zzso of zzso zzso analysis zzso and the glaucoma probability score zzso was explored by sensitivity and specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristics zzso zzso The analysis was performed globally and by zzso disc size zzso and by 3 zzso severity zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso 

The zzso showed a sensitivity zzso zzso zzso similar to and a specificity zzso zzso zzso lower than that of zzso zzso It showed a higher specificity in small discs than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but a low to very low specificity in medium to very large discs zzso zzso large, zzso very large, zzso zzso zzso analysis Global showed the highest sensitivity and specificity zzso and zzso in very large zzso zzso Burke linear zzso function zzso and cup shape measure zzso showed the best and least variable zzso across zzso nerve head sizes and glaucoma zzso The sensitivity of both zzso and the zzso decreased at the earlier glaucoma zzso The zzso and zzso agreement was moderate throughout the entire population and in small discs and early stage, whereas it was weaker among the other disc size and glaucoma stage zzso 

zzso diagnostic zzso accuracy is zzso The zzso is less specific and more influenced by disc size than zzso Cup shape measure and the zzso offer the best and less variable performances across different disc sizes and glaucoma zzso
