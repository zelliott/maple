zzso zzso zzso zzso to proteins is one of the major tasks of functional zzso Despite the impressive technical advances of the past decades, it is still time-consuming and zzso to zzso determine zzso on a high zzso zzso Thus, zzso predictions are the preferred method for large-scale assignment of protein zzso and if appropriate, followed up by experimental zzso In this report, using a machine learning approach, the zzso zzso Algorithm zzso we developed a prediction system for protein zzso in which we incorporated a protein functional domain zzso The overall accuracy achieved by this system is zzso Furthermore, comparisons with other methods have been conducted to demonstrate the zzso and efficiency of our prediction zzso We also provide an zzso of our zzso zzso zzso System zzso which is available at zzso
