During the last decade, studies have shown that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso reconstruction could be effectively zzso and considerably accelerated by graphics processing unit zzso zzso However, most of these studies rely on zzso sensitivity zzso In many cases, the time required to zzso this zzso can be longer than the reconstruction time zzso In fact, the relatively long time required for the calculation of the zzso sensitivity zzso is considered as one of the main obstacle in introducing a zzso PET reconstruction zzso for routine clinical zzso The objective of this work is to accelerate a fully zzso zzso algorithm, including the calculation of the sensitivity zzso that accounts for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso For this purpose, sensitivity zzso calculations and zzso zzso reconstructions were implemented on zzso using the geometry of a commercial PET zzso The system zzso were built zzso by using an approach with multiple rays per detector zzso The reconstructions were performed for a volume of 188 zzso 188 zzso 57 zzso of 2 zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso and for another volume of 144 zzso 144 zzso 57 zzso of 4 zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso The time to zzso the sensitivity zzso for the 188 zzso 188 zzso 57 array was 9 s while the zzso zzso performed at a rate of zzso millions of events per zzso For the 144 zzso 144 zzso 57 zzso the respective numbers are 8 s for the sensitivity zzso and zzso million of events per second for the zzso zzso This work lets envision fast reconstructions for advanced PET applications such as real time dynamic studies and zzso image zzso
