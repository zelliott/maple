The performance of zzso gene regulatory network zzso zzso depends on the sample zzso It is generally considered that the larger the sample size, the better the gene network zzso zzso Nevertheless, there is not adequate information on determining the sample size for optimal zzso In this study, the author systematically demonstrates the effect of sample size on zzso gene network zzso zzso with an ensemble zzso The empirical results showed that the zzso performances of the considered zzso tend to zzso after a particular sample size zzso As a specific example, the sample size region around zzso is sufficient to obtain the most of the zzso performance with respect to precision using the representative zzso zzso on the synthetic zzso data sets of zzso coli and also zzso data set of a zzso sapiens zzso The author verified the convergence result on a large, real data set of zzso coli as zzso The results give evidence to biologists to better design experiments to zzso gene zzso Further, the effect of zzso on zzso performances over various sample sizes is zzso zzso supplementary zzso
