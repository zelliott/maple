A commercially available motion phantom zzso zzso zzso was modified for zzso motion control with the aim of zzso patient respiratory motion in one dimension in both the zzso and zzso directions, as well as, providing zzso zzso and zzso patterns for the testing of zzso gating zzso In order to simulate realistic patient motion, the DC motor was replaced by a zzso zzso A separate zzso motion platform was also designed to accommodate a variety of surrogate marker zzso The platform employs a second zzso motor that allows for the decoupling of the zzso and insert zzso The zzso accuracy was tested by replicating patient traces recorded with the zzso real-time position management zzso system and comparing the motion zzso recorded motion trace with the original patient zzso Six lung cancer patient traces recorded with the zzso system were uploaded to the motion zzso in-house control software and subsequently zzso through the phantom motion zzso The zzso motion profile was recorded with the zzso system and compared to the original patient zzso zzso and zzso patterns were simulated with the motion platform and recorded with the zzso system to verify the systems potential for routine quality assurance of commercial zzso gating zzso There was good correlation between zzso and actual patient data zzso zzso Mean differences between the location of zzso in zzso and patient zzso for six patients amounted to zzso zzso with the corresponding zzso mean equal to zzso zzso The upgraded motion phantom was found to replicate patient motion accurately as well as provide useful test patterns to aid in the quality assurance of motion management methods and zzso
