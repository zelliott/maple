The goal of the paper is to assess the zzso of zzso models to describe the retention of zzso on clay materials, both in dispersed and zzso zzso A batch method is used to characterize the zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso ratios varying from zzso to zzso zzso For zzso zzso zzso density of zzso zzso a new method is presented where the material zzso is performed in zzso zzso zzso edges and zzso were measured in the presence of a synthetic zzso A model considering zzso exchange reactions with zzso zzso and surface zzso reactions with edge sites was used for the dispersed zzso zzso was shown to be the dominant interacting phase in zzso zzso The zzso of the model to zzso zzso was zzso The results indicate that under conditions where the zzso exchange mechanism is dominant, there is no difference between the dispersed and zzso zzso For the degree of zzso zzso all exchange sites are available for zzso For zzso when surface zzso is the dominant zzso zzso a decrease of the zzso values by a factor of about 3 was observed zzso zzso trace zzso This could be explained zzso by a diminution of the conditional interaction constant between Ni and the edge surface site in the zzso zzso One consequence of this decrease is that the contribution of the organic matter content of zzso zzso to the total zzso becomes zzso
