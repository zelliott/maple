zzso zzso loss and surface zzso early signs of zzso zzso are likely preceded by softening of the ground substance and the collagen zzso Insight in their relative importance to progression of zzso may assist the development of treatment strategies for early zzso To support interpretation of experimental data, a zzso model is proposed that can predict damage progression in cartilage over time, as a consequence of excessive mechanical zzso The objective is to assess the interaction between ground substance softening and collagen fiber damage using this zzso 

An established cartilage mechanics model is extended with the assumption that excessive strains may damage the ground substance or the collagen network, resulting in softening of the overstrained zzso During subsequent loading cycles the strain may or may not cross a zzso resulting in damage to stabilize or to zzso To evaluate how softening of the ground substance and collagen may zzso damage progression is zzso when either one of them, or both together are allowed to occur during zzso increased zzso 

zzso in the ground substance was predicted to zzso in the superficial and transitional zone and resulted in cartilage zzso zzso damage was most prominent in the superficial zone, with more diffuse damage penetrating deeper into the zzso resulting in adverse strain zzso zzso were more pronounced if both constituents developed damage in zzso 

Ground substance softening and collagen damage have distinct effects on cartilage zzso and damage in either one of them may promote each zzso
