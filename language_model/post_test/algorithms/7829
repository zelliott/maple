zzso and persistence of avian influenza viruses zzso among wildlife remains an unresolved issue because it depends both on the ecology of the host zzso population density, zzso and on the environment zzso zzso persistence in zzso We have developed a mathematical model that accounts for both zzso zzso and bird community zzso The model is zzso using bird counts and zzso prevalence zzso zzso suggest that the transmission patterns driving the dynamics of infection at our study site zzso South of zzso involved both a zzso and a zzso transmission zzso zzso transmission is, however, the main zzso of the disease dynamics and observed prevalence zzso This pattern of transmission highlights the importance of the persistence of viral particles in water in zzso dynamics in wild zzso
