A zzso zzso model for correlated zzso responses given the zzso of interest has been zzso Some of the responses are subject to zzso errors and hence are not directly zzso Also zzso on some of the zzso are not zzso instead the zzso on its surrogate are zzso However, the conditional distribution of the zzso zzso given the surrogate is completely zzso Models are proposed taking into account either or both of these sources of zzso zzso zzso are proposed to fit these zzso To ascertain the effect of ignoring zzso errors and/or measurement error on the estimates of the zzso and correlation zzso a sensitivity study is carried out through zzso Finally, the proposed methodology is illustrated through an zzso
