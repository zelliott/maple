An efficient zzso selective fluorescent probe zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by blending zzso with zzso zzso and its zzso complex were well characterized by different zzso techniques like zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis as zzso zzso could detect up to zzso zzso zzso in zzso methanol solution through zzso zzso The method was linear up to 16 zzso of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso were eliminated using zzso as a masking zzso zzso showed a strong binding to zzso zzso as evident from its binding constant value zzso estimated using zzso zzso zzso assisted restricted rotation of the zzso zzso and inhibited zzso electron transfer from the O, zzso sites to the zzso unit are responsible for the enhancement of zzso upon zzso of zzso zzso was used for imaging the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso
