This study considers two aspects of the zzso of a biomass growth observer and specific growth rate controller in zzso from small- to zzso zzso towards a feasible bulk production process for zzso vaccine against zzso zzso The first is the calculation of the oxygen zzso rate, the starting point for online monitoring and control of biomass growth, taking into account the dynamics in the zzso zzso effects and delays are caused by amongst others the zzso and tubing to the zzso These gas phase dynamics are zzso using knowledge of the system in order to reconstruct oxygen zzso The second aspect is to evaluate performance of the monitoring and control system with the required modifications of the oxygen consumption calculation on zzso In zzso zzso zzso good monitoring and control performance is obtained enabling a doubled concentration of bulk vaccine compared to standard batch zzso
