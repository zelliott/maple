A pedigree model for zzso data, motivated by zzso zzso has been developed to examine evidence for familial zzso in disease zzso From an zzso point of view a convenient way to express disease zzso between a pair of relatives is in terms of the odds zzso For a rare disease this is almost equivalent to the relative risk of one family member being affected given that the other is affected, and in extending this to zzso it is assumed that these relative risks are zzso In applying the model to the breast cancer data, zzso on a rare disease zzso through an affected zzso it has been shown that zzso of zzso is dependent critically on knowing the probability that a sampled individual is zzso Therefore known population estimates of prevalence or cumulative risk, and an appropriate zzso zzso need to be invoked for the model to give proper estimates of disease zzso The model is flexible in that measured ancillary risk factors, including genetic marker information, can be incorporated into the zzso Therefore in future studies this information should be collected on all individuals, not just those zzso Suggested statistics for examining a fitted model are zzso
