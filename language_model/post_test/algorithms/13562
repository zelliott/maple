zzso zzso currents zzso provide key information about the mechanisms of synaptic transmission and the activity modes of zzso zzso However, detecting spontaneous zzso zzso and zzso has been challenging, because of the small zzso the variable zzso and the undefined time of generation of these zzso Here, we describe zzso to our knowledge, new method for detecting spontaneous synaptic events by zzso using a template that zzso the average time course of spontaneous zzso A recorded zzso trace is zzso from the template, resulting in a series of zzso zzso The zzso of these zzso events are reliably zzso revealing the precise onset times of the spontaneous zzso Among all detection methods, the zzso method has a unique zzso resolution, allowing the detection of individual events in zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso method has a high zzso resolution, because zzso can substantially increase the zzso zzso When tested against previously published methods using experimental data, the zzso method was superior for spontaneous zzso recorded zzso Using the high-resolution zzso detection algorithm, we show that the frequency of spontaneous zzso zzso currents in zzso zzso zzso cells is zzso times higher zzso than zzso
