The aim of this study was to evaluate the zzso variation of zzso pacing threshold in young zzso 

zzso zzso Management zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso feature that uses two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pacing and spontaneous zzso and zzso chamber reset zzso zzso zzso activity with zzso block zzso For this zzso zzso study, zzso automatically measured and recorded thresholds every 4 zzso Data are reported as median zzso or mean zzso zzso In zzso 14 consecutive patients (11 zzso zzso aged 12 years (1 zzso zzso received an zzso zzso PM for zzso zzso patients, zzso or zzso zzso zzso A new pacing system was implanted in eight patients zzso and a replaced PM in six zzso zzso leads were implanted in 10 patients zzso The follow-up duration is 11 zzso zzso zzso threshold zzso were attempted zzso zzso zzso zzso of which zzso zzso were successful zzso zzso zzso 1990 zzso zzso in 11 zzso zzso Three infants had no successful zzso zzso success was 42 zzso zzso zzso 27 zzso zzso zzso 41 zzso zzso Higher thresholds were found between zzso and zzso zzso and lower between zzso and zzso 

Young patients show a zzso zzso of zzso threshold with higher thresholds between zzso and zzso
