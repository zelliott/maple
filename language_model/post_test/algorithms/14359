An analysis is presented of how to zzso the experimental zzso zzso for achieving the best possible zzso ratio zzso in X-ray zzso correlation zzso experiments using area zzso It is shown that there exists an optimum detector distance; zzso the highest zzso is achieved by matching the angular zzso size with the angular source zzso zzso several zzso together can increase the zzso by permitting to match the shape of a detector zzso to the shape of the zzso It is also shown that zzso zzso several times wider than the effective zzso zzso length are zzso further, it is demonstrated that the energy dependence of the zzso is dictated by the energy dependence of detector efficiency and source zzso Ultimately the effects of focusing and low zzso zzso are zzso
