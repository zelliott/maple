zzso zzso therapy zzso has the potential to improve the outcome of patients suffering from mechanical zzso and heart zzso It has been suggested that accurate zzso of baseline extent of mechanical zzso may lead to zzso of patients likely to respond to zzso The standard zzso from a phase zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are parameters obtained from phase analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso that may provide an accurate means of assessing mechanical zzso In this paper, the ability of zzso zzso and E to detect mechanical zzso was investigated and optimal values for image zzso zzso noise zzso and bin size were zzso Finally, the zzso and zzso zzso of the methodology was zzso 

zzso zzso and E were calculated for 37 normal subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso volume zzso 120 zzso zzso volume zzso 60 zzso zzso zzso 120 zzso and normal wall zzso and 53 patients with mechanical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 120 zzso and typical zzso zzso characteristics zzso zzso were created and the area under the curve zzso for each zzso was determined using three different imaging filters (no filter and an order 5 zzso filter with zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso was also determined using zzso threshold values varying between zzso and 50% (of the max zzso zzso Finally, zzso for E was determined for bins sizes varying between 1 degrees and 20 degrees zzso zzso and zzso zzso was calculated at optimal imaging zzso 

No smoothing was found to maximize the zzso The zzso was independent of zzso threshold zzso However, a value of zzso provided optimal zzso of the phase zzso The zzso was also independent of bin zzso At the optimal imaging values, the sensitivity and specificity for all parameters for detection of mechanical zzso was measured to be zzso zzso and zzso correlation zzso zzso were found for zzso S and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso phase analysis zzso zzso zzso and zzso were able to detect mechanical zzso with low zzso and zzso zzso Studies assessing the ability of these parameters to predict zzso outcome are zzso
