zzso zzso the use of their zzso zzso to move efficiently on a wide range of surfaces prior to forming zzso bacterial zzso The zzso zzso mode employed by many bacterial species for surface exploration uses zzso zzso zzso as linear zzso to enable directional zzso In addition to linear motion, however, zzso requires turns and changes of zzso Moreover, the zzso mechanism must be adaptable to the continually changing surface conditions encountered during zzso zzso Here, we develop a novel zzso tracking zzso to dissect twitching zzso in this zzso We show that zzso crawling in zzso zzso consistently zzso between two distinct zzso a translation of constant zzso and a combined zzso that is approximately zzso faster in instantaneous zzso zzso zzso of these actions suggest that the former is due to pulling by multiple zzso whereas the latter is due to release by single zzso The release action leads to a fast zzso motion that can turn the cell body efficiently by zzso Furthermore, the large zzso of the zzso motion enables bacteria to move efficiently through environments that contain zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso substances zzso that bacteria zzso on surfaces during zzso zzso
