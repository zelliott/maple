zzso dynamics simulation generates large quantities of data that must be interpreted using physically meaningful zzso A common approach is to describe the system dynamics in terms of transitions between coarse partitions of zzso zzso In contrast to previous work that partitions the space according to geometric zzso the authors examine here zzso based on zzso merging zzso zzso together so as to identify zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso As test systems zzso molecular dynamics simulations of the zzso zzso and zzso are zzso Both systems clearly exhibit zzso with some zzso distinct zzso states being zzso very zzso Using the backbone zzso zzso pattern to define the zzso a definition is obtained of zzso states whose lifetimes considerably exceed the memory associated with interstate zzso thus allowing the zzso to be described by a zzso zzso This model is shown to be valid by comparison of its predictions with the zzso obtained directly from the molecular dynamics zzso In contrast, zzso based on the zzso pattern fails to identify zzso zzso states or a reliable zzso zzso Finally, an approach is proposed to generate a zzso model of networks, each having a different number of zzso zzso The model hierarchy yields a qualitative understanding of the multiple time and length scales in the dynamics of zzso
