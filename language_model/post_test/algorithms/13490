The zzso of zzso growing cell populations is a major task in the field of adult stem cell production used for drug discovery and in the field of zzso zzso To zzso quality of a cell population, a crucial event is the zzso cell zzso the precise knowledge of these events enables the reconstruction of lineages and accurate proliferation zzso as well as a detailed analysis of cell zzso To serve in an autonomous cell farming zzso such a detector requires to work reliably and zzso 

We introduce a zzso detector that is using a maximum likelihood zzso zzso based on zzso cell features zzso area, zzso zzso zzso It adapts to the 3 zzso of cell growth zzso log and stationary zzso As a concurrent model, we compared zzso with kernel zzso using zzso zzso and zzso kernel zzso All approaches are evaluated for their ability to distinguish between zzso and zzso zzso The large, publicly available benchmark data zzso zzso data set A with zzso segmented cells, zzso zzso zzso is used for this zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso approach clearly zzso previously published zzso approaches and the linear zzso Furthermore, it robustly reaches a performance comparable to zzso and zzso zzso 

The proposed simple and label free zzso zzso might be the method of choice when it comes to autonomous cell zzso zzso it is essential to have reliable and zzso zzso detection that covers all zzso of cell zzso
