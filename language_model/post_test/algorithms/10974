zzso medical systems are a special kind of medical software in general, and just as any medical software system they should make accurate zzso However, accuracy of intelligent medical systems is highly dependent on various factors such zzso choosing an appropriate basic method zzso decision trees, neural zzso induction method zzso purity zzso and appropriate support methods zzso zzso zzso zzso In this paper we present the results of extensive research of the above alternatives on 54 zzso databases and their influence on the accuracy of decision trees, which constitute one of the most desirable forms of intelligent medical zzso We also introduce new hybrid purity measures that on some databases outperform other purity zzso The results presented here show that the selection of the right purity measure with the proper zzso method and application of the boosting method can really make a difference in terms of higher accuracy of induced decision zzso zzso choosing the appropriate factors that can increase the accuracy of the induced decision tree is a very demanding and time-consuming zzso
