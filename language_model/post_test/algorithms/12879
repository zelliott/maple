We propose and zzso demonstrate a new method to extend the range of zzso optical time domain analysis zzso zzso It exploits the virtual transparency created by zzso zzso pumping in optical zzso The idea is theoretically analyzed and zzso demonstrated in a 50 zzso zzso By working close to zzso we also show that the measurement length of the zzso can be increased up to 100 zzso with 2 meter zzso We zzso extensions of this technique to measurement lengths well beyond this value, as long as the issue of relative intensity noise zzso of the primary zzso pump can be zzso
