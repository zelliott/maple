To design a decision tree according to time from zzso and site, zzso and number of zzso for the rational treatment of patients with zzso at the zzso site after zzso therapy zzso to minimize performance of zzso 

From a database of 504 women selected to receive zzso those developing probably benign zzso within 3 years of zzso received close follow-up with zzso Patients developing fewer than four probably benign zzso more than 3 years after treatment were offered zzso or zzso If zzso appeared zzso or patients developed four or more zzso after 3 years, biopsy was zzso 

zzso patients (29 breasts zzso developed zzso confined to the zzso zzso Fifteen patients (15 zzso developed zzso within 3 years of zzso and were followed up with zzso Thirteen patients zzso zzso developed zzso confined to the zzso site after more than 3 zzso Among the latter group, zzso appeared zzso in four zzso and biopsy specimens revealed three zzso The remaining 10 breasts were followed up with zzso No patient undergoing zzso follow-up without biopsy has had clinical evidence of local failure throughout the follow-up zzso 

zzso zzso is an option when zzso zzso develop at the zzso site depending on time of appearance and number; it is the primary recommendation when these zzso develop within 3 years after zzso
