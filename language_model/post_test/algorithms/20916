The purpose of this study was to estimate the effect sizes of drug interactions on plasma zzso zzso while adjusting for potentially zzso factors such as zzso The zzso was performed by using a mixed model, data from a series of previously published studies of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and unpublished data from patients under clinical therapeutic drug monitoring zzso The total sample included zzso adult patients zzso zzso who provided both zzso plasma zzso zzso and smoking zzso They provided a total of 360 zzso zzso (1 to 11 measures per zzso Smoking and zzso zzso or zzso use were found to have significant effects on median plasma zzso zzso The effects of zzso on plasma zzso zzso were modified by zzso After adjusting for zzso dose and zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso were zzso lower in zzso who were taking zzso than in zzso who were not taking zzso zzso zzso were zzso higher in smokers who were taking zzso than in smokers who were not taking zzso zzso zzso were zzso lower in smokers who were not taking zzso than in zzso who were not taking zzso and zzso zzso were zzso lower in smokers who were taking zzso than in zzso who were taking zzso After adjusting for zzso dose and taking zzso the correction factor comparing smokers taking zzso versus zzso who were not taking zzso was zzso zzso age, and zzso use of zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso did not have significant effects on zzso zzso The main limitation of this clinical design is the unavoidable substantial zzso that characterizes zzso clinical zzso which may make it difficult to detect the effects of some zzso Other limitations were the small sample size of some drug zzso and the lack of testing for plasma zzso zzso
