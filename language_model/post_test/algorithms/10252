Some clinical and experimental studies have shown the use of statins could protect against zzso but there are not adequate data at zzso 

We performed a zzso of zzso trials with statins on the zzso of zzso of zzso to estimate the impact of zzso use on zzso zzso 

We searched zzso zzso and the Cochrane controlled Trials Register zzso Library zzso 4, zzso up to November 2010 to identify studies covering the use of statins on zzso zzso 

In published data from nine short term trials zzso patients, zzso zzso the effect of statins was significantly associated with a decreased risk of recurrence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso The result of OR was higher when studies with zzso score zzso were excluded zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso Among four long term trials zzso patients, zzso zzso the effect of statins was associated with a decreased risk of recurrence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso In three long term trials of more intensive versus standard zzso zzso patients, 188 zzso there was no evidence of a reduction in the risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso 

Our zzso suggests that the use of statins may be associated with preventing zzso in short term trials and long term trials, but in the long term trials of more intensive versus standard zzso there was no evidence of a reduction in the risk of zzso However, we still need large-scale zzso double blind zzso trials with zzso occurrence as the main zzso in order to finally confirm the benefits of zzso in zzso zzso
