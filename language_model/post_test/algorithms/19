A method has been developed to calculate depths of calculation points zzso in patient contours containing internal zzso In this method, each zzso is zzso by a zzso series zzso five to ten zzso Using this zzso the zzso of a ray line with each zzso are found as the solution of a zzso zzso Once these zzso have been located, effective depths used in zzso calculations can readily be zzso
