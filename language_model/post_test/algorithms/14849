In this study, we investigate the problem of detecting time epochs when zzso updates can be applied in a zzso zzso navigation zzso zzso zzso We examine three commonly used zzso the acceleration moving zzso zzso the acceleration magnitude zzso and the angular rate energy zzso We demonstrate that all detectors can be derived within the same general likelihood ratio test framework given the different prior knowledge about the sensor zzso Further, by combining all prior knowledge, we derive a new likelihood ratio test zzso zzso we develop a methodology to evaluate the performance of the zzso zzso the developed methodology, we evaluate the performance of the detectors using leveled ground, slow zzso 3 zzso and normal zzso 5 zzso gait zzso The test results are presented in terms of detection versus zzso zzso Our preliminary results shows that the new detector performs marginally better than the angular rate energy detector that zzso both the acceleration moving zzso detector and the acceleration magnitude zzso
