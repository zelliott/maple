zzso blurred images of a scene contain valuable depth zzso In this paper, our objective is to recover the 3-D structure of a scene from motion zzso zzso In the proposed approach, the difference of blur between two observations is used as a cue for recovering depth, within a zzso state zzso zzso For motion zzso we use an zzso image zzso Since the relationship between the observation and the scale factor of the point spread function associated with the depth at a point is zzso we propose and develop a zzso of zzso Kalman filter for depth zzso There are no restrictions on the shape of the blur zzso Furthermore, within the same zzso we address a special and challenging scenario of depth from zzso with zzso zzso The effectiveness of our approach is evaluated on synthetic as well as real data, and its performance is also compared with contemporary zzso
