One of the challenges of zzso zzso ratio zzso and image quality in zzso zzso imaging using zzso zzso is associated with the different MR signal zzso for zzso and its zzso products, zzso and zzso The impact of the acquisition time window, variation of flip angles, and order of phase zzso on zzso and image quality were evaluated in mathematical simulations and rat experiments, based on zzso fast chemical shift imaging zzso and three-dimensional zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso The image timing was set to coincide with the peak production of zzso The strategy of combining variable flip angles and zzso phase zzso zzso improved image quality while retaining good zzso In addition, two aspects of zzso sampling strategies were zzso zzso design zzso zzso zzso zzso and spectral bandwidth zzso zzso 500 zzso zzso 267 zzso Both zzso zzso and reduced zzso zzso toward increased zzso The imaging strategies reported here can serve as guidance to other zzso zzso imaging protocols for zzso zzso imaging zzso
