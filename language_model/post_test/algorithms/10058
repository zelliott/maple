This letter discusses blind zzso based on zzso predictability zzso 2001 ; zzso He, & zzso 2005 zzso Our results show that the sources are zzso using the zzso predictability method if and only if they have different zzso structures zzso zzso zzso the zzso and limitations of the zzso predictability method are zzso In addition, instead of using generalized zzso we suggest using joint approximate zzso zzso to improve the zzso of the zzso A new criterion is presented to evaluate the separation zzso zzso simulations are performed to demonstrate the zzso of the theoretical zzso
