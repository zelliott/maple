Previous investigations of the dynamic organization of the lower zzso and its relation to peripheral and other central nervous systems were predominantly performed by linear zzso These are based on zzso zzso which merely can be applied to stationary signal zzso Thus, the current concept of the common zzso system zzso in the zzso formation zzso of the lower zzso and basic types of its functional organization have been zzso Here, we present experiments where zzso activities of the zzso and the nucleus zzso zzso zzso first relay station of zzso zzso were recorded together with related parameters of electroencephalogram zzso zzso and cardiovascular zzso The zzso zzso are part of the CBS, which zzso in regulation and coordination of zzso zzso and motor systems, and zzso The zzso time series, thus acquired, yield information about the internal dynamic coordination of the participating regulation zzso The major problem in evaluating these data is the zzso and zzso of the zzso We used a set of especially designed time resolving methods to evaluate zzso dynamic zzso in the interaction between CBS zzso and cardiovascular signals, zzso and the zzso and between zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and CBS zzso
