A zzso zzso propensity score zzso zzso has been proposed to adjust for zzso in claims zzso The feasibility of using this zzso in other types of zzso databases is zzso 

We estimated the comparative safety of traditional zzso zzso drugs zzso and selective zzso zzso regarding the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding zzso in The Health Improvement Network, an electronic medical record zzso database in the zzso We compared the adjusted effect estimates when the zzso were identified using expert knowledge or the zzso zzso zzso 

Compared with the zzso traditional zzso zzso the crude odds ratio zzso of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso selective zzso inhibitor zzso The OR dropped to zzso zzso zzso upon adjustment for known risk factors for zzso that are typically available in both claims and zzso zzso The OR remained similar when further adjusting for zzso alcohol consumption, and body mass zzso are not typically recorded in claims databases zzso zzso zzso zzso or adding 500 zzso identified zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for age and sex plus 500 zzso identified zzso produced an OR of zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso can be implemented in zzso studies that use primary care zzso databases such as The Health Improvement zzso For the zzso association for which major zzso are well known, further adjustment for zzso selected by the zzso had little impact on the effect zzso
