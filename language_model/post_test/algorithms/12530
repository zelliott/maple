zzso identification of genetic risk zzso for complex diseases has relied on the ability to minimize disease and genetic zzso to increase the power to detect zzso One means to account for disease zzso is by incorporating zzso zzso However, the inclusion of each zzso will add one degree of freedom to the zzso sharing based linkage test, which may in fact decrease zzso We explore the application of a propensity score, which is typically used in zzso zzso to combine multiple zzso into a single zzso as a means of allowing for multiple zzso with the addition of only one degree of zzso In this study, zzso trait data, simulated under various models involving genetic and environmental effects, were analyzed using a zzso linkage statistic implemented in zzso Power and type I error rates were zzso zzso suggest that the use of the propensity score to combine multiple zzso as a single zzso consistently improves the power compared to an analysis including no zzso each zzso individually, or all zzso zzso Type I error rates were inflated for analyses with zzso and increased with increasing number of zzso but reduced to nominal rates with sample sizes of 1000 zzso zzso we recommend using the propensity score as a single zzso in the linkage analysis of a trait suspected to be influenced by multiple zzso because of its potential to increase the power to detect linkage, while controlling for the increase in the type I zzso
