The previous theoretical work of a delivery transfer function zzso in zzso is expanded to include the unique intensity zzso method of zzso zzso In addition to the zzso of each zzso and the zzso scatter zzso spreading of the dose that other zzso units have, zzso zzso uses 51 small arcs of varying lengths to adjust the zzso The blurring from these arcs is not taken into account during treatment zzso A theoretical zzso is constructed, and a calculation is performed which includes this unique source motion in relation to the other zzso zzso Various typical delivery parameters are used to generate resolution maps for a constant intensity zzso Near the zzso the zzso (to a given beam zzso blurring is small but at larger zzso zzso zzso the source blurring dominates over leaf zzso For most clinical situations, this inherent source motion blurring is expected to be zzso
