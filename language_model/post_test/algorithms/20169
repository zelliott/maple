The purpose of this study was to analyze tooth mobility changes in zzso permanent teeth and relate this to type of zzso healing zzso tissue healing zzso zzso healing with zzso ligament zzso and zzso with zzso of zzso tissue zzso because of pulp necrosis in the zzso zzso Furthermore, the effect of age, location of the fracture on the zzso and observation period on mobility values was zzso zzso values were measured for 44 of 95 previous reported zzso permanent zzso zzso changes were measured with a zzso zzso and zzso zzso served as zzso The mobility values represented the zzso excursion of the root measured in zzso when the tooth received a frontal and a zzso impact of 100 g zzso In 18 cases of hard tissue healing zzso a slightly increased mobility was seen after 3 months and 1 year, and a zzso of mobility value was usually found after 5 and 10 zzso In 17 cases of zzso healing, generally a higher mobility was found in comparison with root fractures healing with hard zzso and a consistent decrease in mobility value was found in the course of the 10 year observation zzso A tendency for reduced mobility over time was found, a relation that could possibly be explained by the known general decrease in tooth mobility with increasing zzso Finally, nine cases of zzso with initial zzso of zzso tissue zzso because of pulp necrosis in the zzso zzso resulted in increasing mobility values possibly related to a lateral breakdown of the zzso in relation to the fracture zzso In control teeth, a lowering of mobility was found over the course of a 10-year observation zzso In conclusion, mobility changes appeared to reflect the zzso healing stages and known age effects upon tooth zzso
