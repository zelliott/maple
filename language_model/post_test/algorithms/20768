zzso models of reinforcement learning have recently been applied to analysis of brain imaging and neural recording data to identity neural zzso of specific processes of decision making, such as valuation of action candidates and parameters of value zzso However, for such zzso analysis zzso selecting an appropriate model is zzso In this study we analyze the process of choice learning in rats using zzso zzso We show that zzso which is a standard reinforcement learning algorithm, does not adequately reflect the features of choice zzso Thus, we propose a generalized reinforcement learning zzso zzso that incorporates the negative reward effect of reward loss and forgetting of values of actions not zzso Using the zzso zzso method for zzso zzso we demonstrated that the zzso zzso can predict an zzso choice behaviors as efficiently as the best zzso zzso The results suggest the usefulness of the zzso for the zzso analysis of neural processes involved in decision zzso
