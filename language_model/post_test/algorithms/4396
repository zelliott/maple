An zzso zzso is presented that allows the user to model the subsurface residence time of shallow ground water zzso stream base flow based on zzso scale variation of zzso zzso The zzso accounts for the effects of radioactive zzso the shallow subsurface mixing of ground water with zzso and ground water zzso The inverse of the zzso modeled flux through the saturated zone is equivalent to the residence zzso The data required for this model include at least two zzso of zzso in base flow for a given stream location made at least a decade apart and the long-term zzso input in zzso for the region of zzso The model is sensitive to relatively small changes in zzso zzso and is limited by zzso uncertainties to an accuracy of approximately zzso zzso The zzso was applied to stream base flow for several zzso in the Piedmont Province of Georgia in which zzso zzso were measured during the early 1990s and again in the zzso The model results produced highly zzso residence times for three zzso similar zzso in the Upper zzso zzso in North Central zzso The best estimate of the average residence time for ground water zzso base flow in this Piedmont basin using this new method is between approximately 14 and 18 zzso These results are generally consistent with calculations made in previous studies, and these relatively long residence times can be attributed to the storage of water in the clay zzso that dominate Piedmont Province zzso
