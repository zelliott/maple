To develop and validate an zzso to automatically zzso white matter zzso zzso zzso 

Images acquired as part of the Dallas Heart zzso a zzso zzso study of cardiovascular health, were used to develop and validate the zzso zzso zzso prepared rapid acquisition zzso echo zzso and zzso zzso inversion recovery zzso images were acquired from zzso zzso Images from 161 participants zzso of the zzso were used to set an intensity threshold to maximize the agreement between the zzso and a qualitative rating made by a zzso The resulting zzso was run on the entire cohort and zzso analyses were used to refine the zzso volume zzso The zzso automatic zzso burden estimate was then compared to manual quantitative zzso of zzso volume in 28 participants distributed across the range of volumes seen in the entire zzso 

The zzso showed good agreement with the zzso readings of a trained zzso the zzso Rank Order zzso zzso was r zzso zzso Linear zzso analysis showed a good correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso analysis showed a bias of zzso zzso and a standard zzso of zzso zzso over a range of zzso to 41 zzso 

We have developed an zzso that automatically estimates the volume of zzso burden using an zzso and a zzso zzso This provides a tool for evaluating the zzso burden of large populations to investigate the relationship between zzso burden and other health zzso
