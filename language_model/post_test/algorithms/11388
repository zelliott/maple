We report on a method for zzso of zzso mode zzso and zzso in zzso plastic optical fibers zzso from the shapes of impulse responses at two different fiber zzso While alternating the fiber zzso zzso between simulated and reference impulse responses are minimized by zzso both mode zzso and zzso parameters using zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso approach to zzso zzso power flow equation fast zzso of simulated impulse responses is zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso and zzso parameters zzso to values that reconstruct fiber characteristics reported by other zzso We show that our results can be used for prediction of impulse responses, yielding determination of frequency responses, fiber zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that our method enables characterization of zzso from fiber impulse response zzso
