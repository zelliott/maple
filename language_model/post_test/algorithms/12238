zzso learning is a challenged task in machine zzso In this context, the data associated with one class are far fewer than those associated with the other zzso Traditional machine learning methods seeking zzso accuracy over a full range of instances are not suitable to deal with this problem, since they tend to zzso all the data into a majority class, usually the less important zzso In this correspondence, the authors describe a new approach named the biased zzso probability machine zzso to deal with the problem of zzso zzso This zzso model is demonstrated to provide an elegant and systematic way for zzso zzso More specifically, by controlling the accuracy of the majority class under all possible choices of zzso zzso with a given mean and zzso zzso this model can zzso and systematically incorporate a bias for the minority zzso By establishing an explicit connection between the zzso accuracy and the bias, this approach zzso itself from the many current zzso zzso these methods often impose a certain bias on the minority data by adapting intermediate factors via the zzso zzso The authors detail the theoretical foundation, prove its zzso propose an efficient zzso algorithm, and perform a series of experiments to evaluate the novel zzso The comparison with other competitive methods demonstrates the effectiveness of this new zzso
