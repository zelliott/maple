Cancer zzso represents a zzso system that requires mathematical modeling for complete understanding of the zzso The combination of zzso with radiation zzso has been recently shown to successfully eliminate tumors when zzso alone zzso However, it introduces a new level of zzso We have developed a mathematical model, based on population zzso that captures the essential elements of zzso The existence of corresponding equilibrium points related to complete zzso partial zzso and therapy failure is proved and zzso The parameters of the model were estimated by fitting to experimental zzso By using simulations we analyzed the influence of parameters that describe the interaction between virus and tumor cell on the outcome of the zzso Furthermore, we evaluated relevant therapeutic scenarios for zzso and offered elements for zzso
