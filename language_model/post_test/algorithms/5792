zzso analysis plays an essential role in microbial community zzso zzso zzso is one of the most widely employed approaches to finding operational zzso units, the basis for many downstream zzso Most existing zzso have zzso space and zzso complexities, and thus can be used only for small or zzso zzso We propose a new online zzso zzso that simultaneously addresses the space and zzso issues of prior zzso The basic idea is to partition a sequence space into a set of zzso using a partition tree constructed using a zzso then zzso refine a zzso structure in these zzso The technique relies on new methods for fast zzso searching and efficient dynamic zzso and deletion of tree zzso To avoid exhaustive zzso of zzso distances between zzso we represent each cluster of sequences as a zzso zzso and define a set of operations to align these zzso sequences and zzso genetic distances between zzso We present analyses of space and zzso complexity, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our new zzso using a human gut zzso data set with over one million zzso The new zzso exhibits a zzso time and space complexity comparable to greedy zzso zzso zzso while achieving a similar accuracy to the standard zzso zzso zzso
