Studies have shown that timing of protein zzso zzso content, and speed of zzso significantly affect zzso protein zzso Our aim was to determine if one can spare lean body mass during energy restriction by varying the quality and the timing of protein zzso zzso volunteers followed a zzso restricted energy zzso Four groups were zzso zzso pulse, zzso spread, zzso protein zzso zzso zzso pulse, and MSP spread zzso zzso zzso per zzso In zzso groups, zzso were the only protein zzso it was MSP in MSP zzso zzso were distributed in four meals per day in the proportion zzso in the pulse zzso it was zzso in the spread zzso We measured weight, body zzso nitrogen balance, zzso zzso perception of hunger, plasma zzso zzso tissue zzso and whole body protein zzso Volunteers lost zzso zzso zzso zzso of weight, zzso zzso zzso zzso of fat, and zzso zzso zzso zzso of lean mass, with no difference between zzso In zzso zzso cell size and zzso expression of various genes were reduced with no difference between zzso zzso perception was also never different between zzso In the last week, due to a higher zzso of protein degradation and despite a lower stimulation of protein zzso zzso balance between whole body protein synthesis and degradation was better with zzso than with zzso It seems likely that the positive effect of zzso on protein balance occurred only at the end of the zzso
