In this paper, an zzso based on a joint use of spectral and zzso techniques for heart rate zzso zzso analysis is zzso First, the measured zzso data are passed into a trimmed moving average zzso filtering system to generate a lower frequency zzso time series and a higher frequency zzso one that approximately reflect the sympathetic and zzso activities, zzso Since the zzso zzso can be used to characterize the level of chaos in complex zzso systems, the largest zzso zzso corresponding to the complex sympathetic and zzso systems are then estimated from the zzso and zzso time series, respectively, using an existing zzso zzso results of a zzso maneuver experiment indicate that both characteristic zzso or their combinations might serve as a set of innovative and robust indicators for zzso analysis, even under the contamination of sparse impulses due to zzso beats in the zzso zzso
