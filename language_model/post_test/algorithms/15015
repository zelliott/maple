Researchers and clinicians commonly use the zzso system of zzso et zzso as a basis for treatment decisions during the active phase of zzso disease because of its putative utility as a predictor of long-term zzso It is generally assumed that this system has an acceptable degree of zzso This zzso however, is not convincingly supported by the zzso 

The purpose of the present study was to assess the zzso and zzso reliability of the zzso system of zzso et zzso with use of a zzso zzso zzso During the zzso phase, nine zzso independently used the system to evaluate the zzso of zzso mature patients who had been managed for zzso zzso The intervention between the zzso and zzso zzso consisted of a zzso session during which all zzso jointly arrived at standardized definitions of the various joint structures that are assessed with use of the zzso zzso The effect of these definitions on reliability then was assessed by zzso the zzso during the zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso reliability zzso ranged from zzso to zzso and the zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso The zzso zzso reliability zzso ranged from zzso to zzso and the zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso to the zzso was a lack of agreement concerning the assessment of joint structures and the way in which the zzso translated these evaluations into a zzso according to the system of zzso et zzso 

Although zzso reliability was marginally acceptable, the degree of zzso between the zzso assigned by different zzso even after the intervention - calls into question the reliability of the system of zzso et zzso consequently, the zzso of any treatment decisions, outcome evaluations, or zzso studies based on this system is also in zzso
