A model has been developed based on random walk theory that allows the diffusion of light along a principal axis to differ from that in zzso zzso We present expressions that describe the zzso intensity measured across a slab and on the surface of a zzso medium for a principal axis oriented parallel or perpendicular to the zzso The model of zzso zzso is compared with experimental data acquired by use of a phantom consisting of wax fibers arranged within a solid cube of zzso It is shown that a single set of optical parameters is sufficient to model the experimental zzso acquired across all three zzso of the zzso
