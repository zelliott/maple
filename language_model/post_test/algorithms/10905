zzso zzso responses of the cone system to a zzso stimulus can exhibit a zzso variation in zzso This phenomenon of zzso period doubling has been attributed to a zzso feedback mechanism within the zzso that alters response zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate zzso zzso in period doubling in the zzso of the human cone system, and to assess the implications of this zzso for signal processing within the zzso Period doubling was examined in a group of 12 visually normal subjects, using zzso zzso flicker and harmonic analysis of the zzso zzso For all subjects, the zzso responses to zzso flicker (a frequency commonly used zzso were characterized by a harmonic component at the stimulus frequency and at higher zzso that were integral multiples of the stimulus frequency, as zzso In addition, six of the subjects showed period doubling at 32 zzso characterized by harmonic components at zzso multiples of a frequency that was half the stimulus frequency (the zzso However, the zzso itself did not exceed the noise zzso These findings suggest that the zzso is generated prior to or at the site that produces the zzso higher zzso of the zzso response, and that a subsequent zzso filter zzso this zzso zzso of harmonic components of the subjects' zzso zzso at other stimulus zzso as well as a zzso analysis of the zzso zzso suggested that individual differences in period doubling may be due to zzso variation in the strength of the hypothesized feedback signal and/or the time constant of its zzso
