zzso generation zzso typically make use of the plane wave result when zzso values for the zzso zzso zzso from experimental zzso This approach, however, ignores the effects of zzso zzso and receiver integration which are common features in a typical zzso Our aim is to determine the importance of these effects when making zzso of zzso over different sample dimensions, or using different input zzso We describe a three-dimensional zzso model designed to accurately predict the results of a typical experiment, based on a zzso zzso An experiment is designed to measure the zzso variation of the fundamental and second harmonic zzso components in an zzso zzso and the results are compared with those predicted by the zzso The absolute zzso values are then extracted from the experimental data using both the simulation and the standard plane wave zzso A difference is observed between the values returned by the two methods, which varies with zzso range and input zzso
