In this work we propose an approach to reduce the zzso noise for a given dynamic range, zzso the number of zzso of an analog to digital zzso used in an zzso zzso In this approach, the receiver gain is zzso increased so that the free induction zzso is recorded in such an emphasized way that the zzso signal is digitized using as many number of bits as possible, and at the stage of data processing, the original signal profile is restored by applying the zzso that compensates the effect of the zzso This approach, which we call zzso after zzso gain zzso during zzso sequence with Time zzso is performed in a solid-state system containing a pair of zzso zzso one of which is fully zzso labeled and the other is naturally zzso It is demonstrated that the zzso smaller peak buried in the zzso noise in the conventional approach can be revealed by employing zzso
