In this letter, we propose a coordinate rotation digital computer zzso zzso for computing the zzso phase of a support zzso machine zzso in zzso zzso using only shift and add operations and avoiding zzso zzso This result is obtained thanks to a zzso zzso which greatly zzso the zzso zzso phase zzso and, at the same time, maintains good zzso performance respect to the conventional zzso zzso
