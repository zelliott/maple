Cellular calcium transient zzso are zzso zzso in the peak zzso calcium concentration exhibited by cardiac cells during rapid electrical stimulation or under pathological zzso zzso transient zzso promote action potential duration zzso which have been linked to the onset of life-threatening zzso zzso Here we use a recently developed zzso detailed mathematical model of zzso zzso to investigate both zzso and deterministic aspects of zzso calcium dynamics during zzso The model combines a zzso distributed description of zzso calcium zzso where a large number of calcium release units are zzso distributed throughout the cell, with a full set of zzso membrane zzso The results demonstrate that zzso channel zzso at the level of single calcium release units can influence the zzso zzso dynamics by causing phase zzso over many beats during fixed frequency pacing close to the zzso zzso They also demonstrate the existence of a wide range of zzso zzso Depending on the sign and magnitude of zzso zzso calcium zzso can be zzso synchronized or zzso in or out of phase with action potential duration zzso and the zzso separating zzso regions of calcium zzso can be expelled from or trapped inside the zzso This range of states is found to be larger than previously anticipated by including a robust global zzso where calcium zzso can be zzso synchronized but out of phase with action potential duration zzso The results are explained by a combined theoretical analysis of zzso stability and zzso motion using general zzso maps of the zzso dynamics and zzso zzso
