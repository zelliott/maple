Even though zzso has been employed and studied extensively for over 30 years, the attempts to explain its mechanism have not been entirely zzso The basic carrier model uses four rate zzso that describe association of an zzso and carrier, transfer of the complex across the zzso zzso of the complex, and transfer of the free carrier back across the zzso If the basic model is correct all of these zzso are independent of zzso zzso In previous work with zzso the rate zzso for transfer of free carrier, transfer of complexes, and zzso were independent of the zzso but the rate constant for association varied zzso No satisfactory explanation for these observations was zzso In this study current relaxations after charge zzso have been analyzed using digital data zzso a zzso algorithm, and inspection of linear plots of zzso In agreement with previous results the relaxations for sufficiently high zzso or zzso zzso contain three exponential zzso but the rate zzso for association and zzso decrease to similar zzso as zzso concentration zzso A simple extension of the carrier model to allow a more realistic description of association and zzso is in good agreement with the rate zzso fitted in the present study but not those for low zzso zzso found in previous zzso At high zzso zzso the zzso step in association appears to be a change in the zzso of the free carrier preceding the zzso association zzso Transfer of neutral, free zzso between the surfaces is slower than the transfer of the charged zzso zzso Transfer of the complex may be hastened by deformation of the zzso or transfer of the free carrier may be slowed by a need for zzso zzso
