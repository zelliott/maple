A zzso flat flame on a circular porous plug zzso can form patterns of one or two concentric rings of cells in which zzso hotter regions are separated by zzso cooler zzso and zzso Dynamic states are found at zzso values that are zzso between those of the ordered zzso Rotating states, modulated rotating states, hopping states, and zzso ordered states have all been observed with motions of approximately 100 zzso These states have been described using the ideas of zzso zzso Their characteristics have been analyzed using modal decomposition zzso zzso states are zzso and zzso different from these other dynamic zzso In zzso states one or both of the concentric rings rotate very slowly, approximately zzso zzso each speeding up and slowing down in a manner unique to that zzso zzso of the angular displacement and zzso values of the angular zzso are presented for four zzso zzso The experimental results are discussed in the context of the physical characteristics of the flame front and in terms of zzso of systems with zzso Many of the principal features of zzso motion are not yet zzso
