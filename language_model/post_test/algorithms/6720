We develop a joint model for the analysis of zzso and survival data in the presence of data zzso We use a mixed effects model for the repeated measures that incorporates both zzso and zzso random effects, with subjects zzso within zzso A Cox frailty model is used for the survival model in order to accommodate the zzso We then link the two responses via the common zzso random effects, or zzso This model allows us to simultaneously evaluate the effect of zzso on the two types of responses, while accounting for both the relationship between the responses and data zzso The model was motivated by a study of zzso zzso disease patients undergoing zzso where we wished to evaluate the effect of iron treatment on both the patients' zzso levels and survival times, with the patients clustered by enrollment zzso
