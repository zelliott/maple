zzso between zzso of proteins is often critical for zzso These motions and proteins with large scale flexibility in general are often not readily amenable to conventional structural analysis such as X-ray zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso or electron zzso A common evolution of a zzso project, once a high resolution structure has been determined, is to zzso possible sights of zzso Here we describe an analysis tool using relatively inexpensive small angle X-ray scattering zzso zzso to identify flexibility and validate a constructed minimal ensemble of models, which represent highly populated zzso in zzso The resolution of these results is sufficient to address the questions being asked: what kinds of zzso do the zzso sample in solution? In our rigid body modeling strategy zzso molecular dynamics zzso simulations are used to explore zzso zzso A common strategy is to perform the MD simulation on the zzso connections at very high temperature, where the additional kinetic energy prevents the zzso from becoming trapped in a local zzso The MD simulations provide an ensemble of molecular models from which a zzso curve is calculated and compared to the experimental zzso A genetic zzso is used to identify the minimal ensemble zzso ensemble search, zzso required to best fit the experimental zzso We demonstrate the use of zzso in several model and in four experimental zzso
