The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate the utility of a zzso zzso zzso of a zzso animal model zzso to estimate breed composition means and additive genetic zzso as well as on zzso due to the segregation between zzso The zzso and a conventional animal model zzso were both applied to five simulated data sets derived from each of two different zzso zzso I consisted of crosses between two breeds having a twofold difference in genetic zzso and a zzso segregation zzso zzso II had the same population structure as zzso I, except that the two breeds had the same genetic zzso with no segregation zzso that is, zzso II was essentially single breed in its genetic zzso For zzso I, zzso means of all zzso components obtained by zzso were zzso with zzso zzso probability intervals zzso having the expected coverage based on five zzso The zzso showed a slightly superior performance over the AM for genetic predictions in zzso I, although there was no evidence that the use of the zzso translated into greater genetic gains relative to the use of the zzso Nevertheless, the zzso was clearly demonstrated to have superior fit to the data using zzso factors zzso as the basis for model zzso As expected, the zzso and AM performed equally well in zzso zzso A data set consisting of zzso zzso gain zzso records of a zzso population zzso animals in the zzso also was zzso The zzso zzso on zzso and zzso additive zzso zzso substantially zzso zzso had a zzso mean zzso of zzso with a zzso zzso of zzso to zzso whereas the corresponding values for the zzso were zzso and zzso to zzso zzso The zzso mean genetic zzso due to the segregation between these breeds was zzso zzso with a zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso and represented zzso of the zzso but only zzso of the zzso zzso mean genetic zzso The zzso mean zzso using the AM was zzso presumed common across the two breeds, with a zzso zzso of zzso to zzso The zzso heavily favored the zzso over the AM for the zzso zzso zzso the zzso represents a viable alternative to AM for zzso genetic evaluations, providing the necessary flexibility in modeling zzso genetic zzso of breed composition zzso
