This paper presents fuzzy zzso neural network zzso models for prediction and identification of zzso zzso zzso The proposed zzso models are obtained from the traditional zzso fuzzy system by replacing the zzso part of fuzzy rules with zzso basis functions that have the ability to zzso both in time and frequency zzso The first and last model use zzso and zzso of zzso and translated versions of zzso zzso basis functions, respectively, and in the second model, zzso parts of the rules consist of zzso function of zzso zzso type of zzso functions are used in IF part of the fuzzy zzso A fast zzso training algorithm, zzso the zzso method, is used to find the optimal values for unknown parameters of the zzso zzso zzso examples are also given to compare the effectiveness of the models with the other known methods in the zzso According to simulation results, we see that the proposed zzso models have impressive zzso zzso
