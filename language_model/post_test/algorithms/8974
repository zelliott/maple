zzso hypertension zzso develops in approximately 50% of all patients with severe traumatic brain injury zzso zzso it is very important to identify a suitable animal model to study and understand the zzso of zzso zzso to develop effective zzso 

We describe a new experimental zzso model designed to simulate expansive brain zzso causing zzso Under zzso zzso was simulated with a balloon zzso The zzso variables were measured with zzso pressure zzso zzso monitoring, zzso cerebral zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

None of the animals died during the zzso The zzso zzso showed a slower rise compared with zzso zzso We found a correlation between zzso and cerebral zzso 

The model described here seems useful to understand some of the zzso characteristics of acute zzso
