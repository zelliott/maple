In zzso contrast studies modulated by the blood zzso zzso effect, it is often assumed that zzso is a purely zzso positive contrast agent in zzso images, and the effects that are not due to blood zzso zzso contrast are small enough to be zzso In this study, this assumption is re-evaluated and zzso zzso zzso effects in zzso zzso contrast studies of the human brain were zzso We observed significant negative signal changes in zzso images in the frontal zzso zzso maps suggest that this effect was primarily due to increased zzso zzso from increased zzso field zzso due to zzso changes from oxygen in and around the upper zzso These zzso field effects were shown to scale with magnetic field zzso Signal changes observed around the brain periphery and in the zzso suggest the effect of image zzso from zzso bulk zzso shifts, along with a possible contribution from decreased zzso due to oxygen dissolved in the zzso zzso zzso the concentration of zzso oxygen was shown to mitigate negative contrast of molecular oxygen due to these effects, while still maintaining sufficient blood zzso zzso contrast to produce accurate zzso of cerebral blood zzso
