The objective of this study was to zzso the zzso and zzso of fetal cardiac zzso volumes obtained using zzso image correlation zzso and zzso zzso zzso Analysis zzso GE zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A technique was developed to zzso zzso volumes using the zzso zzso zzso zzso Twenty-five normal zzso were evaluated for the zzso zzso to compare the zzso of variation zzso of zzso volumes obtained using 15 degrees and 30 degrees zzso zzso to compare the zzso between 3 methods of zzso zzso zzso zzso Manual zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to determine zzso by calculating agreement and reliability of zzso volumes when each zzso was measured twice by 3 zzso zzso was assessed by obtaining 2 zzso from each of 44 normal zzso For each zzso 2 zzso volume calculations were performed, and agreement and reliability were zzso Additionally, measurement error was zzso 

zzso zzso was better with 15 degrees rotation than 30 degrees (15 zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso versus 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso volumes obtained with zzso zzso Trace had better agreement than those obtained using either zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso or Manual Trace zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso volumes were zzso with good agreement and excellent reliability for both zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso volumes were zzso with negligible differences in agreement and good zzso In addition, bias between zzso acquisitions was minimal zzso mean percent difference, zzso zzso limits of agreement, zzso 

Fetal zzso using zzso and zzso allows zzso and zzso calculation of zzso volumes with the zzso zzso zzso zzso
