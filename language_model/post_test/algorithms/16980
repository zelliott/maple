The zzso plot is a popular zzso time series analysis tool because of its intuitive display of dynamic system zzso zzso plots have been used to zzso heart rate and respiratory pattern zzso However, conventional quantitative analysis relies primarily on statistical zzso of the cumulative distribution of points, making it difficult to interpret irregular or complex zzso Moreover, the plots are constructed to reflect highly correlated regions of the time series, reducing the amount of zzso information that is presented and thereby hiding potentially relevant zzso We propose zzso zzso zzso zzso a novel analysis methodology that uses standard techniques to zzso the zzso distribution of points and to detect zzso sources responsible for zzso zzso In addition, the analysis is applied across multiple time delays, yielding a richer insight into system dynamics than the traditional circle return zzso The method is applied to data sets of zzso intervals and to synthetic point process data extracted from the Lorenz time zzso The results demonstrate that zzso zzso the traditional analysis and can be applied more generally, including zzso plots with multiple zzso and more consistently than the conventional measures and can address questions regarding potential structure underlying the zzso of a data zzso
