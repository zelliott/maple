We have recently shown that an energy penalty for the incorporation of residual zzso constraints into molecular structure calculations can be formulated without the explicit knowledge of the zzso orientation zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 1999, 15, zzso Here we report the zzso of such an zzso into the program zzso The new zzso is easy to use and has good convergence zzso The zzso is used for the structure refinement of the zzso zzso protein using 252 zzso zzso zzso The approach is compared to the conventional penalty function with explicit knowledge of the orientation zzso zzso and zzso No significant differences are found with respect to speed, zzso core quality or coordinate zzso
