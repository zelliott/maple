As a result of previous large, zzso linkage studies there is a substantial amount of existing marker zzso Due to the increased sample size, genetic maps estimated from these data could be more accurate than publicly available zzso However, current methods for map zzso are restricted to data sets containing zzso with a small number of individuals, or cannot make full use of marker data that are observed at several zzso on members of large, extended zzso In this article, a maximum likelihood zzso method for map zzso that can make full use of the marker data in a large, zzso linkage study is zzso The method is applied to replicate sets of simulated marker data involving seven linked zzso and pedigree structures based on the real zzso linkage study of zzso et zzso zzso American Journal of Human zzso 73, zzso The zzso of the zzso estimate is accurately estimated, and tests of both simple and composite zzso hypotheses are zzso An efficient procedure for combining map estimates over data sets is also zzso
