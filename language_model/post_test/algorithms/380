zzso zzso are solid or zzso zzso formed in the zzso zzso and may be caused by a variety of zzso zzso This paper presents a novel active zzso model for precise zzso of zzso zzso of various shapes according to their zzso and texture, as displayed in ultrasound zzso zzso The proposed model, named joint zzso zzso is based on a modified zzso functional that, in addition to regional image intensity, incorporates statistical texture information zzso by feature zzso The zzso are zzso within the functional through new zzso zzso zzso The JET model requires only a rough region of interest within the zzso zzso as input and automatically proceeds with precise zzso of the zzso revealing their shape and zzso The performance of the JET model was validated on a range of US images displaying zzso and zzso zzso of various zzso The zzso of the results shows that the JET model: 1) provides precise zzso of zzso zzso as compared to zzso zzso zzso obtained by experts and 2) zzso with the limitations of the previous zzso US zzso approaches as it is capable of zzso zzso zzso regardless of their zzso or zzso
