A zzso model was used to evaluate the variation of zzso dental arch length with respect to the zzso zzso but without zzso the zzso zzso In zzso terms, the equations of the zzso representing the lower dental arch, before and after zzso inclination of 1 zzso and of 1 degree, with controlled and uncontrolled zzso were zzso The length of the zzso dental arch changed in the zzso arch form by zzso zzso for each zzso of zzso inclination with respect to the zzso functional plane, by zzso zzso for each degree of controlled tipping and by zzso zzso for each degree of uncontrolled zzso In the elliptical arch form zzso zzso zzso it changed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, in the zzso form by zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the circular form by zzso zzso and zzso zzso and in the zzso form by zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results show that by changing the arch form without zzso the dimension of the dental arch, different arch lengths can be gained for each zzso of zzso In addition, by controlled tipping an zzso arch one-fifth longer than by uncontrolled tipping can be zzso It would be zzso in zzso treatment planning to evaluate the type of dental arch, since the space available or the space required changes depending on the arch form and on the zzso tooth zzso
