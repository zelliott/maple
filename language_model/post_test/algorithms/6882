Although zzso are increasingly used in soil zzso little is known about their effects on soil zzso zzso In this work, the surface and pore properties of randomly zzso zzso zzso and three typical clay minerals were zzso and the effects of zzso zzso on clay minerals were studied using water vapor zzso and mercury intrusion zzso zzso As compared to clay zzso for pure zzso very large surface area and volume of zzso pores zzso were zzso Energy of interaction with water zzso volume of zzso pores zzso and zzso dimensions in both pore size ranges of zzso were lower than those of the zzso When increasing amounts of zzso were added to the zzso the surface area and zzso volume decreased and zzso energy zzso The volume of zzso decreased after zzso treatments for zzso and zzso and increased for zzso As deduced from the zzso dimensions increase, the pore structure of the minerals became more complex with zzso zzso The observed changes were in general contrary to these expected when zzso and minerals coexist as separate, zzso zzso and suggested strong interaction of zzso with clay zzso
