zzso zzso and fast atom zzso zzso positive zzso mass zzso zzso of 1 : 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso complex allowed the detection of gaseous zzso 1 : 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of such zzso 1 : 1 zzso species showed the zzso zzso to be retained to a significant extent by the host and by its cage fragmentation products, in spite of the higher zzso affinity of zzso with respect to that of zzso This requires an zzso zzso zzso transfer to occur within the gaseous zzso zzso zzso could be accounted for by the promotion of such an zzso process; however, the zzso affinity decrease of the guest determined by the loss of the elements of zzso which is a dominant zzso zzso reaction of pure zzso zzso could also provide a rationale for such an zzso zzso zzso zzso This proposal parallels the reaction scheme we had previously formulated for the analogous zzso and tandem zzso zzso of 1 : 1 zzso inclusion complex with the zzso zzso guest undergoing zzso
