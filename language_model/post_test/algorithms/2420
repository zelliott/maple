A core assumption of many theories of development is that children can learn indirectly from other zzso However, indirect experience (or zzso is not constrained to provide zzso zzso As a result, if children are to capitalize on this source of knowledge, they must be able to zzso who is trustworthy and who is zzso How might a zzso make such zzso while at the same time learning about the zzso What zzso if any, might children bring to this problem? We address these questions with a zzso model of zzso trust in which learners reason about the zzso and zzso of an zzso We show that the model captures the zzso shown by young children in four zzso zzso using zzso accuracy to zzso how much to trust zzso zzso using zzso recent accuracy to overcome effects of zzso zzso zzso trust based on consensus among zzso and zzso using information about zzso to decide not to zzso The model also explains zzso changes in performance between 3 and 4 years of age as a result of changing default assumptions about the zzso of other zzso
