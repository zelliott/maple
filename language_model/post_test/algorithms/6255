We propose independent component analysis zzso as a zzso for synthetic zzso zzso zzso in zzso SAM is a very useful method for source current zzso However, SAM cannot separate one source from the others when there are zzso zzso especially for successively active zzso The proposed method compensates the intrinsic drawback of SAM with zzso which is feasible for 3-D imaging of the zzso current distribution of specific zzso zzso By using our method, we successfully localized an accessory zzso of a patient suffering from the zzso zzso
