The Parkinson's Disease zzso zzso is the most widely used Parkinson's specific measure of health zzso It is increasingly used in treatment trials, sometimes as a primary zzso where any missing data can potentially cause difficulties in zzso 

The purpose of this article is to evaluate the zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso of missing dimension scores on the zzso zzso 

A postal survey of patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease zzso A total of zzso patients were surveyed and zzso zzso questionnaires returned completed or partially zzso Of these, complete zzso data were available in zzso zzso zzso Data were deleted from this complete zzso and a zzso of 200 respondents from this zzso and then zzso using the zzso zzso results were then compared to the zzso before data zzso 

zzso gained from zzso of data closely mirrored that of the complete zzso in each zzso zzso statistics, mean scores and spread of scores were almost identical between original and zzso zzso Furthermore, original and zzso zzso were highly correlated zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and mean differences were small zzso 

The results suggest that the use of zzso for the zzso provides data that closely mirrors the original when this has been deliberately zzso zzso zzso is likely to be appropriate for trials using the zzso that contains missing data zzso
