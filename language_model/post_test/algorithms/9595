This study developed an improved motion zzso zzso for zzso strain imaging that employs a dynamic programming zzso In this article, we model the motion zzso task as an zzso zzso Since tissue motion under external mechanical stimuli often should be reasonably zzso a set of cost functions combining correlation and various levels of motion continuity constraint were used to zzso the motion zzso To solve the zzso problem with a reasonable zzso load, a dynamic programming technique that does not require zzso was used to obtain displacement zzso in zzso zzso Then, a zzso zzso zzso was used to calculate local zzso in fractional zzso Two zzso schemes were investigated with in zzso ultrasound echo data zzso We found that the proposed zzso provides more accurate displacement estimates than our previous zzso for in zzso clinical zzso In particular, the new zzso is capable of tracking motion in more complex anatomy and increases strain image consistency in a sequence of zzso zzso results also suggest that a significantly longer sequence of high contrast strain images could be obtained with the new zzso compared with the previous zzso The new zzso can also tolerate larger motion zzso zzso cavity in an zzso zzso zzso
