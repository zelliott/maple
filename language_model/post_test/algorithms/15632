This study is concerned with the zzso of a zzso zzso linked to the plasma compartment of a larger mathematical model previously zzso zzso these models can be used to zzso amongst other things, fluid and small zzso zzso rates by the zzso information that should prove useful in evaluating values and trends related to zzso fluid balance for different clinical conditions to establish fluid administration protocols and for educational zzso The zzso module assumes zzso zzso responses of the kidney to changes in plasma volume and/or plasma sodium content from their normal zzso set zzso zzso hormonal influences are not explicitly formulated in this zzso zzso The model also considers that the zzso zzso rates of small zzso other than sodium are zzso to the zzso rate of zzso As part of the model development two aspects are emphasized zzso the zzso of parameters related to the zzso elimination of fluid and small zzso and zzso model validation via comparisons between the model predictions and selected experimental zzso For zzso model predictions of the zzso dynamics are compared with new experimental data for two zzso plasma overload resulting from external fluid infusion zzso infusions of zzso solutions and/or zzso saline zzso and zzso zzso zzso conditions that result from the external loss of zzso The present study demonstrates that the zzso kidney module presented above can provide good short-term predictions with respect to all zzso zzso considered zzso zzso implications of the model are also zzso
