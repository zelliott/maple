zzso of the relationship between zzso structure and its dynamic behavior is essential for understanding protein zzso In this study, the description of a protein three-dimensional structure as a network of hydrogen bonding interactions zzso zzso is introduced as a tool for exploring protein structure and zzso HB plot offers a simple way of analyzing protein secondary and zzso zzso Moreover, hydrogen bonds stabilizing secondary structural elements and those formed between distant zzso zzso as zzso hydrogen zzso be easily distinguished in HB plot, thus, zzso acid zzso involved in stabilizing protein structure and function can be easily zzso By analyzing the network of zzso interactions the possible spread of information within a protein can be investigated as zzso The zzso in zzso hydrogen bonding network during zzso transitions were investigated through case zzso and showed the zzso of HB plot in exploring zzso details in zzso
