zzso of zzso random zzso libraries is a powerful technique for identifying peptides that mimic zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso However, peptides derived using zzso zzso may represent zzso for a diverse range of zzso Hence following screening of zzso libraries with zzso zzso including zzso disease zzso a procedure is required to distinguish relevant from irrelevant zzso We therefore applied the multiple sequence alignment zzso zzso together with a zzso for scoring zzso acid zzso based on zzso properties to generate guide trees depicting zzso of selected zzso A random zzso library was zzso nine times using no selecting zzso zzso G zzso from zzso of subjects with zzso diseases zzso zzso zzso zzso and type 1 zzso and three zzso zzso zzso that contained zzso to overlapping zzso on the Ross River zzso envelope protein zzso zzso randomly sampled from the library were distributed throughout the guide tree of the total set of peptides whilst many of the peptides derived in the absence of selecting zzso aligned to a single zzso zzso peptides selected by different sources of zzso aligned to separate zzso each with a different zzso acid zzso These alignments were validated by testing all of the 53 zzso derived using zzso from zzso zzso for zzso by capture zzso with zzso affinity zzso on the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso complex zzso the major zzso in zzso only those zzso that aligned to zzso clusters were zzso Hence the multiple sequence alignment procedure discriminates relevant from irrelevant zzso and thus a major difficulty with zzso zzso random zzso libraries with zzso zzso is zzso
