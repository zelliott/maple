During the last decade, molecular biology has demonstrated the extraordinary zzso of genetic abnormalities in zzso disease zzso The main zzso are either of the zzso or zzso type, transmitted with dominant or zzso zzso zzso zzso CMT is less rare than it was initially described and is often zzso as zzso dominant zzso Linked zzso are zzso disease, zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso to pressure zzso Each zzso can be due to different zzso and concerned genes are zzso zzso each zzso can express different zzso zzso diagnostic strategy of CMT is mainly zzso on three zzso - zzso expertise which is based on the analysis of the inheritance mode and on zzso data, which are peculiar in zzso - knowledge of respective occurrence of the different zzso and zzso which is increasing - technical feasibility of molecular biology methods which is important to consider, even though progress are zzso zzso According to these considerations, a strategy is proposed for molecular diagnosis of zzso
