zzso zzso trees constructed from different zzso zzso from different zzso are often conflicting with one another, zzso they cannot be integrated into a single zzso zzso zzso networks have become an important tool in molecular evolution, and rooted zzso networks are able to represent conflicting rooted zzso zzso zzso the development of appropriate methods to zzso rooted zzso networks from rooted zzso trees has attracted considerable research interest of zzso The zzso zzso proposed by van zzso et zzso is able to construct much simpler networks than other available methods, but it is extremely slow, and the networks it zzso are dependent on the order of the input zzso Here, we introduce an improved zzso algorithm, zzso We show that zzso is faster than zzso and less dependent on the input data zzso Moreover, zzso is able to construct much simpler networks than almost all other zzso zzso is available at zzso
