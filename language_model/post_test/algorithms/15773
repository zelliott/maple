We investigated the effect of two IV zzso zzso and zzso on airway responsiveness in a rat model of chronic zzso zzso in comparison with zzso zzso zzso rats were obtained using a zzso chamber zzso days at a zzso pressure of 380 zzso zzso The ability of both zzso to relax and prevent zzso contraction was assessed in isolated zzso rings zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso agent zzso zzso zzso of both compounds relaxed zzso rings zzso with zzso or zzso with a similar zzso in zzso and zzso zzso In zzso rings zzso with zzso the negative zzso of zzso that reduced the zzso contraction by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso rats and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso rats, zzso At a fixed zzso zzso (3 zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso rings contraction in response to cumulative zzso of zzso and zzso However, in contrast with the equivalent zzso effect of both zzso zzso was zzso less effective than zzso for zzso the subsequent contraction to zzso and zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso retain their zzso properties in zzso rat airways by acting on the zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso may cause airway zzso or zzso in patients with normal or pathological zzso This study investigated the ability of zzso and zzso to both reverse zzso and inhibit contraction of zzso rings isolated from chronically hypoxic zzso
