This letter presents a study of the correlation between the zzso zzso of synaptic zzso and the zzso properties of zzso neural networks with zzso zzso For this type of neural network, it was found that there are essentially two different zzso zzso the chaos phase, with almost all zzso zzso to a single chaotic zzso and the memory phase, with almost all zzso being attracted toward zzso zzso acting as zzso We found that if a neural network is designed in the chaos phase, the zzso spectrum of its synaptic zzso behaves like that of a random zzso zzso all zzso lie zzso distributed within a circle in the complex zzso and if it is designed in the memory phase, the zzso spectrum will split into two zzso one part zzso to a random background, the other part equal in number to the memory zzso The mechanism for these phenomena is discussed in this zzso
