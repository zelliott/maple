The zzso model can be fitted to survival data using a stable linear zzso When tested on 800 sets of zzso generated data, this method proved more stable and efficient than the zzso method of maximum likelihood, which requires initial estimates of model parameters and failed to fit a substantial fraction of data zzso Though maximum likelihood yielded more consistent estimates of proportion zzso mean, and standard zzso of zzso time), the linear normal zzso may nevertheless prove useful for these purposes: zzso computing initial estimates of model parameters for the maximum likelihood zzso zzso fitting data sets that cannot be fit by this zzso and zzso zzso the zzso model directly from cumulative zzso
