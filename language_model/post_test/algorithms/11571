Recent advances in a new method for the de zzso design of zzso zzso are zzso A new set of rules to define the possible zzso contacts between protein and zzso is zzso This method was derived from published statistical analyses of zzso contacts in crystal zzso of organic molecules and has been implemented in the recently described computer program zzso Moreover, zzso can now append a new zzso onto an already existing zzso zzso are reported for the design of zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results demonstrate that zzso is indeed capable of designing new zzso with improved binding when compared to the reference zzso
