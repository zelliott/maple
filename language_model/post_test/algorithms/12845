We present a general framework for the reconstruction of natural video scenes zzso with a population of zzso neural circuits with random zzso The natural scenes are modeled as zzso functions that belong to a space of zzso zzso The visual zzso system consists of a bank of zzso modeling the visual receptive fields, in cascade with a population of neural zzso modeling zzso in the early visual zzso The zzso models considered include zzso zzso and zzso zzso pairs with zzso zzso zzso All thresholds are assumed to be zzso We demonstrate that neural zzso is akin to taking noisy zzso on the stimulus both for zzso and zzso zzso We formulate the reconstruction problem as the zzso of a suitable cost functional in a zzso zzso space and provide an explicit zzso for stimulus zzso We also present a general solution using the theory of smoothing zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso We provide examples of both synthetic video as well as for natural scenes and demonstrate that the quality of the reconstruction degrades gracefully as the threshold zzso of the zzso zzso
