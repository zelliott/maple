We develop a novel statistical approach for zzso zzso and specialists in two distinct zzso Using a zzso model based on estimated species relative abundance in two zzso our method zzso bias due to differences in sampling zzso between two habitat types as well as bias due to insufficient sampling within each zzso The method permits a robust statistical zzso of habitat specialists and zzso without excluding rare species a zzso Based on a zzso specialization zzso the model zzso species into one of four groups: zzso zzso zzso habitat A zzso zzso habitat B zzso and zzso too rare to zzso with zzso We illustrate our zzso zzso method using two contrasting data zzso zzso bird abundance in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso Australia and zzso tree abundance in zzso zzso and zzso zzso rain forests in the Caribbean zzso of northeastern Costa zzso We evaluate the zzso model in detail for the tree data zzso Our results for birds were highly zzso with a previous zzso zzso but our method classified a higher fraction zzso of bird species with statistical zzso Based on a conservative specialization threshold and adjustment for multiple zzso zzso of tree species in the full sample were too rare to zzso with zzso Among the species zzso zzso specialists constituted the largest class zzso followed by zzso tree species zzso and zzso specialists zzso The zzso model was more sensitive than indicator value analysis or zzso zzso zzso zzso in detecting habitat specialists and also detects zzso zzso zzso of specialists and zzso based on rarefied zzso was highly consistent with zzso based on the full sample, even for sampling percentages as low as zzso Major advantages of the new method are zzso its ability to distinguish habitat zzso zzso with no significant habitat zzso from species that are simply too rare to zzso and zzso zzso to a single representative sample or a single pooled set of representative samples from each of two habitat zzso The method as currently developed can be applied to no more than two zzso at a zzso
