The zzso response of zzso zzso zzso in zzso was studied using laser zzso of 65 zzso at zzso zzso The experiments were performed using the zzso managed zzso technique that allows zzso of the electronic contribution for the zzso response, free from zzso zzso The results were analyzed using an zzso approach based on the zzso approximation that allowed extraction of the zzso zzso of a zzso from the zzso High zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately four orders of magnitude larger than for gold zzso in the visible, and large zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The present results offers new perspectives for zzso zzso in the zzso
