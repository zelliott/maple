To evaluate the zzso zzso zzso III zzso zzso glaucoma probability score in zzso normal from zzso eyes and to compare the glaucoma probability score with zzso zzso analysis zzso 

Prospective zzso zzso 

zzso normal, 40 zzso and 83 zzso eyes were examined with Swedish interactive threshold zzso standard zzso visual fields and zzso zzso zzso and specificity were evaluated using global and zzso glaucoma probability score and zzso compared with damage in visual zzso Areas under receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso were zzso zzso between zzso and glaucoma probability score was calculated using the zzso zzso zzso probability score was considered to be displaced when a symbol was outside and the opposite symbol was inside the zzso zzso 

zzso sensitivity and specificity were zzso and zzso (most specific zzso and zzso and zzso (least specific zzso zzso zzso probability score sensitivity and specificity were zzso and zzso (most specific zzso and zzso and zzso (least specific zzso zzso Visual field parameters were related to the global zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso glaucoma probability zzso A displaced glaucoma probability score was found in 35 eyes, but with unchanged glaucoma probability score sensitivity and zzso Areas under the zzso zzso of glaucoma probability score was zzso The zzso zzso was zzso 

zzso probability score analysis tends to be more sensitive but less specific than zzso zzso probability score did not differentiate normal and zzso zzso When zzso glaucoma probability score sensitivity and specificity were zzso zzso and glaucoma probability score agreement was zzso zzso probability score is advantageous over zzso in zzso zzso
