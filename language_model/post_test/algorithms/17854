In this paper a Clifford zzso method is applied to calculate zzso chain zzso The approach enables the calculation of the position of an atom in space with the knowledge of the bond length zzso zzso angle zzso and rotation angle zzso of each of the preceding bonds in the zzso zzso the set of geometrical parameters zzso yields all the position coordinates zzso of the main chain zzso Moreover, the method allows the calculation of side chain zzso and the zzso of zzso of chain zzso With these features it is, in principle, possible to generate zzso of any type of chemical zzso This method is proposed as an alternative for the classical approach by zzso zzso It is more straightforward and its final symbolic representation considerably simpler than that of zzso zzso zzso for realistic modeling by means of incorporation of energetic considerations can be combined with zzso This article, however, is entirely focused at showing the suitable mathematical framework on which further developments and applications can be zzso
