In the case of zzso zzso including prostate zzso and seminal zzso zzso zzso radiation therapy zzso should improve the therapeutic ratio of the treatment of prostate zzso 

Comparing zzso by simple zzso zzso with conventional zzso zzso therapy zzso zzso in the treatment of zzso zzso including zzso 

For five patients having a zzso zzso zzso previously treated at our Institute with zzso zzso conventional 3- and zzso zzso plans were compared with zzso plans in terms of biological zzso zzso plans were generated by using five zzso beams with a partial shielding of the zzso zzso with our zzso zzso technique zzso C, zzso A, zzso M, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Dynamic beam zzso by using a single dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was one-dimensional and the shape of the beams was at single minimum in correspondence with the zzso of the zzso the beam intensity in the minimum was set equal to 20 or zzso of the open beam zzso All plans were simulated on the zzso zzso using a zzso based zzso (with 18 zzso zzso zzso control probability zzso and normal tissue complication probabilities zzso (for zzso zzso and zzso zzso were calculated for all situations when varying the zzso dose from 60 to 90 zzso zzso zzso were corrected taking dose zzso into account through the zzso zzso for the zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso models were respectively zzso Three different scores were zzso zzso increase of zzso while keeping zzso zzso equal to zzso zzso zzso increase of the uncomplicated zzso control probability zzso zzso increase of the zzso scoring function zzso developed by Mohan et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Baldwin B, zzso relevant zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The impact of the uncertainty in the knowledge of the parameters of the biological models was investigated for zzso 

zzso The average gain in zzso when considering zzso against zzso zzso plans was zzso zzso zzso zzso the average increase of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the average increase of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso The largest gain was found for one patient zzso 5) showing a significantly larger overlapping between zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso may clearly improve the therapeutic ratio in the treatment of zzso zzso including P and zzso In the range of clinically suitable values, the impact of the uncertainty of the parameters zzso and zzso does not significantly alter the main results concerning the gain in zzso The reported gain in terms of zzso and zzso should be considered with great caution because of the intrinsic uncertainties of the zzso parameters and, for zzso because the zzso zzso zzso variations of the shape and dimension due to variable zzso may be very different from the zzso calculated on a single CT zzso Further investigations should consider zzso zzso and zzso plan in order to compare them in terms of zzso
