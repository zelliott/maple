In technical chemistry, systems biology and zzso the construction of zzso models has become an essential step in process design and product zzso zzso zzso of the reactions requires detailed knowledge about the processes zzso However, when concerned with the development of new products and production techniques for example, this knowledge often is not available due to the lack of experimental zzso Thus, when one has to work with a selection of proposed models, the main tasks of early development is to discriminate these zzso In this article, a new statistical approach to model discrimination is described that ranks models zzso the probability with which they reproduce the given zzso The article introduces the new approach, discusses its statistical background, presents zzso techniques for its zzso and illustrates the application to examples from zzso
