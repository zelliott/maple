To determine whether serum zzso zzso zzso levels or zzso of zzso zzso Algorithm zzso scores are useful second-stage tests for tumors thought to be difficult to characterize as benign or zzso on the basis of ultrasound findings by experienced zzso and to investigate whether adding information on serum zzso levels or zzso scores to ultrasound findings improves diagnostic zzso 

This was a prospective zzso diagnostic accuracy study conducted in a zzso referral center that enrolled consecutive women with a known zzso mass scheduled for zzso zzso level III examiners classified each mass as certainly or probably benign, difficult to zzso or probably or certainly zzso after zzso ultrasound zzso zzso zzso and CA 125 levels were measured before zzso 

The final database comprised 360 women, of whom 216 zzso had benign and 144 zzso had zzso zzso zzso were highly confident in 196 cases zzso moderately confident in 135 zzso and completely uncertain about their diagnosis in 29 zzso zzso With a sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso zzso assessment outperformed zzso and zzso in the zzso of difficult zzso Both tests had low zzso capacity with poor areas under the zzso characteristics curve of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A strategy that incorporates sequential testing of serum zzso or zzso scores after zzso zzso resulted in a deterioration in overall test zzso 

zzso of serum zzso or calculating scores using the zzso as secondary tests does not seem useful for zzso zzso tumors after zzso assessment with zzso zzso
