zzso zzso zzso was zzso using a selective zzso the zzso between zzso zzso and zzso To zzso the reaction conversion and purity of zzso dual response surface was applied to determine the effects of zzso and their zzso interactions on product zzso A total of 32 individual experiments were performed to study reaction temperature, reaction time, zzso zzso ratio, zzso zzso and water zzso The highest reaction conversion and selectivity towards zzso were zzso and zzso respectively, at 55 degrees C, reaction time zzso day, zzso loading zzso zzso water activity zzso and a zzso zzso ratio of zzso Moreover, predicted values showed good validation with the experimental values when experiments corresponding to selected points on the zzso plots were carried zzso
