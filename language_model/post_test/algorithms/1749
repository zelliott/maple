zzso tracking has become a standard tool for the investigation of zzso properties, especially in small systems such as biological zzso Usually the resulting time series are analyzed in terms of time averages over individual zzso Here we study confined normal as well as anomalous zzso modeled by fractional zzso motion and the fractional zzso zzso and show that even for such zzso systems zzso quantities behave differently from their zzso counterparts, irrespective of how long the measurement time zzso zzso of the exact behavior of time averages is therefore fundamental for the proper physical interpretation of measured time series, in particular, for extraction of the relaxation time scale from zzso
