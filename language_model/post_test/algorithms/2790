Complex regulatory dynamics is ubiquitous in molecular networks composed of genes and zzso Recent progress in zzso biology and its application to molecular data generate a growing number of complex zzso Yet, it has been difficult to understand the governing principles of these networks beyond zzso analysis or extensive zzso zzso Here the authors exploit several simplifying biological circumstances which thereby enable to directly detect the underlying zzso zzso driving periodic zzso in a zzso zzso zzso model of a zzso zzso System analysis is performed using the cell cycle, a zzso zzso complex regulatory circuit driven by external zzso By introducing an explicit time delay and using a zzso approach the authors reduce the system to a zzso linear system with two variables that capture the dynamics of this complex zzso A key step in the analysis is the identification of functional zzso by identifying the relations between zzso within the zzso These functional zzso are referred to as zzso zzso operating as sensitive switches in the original complex zzso By using reduced mathematical representations of the zzso the authors derive explicit conditions on how the cell cycle dynamics depends on system zzso and can, for the first time, zzso and prove global conditions for system zzso The approach which includes zzso biological simplifying conditions, identification of zzso zzso and mathematical reduction of the model complexity may be zzso to other zzso biological regulatory zzso zzso supplementary zzso
