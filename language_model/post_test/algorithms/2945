We show that the spatial synchronization of zzso zzso on zzso networks, zzso through zzso chemical zzso depends vitally on the intensity of additive noise and the zzso zzso In particular, a twofold zzso is needed for achieving zzso spatial zzso thus indicating the existence of an optimal noise intensity as well as an optimal zzso zzso On the other hand, the traditional linear zzso via gap zzso while still requiring a zzso of the noise intensity, does not zzso the existence of an optimal zzso strength since the synchronization increases zzso with the increasing zzso zzso Presented results reveal inherent differences in optimal spatial synchronization evoked by chemical and electrical zzso and could hence help to pinpoint their specific roles in networked zzso
