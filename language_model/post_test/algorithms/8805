zzso rapid sweep zzso zzso zzso has been introduced for application to zzso biological samples zzso et zzso zzso zzso are pure zzso and are built up by acquiring data in spectral segments that are zzso In this paper we extend the method to frozen solutions of zzso a square zzso copper complex with four zzso nitrogen zzso zzso zzso zzso are created from zzso of 170 zzso segments spanning zzso G at zzso zzso These zzso however, are not directly useful since nitrogen zzso zzso are barely zzso Application of the moving difference zzso zzso to the digitized zzso pure zzso spectrum is used to produce zzso that are analogous to the first harmonic zzso The signal intensity is about four times higher than when using conventional 100 zzso field zzso depending on line zzso zzso not only filters the spectrum, but also the noise, resulting in further improvement of the zzso for the same signal acquisition zzso The zzso zzso can be zzso zzso different spectral regions can be examined at different zzso and an zzso can be used that is substantially greater than the upper limit of the field zzso zzso of a conventional zzso zzso which improves the zzso ratio of broad zzso
