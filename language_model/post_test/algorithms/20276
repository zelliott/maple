The availability of large data sets together with the growth in power and storage capabilities of computers have made the analysis of the spatial distribution of disease rates an increasingly important tool in public health zzso Use of existing geographic divisions or groupings tends to result either in unstable estimates of disease rates if the corresponding populations are small or in loss of spatial resolution if the areas are unnecessarily zzso This paper describes a computer zzso for combining existing geographic areas into regions with populations large enough to diminish zzso zzso in disease rates while limiting the loss in zzso The method is demonstrated using Medicare hospital admissions data for pneumonia and central nervous system zzso Disease rates were calculated for both zzso regions and those generated by the zzso and their frequency zzso were zzso The zzso produces more stable rates over a variety of diseases and provides substantially more flexibility than the use of zzso zzso
