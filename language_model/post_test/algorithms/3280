The behavior of spiral waves is investigated in a model of zzso media supporting local zzso zzso for a range of values of a control zzso This local behavior is accompanied by the formation of zzso at which the arms of the simple spiral waves begin to zzso With further zzso changes, this zzso structure loses stability, becoming quite zzso eventually evolving into zzso while the local dynamics increases in zzso The breakup of the spiral waves arises from a zzso instability of the zzso induced by the arm zzso This process of spiral breakup in the presence of zzso zzso represents an alternative to previously described scenarios of instability of line defects and zzso in media with zzso and zzso zzso zzso
