In zzso listeners acoustic masking occurs depending on frequency, zzso and energy of specific zzso If the selection of zzso channels in cochlear implant systems was based on zzso masking models, the bandwidth of the zzso interface could be used more effectively by concentrating on relevant signal components and zzso those that are usually not perceived by normal hearing zzso zzso a new strategy called zzso zzso Advanced Combination zzso has been developed which uses a zzso model for the channel selection instead of the simple zzso selection zzso of the zzso zzso 

Only subjects having at least 2 years experience with the zzso strategy were zzso A zzso zzso design was used to compare the new speech coding strategy with the zzso zzso 

The investigation was a zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The study group consisted of 10 zzso zzso adult zzso 

The following programs were zzso zzso zzso with 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso with 8 channels zzso and zzso zzso with 4 channels zzso 

Speech perception tests in quiet and noise, Quality Assessment zzso 

zzso indicate a trend towards better performance with zzso Scores in the zzso monosyllabic word test increased by zzso while the zzso in the zzso sentence test improved significantly by zzso zzso 

The use of zzso masking models in speech coding strategies has the potential to improve speech perception performance in cochlear implant zzso
