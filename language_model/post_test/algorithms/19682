zzso is one of the most popular zzso for independent component analysis zzso zzso a set of statistically independent sources that have been mixed zzso A key question is how accurate the method is for finite data zzso We propose an improved version of the zzso zzso which is zzso efficient, zzso its accuracy given by the residual error zzso attains the zzso lower bound zzso The error is thus as small as zzso This result is rigorously proven under the assumption that the probability distribution of the independent signal components belongs to the class of generalized zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso for alpha zzso zzso We name the zzso efficient zzso zzso zzso complexity of a zzso zzso of the zzso is shown to be only slightly (about three zzso higher than that of the standard zzso zzso zzso corroborate these claims and show superior performance of the zzso compared with zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso of zzso et zzso on separating sources with distribution zzso zzso with arbitrary zzso as well as on sources with zzso distribution, and a good performance in separating zzso mixed speech zzso
