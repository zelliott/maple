zzso object reconstruction from a single zzso line drawing is an important problem in computer zzso Many methods have been presented to solve this problem, but they usually fail when the geometric structure of a zzso object becomes zzso In this paper, a novel approach based on a zzso strategy is proposed to handle the zzso reconstruction of a zzso complex zzso object from its zzso line drawing with hidden lines zzso The approach consists of four steps: 1) identifying the internal faces of the line drawing, 2) zzso the line drawing into multiple simpler ones based on the internal faces, 3) reconstructing the zzso shapes from these simpler line drawings, and 4) merging the zzso shapes into one complete object represented by the original line zzso A number of examples are provided to show that our approach can handle zzso reconstruction of more complex objects than previous zzso
