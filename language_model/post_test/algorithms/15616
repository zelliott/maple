We show that large ensembles of zzso zzso models, obtained zzso in zzso or sampling from zzso probability zzso can be effectively summarized by a relatively small number of representative zzso In some cases this summary may even yield better function zzso We present a method to find representative models through zzso based on the zzso zzso on a data zzso We apply the method on an ensemble of neural network models obtained from zzso on the Boston housing data, and use the results to discuss zzso in terms of bias and zzso A parallel application is the prediction of newspaper sales, where we learn a series of parallel zzso The results indicate that it is not necessary to store all samples in the zzso a small number of representative models generally matches, or even zzso the performance of the full zzso The clustered representation of the ensemble obtained thus is much better suitable for qualitative analysis, and will be shown to yield new insights into the zzso
