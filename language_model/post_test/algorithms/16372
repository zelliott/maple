zzso gas zzso zzso is an important technique for the characterization of surface properties of solid zzso A standard method of surface characterization is that the surface zzso free energy of the solid stationary phase is zzso determined by using a series of linear zzso liquids as molecular zzso and then the zzso parameters are calculated from the zzso zzso However, for the calculation of surface zzso free energy, generally, two different methods are used, which are zzso method and Schultz zzso In this paper, the results calculated from zzso method and Schultz method are compared through calculating their ratio with their basic equations and zzso It can be concluded that the zzso parameters calculated with zzso method will always be larger than the data calculated with Schultz zzso When the measuring temperature increases, the ratio increases zzso Compared with the parameters in zzso zzso it seems that the traditional surface free energy parameters of zzso listed in the papers using Schultz method are not enough accurate, which can be proved with a published zzso experimental zzso
