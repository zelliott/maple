DNA zzso are devices that are able, in principle, to detect and zzso the presence of specific zzso acid sequences in complex biological zzso The measurement consists in detecting zzso signals from several spots on the zzso surface onto which different probe sequences are zzso One of the problems of the data analysis is that the signal contains a noisy background component due to zzso zzso We present a physical model for background zzso in zzso zzso It combines two different zzso The first is based on the sequence zzso specifically its zzso zzso zzso The second is based on the strong correlation of zzso from locations which are the physical neighbors of a specific spot on the zzso Both effects are incorporated in a background zzso which contains 24 free zzso fixed by zzso on a training data zzso In all data analyzed the zzso zzso obtained by zzso are found to strongly correlate with zzso determined stacking free energies for zzso zzso in zzso Moreover, there is an overall agreement with experimental background data and we show that the zzso model that we propose performs on average better than purely statistical approaches for background zzso The model thus provides an interesting alternative method for background zzso schemes in zzso zzso
