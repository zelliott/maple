In this chapter, we demonstrate the usage of a zzso elastic network model to analyze protein zzso transitions in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso C virus zzso This analysis allows us to identify and zzso collective domain motions involved in the zzso transitions and predict the order of structural events during the zzso It is highly efficient and zzso to many zzso protein structures which undergo large zzso changes to fulfill their zzso This method is made available through a Web server ( zzso zzso
