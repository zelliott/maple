zzso plays a major role in the stabilization and function of zzso as such, it remains a major focus of theoretical and zzso studies of zzso zzso interactions are long range, and strongly dependent on the zzso and zzso surrounding the zzso under zzso During the past year, progress has been reported in the treatment of zzso in explicit and implicit zzso zzso zzso new developments of explicit zzso models include more efficient Ewald zzso methods, as well as alternative approaches based on reaction field theory, periodic images and zzso zzso zzso zzso models remain divided into those that solve the zzso equation zzso and those based on the generalized Born zzso Both approaches are now included in molecular dynamics simulations and their zzso may be assessed by direct comparison against experimental zzso It is worth mentioning the recent development of web zzso that facilitate access to and usage of existing tools for computing zzso zzso
