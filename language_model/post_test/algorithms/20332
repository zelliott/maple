zzso treatment of rats with zzso leads to zzso loss and a reduced zzso response to zzso suggesting that zzso reduces zzso zzso transport in the zzso zzso This was investigated in the present study by measuring the zzso response to zzso infusion followed by zzso in chronically zzso conscious rats given zzso for 3 to 4 weeks to achieve plasma zzso zzso of approximately zzso zzso A zzso infusion system was used to maintain sodium and water zzso thereby preventing zzso of the findings as a consequence of drug-induced changes in zzso zzso In a control group of rats, zzso zzso decreased in response to zzso zzso zzso and subsequent zzso administration led to a marked increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, in the zzso group, there was no significant response to either zzso or zzso It is concluded that long-term treatment with lithium, even when plasma zzso zzso are below 1 zzso reduces zzso zzso transport through the zzso zzso channels in the principal cells of the zzso zzso
