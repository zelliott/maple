We propose an zzso framework to estimate the quality of video tracking zzso without zzso zzso The framework is divided into two main zzso zzso the zzso of the tracker condition to identify zzso segments during which a target is lost and the measurement of the quality of the estimated track when the tracker is zzso A key novelty of the proposed framework is the capability of evaluating video zzso with multiple failures and zzso over long zzso zzso tracking is identified by analyzing the uncertainty of the tracker, whereas track recovery from errors is determined based on the zzso zzso The proposed approach is demonstrated on a particle filter tracker over a zzso data zzso Experimental results show the effectiveness and zzso of the proposed framework that improves state-of-the-art approaches in the presence of tracking challenges such as zzso zzso changes, and clutter and on sequences containing multiple tracking errors and zzso
