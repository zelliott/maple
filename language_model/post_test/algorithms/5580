In many zzso reactions occurring in living cells, number of various molecules might be low which results in significant zzso zzso In addition, most reactions are not zzso there exist natural time delays in the evolution of cell zzso It is a challenge to develop a systematic and rigorous treatment of zzso dynamics with time delays and to investigate combined effects of zzso and delays in concrete zzso propose a new methodology to deal with time delays in biological systems and apply it to simple models of gene expression with delayed zzso We show that time delay of protein degradation does not cause zzso as it was recently zzso It follows from our rigorous analysis that one should look for different mechanisms responsible for zzso observed in biological zzso develop a systematic zzso treatment of zzso models of time zzso zzso we take into account that some zzso for example degradation, are zzso that is: once molecules start to degrade they cannot be part in other degradation zzso introduce an auxiliary zzso process and calculate zzso the zzso and the zzso function of the number of protein molecules in stationary states in basic models of delayed protein zzso
