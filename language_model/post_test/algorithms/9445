The zzso are zzso in the same fashion by zzso and zzso forces, so zzso signals are ambiguous indicators of zzso The ambiguity can be resolved with added visual information indicating orientation and acceleration with respect to the zzso Here we present a zzso model of the statistically optimal combination of noisy zzso and visual zzso zzso associated with sensory zzso are represented in an zzso zzso The likelihood function associated with the zzso signal illustrates the zzso there is no unique solution for zzso or zzso zzso functions associated with other sensory signals can resolve this zzso In addition, we propose two zzso each acting on a dimension in the zzso zzso the zzso prior and the zzso zzso We conducted experiments using a motion platform and attached visual display to examine the influence of visual signals on the interpretation of the zzso zzso zzso made pitch and acceleration judgments as the zzso and visual signals were manipulated zzso zzso of the model were zzso zzso visual signals affected the interpretation of the zzso zzso zzso less variable signals had more influence on perceived orientation and acceleration than more variable ones, and zzso combined estimates were more precise than zzso zzso We also show that the model can explain some well-known phenomena including the perception of upright in zero gravity, the zzso effect, and the zzso zzso
