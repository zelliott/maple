Analysis of the zzso variation in zzso zzso is useful for studying zzso zzso However, many statistical methods routinely used to test zzso changes in zzso zzso fail to establish a proper hypothesis or have theoretical or practical zzso Here, a zzso statistical test is proposed in which the distribution of the distances among sampling zzso is approached with computer simulations, and zzso sampling is considered instead of zzso zzso To validate the test and compare its performance with other tests, zzso model simulations were run for a variety of scenarios, and two real molecular databases were zzso The results showed that the simulation test zzso maintained the significance value used zzso for a vast combination of zzso values, whereas other tests were sensitive to the effect of genetic drift or zzso zzso The differences between zzso and zzso sampling were more complex than expected, and a novel effect was zzso This study suggests that the ST is especially useful for studies with small populations and many zzso as in zzso or sequencing molecular zzso
