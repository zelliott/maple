To assess zzso zzso an zzso using zzso weight zzso as a tool for the prediction of zzso of zzso zzso in a large geographically and racially diverse study zzso 

zzso analysis was performed zzso on conventionally zzso infants from 10 zzso intensive zzso zzso were entered into zzso which signals an alarm for an abnormal weight gain zzso zzso were classified into categories of no alarm zzso to develop type zzso alarm (at risk for developing type zzso of zzso requires that an infant has zzso zzso age less than 32 weeks at birth, zzso weekly weight zzso zzso weight zzso of other zzso retinal vascular zzso 

A total of zzso infants with a median zzso age of 28 weeks zzso zzso weeks) and median birth weight of zzso g zzso zzso zzso were included in the study zzso An alarm occurred in zzso infants zzso with a median time from birth to alarm of 3 weeks zzso zzso weeks) and from alarm to treatment of 8 weeks zzso 1 day to 22 zzso The sensitivity of zzso was zzso and the negative zzso value was zzso Two infants with type 1 zzso requiring treatment after 40 zzso zzso age did not receive an zzso 

The zzso system is a useful adjunct for zzso screening that identifies high-risk infants early to zzso care and potentially reduce the overall number of diagnostic zzso zzso
