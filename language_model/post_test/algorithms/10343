In this article, a new spatial filtering approach, called zzso common spatial patterns zzso is proposed for zzso zzso zzso Unlike the conventional common spatial patterns zzso that is substantially a zzso decomposition technique, zzso is intently designed for zzso zzso The basic idea of zzso is to construct a zzso criterion that extracts both zzso and zzso zzso zzso The classical zzso only considers separating class means, zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso In contrast, zzso aims to maximize zzso scatter and meanwhile minimize zzso zzso zzso zzso is formulated as a generalized zzso zzso zzso on real zzso zzso show the effectiveness of the proposed zzso
