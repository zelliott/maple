zzso zzso relevant zzso models of zzso is critical for understanding zzso activity and zzso We recently suggested that zzso from multiple locations along the zzso zzso and zzso are necessary as a data set when using a genetic zzso zzso to zzso the parameters of a zzso model of an entire zzso However, recordings from zzso zzso zzso can routinely be performed simultaneously from only two zzso Now we show that a data set recorded from the zzso and zzso zzso combined with a zzso peeling procedure is sufficient to zzso a zzso model for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The peeling procedure was tested on several zzso models showing that it avoids local zzso in zzso zzso Based on the requirements of this analysis zzso we designed and performed simultaneous zzso recordings from the zzso and zzso zzso of rat zzso zzso zzso The data set obtained from these recordings allowed constraining a simplified zzso model for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso containing four zzso zzso In agreement with experimental findings, the zzso model predicts that the zzso density zzso of zzso zzso zzso taper rapidly zzso to the zzso while the density zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso slowly along the zzso zzso The model reproduced the zzso of the action potential and the zzso of the resting membrane potential along the zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso model provided a zzso explanation for the zzso of the action potential into the zzso zzso and the generation of zzso zzso zzso
