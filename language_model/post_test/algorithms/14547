zzso zzso have been zzso linked to cancer development and zzso and are potentially zzso by drug zzso The zzso tails of zzso contain zzso acid zzso zzso by zzso modifications such as zzso Given that zzso zzso induce cancer cell differentiation and death, an increasing number of these compounds has been zzso in the last ten zzso Many zzso zzso are in clinical trials for the treatment of zzso Two of them, the zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso are approved in the second line treatment of zzso persistent or relapsed zzso T Cell zzso zzso The growing evidence of the potential benefits of an zzso treatment based on the use of zzso zzso have led to a large number of patent applications all over the zzso The aim of this review is to give an overview of the basic current knowledge and molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso and their clinical trials as well as to focus on the recent patent applications existing in the field of zzso zzso and cancer treatment between 2008 and 2010 in zzso
