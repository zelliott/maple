In order to study the involvement of zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso we investigated the effect of novel zzso inhibitor zzso zzso on human zzso and bovine zzso In human primary zzso the production of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso was induced by zzso zzso with zzso inhibited the release of zzso zzso and zzso with zzso values of 20, 230 and zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity was also confirmed by a decrease in zzso release from human zzso cell line zzso with an zzso value of 17 zzso zzso protection zzso on human primary zzso indicated that zzso and zzso zzso levels almost reached the maximum 14 h after zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso quickly reached the maximum 4 h after the zzso zzso zzso the zzso levels of zzso and zzso zzso with zzso values of zzso and 79 zzso zzso The zzso zzso level was also suppressed with an zzso value of 21 zzso In the zzso culture of bovine zzso cartilage, zzso suppressed the collagen zzso induced by zzso and zzso M, but not zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that activated zzso zzso cartilage breakdown by enhancing the expression of zzso responsible for collagen zzso which thus implies zzso effects of zzso zzso in zzso
