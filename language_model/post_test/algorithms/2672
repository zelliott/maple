Fast mode decision zzso have been widely used in the video zzso zzso to reduce zzso complexity yet without much sacrifice in the coding zzso zzso stopping theory, which addresses early termination for a generic class of decision problems, is adopted in this paper to achieve fast mode decision for the zzso Video zzso zzso A constrained model is developed with optimal zzso and the solutions to this model are employed to zzso the candidate mode list and predict the early zzso Comprehensive simulation results are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed method strikes a good balance between low zzso complexity and high coding zzso
