We present a method based on zzso resolved zzso measurement for the simultaneous zzso of optical transport zzso zzso the reduced scattering zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the intrinsic zzso zzso from zzso zzso The accuracy of this approach was tested by conducting studies on a series of zzso zzso with known optical transport zzso The estimated relative error in the values for zzso zzso and zzso a using this technique was found to be zzso or zzso Furthermore, the line shape and intensity of the intrinsic zzso recovered by using this approach were observed to be free from the zzso effects of the zzso zzso and scattering properties of the zzso and they were in excellent agreement with the directly measured intrinsic zzso zzso of the zzso
