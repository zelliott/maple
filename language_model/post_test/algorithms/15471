The goal of this study is to identify zzso changes in zzso zzso zzso A novel approach based on the recently developed diffusion map zzso which is considered to be one of the leading zzso learning methods, is zzso zzso mapping provides zzso reduction of the data as well as pattern recognition that can be used to distinguish different states of the patient, for example, zzso and zzso A new algorithm, which is an extension of diffusion zzso is developed to construct coordinates that generate efficient geometric representations of the complex structures in the zzso zzso In addition, this method is adapted to the zzso data and enables the extraction of the underlying brain zzso The zzso is tested on zzso data recorded from several zzso contacts from a patient being evaluated for possible zzso surgery at the zzso Haven zzso zzso results show that the proposed approach provides a distinction between zzso and zzso zzso
