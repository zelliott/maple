Shannon zzso from information theory has been applied to estimate the degree of zzso from equal usage of synonymous zzso however, previous attempts have failed to take into account all three aspects of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso the number of distinct zzso zzso zzso their relative zzso and zzso their degree of zzso zzso A new index taking into account all of these aspects is zzso The index, designated as the zzso sum of relative zzso zzso is defined as the sum of the relative zzso of each zzso acid weighted by its relative frequency in the zzso In this paper, we demonstrate that zzso allows us to avoid some zzso acid usage biases and can yield results contradictory to those obtained by previous zzso
