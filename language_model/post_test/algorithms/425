This paper proposes an zzso approach of modeling clinical zzso zzso at the semantic level for zzso computerized clinical zzso zzso and efficient delivery of high-quality zzso zzso A clinical zzso zzso zzso is formally defined in zzso web zzso language zzso to provide common semantic foundation for meaningful representation and exchange of zzso zzso A zzso semantic modeling method is then presented to describe clinical pathways as interconnected zzso models including the zzso outcome flow and intervention zzso level along a care zzso Furthermore, relevant zzso knowledge can be fully represented by combing zzso entities in zzso and zzso rules based on semantic web rule language zzso An illustrative example about a clinical zzso for zzso section shows the zzso of the proposed methodology in enabling structured semantic descriptions of any real clinical zzso
