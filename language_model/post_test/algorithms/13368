zzso groups of individuals forming coherent genetic clusters is relevant to many fields of zzso This paper addresses the zzso problem: given a collection of zzso partition those zzso into K groups, each group being a sample of the K source populations that are represented in the collection of zzso This problem involves allocating zzso to genetic groups while building those groups at the same time without the use of any other a zzso zzso zzso is a zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso zzso that uses an zzso method to partition a collection of zzso into k zzso Rules to estimate K are formulated and their zzso firmly established by running simulations under several migration rates, migration zzso number of zzso and values of zzso zzso tended to build clusters largely consistent with the source zzso The performance of zzso was also compared with that of zzso and zzso zzso provided more accurate allocations to clusters and more reliable estimates of zzso it also ran much faster than zzso zzso is based on an entirely novel approach and provides a true alternative to the existing, zzso based, zzso zzso zzso for zzso or for zzso markers can be downloaded from zzso
