The present study was initiated to generate a model of predicting zzso zzso of substances from their molecular zzso For 211 drugs or zzso compounds, their zzso zzso were calculated by zzso zzso The optimal subset of the zzso for the prediction of zzso zzso was determined by genetic zzso in combination with partial least squares zzso zzso Thirty-four zzso were selected by this zzso Using 29 of the zzso selected, of which the scaled zzso zzso was zzso the zzso zzso zzso was zzso with 19 principal components that was the optimal and the standard error of prediction was zzso Thus, it is suggested that the model obtained would exhibit a good performance in predicting the zzso zzso of zzso
