zzso function was investigated in zzso dietary zzso domestic zzso zzso zzso zzso White zzso zzso (2 weeks old) were fed zzso zzso diets containing either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso soy protein for 4 weeks ad zzso zzso were quickly killed by zzso and zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso and zzso levels were measured by zzso zzso zzso capacity zzso of plasma was also zzso In addition, in randomly selected zzso a rough index of the B clearance rate was zzso Finally, to determine the influence of protein zzso on zzso cell function per se, we measured the acute zzso B responses of highly enriched zzso cell populations to various zzso zzso zzso zzso and cellular B production zzso supported with zzso Plasma B and zzso zzso of L zzso were, respectively, zzso greater and zzso less than those of N zzso In addition, plasma B clearance rate of L birds was zzso greater than that of N birds, thus suggesting a greater B zzso rate in L zzso However, zzso plasma zzso of L zzso was 59% less than that of N zzso Thus, the free plasma B concentration of L birds was greater than that of N zzso The increase in the plasma B concentration of L zzso is explained in part by the relative adrenal weight of these birds which was zzso greater than that of N zzso In addition, there were differences at the zzso cell zzso On an equal cell concentration basis, zzso and zzso B production values zzso by zzso zzso and zzso and supported by zzso of L zzso zzso cells were, respectively, zzso and zzso greater than those of N zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso production of L bird cells was zzso greater than that of N bird cells, such that the ratio of zzso production to B production was not altered by protein zzso The data suggest that the greater zzso capacity of L zzso cells was due to an increase in zzso zzso zzso content and/or activity and not to an zzso in the composition of zzso cell types within the populations of isolated zzso Furthermore, zzso analog zzso values for B, zzso and zzso production by L bird cells were about one third to one fifth the values for N bird cells, thus indicating that L bird cells were about 3-5 times more sensitive to zzso than were N bird zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
