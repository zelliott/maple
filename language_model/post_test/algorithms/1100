zzso a neural network's complexity improves the ability of the network to zzso future zzso Like an zzso zzso function, neural networks may miss their target because of the excessive degrees of freedom stored up in unnecessary zzso Over the past decade, the subject of pruning networks produced zzso zzso like zzso zzso Brain zzso and zzso Brain zzso as methods to remove connections with the least zzso The method proposed here uses the zzso zzso to estimate the distribution of the model zzso zzso zzso multiple comparison procedures are then used to make pruning zzso We show this method compares well with zzso Brain zzso in terms of ability to prune and the resulting network zzso
