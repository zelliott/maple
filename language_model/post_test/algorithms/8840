The aim of this work is to provide insights into multiple metrics clinical validation of zzso image registration and zzso propagation methods in zzso lung zzso zzso The following zzso were analyzed and zzso Volume zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Positive zzso Value zzso and Surface zzso zzso The analysis was performed on three patient zzso using as reference a zzso volume generated by means of zzso Truth And Performance Level zzso zzso zzso from the outlines of five zzso zzso discrepancies in the quality assessment provided by the different metrics in all the examined cases were zzso zzso sensitivity was more evident in presence of image artifacts and particularly for zzso anatomical structures, such as esophagus or spinal zzso Volume zzso did not account for position and zzso exhibited zzso due to its intrinsic symmetry zzso zzso and zzso of the reference contours cannot be zzso and dependency on the total volume of the zzso zzso analysis showed more robust performance, as each zzso concurs to the zzso of the zzso but was not able to detect inclusion of zzso and zzso zzso zzso distances could interpret the actual shape of the structures, but might report higher zzso in case of large local differences in the zzso zzso According to our study, the combination of zzso and zzso for the validation of zzso propagation zzso in zzso could provide the necessary failure detection zzso
