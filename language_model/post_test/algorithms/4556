Gene expression profiles obtained from samples of diabetic and normal rats with and without treatments can be used to identify genes that distinguish normal and diabetic individuals and also to evaluate the effectiveness of drug zzso This study examines changes in global gene expression in rat muscle caused by zzso diabetes and zzso zzso zzso We explored zzso and zzso methods with gene screening measures for zzso gene expression data to zzso and predict individuals with high risk of zzso zzso show that the mixed zzso zzso approach provides an efficient way to conduct an investigation of the inherent zzso in gene expression data and to estimate the effects of experimental factors such as treatments and diseases and their zzso The zzso weighted voting and neural network zzso show good zzso performance for the diabetes and treatment zzso Although neural network performs better than weighted voting with higher zzso rate, the interpretation of weighted voting is more zzso The study indicates that the choice of the gene selection procedure is at least as important as the choice of the zzso zzso We conclude that both mixed zzso and zzso approaches provide the statistical evidence of the biological hypotheses that zzso zzso treatment of diabetic animals restores gene expression patterns to zzso Although zzso and zzso methods provide different strengths and perspective for the analysis of the same set of data, in general both can be considered and developed for analyzing zzso design experiments with multiple groups and zzso This study represents a major step towards the discovery of responsible genes related to diabetes and its zzso
