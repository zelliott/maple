We describe improvements of the currently most popular method for prediction of classically zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of two different zzso based on neural network and hidden zzso model zzso where both components have been zzso zzso by the idea that the zzso site position and the zzso acid composition of the signal zzso are zzso new features have been included as input to the neural zzso This addition, combined with a thorough zzso of a new data set, have improved the performance of the predictor significantly over zzso version zzso In version 3, correctness of the zzso site predictions has increased notably for all three zzso groups, zzso zzso and zzso zzso The accuracy of zzso site prediction has increased in the range zzso over the previous version, whereas the signal zzso discrimination improvement is mainly due to the elimination of zzso predictions, as well as the introduction of a new discrimination score for the neural zzso The new method has been zzso against other available zzso zzso can be made at the publicly available web server
