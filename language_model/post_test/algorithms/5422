zzso similar diseases have been found to be caused by functionally related zzso suggesting a modular organization of the genetic landscape of human diseases that mirrors the zzso observed in biological interaction zzso zzso complexes, as molecular machines that integrate multiple gene products to perform biological functions, express the underlying modular organization of zzso interaction zzso As such, protein complexes can be useful for interrogating the networks of zzso and zzso to zzso zzso associations of zzso 

We proposed a technique called zzso (Random Walker on zzso Complex Network) for predicting and zzso disease zzso The basis of zzso is a protein complex network constructed using existing human protein complexes and protein interaction zzso To prioritize candidate disease genes for the query disease zzso we zzso the associations between the protein complexes and the query zzso in their respective protein complex and zzso zzso We tested zzso on predicting zzso associations using zzso zzso our method was observed to outperform existing zzso We also applied zzso to predict novel disease genes for two representative diseases, zzso Breast Cancer and zzso 

zzso prediction and zzso of disease genes can be enhanced by fully exploiting the underlying modular organizations of both the disease zzso and the protein zzso Our zzso uses a novel protein complex network as a basis for interrogating the human zzso zzso As the protein complex network can capture the underlying zzso in the biological interaction networks better than simple protein interaction networks, zzso was found to be able to detect and prioritize disease genes better than traditional approaches that used only zzso zzso
