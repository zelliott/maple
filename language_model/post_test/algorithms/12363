An important feature of interaction between two signal components is the direction of the zzso Recently, different methods have been developed and applied for detecting the direction of zzso Besides zzso methods, zzso causality is a well-known zzso zzso One popular linear approach is based on zzso modeling of the underlying process and evaluates prediction errors under different past zzso In the present study, this linear concept is extended to zzso threshold zzso models, which cover a wider class of zzso An approach for the definition of a zzso zzso causality is given and applied to simulated zzso
