The problem of computing the minimum zzso path zzso from a set of clones arranged in a physical map is a cornerstone of zzso zzso zzso sequencing zzso We formulate this problem in a graph theoretical zzso and then solve by a combination of minimum hitting set and minimum spanning tree zzso The tool implementing this strategy, called zzso shows improved performance compared to the widely used software zzso When we execute zzso and zzso on the same physical map, the zzso produced by zzso covers a higher portion of the zzso and uses a smaller number of zzso For instance, on the rice zzso the zzso produced by our tool would reduce by about 11 percent the cost of a zzso sequencing zzso zzso code, benchmark data sets, and documentation of zzso are freely available at zzso under zzso zzso
