This paper presents a new reconstruction zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By incorporating the zzso characteristics of the X-ray beam into the reconstruction process, the zzso is capable of eliminating beam zzso zzso The single energy version of the zzso assumes that each zzso in the scan field can be expressed as a mixture of two known zzso for example, a mixture of zzso bone and zzso or a mixture of fat and zzso These assumptions are easily satisfied in a quantitative zzso zzso zzso zzso We have compared our zzso to three commonly used zzso correction zzso Experimental results show that our zzso is much more robust and zzso We have also shown that zzso zzso obtained using our zzso are five times more accurate than that from current zzso systems zzso zzso The zzso mode does not require any prior knowledge of the object in the scan field, and can be used to estimate the zzso zzso function of unknown zzso We have tested the zzso setup to obtain an accurate estimate for the zzso zzso function of zzso zzso zzso
