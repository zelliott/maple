zzso zzso of the transplanted human heart by the zzso nervous system has not been zzso A lack of zzso control of the transplanted zzso is reflected by an increased resting heart rate, a sluggish heart rate response to zzso exercise and a reduced heart rate zzso Recent evidence suggests that a measure of deterministic chaos in the heartbeat zzso series zzso correlation dimension, zzso is superior to the conventional power spectrum or other zzso measures in detecting changes in the mechanism underlying heartbeat zzso 

The zzso is based on the presumption that the zzso is determined and zzso whereas the zzso measures all assume that the zzso is around a stationary mean and is zzso The zzso reconstructs the degrees of freedom zzso of independent zzso in the system that generates the time series zzso and does this irrespective of whether the system is zzso or deterministic and is stationary in zzso 

zzso was determined for heartbeat intervals zzso zzso digitized at 1200 zzso zzso zzso of 23 heart transplant recipients zzso 9 adults, 14 children; zzso years after zzso and 21 healthy control subjects zzso 13 adults, 8 zzso The zzso zzso averaged zzso zzso zzso for the zzso adults and zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso Mean zzso was reduced after transplantation to zzso zzso zzso in 6 zzso recorded within 1 year after zzso in one zzso recorded 2 weeks after surgery the mean zzso was zzso Between 1 to 2 years zzso was found increased in 2 of 3 subjects and between 2 to 8 years it was increased in 13 of 13, but not to control zzso In normal hearts the zzso zzso of each heartbeat cycle is associated with zzso and the zzso remainder with zzso zzso the zzso zzso during which zzso is primarily zzso To examine more closely the residual and returning heartbeat dynamics of the zzso subjects, these zzso series were examined during mild exercise (40 to 90 zzso and its zzso In recent zzso resting zzso and zzso were moderately reduced and modulated by exercise and recovery, but with an approximate 100 beat zzso In long-term zzso zzso zzso subjects there was a rapid and larger response to zzso but compared to normal the range was smaller and the complexity of the zzso zzso in time was zzso 

zzso of zzso deterministic dynamics after transplantation suggests recovery of zzso control attributable to 1) reorganization of the viable intrinsic cardiac nervous system, 2) zzso by the zzso zzso nervous system, or 3) zzso
