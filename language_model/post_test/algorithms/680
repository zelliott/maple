This paper presents new statistical methods in the field of exposure zzso We focus on the zzso of the probability for the exposure to exceed a fixed safe level such as the provisional tolerable weekly intake zzso when both consumption data and contamination data are independently zzso Various calculations of exposure are proposed and zzso For many zzso zzso belongs to the exposure tail distribution, which suggests the use of extreme value theory zzso to evaluate the zzso Our approach consists in zzso the exposure tail by a zzso type distribution characterized by a zzso index which may be seen as a measure of the risk of exceeding the zzso Using zzso by zzso specialists, we correct the bias of the usual Hill zzso to accurately estimate this risk zzso We compare the results with an empirical plug-in method and show that the zzso adjustment is relevant and efficient when exposure is low compared to the zzso while the plug-in method should be used when exposure is zzso To illustrate our approach, we present some exposure assessment for heavy metals zzso cadmium, zzso via sea product zzso
