zzso domain phase zzso for zzso and zzso quantitative phase imaging is zzso The phase retrieval is realized in the depth domain to maintain a high sensitivity, while the phase information obtained in the spectral domain is exploited to extend the dynamic range of optical path zzso zzso advantage of phase retrieved in the depth domain over that in the spectral domain is thoroughly zzso The performance of the proposed depth domain phase based approach is illustrated by phase imaging of a resolution target and an onion zzso
