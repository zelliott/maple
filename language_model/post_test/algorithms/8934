Traditionally, it has been held that a central characteristic of stem cells is their ability to divide zzso Recent advances in zzso genetic labeling provided ample evidence that zzso stem cell divisions play an important role in adult zzso zzso It is well understood that the two types of cell divisions differ in terms of the stem zzso flexibility to expand when zzso On the contrary, the implications of zzso and zzso divisions for zzso zzso are still poorly zzso In this paper we study a zzso model of a renewing zzso and address the zzso problem of tissue architecture in the context of zzso zzso Specifically, we study the process of tumor zzso gene zzso which usually takes place as a consequence of two zzso and which is one of the most common patterns in zzso We compare and contrast zzso and zzso (and zzso stem cell zzso and focus on the rate at which zzso zzso are zzso It turns out that zzso cells generate such zzso at a rate which is significantly lower than that of zzso zzso This result holds whether zzso zzso zzso are zzso neutral, or zzso It is also independent on whether the zzso zzso zzso are produced only among the stem cells or also among more specialized zzso We argue that zzso stem cell divisions in zzso could be an adaptation which helps delay the onset of zzso We further investigate the question of the optimal fraction of stem cells in the zzso and zzso the contribution of zzso cells in zzso zzso Our work provides a hypothesis to explain the observation that in zzso cells, zzso patterns of stem cell division seem to be very zzso
