We observe the appearance of multiple zzso surface zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso when embedded in an organic semiconductor that exhibits a highly zzso zzso Comparing the zzso zzso of zzso with and without zzso zzso reveals the presence of two zzso zzso zzso simulations and calculations based on an zzso model allow us to attribute both zzso to zzso zzso and show that the strong zzso of the organic zzso is responsible for this zzso The presence of these two zzso zzso was found to enhance the zzso of the organic semiconductor over a broad wavelength zzso
