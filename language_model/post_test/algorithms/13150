The zzso zzso plays a pivotal part in a number of important human zzso However, traditional protein zzso site detection by experimental approaches are often zzso and zzso In this study, we initiated an attempt for the zzso prediction of protein zzso zzso We developed a new method for predicting the zzso sites based on a Random Forest zzso As a result, zzso accuracy and zzso zzso value were obtained for the training zzso and zzso accuracy and zzso zzso value for the testing zzso Our method considered several features including sequence zzso residual disorder, secondary structures, zzso accessibility, zzso properties and zzso acid occurrence zzso By means of the feature selection algorithm, an optimal set of zzso features were zzso these features were considered as the ones that contributed significantly to the prediction of protein zzso zzso Analysis of the optimal feature set indicated several important factors in determining the zzso and a possible consensus sequence of the zzso recognition site zzso was zzso These may shed some light on the in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of zzso providing guidelines for experimental zzso
