We study the nature of the fitness landscapes of a zzso Kauffman's zzso model with a zzso zzso We have zzso calculated the rugged fitness zzso the zzso their tails, and the correlation between the fitness of local zzso and their zzso distance from the highest optimum found, zzso We have found that zzso there is an interesting difference between random and zzso networks such that the statistics of the rugged fitness landscapes is zzso for the random network while it is zzso with a tail for the zzso zzso zzso as the average degree zzso increases, there is a phase transition at the critical value of zzso below which there is a global order and above which the order goes zzso
