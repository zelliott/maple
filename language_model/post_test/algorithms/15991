During zzso differentiation and zzso electrical zzso is essential for proper gene expression and the formation of zzso The expression of zzso channels is crucial for this process; in particular, zzso zzso channels function as the key zzso of membrane zzso Previously, we reported that the zzso zzso current zzso and zzso zzso channel zzso expression increased in cultured zzso zzso cells with zzso To examine the correlation between zzso currents and the action potential, in the present study, we measured zzso changes of action zzso in cultured zzso cells using the zzso zzso zzso In addition to an observed zzso of zzso we found that the zzso current also increased during zzso The increase in both currents was accompanied by a change in the membrane zzso from the zzso type to the repetitive firing zzso Next, to zzso whether zzso is responsible for the zzso and to assess the effect of zzso zzso on action potential zzso we zzso a zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso into cultured zzso zzso of zzso resulted in the elimination of zzso in the zzso zzso This result demonstrates that members of the zzso zzso are responsible for the zzso in developing zzso zzso Moreover, elimination of zzso resulted in zzso of zzso before the first spike zzso In contrast, expression of zzso zzso resulted in a delay in zzso This indicates that appearance of zzso is critically required for suppression of the zzso of zzso cells during their zzso
