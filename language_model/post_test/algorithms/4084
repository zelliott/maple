zzso zzso is a method of studying brain activity via recordings of the magnetic field generated by neural zzso Modern zzso systems employ an array of low zzso zzso quantum interference devices zzso zzso that surround the zzso The geometric distribution of these zzso is zzso by maximizing the information content available to the system in brain activity recordings according to Shannon's theory of noisy channel zzso 

zzso we present a theoretical comparison of the performance of low- and zzso zzso zzso systems in recordings of brain zzso 

We find a zzso zzso zzso zzso system is capable of zzso at least zzso more information than an equivalent zzso zzso zzso The results suggest more information can be extracted from zzso zzso zzso recordings zzso higher sensor noise levels than their zzso zzso because of the closer proximity to neural sources in the zzso 

We have duplicated previous results in terms of total information of zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso technology theoretically zzso its conventional zzso counterpart in zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso zzso system's potential for extraction of more information about neural activity can be used to, zzso develop better diagnostic and monitoring techniques for brain disease and enhance our understanding of the working human zzso
