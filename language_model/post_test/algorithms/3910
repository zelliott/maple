zzso is a convenient and widely used technique to look into the zzso muscle motion as it is radiation-free and zzso The motion of localized parts of the muscle, disclosed by zzso zzso reflects contraction activities of the corresponding zzso However, little attention was paid to the zzso of zzso muscle motion, especially towards zzso of dense deformation field at different depths under the zzso Yet fewer studies on the zzso of such muscle motion or further clinical applications were reported in the zzso A zzso zzso was used to estimate the motion of zzso muscle zzso in zzso direction in this zzso To provide insights into the rules of zzso muscle motion, we proposed a novel framework including motion zzso zzso and quantitative analysis to interpret zzso activities of collaborating muscles with spatial zzso The proposed methods were evaluated on ultrasound image zzso captured at a rate of 25 frames per second from eight healthy zzso In order to estimate and zzso the zzso motion in zzso direction, each subject was asked to perform zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results show that the proposed zzso methods provide both spatial and zzso details and they are helpful to study muscle zzso One of the proposed quantitative measures was also tested on a patient with unilateral limb dysfunction caused by cerebral zzso The measure revealed distinct patterns between the normal and the dysfunctional lower zzso The proposed framework and its associated quantitative measures could potentially be used to complement zzso zzso and zzso signals in functional assessment of skeletal zzso
