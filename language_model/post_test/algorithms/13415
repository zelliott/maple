zzso rates are usually considered to be dependent on local properties of the molecules involved in zzso However, for large zzso distant constraints might affect reaction rates by affecting dynamics leading to transition zzso In zzso experiments we have found that zzso that relax DNA zzso stress display rates that depend strongly on how the distant ends of the zzso are zzso experiments with zzso particles zzso to the end of zzso zzso reveal zzso rates zzso correlated with particle drag zzso This effect can be understood in terms of the zzso between zzso extension and local molecular zzso The rate of zzso zzso motion controls the rate at which transition states are visited in the middle of a long zzso zzso we have also observed this effect for reactions on zzso zzso other zzso show rates unaffected by zzso zzso Our results reveal a unique mechanism through which zzso rates can be controlled by constraints on zzso or zzso zzso
