We consider modeling and zzso analysis for zzso data when the termination time for each subject may depend on its history of the zzso zzso We propose a fully specified zzso model for the joint distribution of the zzso events and the termination zzso For this model, we provide a natural zzso derive several novel properties, and develop a zzso analysis based on a zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso Comparisons are made to other existing models and methods for zzso zzso We demonstrate the usefulness of our new models and zzso through the zzso of a data set from a clinical zzso
