zzso reconstructions are underpinned by zzso divergence times and ancestral area zzso which together yield ancestral area zzso that provide a basis for proposing and testing hypotheses of zzso and zzso zzso for area coding include zzso coding with a single character, zzso coding with multiple characters and string zzso zzso reconstruction methods are divided into zzso versus zzso zzso We compared nine methods for reconstructing ancestral areas for zzso zzso zzso reconstructions were a problem for all zzso Important differences resulted from coding areas based on the geographical ranges of extant species versus the geographical provenance of the oldest fossil for each zzso Africa and South America were reconstructed as the ancestral areas for zzso and zzso zzso Most methods reconstructed zzso as the ancestral area for zzso zzso and zzso The coincidence of molecular dates for the separation of zzso and zzso at approximately 100 Ma with the plate zzso zzso of Africa and South America hints at the importance of zzso in the early history of zzso zzso has also been important including the origins of zzso endemic zzso zzso Further studies will benefit from increased zzso sampling and the application of new ancestral area reconstruction zzso
