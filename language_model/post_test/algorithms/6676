For the simulation of therapeutic ultrasound applications, a method including zzso zzso effects directly in the time domain is highly zzso This paper describes an efficient zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso model presented by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 96, zzso zzso zzso of therapeutic ultrasound applications are feasible in conjunction with a previously presented finite differences zzso zzso zzso for zzso ultrasound propagation zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 111, zzso zzso zzso implemented the empirical frequency zzso zzso using a zzso zzso operator directly in the zzso zzso Though a variety of zzso models has been published in recent years, no efficient zzso zzso has been presented so far for frequency zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso integral with standard zzso techniques requires enormous zzso effort and therefore often limits the application of such models to zzso zzso In contrast, the presented method is based on a zzso zzso and requires only three time levels and a few auxiliary data to approximate the zzso integral with high zzso The simulation results are validated by comparison with zzso solutions and zzso
