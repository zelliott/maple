zzso flow zzso have been obtained for brine flowing through zzso sandstone using the rapid zzso pulse zzso In this way, 8 flow zzso at different observation times Delta were acquired in 67 zzso compared to 7 h for the same zzso implemented with conventional zzso field zzso zzso zzso zzso allows this time saving to be achieved through the acquisition of multiple displacement probability zzso over a range of Delta in a single zzso If only the zzso moments are required, this experiment time can be further reduced to 9 zzso through appropriate sparse sampling at low zzso zzso The zzso moments obtained from zzso zzso with dense and sparse zzso sampling are shown to be equivalent to those obtained from conventional zzso zzso
