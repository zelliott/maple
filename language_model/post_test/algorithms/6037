zzso optical zzso zzso is an emerging functional medical imaging zzso which aims to recover the optical properties of biological zzso The forward problem of the light propagation of zzso can be zzso in the frequency domain as a diffusion equation with Robin boundary zzso In the case of multilayered zzso with zzso constant zzso the forward problem is equivalent to a set of coupled zzso zzso In this paper, we present solutions for the multilayered diffuse light propagation for a zzso concentric sphere model using a series expansion method and for a general layered geometry using the boundary element method zzso zzso are presented comparing these solutions to an independent zzso Carlo model, and for an example three layered head zzso
