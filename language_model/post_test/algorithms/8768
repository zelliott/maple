Most methods for next-generation sequencing zzso data analyses incorporate information regarding zzso zzso using the assumption of zzso equilibrium zzso as a zzso However, many organisms including those that are zzso partially zzso or with asexual life cycles show strong zzso from zzso For such species, and specially for zzso data, it is necessary to obtain estimates of zzso zzso zzso for each individual before calling zzso Here, we present two methods for zzso zzso zzso from zzso data based on an zzso zzso zzso We assess the impact of taking zzso into account when calling zzso or zzso the site frequency spectrum zzso and demonstrate a marked increase in accuracy on zzso highly zzso zzso We demonstrate the zzso and efficacy of these methods in both simulated and real data zzso
