zzso models are an important tool to explain and comprehend complex phenomena, and unparalleled zzso advances enable us to easily explore them without any or little understanding of their global zzso In fact, the likelihood of the data under complex zzso models is often zzso or zzso intractable in many areas of zzso This makes it even more important to simultaneously investigate the zzso of these zzso absolute terms, against the data, rather than relative to the performance of other zzso no such procedure has been formally discussed when the likelihood is zzso We provide a statistical interpretation to current developments in zzso zzso zzso that explicitly accounts for discrepancies between the model and the data, termed Approximate zzso zzso under model uncertainty zzso We augment the likelihood of the data with unknown error terms that zzso to freely chosen checking functions, and provide zzso Carlo strategies for sampling from the associated joint zzso distribution without the need of evaluating the zzso We discuss the benefit of incorporating model zzso within an ABC zzso and demonstrate how this method diagnoses model mismatch and guides model refinement by contrasting three qualitative models of protein network evolution to the protein interaction zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our results make a number of model deficiencies zzso and suggest that the zzso zzso network zzso is inconsistent with evolution dominated by link turnover or lateral gene transfer zzso
