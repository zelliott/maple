The purpose of this study was to determine whether a simple zzso zzso could be developed for predicting zzso to zzso zzso zzso as defined by sustained spontaneous or zzso zzso Two different zzso zzso zzso were determined by the difference between the longest and shortest zzso zzso measured in three zzso leads zzso zzso zzso zzso and at least 11 of 12 leads zzso from the zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso were investigated (with and without the zzso duration from the zzso zzso and compared to the zzso zzso zzso in order to determine their sensitivity and specificity for detecting zzso Only patients who underwent zzso and were referred for programmed electrical stimulation were included in this zzso A positive zzso was defined by filtered zzso duration zzso 114 zzso and/or low zzso signal duration zzso 38 zzso and/or root mean square zzso in the last 40 zzso of zzso 20 zzso Sixty patients were enrolled in this study with a mean age of 63 zzso 2 zzso Fifty-five percent of the patients had coronary artery zzso A simple zzso zzso consisting of the sum of zzso plus the zzso duration had a sensitivity and specificity of zzso and zzso respectively, zzso the zzso had a sensitivity and specificity of zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso We conclude that a simple zzso zzso is more sensitive than the zzso for predicting zzso This zzso combines two easily measured variables obtained from the zzso zzso and can easily be performed without expensive computer zzso
