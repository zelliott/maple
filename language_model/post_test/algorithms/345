The zzso zzso Task is a well known test problem for two-state discrete zzso zzso For many years researchers have used a variety of evolutionary zzso approaches to evolve solutions to this zzso In this paper, we investigate the zzso of solutions when the underlying Cellular zzso is zzso with a type of memory based on the zzso Mean Square zzso To obtain high performance solutions using a simple zzso genetic algorithm, we design a novel representation based on the zzso representation used for Learning zzso zzso The new representation is found able to produce superior performance to the bit string traditionally used for representing Cellular zzso Moreover, memory is shown to improve zzso of solutions and appropriate memory settings are able to be evolved as a component part of these zzso
