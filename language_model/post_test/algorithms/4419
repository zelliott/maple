To predict the development of zzso heart disease zzso which is a life-threatening complication of certain neuroendocrine zzso To this end, a novel type of zzso zzso known as the zzso zzso is zzso 

zzso cases of patients that suffered from a zzso zzso zzso zzso of which 22 patients developed zzso were obtained from the Netherlands Cancer Institute zzso Eleven attributes that are known at admission have been used to zzso whether the patient develops zzso zzso accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristics zzso curve of the zzso zzso are compared with those of the zzso zzso zzso regression, the zzso learning zzso zzso and a decision rule, as formulated by an expert zzso 

The zzso zzso showed the best zzso accuracy of zzso correctly classified cases, although differences were significant only for zzso zzso and zzso An area under the zzso curve of zzso was attained for the zzso zzso and equaled that of the zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso performed favorably to other state-of-the-art zzso zzso and equally well as a zzso that was formulated by the zzso Furthermore, the zzso of the zzso zzso make it a useful machine learning technique in zzso where multiple causes influence a common zzso
