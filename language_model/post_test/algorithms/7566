Feature selection can decrease zzso size and improve accuracy by removing noisy and/or redundant zzso However, it is possible for feature selection to yield features that are only partially zzso about the classes in the zzso These features are beneficial for distinguishing between some classes but not zzso In these cases, it is beneficial to divide the large zzso problem into a set of smaller problems, where a more specific set of features can be used to zzso different zzso zzso a problem this way is also common when the base zzso is zzso and the problem needs to be reformulated as a set of zzso problems so it can be handled by the zzso This paper presents a method for zzso zzso that simultaneously zzso a zzso tree of simpler zzso zzso and performs feature selection for the individual zzso The feature selected zzso zzso zzso is tested against several well-known techniques for zzso zzso Tests are run on nine different real data sets and one artificial data set using a support zzso machine zzso zzso The results show that the accuracy obtained by the zzso is comparable with other common zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the zzso creates solutions with fewer zzso fewer features, and a shorter testing time than the other zzso zzso zzso
