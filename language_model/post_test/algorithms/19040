zzso transition is studied for the zzso fluid of zzso diameter zzso in the presence of a homogeneous surface modeled by the zzso potential of attractive well from zzso to zzso We investigate surface phase coexistence of zzso film transition using zzso transition zzso zzso Carlo zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso dynamics zzso and zzso are zzso to predict the properties of the fluid for various surface fluid zzso zzso of zzso transition with the variation of surface affinity are observed for a domain of reduced temperature from zzso to zzso We have used MD and zzso size zzso zzso simulations to calculate the boundary tension as a function of temperature as well as surface zzso zzso tensions via MD and zzso methods are in good zzso The boundary tension increases with the decrease of zzso zzso zzso critical properties are calculated using zzso diameter approach and zzso zzso We found that critical temperature and density increase with the decrease of zzso zzso
