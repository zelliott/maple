The study of zzso mechanics concerns functional characteristics depending on wall elasticity and flow zzso Wall elasticity can be investigated through the zzso of parameters like the zzso zzso which is of high clinical interest because of its known correlation not only with the advanced zzso disease, but also with aging and major risk factors for cardiovascular zzso The flow zzso profile is also clinically relevant, because it zzso zzso function and can be responsible for the development and distribution of zzso zzso A clinically relevant variable extracted from the blood zzso profile is the wall zzso rate zzso which represents the spatial zzso zzso near the vessel zzso This paper describes an integrated ultrasound system, capable of detecting both the zzso profile and the wall movements in human zzso It basically consists of a PC zzso board including a single high-speed digital signal zzso This is dedicated to the analysis of zzso zzso from 128 range cells located along the axis of the interrogating ultrasound zzso zzso zzso generated from the walls zzso by high zzso and low zzso zzso and from red blood cells zzso by low zzso and relatively high zzso zzso are independently processed in zzso Wall zzso is detected through the zzso algorithm, while blood zzso is investigated through a complete spectral analysis of all signals zzso by zzso and zzso is extracted from the estimated zzso zzso zzso applications of the new system, including the simultaneous analysis of blood flow and zzso wall movement in healthy volunteers and in a diseased patient, are discussed, and first results are zzso
