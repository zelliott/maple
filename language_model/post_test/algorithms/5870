For a detailed characterization of zzso and zzso of human heart rate, we introduce an analysis method to investigate the deformation process of the probability density function zzso of zzso increments when going from fine to coarse zzso To characterize the scale dependence of the zzso zzso we use two zzso 1) calculation of zzso relative zzso 2) zzso zzso based on zzso equation zzso zzso et zzso zzso We compare zzso of the zzso zzso between actual heart rate fluctuations and artificially generated zzso and zzso noise, including a widely used zzso model and a recently proposed zzso model based on a random cascade zzso Our analysis highlights an essential difference between heart rate fluctuations and those generated by other zzso The outstanding feature of human heart rate is the robust zzso of the zzso zzso which is preserved not only in a zzso condition, but also in a dynamic state during waking hours, in which the mean level of heart rate is dramatically zzso Our results strongly suggest the need for revising existing models of heart rate zzso to incorporate the zzso in the zzso
