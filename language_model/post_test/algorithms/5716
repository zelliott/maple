There is a perceived zzso between the ease of measuring alcohol in the body and the accuracy of the zzso zzso tests of blood alcohol zzso are considered the most accurate, zzso stationary breath testers based on zzso zzso technology are slightly less accurate, but accepted for evidentiary purposes in most zzso and quick portable breath testers based on fuel-cell technology are the easiest to administer but not acceptable in many zzso This study compared the accuracy of an evidentiary portable breath tester and an evidentiary zzso breath tester relative to blood alcohol zzso zzso zzso were used to obtain confidence limits for the alcohol levels as read by the breath testers that would provide tradeoffs of false zzso and false zzso for three levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso corresponding to false positive values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso A decision tree model is offered for the optimal use of the three measures, so that portable breath testers can be sufficient for high level zzso stationary breath testers can be sufficient for medium level zzso and blood tests are recommended for still lower zzso The model provides quantitative zzso threshold levels for the two most common zzso levels used to imply zzso zzso and 80 zzso
