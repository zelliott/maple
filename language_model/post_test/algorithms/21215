When complex data is distributed in a biased manner between disease classes, zzso accuracy can be increased with a network set of zzso neural networks developed by zzso A novel projection method is also introduced for the visual zzso of the data to zzso its features and disease class zzso The set of the zzso neural networks and the projection method were tested with zzso data and they improved average sensitivity and positive zzso value at least zzso up to zzso and zzso compared to our earlier neural network zzso with the same zzso The methods were also experimented with two additional data sets, which included zzso very difficult zzso
