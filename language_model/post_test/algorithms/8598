DNA zzso represents one of the major advances in functional zzso Its ability to study expression of several thousands of genes or even all genes in the entire zzso in a single experiment has changed the way in which we address basic biomedical zzso Numerous publications have shown its utility in drug discovery, disease diagnosis, novel gene zzso and understanding complex biological zzso However, there are substantive technical issues associated with the use of this technology that limit the interpretation of zzso zzso In this review, we first give an overview of DNA zzso technology and then focus on uncertainty areas of zzso technology that include making zzso isolation of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and data zzso The center theme of this review is to improve zzso zzso by addressing common technical zzso Finally, we briefly zzso zzso applications in biomedical zzso
