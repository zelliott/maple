zzso positioning dictates zzso DNA zzso and zzso To predict zzso positions in a statistical mechanics model, we exploited the knowledge that zzso favor DNA sequences with specific periodically occurring zzso Our model is the first to capture both zzso position within a few base pairs, and free binding energy within 2 zzso for all the known zzso positioning zzso By applying zzso equation to the derived energy landscape, we isolate sequence effects on zzso zzso occupancy from other factors that may influence zzso zzso For both in zzso and in zzso systems, three parameters suffice to predict zzso occupancy with correlation zzso of respectively zzso and zzso As predicted, we find the largest zzso in zzso around zzso start zzso This relatively simple zzso can be used to guide future studies on the influence of DNA sequence on zzso zzso
