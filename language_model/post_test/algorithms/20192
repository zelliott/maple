In minimally invasive zzso interventions, different imaging zzso such as magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso and 3-D ultrasound zzso can provide zzso zzso image zzso Dynamic image registration is a well-established approach that permits real-time diagnostic information to be enhanced by placing zzso real-time images within a high quality anatomical zzso For the guidance of cardiac interventions, it would be valuable to register dynamic zzso or CT with zzso zzso However, in practice, either the high zzso cost prohibits such real-time zzso or else the resulting image quality is not satisfactory for accurate zzso zzso Modern graphics processing units zzso provide the zzso zzso and increased zzso precision to address this zzso In this paper, we first outline our research on dynamic 3-D cardiac MR and US image zzso real-time zzso registration and US zzso Next, we describe our contributions on image processing and zzso techniques for zzso zzso + zzso cardiac image zzso and our zzso zzso for zzso zzso medical image zzso and optical zzso along with real-time synchronization of zzso dynamic cardiac zzso Finally, multiple transfer functions, various image composition schemes, and an extended zzso setting and adjustment approach are proposed and applied to facilitate the dynamic zzso MR and US cardiac data exploration and enhance the feature of interest of US image that is usually restricted to a narrow zzso intensity zzso
