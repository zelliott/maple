Learning zzso Systems zzso such as the zzso zzso evolve distributed problem solutions represented by a population of zzso During evolution, features are zzso zzso and zzso to provide increasingly accurate zzso Recently, it was shown that, as in conventional genetic zzso zzso some problems require efficient processing of zzso of features to find problem solutions zzso In such problems, standard variation operators of genetic and evolutionary zzso used in zzso suffer from potential disruption of groups of interacting features, resulting in poor zzso This paper introduces efficient crossover operators to zzso by incorporating techniques derived from competent zzso the extended compact zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso Instead of simple crossover operators such as uniform crossover or zzso zzso zzso or zzso mechanisms are used to build a zzso model of the global population and to generate offspring zzso locally using the zzso Several offspring generation variations are introduced and zzso The results show that it is possible to achieve performance similar to runs with an informed crossover operator that is specifically designed to yield ideal zzso zzso exploiting provided problem structure zzso Thus, we create the first competent zzso zzso and zzso that detect dependency structures online and zzso corresponding zzso dependency structures effectively without any information about these structures given in zzso
