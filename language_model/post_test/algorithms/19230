The problem of discriminating between a number of similar, zzso zzso is discussed with special reference to the phenomenon of kin and zzso discrimination in social zzso zzso by the basic zzso and anatomical features of the zzso sensory receptors and neural pathways in insects, a model is presented for the process of odor zzso The model zzso neural processing capabilities that include the zzso transformations of electrical zzso to generate a zzso quantity representing the zzso of two zzso zzso The model thereby zzso the notion of zzso matching that appears in the kin recognition literature, and makes the concept of a recognition template more zzso The hypotheses underlying the model suggest a number of zzso studies that should be zzso while the model itself provides a basis for zzso several areas of research pertaining to kin recognition in particular species of zzso
