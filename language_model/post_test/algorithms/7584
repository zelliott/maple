zzso evolution zzso is a simple and powerful zzso evolutionary algorithm, successfully used in various scientific and engineering zzso Although DE has been studied by many researchers, the neighborhood and direction information is not fully and simultaneously exploited in the designing of zzso In order to alleviate this drawback and enhance the performance of zzso we first introduce two novel operators, zzso the neighbor guided selection scheme for parents involved in zzso and the direction induced zzso strategy, to fully exploit the neighborhood and direction information of the population, zzso By zzso these two operators, a simple and effective DE zzso which is referred to as the neighborhood and direction information based DE zzso is then proposed for enhancing the performance of zzso This way, zzso not only zzso the information of neighboring individuals to exploit the regions of zzso and accelerate convergence but also incorporates the direction information to prevent an individual from entering an zzso region and move to a promising zzso zzso a good balance between exploration and exploitation can be zzso In order to test the effectiveness of zzso the proposed framework is applied to the original DE zzso as well as several state-of-the-art DE zzso Experimental results show that zzso is an effective framework to enhance the performance of most of the DE zzso zzso
