zzso in zzso zzso factor zzso gene expression contribute to serious zzso such as depression, zzso cancer, zzso Huntington and Parkinson's zzso zzso exploring the mechanisms of zzso regulation represents a great clinical zzso zzso zzso expression remains difficult due to its multiple neural zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso data could provide insight into the regulation of this complex zzso Conventional zzso zzso analysis is usually carried out by merging the zzso or by confirming the zzso of significant correlations across zzso However, zzso patterns can be different under various conditions that are represented by zzso in a zzso zzso assessing zzso by measuring correlation zzso across merged samples of a zzso or by merging zzso might not capture all correlation zzso 

In our study, we performed zzso analysis of publicly available zzso data using zzso as a zzso introducing a zzso zzso The key steps of the analysis zzso dividing zzso into zzso with biologically meaningful sample content zzso zzso gender or disease state zzso analyzing zzso with the zzso gene in each subset zzso and confirming zzso expression links across zzso Finally, we analyzed conservation in zzso with zzso between human, mouse and zzso and sought for zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes discovered in this study regulate nervous system development, and are associated with various types of cancer and neurological zzso Also, several zzso factor identified here have been reported to regulate zzso expression in zzso and in zzso 

The study demonstrates the potential of the zzso approach in zzso conservation analysis for studying the regulation of single genes and proposes novel regulators of zzso gene zzso
