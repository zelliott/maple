zzso zzso zzso zzso and Search zzso zzso are two pacing zzso designed to reduce zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso by operating in zzso mode with backup zzso pacing during zzso block zzso zzso operates in zzso mode with a nominal zzso extension of 290 zzso during zzso sensing and 320 zzso during zzso zzso The reduction in zzso pacing was compared with these two zzso in zzso zzso 

The zzso and zzso clinical studies assessed the percentage of zzso pacing zzso after 1 zzso Each patient's zzso status was assigned using the following zzso zzso persistent zzso zzso zzso episodic zzso zzso zzso second-degree zzso zzso first-degree zzso zzso and no zzso zzso zzso was tabulated for each zzso status zzso 

Data were available from zzso patients of whom 129 received zzso pacing with the zzso zzso activated and 193 patients with zzso pacing and the zzso function zzso each for a month zzso zzso resulted in a significantly lower zzso than zzso in all zzso categories except for zzso zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso vs 100, P zzso zzso 

zzso resulted in a greater reduction zzso than zzso across all patient groups except persistent zzso zzso zzso The greatest reduction zzso was observed in patients with mildly impaired zzso zzso
