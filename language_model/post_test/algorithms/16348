zzso zzso pulse pressure and blood pressure zzso can lead to zzso of cerebral white matter zzso potentially attributable to shared genetic zzso We calculated the magnitude of shared genetic zzso between zzso and fractional zzso of water zzso a sensitive measurement of zzso integrity in a zzso population of Mexican zzso The patterns of zzso and regional genetic overlap between zzso and fractional zzso were interpreted in the context the zzso zzso zzso We also tested whether regional pattern in genetic zzso is modulated by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and high-resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso 55 zzso diffusion zzso imaging data were analyzed for 332 zzso zzso mean age zzso zzso zzso zzso members of the San Antonio Family Heart zzso zzso genetic correlation analysis was used to calculate the genetic overlap between several zzso zzso zzso pressure, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and fractional zzso zzso and regional zzso zzso zzso in pulse pressure and zzso zzso exhibited a significant genetic overlap with zzso in zzso fractional zzso values, sharing zzso and zzso of genetic zzso zzso zzso shared genetic zzso was significantly influenced by rates of zzso development zzso zzso The pattern of genetic overlap between zzso and zzso integrity was generally in agreement with the zzso zzso zzso Our study provides evidence that a set of zzso acting genetic factors jointly influence zzso variation in zzso and zzso zzso The magnitude of this overlap appears to be influenced by zzso of zzso development, suggesting a possible role for zzso zzso
