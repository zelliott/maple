The zzso system is capable of detecting zzso at very low zzso zzso experiments have demonstrated zzso sensitivities down to the zzso range in preparations from the sensory zzso However, the contemporary model for zzso signal zzso provides that zzso bind to zzso receptors with relatively low specificity and consequently low zzso making this detection of zzso zzso theoretically difficult to zzso We employ a zzso model to demonstrate how zzso sensory zzso zzso sensitivity can be tuned by zzso of zzso zzso and/or by other mechanisms regulating spare zzso capacity, thus resolving this zzso The zzso intensity tuning ranges zzso of whole zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells are considerably broader than the commensurate zzso of individual zzso These data are difficult to reconcile with certain contemporary hypotheses that zzso zzso in zzso exhibit a homogeneous population of zzso receptors and identical tuning for odor zzso We show that zzso in spare zzso capacities within a zzso zzso population can increase the zzso zzso of a zzso population of zzso regardless of the presence or absence of a diversity of zzso expression within the zzso The zzso of zzso zzso has been observed in zzso other mechanisms for cellular regulation of spare zzso capacity are also highly plausible zzso quantitative regulation of the relative expression levels of zzso and zzso zzso We present a model illustrating that these processes can zzso both how zzso come to exhibit high sensitivity to zzso stimuli without zzso increased zzso binding affinities or zzso and how a population of zzso zzso could exhibit a broader concentration sensitivity than its individual constituent zzso even given a population expressing identical zzso zzso The regulation of spare zzso capacity may play an important role in the zzso system's ability to reliably detect low odor zzso discriminate odor zzso and segregate this intensity information from representations of odor zzso
