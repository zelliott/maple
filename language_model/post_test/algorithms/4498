zzso prediction of zzso protein sequences generated by zzso projects has emerged as an important focus for zzso zzso We have zzso several approaches beyond traditional sequence similarity that zzso the overwhelmingly large amounts of available data for zzso function zzso including zzso association zzso zzso interaction zzso zzso process zzso zzso and zzso zzso Because they incorporate structural and experimental data that is not used in zzso methods, they can provide additional accuracy and reliability to protein function zzso Here, first we review the definition of protein zzso Then the recent developments of these methods are introduced with special focus on the type of predictions that can be zzso The need for further development of comprehensive systems biology techniques that can zzso the ever-increasing data presented by the zzso and zzso communities is zzso For the readers' zzso tables of useful online resources in each category are zzso The role of zzso scientists in the near future of biological research and the interplay between zzso and experimental biology are also zzso
