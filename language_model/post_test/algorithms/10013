The zzso phase zzso of a signal zzso exhibits slips when the magnitude of their successive phase difference zzso exceeds zzso By applying this approach to zzso zzso and long-range correlated data, we show that the standard zzso of the time difference between the successive phase slips zzso zzso by the percentage of slips in the data is characteristic of the correlation in the zzso We consider a zzso square lattice and model each lattice point by a zzso zzso zzso zzso Further, we model a zzso of the lattice using a different set of zzso parameters compared to the zzso By applying the proposed approach to the lattice model, we show that the two distinct zzso regions introduced in the lattice are clearly zzso Finally, we demonstrate the application of this approach to zzso zzso and fetal zzso signals recorded using 151 zzso quantum interference device sensors to identify the sensors containing the zzso and fetal brain signals and discuss the improved performance of this approach over the traditionally used spectral zzso
