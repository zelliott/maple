We report the design of zzso chemical spaces using zzso a mapping zzso that generates and zzso flexible space representations for the identification of active or selective zzso The zzso zzso increases the zzso of reference spaces in a controlled manner by evaluating a single zzso per zzso For seven sets of closely related zzso zzso G protein coupled zzso zzso zzso with different zzso zzso reference spaces were designed and used to identify selective compounds by screening a biologically zzso zzso zzso of zzso that constitute zzso reference spaces identified with zzso can also be used to build other zzso models for the prediction of compound zzso
