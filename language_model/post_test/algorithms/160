zzso monitoring often involves the analysis of systems with hidden factors that switch between different modes of operation in some zzso Given a sequence of zzso the task is to zzso the filtering distribution of the switch setting at each time zzso In this paper, we present zzso switching linear zzso systems as a general framework for handling such zzso We show how domain knowledge and learning can be successfully combined in this zzso and introduce a new factor (the zzso for dealing with zzso zzso We demonstrate the flexibility of this type of model by applying it to the problem of monitoring the condition of a premature baby receiving intensive zzso The state of health of a baby cannot be observed directly, but different underlying factors are associated with particular patterns of zzso zzso and zzso We have explicit knowledge of common factors and use the zzso to model novel patterns which are clinically significant but have unknown zzso Experimental results are given which show the developed methods to be effective on typical intensive care unit monitoring zzso
