zzso hydrogen bonding interactions between main chain zzso hydrogen atoms and polar side chain zzso that zzso consecutive zzso or zzso elements of secondary structure in zzso from zzso coli, a TIM barrel zzso have previously been found to contribute 4-6 zzso zzso to the stability of the native zzso Experimental analysis of similar zzso zzso in a zzso pair of TIM barrel proteins of low sequence identity, zzso from zzso zzso and zzso coli, reveals that this dramatic enhancement of stability is not unique to zzso A survey of 71 TIM barrel proteins demonstrates a zzso symmetry for the placement of zzso zzso bracing the fundamental zzso building block and defining its register in the zzso zzso The preferred sequences and locations of zzso zzso will enhance structure prediction zzso and provide a strategy for engineering stability in TIM barrel zzso
