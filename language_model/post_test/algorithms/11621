A zzso control and its application in functional electrical stimulation zzso assisted walking of subjects with zzso are described in this zzso The design of rules for control comprises the following two steps: zzso determination of muscle zzso patterns by using a fully customized spatial zzso model of zzso walking, and zzso learning of rules, that is, correlation between the muscle zzso patterns and zzso of walking by means of an artificial neural zzso The adopted zzso system activated eight muscle groups with surface zzso The only zzso allowing movement in the zzso plane were the hips, and zzso controlled zzso in zzso plane were ankles, knees and zzso The simulation minimized the tracking error of the joint angles and the total zzso of all eight muscles being zzso A zzso function artificial neural network was applied for learning of zzso Three automatically controlled modes zzso zzso and zzso and zzso walking were evaluated in six subjects with a complete spinal zzso zzso zzso The performance of walking was assessed by the zzso zzso energy consumption based on oxygen zzso zzso zzso cost index, zzso maximum speed of walking, and zzso a zzso The results showed that all modes of walking are achievable and that automatic control leads to more efficient and faster zzso The speed of walking achieved by automatic control was almost three times bigger compared with the speed of zzso zzso The energy cost and rate decreased significantly when automatic control was zzso yet, they were still much bigger than the values measured in zzso zzso The objective outcome measures suggest that the zzso walking was the most effective, yet a questionnaire shows that most subjects preferred slow zzso The most likely reason for the preference of lower efficiency walking over the faster end energy efficient zzso walking was that zzso patients had difficulties in zzso the voluntary movement of the trunk and arms to the artificially controlled movements of zzso
