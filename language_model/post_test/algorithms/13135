To define the clinical spectrum of regional zzso anomalies associated with large zzso zzso of the lower half of the body, clarify risk for underlying anomalies on the basis of zzso location, and provide imaging guidelines for zzso 

We conducted a zzso retrospective case analysis of 24 new patients and review of 29 published zzso 

zzso in our series tended to be zzso and often zzso zzso in zzso Such zzso were often extensive, covering the entire zzso zzso limb zzso also showed potential for zzso anomalies, including underlying zzso anomalies, limb zzso and zzso The zzso zzso and underlying anomalies demonstrated regional zzso zzso were the most common category of associated zzso 

We propose the zzso zzso to describe the association of Lower body zzso and other zzso zzso zzso anomalies, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso anomalies, and Renal zzso There are many similarities between zzso and zzso syndrome, which might be considered regional variations of the zzso Although guidelines for imaging are suggested, prospective studies will lead to precise imaging recommendations and help determine true zzso risk and long-term zzso
