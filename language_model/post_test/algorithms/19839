This work is concerned with the creation of three-dimensional zzso zzso ultrasound from a set of volumes acquired using a mechanically swept zzso zzso zzso volumes of ultrasound data can be registered by attaching a position sensor to the zzso this can be an inconvenience in a clinical zzso A position sensor can also cause some zzso due to patient movement and respiratory zzso We propose a combination of zzso image registration and an zzso integrated zzso sensor for measuring zzso The aim of this research is to produce a reliable and portable ultrasound system that is able to register zzso volumes quickly, making it suitable for clinical zzso 

As part of a feasibility study we recruited 28 pregnant females attending for routine zzso scans to undergo zzso zzso zzso A total of 49 data sets were zzso Each registered data set was assessed for correct alignment of each volume by two independent zzso 

In zzso of the data sets more than four consecutive volumes zzso The successful registration relies on good overlap between volumes and is adversely affected by advancing zzso age and zzso zzso 

The development of reliable zzso zzso ultrasound may help ultrasound practitioners to demonstrate the anatomical relation of pathology and provide a convenient way to store zzso
