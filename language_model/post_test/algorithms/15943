We present a global zzso strategy that incorporates predicted restraints in both a local zzso context and as directives for global zzso approaches, to predict protein zzso structure for zzso zzso Specifically, neural networks are used to predict the secondary structure of a zzso restraints are defined as manifestations of the network with a predicted secondary structure and the secondary structure is formed using local zzso on a protein energy surface, in the presence of the zzso Those zzso predicted to be zzso by the network, define a zzso zzso that is subject to zzso using a global approach known as zzso zzso that has been found to be effective for zzso clusters and zzso Our energy surface is an zzso zzso zzso molecular mechanics force field, that is combined with a new zzso energy function that penalizes zzso group zzso This energy function gives the crystal structure of four different zzso proteins as the lowest energy structure relative to other zzso with correct secondary structure but incorrect zzso zzso We demonstrate this global zzso strategy by determining the zzso structure of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and of a zzso zzso DNA binding zzso
