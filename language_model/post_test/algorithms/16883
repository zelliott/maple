zzso between not fully zzso zzso is weak and limits conventional zzso zzso zzso An automated zzso zzso analysis features could improve the sensitivity to tissue zzso during early bone zzso 

zzso formation in a rat zzso model was analyzed using in zzso zzso and classified zzso zzso cartilage, and zzso zzso A conventional zzso method including manual zzso was compared to a novel zzso method: after removing the background peak, the zzso of each slice were characterized by their moments and analyzed as a function of the position along the long bone zzso 

The zzso method could differentiate between the zzso and zzso tissue (R zzso zzso The zzso approach yielded a clear distinction between all 3 groups with a zzso accuracy up to R zzso zzso 

The zzso evaluation zzso the conventional zzso CT analysis in sensitivity to the healing stage, user independence, and time zzso
