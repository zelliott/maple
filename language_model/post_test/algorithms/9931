zzso zzso patients for clinically significant emotional distress is a recommended standard of care in zzso However, principles regarding the interpretation of screening and diagnostic tests developed in other areas of medicine have not been widely applied in zzso This paper explores the application of the concepts of likelihood ratios and zzso probabilities to the interpretation of psychological screening instruments and demonstrates the development of an zzso for screening for emotional distress and common zzso 

Three hundred zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso Australia completed the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso and Psychological Health Report and the zzso zzso The Hospital zzso and Depression zzso zzso zzso zzso was used as the gold zzso 

zzso ratios showed that a score over threshold on the zzso was zzso times more likely in patients who were cases on the zzso These patients had a zzso zzso probability of being cases on the zzso compared with the zzso probability of zzso Adding either the zzso zzso or the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso significantly increased this zzso probability to zzso and zzso zzso The significance of these improvements was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso 

This study demonstrated the application of probability statistics to develop an zzso for screening for distress in zzso zzso In our sample, a zzso screening zzso improved appreciably on the performance of the zzso alone to identify distressed zzso zzso administration of a very brief instrument followed by selective use of a longer inventory may save time and increase zzso
