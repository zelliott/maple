zzso sequencing zzso technologies are rapidly changing the approach to complex zzso studies, opening the way to personalized drugs development and personalized zzso zzso technologies are characterized by a massive zzso for relatively zzso zzso and they are currently the most reliable and accurate method for grouping individuals on the basis of their genetic zzso The first and crucial step in sequence analysis is the conversion of millions of short sequences zzso into valuable genetic information by their mapping to a known zzso zzso New zzso methods, specifically designed for the type and the amount of data generated by zzso technologies, are replacing earlier widespread zzso alignment zzso which are unable to cope with such massive amount of zzso This review provides an overview of the zzso techniques that have been developed for the mapping of zzso data onto a reference zzso with a special focus on zzso rate and sequence error zzso The different techniques have been experimented on an appropriately defined zzso to investigate their relative zzso costs and zzso as seen from an user zzso Since zzso platforms interrogate the zzso using either the conventional zzso space or the more recent color space, this review does consider techniques both in zzso and color space, emphasizing similarities and zzso
