zzso implant surgery, which involves the surgical zzso of a dental implant into the zzso as an artificial zzso has become one of the most successful applications of zzso zzso zzso in dental zzso For successful implant surgery, it is essential to identify vital zzso structures such as the inferior zzso nerve zzso which should be avoided during the surgical zzso Due to the ambiguity of its structure, the zzso is very elusive to extract in dental CT zzso As a result, the zzso canal is typically identified in most previous zzso This paper presents a novel method of automatically zzso the zzso zzso Mental and zzso zzso which are regarded as the ends of the zzso canal in the zzso are detected automatically using 3-D panoramic volume rendering zzso and texture analysis zzso In the 3-D panoramic zzso novel color zzso and zzso methods are proposed to emphasize the zzso and isolate them from other fine zzso zzso the path of the zzso canal is zzso using a zzso zzso Finally, the zzso canal is extracted by expanding the region of the path using a fast marching method with a new speed function exploiting the anatomical information about the canal zzso In experimental results using ten clinical zzso the proposed method identified the zzso canal accurately, demonstrating that this approach assists dentists substantially during dental implant zzso
