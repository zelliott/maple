We propose a method for the zzso joint analysis of two related aspects of single zzso zzso the zzso zzso measured by the squared zzso of variation zzso of the zzso and the zzso zzso of the spike count measured by the zzso factor zzso We provide a zzso of both zzso using the theory of renewal zzso and verify it for spike trains recorded in zzso Both zzso exhibit a considerable bias for short observations that count less than about zzso spikes on zzso The practical difficulty of measuring the zzso in rate modulated data can be overcome by a simple procedure of spike train zzso which was tested in zzso simulations and in real spike zzso We propose to test zzso spike trains for zzso from the zzso zzso We show that cortical zzso zzso recorded under controlled stationary input conditions in zzso comply with this zzso Performing a zzso joint analysis of zzso and zzso of a single unit recording from the motor zzso of a behaving monkey we demonstrate how the dynamic change of their quantitative relation can be interpreted with respect to zzso intrinsic and zzso factors that influence cortical zzso in zzso Finally, we discuss the effect of several additional factors such as serial zzso correlation and zzso period on the zzso relation of zzso and zzso
