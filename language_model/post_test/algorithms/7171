In this paper, a zzso zzso zzso zzso for structural reconstruction of zzso biological zzso is proposed, which is based on a radiation balance between adjacent zzso A theoretical analysis has been carried out and several influential factors have been analyzed for the reconstructions of a physical model in zzso zzso The simulation results give a criterion of how to choose an appropriate set of parameters to reconstruct biological zzso with the zzso Besides, a zzso system was established and a validation experiment was carried zzso The studies of both zzso simulations and experiments have verified the feasibility of the proposed zzso and give a valuable reference for the future applications of zzso in zzso
