The zzso and zzso calculation results for the zzso transfer reactions of three different systems reveal that the reaction mechanism zzso of a zzso to a zzso is largely determined by the distance between the two zzso centers zzso Systems with relatively large r values tend to abstract a zzso from a zzso of water, zzso these with a relatively small r values prefer to be engaged zzso and their interaction with water is only via hydrogen zzso Further, the results indicate that the effective zzso zzso for an zzso process is strongly correlated with the distance between the two reacting centers zzso in accordance with zzso zzso zzso
