A new zzso zzso for accelerated zzso reconnaissance zzso is proposed that is able to work with a very large number of collective zzso zzso of the dynamics is achieved by constructing a bias potential in terms of a patchwork of zzso locally valid collective zzso These collective coordinates are obtained from trajectory analyses so that they adapt to any new features encountered during the zzso We show how this methodology can be used to enhance sampling in real chemical systems citing examples both from the physics of clusters and from the biological zzso
