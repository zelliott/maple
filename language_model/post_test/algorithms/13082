The separation efficiency and zzso of several commercial zzso particle types (both fully porous and zzso zzso have been investigated using a pharmaceutical zzso basic zzso compound as a test zzso A strong trend between the particle size distribution zzso of the particles and the typically employed zzso of zzso was zzso The relative standard zzso of the zzso of the tested particles ranged between zzso and zzso and in this range, a near linear relationship between the zzso constant, the zzso and the minimal separation zzso was zzso The experimental findings hence confirm the recent observations regarding the relationship between the narrow zzso of the recently zzso zzso particles and their superior efficiency and kinetic zzso The outcome also suggests that the performance of the current generation of fully porous particle columns could be significantly improved if the zzso of these particles could be zzso
