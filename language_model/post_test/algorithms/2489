In this modern era of zzso treatment there is increasing interest in the possibility of avoiding radical surgery in complete zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso In this article, we present a systematic review of such treatments and discuss their therapeutic zzso for the zzso 

We searched the zzso online libraries to identify studies that reported on the long-term surgical and pathological outcomes after local zzso together with those that explored the possibility of clinical observation only in patients achieving a complete clinical response after zzso 

Several retrospective zzso zzso 10), one zzso zzso and one small zzso series have reported on the use of local zzso after zzso and demonstrated zzso low levels of local recurrence with survival comparable to patients progressing to conventional zzso One prospective series allocated patients to observation or radical surgery based on zzso parameters after local zzso zzso and zzso and showed no differences in zzso Two retrospective series from the same group on a Brazilian cohort of patients reported excellent long-term outcomes after zzso and zzso in complete clinical zzso However, other reports have shown no direct correlation between clinical and pathological zzso 

Local zzso may be an appropriate option for selected patients developing good clinical response after zzso In our opinion, a policy of clinical observation in complete clinical zzso after zzso may not be a safe strategy, unless we had robust zzso models for accurate identification of pathological complete zzso In order to identify patients that may be potentially appropriate for such an approach we propose a clinical zzso incorporating important clinical, zzso and pathological zzso The proposed model will require validation in a prospective zzso Finally, we need zzso data for demonstrating the zzso of clinical observation compared to conventional surgery before this can be considered as standard possible therapeutic zzso
