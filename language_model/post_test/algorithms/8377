The recommended method to measure zzso zzso oxide zzso cannot reveal the source of NO zzso We applied a model based on the classical zzso first law of diffusion to partition NO in the zzso The aim was to develop a simple and robust solution zzso with a data quality control feature, and apply it to patients with known zzso in zzso zzso zzso with allergic zzso allergic zzso chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso smokers and controls were zzso NO was measured at three zzso flow zzso An iteration method was developed to partition zzso The airway tissue content of NO was increased in zzso 144 zzso 80 zzso zzso zzso zzso and decreased in smokers, 56 zzso 36 zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no difference between subjects with zzso 98 zzso 40 zzso and controls, 98 zzso 44 zzso The airway transfer rate was increased in allergic asthma and allergic zzso 12 zzso 4 zzso 12 zzso 5 zzso zzso compared to controls, 8 zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso levels were no different from controls, 2 zzso 1 zzso In COPD the zzso levels were increased, 4 zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso NO analysis reveals from where in the respiratory system NO is zzso zzso this new test can be added to the tools the physician has for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with respiratory zzso
