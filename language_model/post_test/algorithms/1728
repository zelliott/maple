The widespread deployment of zzso zzso Identification Systems zzso in law enforcement and border control applications has heightened the need for ensuring that these systems are not zzso While several issues related to fingerprint system security have been investigated, including the use of fake fingerprints for zzso identity, the problem of fingerprint zzso or zzso has received very little zzso zzso zzso refers to the deliberate zzso of the fingerprint pattern by an individual for the purpose of masking his zzso Several cases of fingerprint zzso have been reported in the zzso zzso image quality assessment software zzso zzso cannot always detect altered fingerprints since the implicit image quality due to zzso may not change zzso The main contributions of this paper are: 1) compiling case studies of incidents where individuals were found to have altered their fingerprints for zzso zzso 2) investigating the impact of fingerprint zzso on the accuracy of a commercial fingerprint zzso 3) zzso the zzso into three major categories and suggesting possible zzso 4) developing a technique to automatically detect altered fingerprints based on analyzing orientation field and zzso distribution, and 5) evaluating the proposed technique and the zzso zzso on a large database of altered fingerprints provided by a law enforcement zzso Experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed approach in detecting altered fingerprints and highlight the need to further pursue this zzso
