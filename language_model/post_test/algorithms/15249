We examined simultaneously recorded spikes from multiple rat grid cells, to explain mechanisms underlying their zzso Among grid cells with similar spatial zzso the population activity was confined to lie close to a two-dimensional zzso zzso grid cells differed only along two dimensions of their responses and otherwise were nearly zzso zzso between cell pairs were zzso despite extensive zzso of zzso zzso zzso from novel environments suggest such structure is not inherited from zzso or external sensory zzso Across conditions, zzso relationships are better zzso than responses of single zzso Finally, the system is continually subject to zzso that, were the zzso zzso not attractive, would drive the system to inhabit a different region of state space than zzso These findings have strong implications for theories of zzso activity and substantiate the general hypothesis that the brain zzso using zzso continuous zzso
