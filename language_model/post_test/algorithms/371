Current zzso zzso research in progress has engendered rapid zzso of expression data evolving from zzso zzso Such experiments are generally performed over different zzso belonging to a specific species of zzso For disease diagnosis, zzso zzso are also prepared with zzso taken from similar zzso of different candidates of an zzso zzso data of zzso are frequently mapped to zzso networks to study the functions of zzso their regulation on genes and to explore the complex regulatory network that might exist between zzso zzso zzso genes and zzso These directions of research relating zzso are still not fully zzso and therefore, construction of reliable and compatible methods for mining zzso zzso networks has become an emerging zzso This paper introduces a novel method for mining the zzso zzso networks in order to obtain zzso zzso under the hypothesis that these might be regulated by common zzso 

Three zzso networks, configured from one zzso one zzso and a stem zzso zzso expression data, are studied for analyzing the proposed zzso A novel zzso measure is zzso The results establish the statistical significance of the sets of zzso evolved and the efficacy of the zzso phase employed by the proposed zzso All these zzso yield similar network patterns and produce coherent groups of zzso The existence of common zzso regulating these groups of zzso is zzso zzso The results found are very zzso A novel visual validation method is also proposed that reflects the zzso as well as statistical properties of the grouped zzso This visual validation method provides a promising and statistically significant zzso tool for expression zzso 

A zzso mining methodology that resembles a zzso motivation is proposed in this zzso However, there remains a basic difference between the mining method and a zzso zzso The zzso approach can produce priority zzso zzso from an zzso zzso network, by employing a zzso phase, which are analyzed for statistical and biological zzso The mining zzso zzso the zzso complexity of the analysis, and also handles noise in the zzso In addition, the mining method reveals promising results in the zzso analysis of zzso zzso
