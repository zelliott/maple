This paper explores how zzso zzso zzso zzso location systems can be improved with the use of a light sensor to measure the zzso zzso created when a person walks under zzso unmodified indoor zzso The process of updating the zzso zzso estimates with the information provided by light zzso is a new concept that we have named zzso zzso The displacement and orientation change of a person obtained by zzso zzso is used by the zzso method to accurately zzso the location hypothesis, and vice zzso the zzso approach benefits the zzso approach by obtaining an absolute zzso and reducing the zzso zzso Even from an initially unknown location and orientation, whenever the person passes below a zzso light spot, the location likelihood is zzso updated until it potentially zzso to a zzso probability density zzso The time to zzso to a zzso position hypothesis depends on the number of lights detected and the zzso of the spatial distribution of zzso The proposed zzso method does not require any intensity zzso zzso just the zzso of the position and size of all lights in a building, irrespective of their current zzso zzso This paper presents a detailed description of the zzso concept, the zzso details of the zzso zzso fusion scheme using a particle zzso and several simulated and experimental tests, using a light zzso Galaxy zzso zzso and an external zzso zzso zzso The evaluation includes the zzso zzso approach as well as the fusion with other signals of opportunity zzso zzso zzso or zzso in order to compare their contribution in obtaining high accuracy indoor zzso The integrated solution achieves a zzso error lower than 1 m in most of the zzso
