To zzso assess the accuracy of zzso three-dimensional zzso constructive interference in zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging in the evaluation of mural invasion of zzso zzso by using zzso obtained in zzso images, with zzso analysis as the reference zzso 

Institutional review board approval was obtained for the prospective and retrospective components of this study, with informed consent for the former and waiver of informed consent for the zzso zzso specimens were obtained in 92 patients zzso men, 31 zzso mean age, 65 zzso and contained 96 zzso zzso zzso were examined with a zzso MR system and a zzso loop zzso zzso zzso zzso MR images were obtained with 80 zzso zzso field of view, 512 zzso 512 zzso and zzso section zzso which resulted in a zzso zzso zzso The zzso data sets were zzso with zzso software to generate virtual MR zzso zzso The zzso zzso MR images were compared with zzso findings, and virtual MR zzso images were compared with zzso findings at zzso zzso analysis was performed with zzso rank zzso 

In 92 zzso zzso zzso the depth of mural invasion depicted by zzso zzso MR imaging correlated well with the zzso stage, although the stage assigned with zzso zzso MR imaging was higher than that assigned with zzso analysis in four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso and accuracy were zzso zzso and zzso zzso In 91 zzso zzso virtual MR zzso clearly depicted the zzso type of zzso including gross zzso and tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso MR imaging has high diagnostic accuracy in the in zzso evaluation of mural invasion and zzso features of zzso zzso
