In this paper, the zzso of three fundamental components of image zzso zzso zzso sensing zzso and zzso fitting, are posed and integrated within a zzso zzso This approach benefits from recent advances in statistical learning which have resulted in greatly improved flexibility and zzso The first two components produce zzso zzso zzso and depth maps for the input images, while the third module zzso and resolves the inconsistencies between region labels and depth maps to fit most likely zzso zzso To illustrate the application of these ideas, we have focused on the difficult problem of fitting individual tree models to tree stands which is a major challenge for zzso zzso inventory zzso
