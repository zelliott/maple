The analysis of large-scale gene expression profiles is still a demanding and extensive zzso Modern machine learning and data mining techniques developed in linear algebra, like Independent zzso Analysis zzso become increasingly popular as appropriate tools for analyzing zzso zzso We applied zzso to analyze kinetic gene expression profiles of human zzso derived zzso zzso from three different donors infected with zzso zzso zzso and compared them to more classical methods like zzso zzso zzso were compared using a zzso analysis zzso based on the Gene zzso and the zzso zzso We could show that both methods lead to zzso gene regulatory patterns which fit well to known zzso induced immune zzso In comparison, the zzso attribute of zzso results in a more detailed view and a higher resolution in time dependent behavior of the immune response zzso Additionally, we identified zzso as one of the main regulatory genes during response to zzso zzso zzso
