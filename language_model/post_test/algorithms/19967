The distributed point source method is commonly used to predict the complex acoustic field zzso by zzso zzso In this paper, it is presented as an alternative to conventional approaches often used when solving rough surface scattering zzso Surface zzso and multiple scattering effects are inherently included in the zzso zzso simulation method through zzso manipulation making it very efficient and simple to zzso zzso are presented which illustrate the improvement in accuracy gained over the zzso approximation and the decrease in zzso load over the finite element method, culminating in greater than an order of magnitude decrease in required simulation zzso The method is applied to the practical problem of online wall thickness monitoring within corrosive zzso illustrating the zzso in reflected pulse shape that could be expected from rough surfaces with similar zzso Three commonly implemented zzso zzso are used to analyze a large number of simulated signals from which it is concluded that those based on first arrival time are more stable under increasing zzso conditions than those which are based on reflected pulse zzso
