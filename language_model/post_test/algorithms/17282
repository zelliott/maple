Some zzso properties of zzso zzso of zzso were reported zzso It was shown that despite their lower zzso zzso relative to zzso these zzso zzso with apparently disrupted zzso structures gave either comparable or enhanced in zzso zzso and dissolution rate in simulated zzso media made up of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The current objective was to compare the in zzso behavior of two of these zzso to zzso in dogs and attempt to correlate the in zzso behavior to their in zzso zzso The oral zzso of zzso after administration of zzso zzso and the selected zzso zzso 5, zzso zzso and zzso 5, zzso zzso in fed and zzso beagle dogs were compared to zzso administered zzso zzso and its zzso showed improvement in zzso zzso zzso relative to the zzso state indicating that food enhanced the delivery of zzso from zzso and its zzso The increased zzso in the fed state may be due to stimulation of zzso release by food and, for the zzso possible zzso of their dissolution by zzso In both, zzso and fed states, zzso 2 and 3 gave higher zzso values of zzso than the parent zzso The enhanced zzso of zzso after oral administration were more obvious in fed zzso Although zzso zzso values of zzso from the zzso relative to zzso were not statistically different (at zzso confidence zzso in zzso state, but were different in fed zzso Although the zzso zzso and dissolution of both zzso were lower than zzso dissolution of 2 and 3 was equivalent and greater, respectively, relative to zzso in zzso As expected, the in zzso behavior correlated better with the in zzso zzso dissolution zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso per zzso does not adequately predict in zzso zzso
