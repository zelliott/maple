zzso of molecules in specific small volumes and areas within a cell is likely to be a general strategy that is developed during evolution for regulating the interactions and functions of zzso The cellular plasma zzso which is the zzso membrane that surrounds the entire cell, was considered to be a continuous two-dimensional liquid, but it is becoming clear that it consists of numerous zzso zzso with various zzso such as raft zzso and zzso zzso and membrane molecules are zzso trapped in these zzso In this article, we give a theoretical account on the effects of molecular confinement on zzso zzso reactions in a zzso surface such as the plasma zzso By performing simulations based on a zzso model of diffusion and reaction, we found that in the presence of membrane zzso zzso reactions that occur in each compartment proceed in bursts during which the reaction rate is sharply and briefly increased even though the zzso reaction rate remains the zzso We characterized the time between reaction bursts and the burst zzso as a function of the model zzso and discussed the biological significance of the reaction bursts in the presence of strong inhibitor zzso
