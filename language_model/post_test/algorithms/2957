To determine the extent of zzso differences between conventional three-dimensional zzso dose calculations and zzso zzso dose calculations based on deformation of organ zzso 

zzso dose calculations were zzso performed on zzso zzso data sets for 15 patients with Stage III zzso lung cancer, using a zzso zzso registration zzso on a research version of a commercial radiation treatment planning zzso Target volume coverage and doses to critical structures calculated using the zzso methodology were compared with those calculated using conventional zzso zzso 

For 11 of 15 patients, clinical target volume coverage was comparable in the zzso and zzso calculations, whereas for 7 of 15 patients, planning target volume coverage was zzso For the other patients, the zzso calculation indicated a difference in target volume dose sufficiently great to warrant zzso No correlations could be established between differences in zzso and zzso calculations and gross tumor volume size or extent of zzso zzso differences were observed between zzso and zzso zzso relationships for normal zzso zzso 

Use of zzso dose calculations, when possible, helps ensure that target volumes will not be zzso when respiratory motion may affect the dose zzso
