zzso similarity between a translated zzso sequence and a known biological protein can provide strong evidence for the presence of a zzso coding region, even between zzso related zzso The computer program zzso performed conceptual translation of a zzso query sequence followed by a protein database search in one zzso zzso We characterized the sensitivity of zzso recognition to the presence of zzso zzso and deletion errors in the query sequence and to sequence zzso Reading frames were reliably identified in the presence of zzso query zzso a rate that is typical for primary sequence zzso zzso is appropriate for use in moderate and large scale sequencing projects at the earliest opportunity, when the data are most prone to containing zzso
