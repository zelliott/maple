zzso of the organization of animal societies often requires knowledge of the identity of group members and their spatial zzso We propose an original experimental design to track automatically the position of individuals using radio frequency identification technology zzso zzso equipped with passive zzso were detected by a reader mounted on a mobile arm moving across the nest zzso We developed an zzso to accurately extract the positions of individuals moving in two zzso Our method was validated on synthetic test cases and then used for characterization of the spatial distribution of zzso within zzso This approach provides an amenable system for monitoring large populations of individuals over long periods of zzso
