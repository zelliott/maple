Our objective was to determine whether zzso zzso based on serum total zzso the free proportion of zzso age, digital zzso examination and prostate volume can reduce the rate of zzso zzso results in prostate cancer screening more effectively than the proportion of free zzso alone at zzso zzso A total of zzso consecutive zzso to zzso men with a serum zzso of zzso zzso in the European zzso Study of zzso for zzso Cancer were zzso To predict the presence of cancer, zzso zzso were constructed using zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso neural network with zzso zzso zzso A prospective setting was simulated by dividing the data set zzso into one set for training and validation zzso zzso zzso zzso and one test set zzso zzso zzso zzso The diagnostic models were zzso using the training set to obtain zzso zzso When applied to the test set, the zzso model, the zzso model and the proportion of free zzso reached zzso zzso and zzso sensitivity and reduced zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso results, zzso At a fixed sensitivity of zzso in the test set, the zzso model eliminated more zzso zzso results zzso than the proportion of free zzso alone zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso model did not zzso zzso zzso zzso The area under the zzso curve was larger for the zzso model zzso p zzso zzso and the zzso model zzso p zzso zzso than for the proportion of free zzso zzso A zzso zzso can be used to reduce unnecessary prostate zzso in screening more effectively than the proportion of free zzso alone, but the zzso will require updating when clinical practice develops with zzso
