We investigate the nature of correlations in zzso light sources used for ghost zzso We adopt methods from quantum information theory to distinguish genuinely quantum from classical zzso Combining a microscopic analysis of zzso correlations with an effective zzso description of the beams, we show that quantum correlations exist even in zzso zzso light sources, and appear relevant for the zzso of ghost imaging in the regime of low zzso We further demonstrate that the total correlations in the zzso source beams effectively determine the quality of the imaging, as zzso by the zzso zzso
