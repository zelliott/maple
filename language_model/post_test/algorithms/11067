zzso zzso zzso zzso are attractive for zzso zzso Thus, exploring their effect on viability of seven different cell lines representing different zzso of the human body is highly zzso 

The zzso effects of zzso zzso were studied by zzso exposure of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso lung slices from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and primary mouse zzso zzso was examined following exposure to zzso zzso in the concentration range of zzso zzso zzso for 24 and 72 zzso using zzso blue, zzso and neutral red zzso Changes in zzso stress were determined by a zzso zzso based zzso Data analysis and zzso modeling of the obtained data sets were executed by employing methods of zzso Discovery from Data with emphasis on a decision tree model zzso 

Different zzso zzso of cell viability were obtained for each of the seven cell lines upon exposure to zzso zzso zzso of zzso stress was induced by zzso zzso and found to be dependent on the cell zzso A high linear correlation zzso was found between the toxicity of zzso zzso and the extent of zzso generation following their exposure to zzso zzso The zzso we applied to model the observed toxicity belongs to a type of supervised zzso The decision tree model yielded the following order with decrease of the ranking zzso zzso zzso (as the most influencing zzso cell type zzso the following hierarchy of cell sensitivity towards viability zzso zzso zzso Lung slices zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and time of exposure, where the highest-ranking zzso zzso zzso provides the highest information gain with respect to zzso The zzso of the chosen decision tree model zzso was established by yielding a higher accuracy than that of the well-known zzso zzso zzso 

The observed correlation between the zzso stress, caused by the presence of the zzso zzso with the hierarchy of sensitivity of the different cell types towards zzso suggests that zzso stress is one possible mechanism for the toxicity of zzso zzso
