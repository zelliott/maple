The zzso clinical study including a zzso has been recommended to be the preferred study design for the comparison of an experimental treatment relative to a reference zzso In a zzso zzso study zzso issues arise that are not present in zzso zzso In the past a successful demonstration of superiority of the reference over zzso has been regarded a prerequisite validation step for the demonstration of superiority of the experimental treatment over zzso However, for an investigator this last comparison is the most critical zzso In a clinical study the demonstration of superiority of the experimental treatment over zzso is a result of its own value and this should therefore not be made dependent on tests that are of higher priority in a zzso test zzso This can be achieved through a symmetrical zzso of zzso method for constructing confidence intervals for ratio of the expected values from normally distributed zzso In the symmetrical zzso the different zzso of zzso and zzso disappear, and simultaneous statements for comparisons between the experimental treatment and zzso reference treatment and zzso and reference and experimental treatment can be zzso This is accomplished by moving the discussion on confidence sets from the line of real numbers to the unit circle which allows representing confidence sectors always as connected sets, gives always simple geometrical zzso and is easy to be transformed back to the real numbers if the traditional calculations behave zzso The proposed procedures provides additional insight in existing methods but does obviously not answer the clinical question whether or not the demonstration of superiority of the reference treatment over zzso is a necessary validation step for further zzso
