To evaluate the potential for machine learning techniques to identify objective criteria for zzso vertical facial zzso 

19 parameters were determined from 131 lateral skull zzso zzso were induced from raw data with simple zzso zzso and zzso feature zzso and using a Point Distribution Model zzso of shape templates zzso points taken from zzso zzso 

The induced decision trees enable a direct comparison of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso induce models that are potentially more objective, but their zzso nature makes them zzso for clinical zzso The zzso methodology gives dramatic zzso of two modes separating horizontal and vertical facial zzso zzso feature maps zzso one zzso and zzso the zzso Clinical response suggests that while zzso 1 places greater weight on 5 of 6 zzso zzso 2 relies on more parameters that capture facial zzso 

While machine learning and statistical analyses zzso subjects for vertical facial zzso they have limited application in their present zzso The supervised learning zzso zzso is effective for generating rules for individual clinicians but its inherent bias zzso its use for objective zzso of facial form for research zzso On the other hand, promising results from zzso strategies (especially the zzso suggest a potential use for objective zzso and further identification and analysis of ambiguous zzso At present, such zzso may be zzso for clinical application because of the invisibility of their underlying zzso Further study is required with additional patient data and a wider group of zzso
