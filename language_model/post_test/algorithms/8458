The object of this study was to investigate the feasibility of generating a bone surface from data provided by an ultrasound examination and to match this surface with the previous zzso zzso zzso zzso 

From a CT data set of a training model of the zzso a three-dimensional surface was extracted by global zzso zzso The same model was placed in a water zzso and ultrasound images were taken with a guided ultrasound zzso The three-dimensional surface was generated from the ultrasound data set, and the two surfaces were matched in a semiautomatic zzso 

With special zzso methods, a surface could be extracted automatically from the CT and the ultrasound data zzso From these segmented ultrasound zzso a volume data set of the model was zzso After approximate initial matching, the local matching process was completed zzso 

One of the limitations in zzso surgery is the complicated matching zzso Using special zzso a surface was extracted from the data set of an ultrasound examination and matched in a semiautomatic mode with the surface of a CT data set, zzso the matching zzso
