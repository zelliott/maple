Estimates of joint or limb zzso are commonly used in the study of how the nervous system controls posture and movement, and how that control is altered by injury to the neural or musculoskeletal zzso zzso characterizes the dynamic relationship between an imposed zzso of joint position and the zzso generated in zzso While there are many practical reasons for zzso zzso rather than its zzso zzso it is an zzso representation of the limb mechanics that can lead to difficulties in interpretation or zzso The purpose of this study was to explore the zzso nature of zzso estimates of joint zzso representations to determine how they are influenced by common experimental and zzso zzso This was accomplished by zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso derivatives to illustrate two key difficulties in the physical interpretation of zzso impulse response zzso These illustrations were provided using both simulated and experimental zzso It was found that the shape of the zzso impulse response depends critically on the selected sampling rate, and on the bandwidth and noise characteristics of the position zzso used during the zzso zzso These results provide important guidelines for designing experiments in which zzso estimates of zzso will be zzso especially when those estimates are to be used in a zzso identification zzso
