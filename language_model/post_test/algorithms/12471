Chemical principles dictate that the specific binding of a target to its complementary zzso on a DNA zzso surface, and the zzso binding between other zzso segments and the same zzso are mutually zzso We demonstrate that this mechanism can be understood by considering the competitive chemical reaction taking place on the zzso zzso Inspired by the pioneering work of Zhang and zzso we have developed a physical model for zzso signal analysis, based on possible reaction mechanisms, and implemented it with a zzso zzso zzso zzso Using data supplied by the zzso zzso zzso experiments, our model showed excellent fitting of the zzso This correlation between the predicted expression levels and the zzso zzso of test transcripts demonstrated good zzso abilities of our zzso
