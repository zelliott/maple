zzso detection of multiple targets such as zzso zzso zzso formation, DNA zzso and ethanol ambient changes was explored using localized surface zzso resonance zzso excited by metallic surface zzso The sensitivity enhancement depends on the target as well as the zzso with a maximum at zzso over a conventional structure when detecting an zzso acid SAM with an zzso structure of 200 zzso zzso The measured enhancement shows smaller zzso zzso when detecting various layered zzso while zzso zzso was much zzso The result suggests the feasibility of the efficient detection of multiple zzso at enhanced sensitivity and extends the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso for diverse zzso zzso
