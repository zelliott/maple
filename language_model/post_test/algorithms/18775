zzso procedures have become a zzso approach to the treatment of pancreatic zzso 

Our purpose was to determine the results of a therapeutic zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and conventional zzso drainage in terms of zzso feasibility and efficacy of the zzso procedure and zzso zzso 

Prospective study with a treatment zzso drawn up before the zzso zzso including either conventional zzso zzso drainage zzso conventional zzso drainage zzso or zzso zzso drainage zzso 

A total of 50 patients, including 15 women and 35 men with a mean age of 51 years, were included in this prospective zzso 

The mean size of the zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A total of 29 zzso did not zzso into the zzso wall zzso 24 zzso neither zzso nor communicated with the pancreatic zzso zzso was performed on 28 patients zzso zzso on 13 patients zzso and zzso on 8 patients zzso and zzso procedures failed in 1 zzso Technical feasibility was zzso zzso and clinical success was achieved in zzso of the cases and disappearance of the zzso in zzso of the cases without significant differences among the 3 zzso The morbidity rate was zzso (9 zzso Five zzso occurred in the zzso group and 1 in the zzso zzso One death occurred from late bleeding in the zzso zzso 

zzso of patients in this prospective study was not possible because of the different characteristics of the zzso 

With this algorithm, clinical success was achieved in 45 zzso of the cases and disappearance of the zzso in 48 zzso of the cases with a reasonable morbidity zzso In half of the cases, zzso is required for treating pancreatic zzso
