zzso the patterns of human dynamics and social interaction and the way they lead to the formation of an organized and functional society are important issues especially for zzso zzso Addressing these issues of social networks has recently become possible through large scale data analysis of mobile phone call records, which has revealed the existence of modular or community structure with many links between zzso of the same community and relatively few links between zzso of different zzso The weights of zzso zzso the number of calls between two users, and the network zzso are found correlated such that zzso links are stronger compared to the weak zzso zzso This feature is known as zzso zzso strength of weak zzso zzso In addition to this zzso community structure, the zzso patterns of human dynamics turn out to be zzso or zzso characterized by the heavy zzso distribution of time zzso between two consecutive events, zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we study how the community structure and the zzso dynamics emerge together in a simple evolving weighted network zzso The principal mechanisms behind these patterns are social interaction by zzso closure, zzso links to friends of friends and the focal closure, links to individuals sharing similar attributes or interests, and human dynamics by task handling zzso These three mechanisms have been implemented as a network model with local attachment, global attachment, and zzso zzso zzso By comprehensive zzso simulations we show that the interplay of these mechanisms leads to the emergence of heavy zzso zzso time distribution and the evolution of zzso community zzso Moreover, the zzso results are found to be in qualitative agreement with empirical analysis results from mobile phone call zzso
