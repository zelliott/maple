zzso fold zzso may physically raise zzso pressure to levels high enough to damage zzso and result in leakage of zzso This type of injury is commonly seen in benign vocal fold zzso and is not well zzso 

zzso zzso 

The relationship of zzso pressure to zzso frequency and zzso is derived and confirmed with a physical blood vessel model, then applied to published human zzso to estimate human zzso zzso 

zzso fold zzso pressure is predicted to have a zzso dependence on both frequency and zzso During speaking, the pressure may rise to over 20 zzso and may reach levels far higher for screaming and zzso Such pressure zzso are known to trigger inflammatory zzso and can lead to fluid zzso They also have the potential for zzso control with zzso 

zzso pressure likely rises significantly during vocal fold zzso and may lead to the type of injury seen in benign vocal fold zzso The results support voice therapy aimed at reducing zzso zzso More zzso zzso zzso need to be performed in a wider range of subjects before the full range of human vocal fold vascular pressures can be zzso
