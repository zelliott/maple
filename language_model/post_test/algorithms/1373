Currently available software for zzso zzso does not account for errors in both the independent and the dependent zzso In zzso measurement errors are involved in the drug zzso as well as in the zzso Instead of minimizing the sum of squared vertical errors zzso a zzso program was written to find the closest distance from a measured data point to the zzso line of an estimated zzso curve and to minimize the sum of squared perpendicular distances zzso A zzso Carlo simulation was conducted with the zzso zzso model to compare the zzso and zzso zzso The area between the true zzso relationship and the fitted curve was compared as a measure of goodness of zzso The zzso demonstrated an improvement over the zzso by zzso with small differences in the zzso estimates when the random noise level had a standard zzso of five for both concentration and zzso Consideration of errors in both zzso and effects with the zzso could lead to a more rational zzso of zzso zzso
