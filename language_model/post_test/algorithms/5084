New sequencing technologies greatly facilitate the large-scale bacterial zzso sequencing by reducing zzso However, a considerable bottleneck is in the finishing phase, where dozens to hundreds of gaps need to be zzso In this study, we constructed a web server zzso to help users automate gap closing based on comparative zzso zzso zzso evaluations showed that it significantly zzso previous methods and can produce highly accurate layout result, especially when assembling zzso that are only moderately zzso The availability of such a platform would greatly benefit the research community working on bacterial zzso zzso can be zzso at two mirror sites zzso or zzso
