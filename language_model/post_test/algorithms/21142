The ultimate objective of laser zzso zzso (and a host of specific zzso such as laser zzso contrast analysis, zzso or zzso laser zzso spatial contrast analysis, zzso laser zzso zzso contrast analysis, zzso zzso is to zzso flow zzso from the observed zzso zzso Despite numerous demonstrations over the past 25 years of such a qualitative relationship, no convincing quantitative relationship has been zzso One reason is a persistent mathematical error that has been zzso by a host of workers; another is a zzso about the proper zzso function for ordered zzso Still another hindrance has been uncertainty in the specific relationship between zzso time and local flow zzso zzso we attempt to dispel some of these errors and zzso with the intent of turning laser zzso zzso into a quantitative zzso zzso we review the underlying theory, explore the impact of various zzso models for relating measured intensity fluctuations to zzso motion, and address some of the practical issues associated with the measurement and subsequent data zzso
