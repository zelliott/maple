For patients with impaired zzso function, dosage adjustment is necessary for many zzso Adjustment with respect only to zzso parameters may be zzso 

To apply the theory of zzso and zzso to derive a mathematical model that links the zzso course and the clinical response by means of the zzso zzso zzso under the zzso zzso zzso and to use this analysis and clinical data for zzso to calculate dosage adjustments in zzso zzso 

Model parameters were estimated for the zzso and zzso effects of zzso on the basis of data from the zzso Effect parameters were calculated for various degrees of impaired zzso zzso 

Use of the model parameters gave a high correlation between the predicted and the observed zzso values for zzso efficacy and zzso When calculating dosage adjustments in zzso zzso it was possible to hold only one effect zzso or zzso constant by dosage adjustment, whereas the other changed zzso This was explained by differences between the zzso parameters for each zzso For high zzso zzso a target peak concentration of 9 zzso (for zzso should be obtained every 48 hours in advanced zzso zzso For low zzso the peak concentration should not exceed 3 zzso 

The zzso zzso could be a useful zzso surrogate marker for dosage adjustment in zzso zzso Using the zzso method, the beneficial effect can be balanced against the adverse zzso
