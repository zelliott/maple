zzso zzso zzso zzso is the problem of predicting the three-dimensional native structure of a protein given its primary structure, zzso the corresponding sequence of zzso zzso Different approaches have been proposed to model this problem, and this research explores the prediction of optimal structures using the well studied simplified lattice zzso and Polar zzso zzso particular, on the zzso square zzso We present a twofold zzso First, we devise a new upper bound for the number of contacts achievable by an zzso zzso and show that it is in several cases more stringent than the upper bound previously known in zzso Then, we present an innovative zzso that zzso the state of the art in exact approaches for the prediction of optimal structures in lattice protein model, for zzso square zzso The algorithm, called zzso and based on a heavily pruned exhaustive search, also zzso the state of the art in zzso approaches in several zzso Due to this algorithm, it is now possible to prove optimal results in the square zzso zzso for standard zzso sequences of size up to 80 zzso which were only zzso zzso Furthermore, we provide the zzso zzso all optimal zzso of such benchmark zzso which was unknown in zzso These results can be a useful tool to foster advances in further zzso
