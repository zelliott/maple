We present an zzso for computing the relative zzso zzso of the features of a three-dimensional object using either zzso scores measured at several viewpoints or zzso similarities among several object zzso This technique addresses the zzso zzso version of the direct problem of predicting zzso scores or viewpoint similarities when the object features are zzso On the basis of a linear model for the direct problem, we solve the inverse problem using the method of zzso The critical assumption we make to zzso the solution is that zzso zzso varies slowly on the surface of the zzso The salient regions derived using this assumption zzso indicate what object structures are important in human three-dimensional object perception, a domain where theories typically have been based on somewhat ad hoc zzso
