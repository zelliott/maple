We assessed the ability of two zzso to predict hand zzso from neural activity as a function of the amount of data used to determine the zzso zzso Using chronically implanted zzso zzso zzso and zzso discharge was recorded during trained step tracking and slow continuous tracking tasks in zzso zzso The effect of increasing the amount of data used to build a neural decoding model on the ability of that model to predict hand zzso accurately was zzso We evaluated how well a zzso model classified discrete reaching directions and how well a linear filter model reconstructed continuous hand positions over time within and across zzso For each of these two models we asked two questions: zzso How does zzso performance change as the amount of data the model is built upon increases? zzso How does varying the time zzso between the data used to build the model and the data used to test the model affect reconstruction? Less than 1 zzso of data for the discrete task (8 to 13 zzso and less than 3 zzso (8 to 18 zzso for the continuous task were required to build optimal zzso zzso performance was defined by a cost function we derived that reflects both the ability of the model to predict zzso accurately and the cost of taking more time to build such zzso For both the zzso zzso and the linear filter model, increasing the duration between the time of building and testing the model within a day did not cause any significant trend of degradation or improvement in zzso Linear filters built on one day and tested on neural data on a subsequent day generated zzso zzso that were not significantly different from those generated when the linear filters were tested on neural data from the initial day zzso zzso zzso These data show that only a small amount of data from a limited number of cortical zzso appears to be necessary to construct robust models to predict zzso parameters for the subsequent zzso zzso signals derived from zzso in motor zzso can be reliably acquired for use in neural prosthetic zzso zzso decoding models can be built rapidly from small numbers of cells and maintained with daily zzso zzso
