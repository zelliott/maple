zzso zzso zzso zzso is a C4 perennial grass and widely popular as an important zzso zzso To accelerate the pace of developing high yielding zzso zzso adapted to diverse environmental zzso the generation of zzso resources for this plant is zzso The large zzso size and zzso nature of zzso makes whole zzso sequencing a daunting task even with current zzso zzso the zzso landscape using next generation sequencing technologies provides a viable alternative to whole zzso sequencing in zzso 

zzso zzso libraries from zzso zzso emerging zzso flowers, and dormant seeds were zzso using Roche zzso zzso zzso technology, generating zzso reads with an average read length of zzso zzso De zzso assembly generated zzso zzso with an average length of zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso as a reference greatly improved the assembly and zzso of zzso zzso Comparative analysis of the zzso zzso zzso reads with other zzso zzso including zzso zzso rice and zzso indicated a zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated unique zzso signatures of the four zzso analyzed in this zzso More than 24,000 zzso were identified in the dormant seed zzso In zzso analysis indicated that there are more than 2000 zzso in this zzso zzso of several orphan zzso was confirmed by zzso 

We estimate that about zzso of the zzso gene space has been covered in this zzso This study nearly doubles the amount of zzso information for zzso currently in the public zzso The zzso and economical nature of second-generation sequencing technologies provide an in-depth view of the gene space of complex zzso like zzso zzso analysis of closely related members of the zzso zzso type C4 grasses such as the model system zzso zzso can serve as a viable proxy for the zzso zzso
