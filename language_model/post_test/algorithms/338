zzso sampling zzso is a recently introduced, and now widely used, technique for zzso disease prevalence in hidden zzso zzso data are collected through a zzso zzso in which current sample members recruit future sample zzso In this paper we present zzso as zzso chain zzso Carlo importance zzso and we examine the effects of community structure and the recruitment procedure on the zzso of zzso zzso Past work has assumed that the zzso of zzso estimates is primarily affected by segregation between healthy and infected zzso We examine an illustrative model to show that this is not necessarily the case, and that bottlenecks anywhere in the networks can substantially affect zzso We also show that zzso is inflated by a common design feature in which the sample members are encouraged to recruit multiple future sample zzso The paper concludes with suggestions for implementing and evaluating zzso zzso
