zzso is a hormone that regulates body weight by decreasing food intake and increasing energy zzso zzso mice carry zzso zzso and are obese and zzso zzso administration to lean and zzso mice activates a novel zzso program that zzso zzso zzso Although this response is zzso distinct from that evident after food zzso the molecular nature of these differences is as yet zzso zzso monitoring of zzso genes using zzso zzso in zzso zzso and transgenic mice expressing low levels of zzso revealed that differences in ambient zzso levels have dramatic effects on the zzso of white zzso zzso These data identified a large number of genes that are zzso expressed in zzso zzso To delineate the components of the zzso program specifically affected by zzso the level of the same zzso genes was monitored in zzso and zzso mice at various times after zzso treatment or food zzso A novel application of zzso zzso identified 8 clusters of zzso tissue genes whose expression was different between zzso treatment and food restriction in zzso mice and 10 such clusters in zzso zzso One of the clusters was zzso specifically by zzso in both zzso and zzso mice and included several genes known to be regulated by zzso Further studies confirmed that zzso decreases the levels of zzso zzso and zzso active zzso protein in white zzso zzso Future studies of the molecular basis for the apparent coordinate regulation of the other clusters of zzso genes may reveal additional mechanisms by which zzso exerts its zzso zzso
