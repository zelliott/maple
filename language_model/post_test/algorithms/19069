In both zzso and zzso imaging methods, analysis of functionally interconnected networks has typically focused on brain areas that show strong zzso in specific zzso zzso connectivity measures may be used directly to zzso network zzso independent of their level of zzso This approach requires initial cortical reference areas which may be identified based on their high level of zzso their zzso with an external reference zzso or their strong connectivity with other brain zzso zzso of how the zzso have been localized the mathematical complexity of the analysis methods zzso zzso of the accuracy and zzso of the network structure by direct comparison with the measured zzso zzso it is critical to understand how the choices of parameters and procedures used in the analysis affect the network zzso Here, using simulated and measured zzso zzso data, and Dynamic Imaging of zzso Sources zzso for connectivity analysis, we zzso the veracity of network detection at the individual and group level as a function of relevant zzso zzso Using simulations, we demonstrate that zzso measures enable accurate identification of the network structure even without external reference signals, and illustrate the zzso of this approach to real zzso We show that a valid estimate of zzso zzso is critical for reliable zzso zzso Although this study focuses on application of zzso to zzso data, many issues considered here, especially those regarding individual zzso zzso analysis, are likely to be relevant for other zzso methods and analysis approaches as zzso
