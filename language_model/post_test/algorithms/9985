The aim of this paper is to compare results from lattice zzso and zzso simulations of linear chain zzso We have systematically varied the parameters that may affect the accuracy of the lattice zzso simulations including grid resolution, temperature, zzso mass, and fluid zzso The effects of the periodic boundary conditions are minimized by an zzso correction for the different long-range interactions in periodic and zzso zzso zzso zzso results for the diffusion zzso and Rouse mode relaxation times were found to be insensitive to temperature, which suggests that effects of zzso zzso are zzso By increasing the resolution of the lattice zzso grid with respect to the zzso size, zzso results for the diffusion zzso and relaxation times were zzso these results agree with zzso dynamics to within zzso
