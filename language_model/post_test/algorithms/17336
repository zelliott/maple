The utility of zzso echo double resonance zzso zzso zzso for determining the zzso of linear peptides has been examined critically using a series of zzso and zzso zzso The focus of the present work was the evaluation of long-distance zzso 5 zzso interactions using zzso zzso zzso studies of specifically labeled zzso and synthetic zzso of the zzso zzso mating hormone show that zzso zzso zzso zzso are reliable for distances up to zzso A, and that zzso interactions can be detected for distances up to 7 zzso By contrast, zzso zzso gives reliable results only for distances shorter than zzso zzso To measure distances accurately, zzso data must be corrected for the effects of zzso zzso These corrections are particularly important for measuring long zzso which are of the greatest value for determining zzso secondary zzso We have developed a zzso shell model for calculating the effect of these background zzso The zzso studies also indicate that in a zzso powder, the zzso zzso mating zzso from zzso zzso zzso probably exists as a distribution of different turn structures around the zzso zzso This finding zzso previous solid-state zzso studies on this zzso which concluded zzso assumes a distorted zzso zzso in the zzso central region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 33 zzso zzso
