A zzso single zzso acid zzso zzso derived from zzso was incorporated within a short zzso sequence using an automated zzso zzso Novel derivatives of the zzso zzso zzso were prepared such that the zzso and its Re complex were selectively placed between a terminal zzso zzso acid and the targeting zzso zzso The products, which were zzso in zzso were characterized by mass zzso and zzso zzso The latter technique demonstrated that the structures of the targeting portions of the peptides are the same in the zzso and zzso zzso The affinities of the reported compounds for the zzso zzso zzso were subsequently determined using flow zzso and were found to be comparable to that of the parent zzso The results of this work demonstrate the feasibility and numerous benefits of using the zzso system to prepare zzso zzso and zzso zzso
