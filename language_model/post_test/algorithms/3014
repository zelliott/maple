Rapid movements of live zzso during the acquisition of zzso image stacks can result in zzso between successive image zzso The zzso of the muscles in zzso metamorphosis is an example where sporadic motion during image acquisition impede image analysis and volume zzso Most of the image stack registration zzso applied in zzso are aimed at the linear alignment of fixed zzso zzso However, live muscles are zzso objects and their zzso and relaxations represent zzso transformations that cannot be properly zzso by applying purely linear registration zzso We developed a fully automated zzso zzso stack registration zzso method that zzso the mean square error of zzso between successive image zzso The mapping function is formulated using the thin plate zzso zzso A zzso linear to zzso coarse to fine matching strategy is applied to ensure stability and fast zzso zzso structure is preserved by constraining the step size of the zzso zzso To assess the accuracy of zzso zzso we propose a new zzso method that measures geometrical features of restored zzso We tested our zzso on image stacks generated by laser scanning zzso zzso that show live muscles during the zzso stage of zzso zzso Our registration zzso is able to restore image stacks that are distorted by periodic contraction of zzso zzso assessment of registration performance agrees well with qualitative visual zzso Our zzso method is able to restore image stacks for the purpose of zzso and quantitative analysis of zzso metamorphosis and, zzso various other processes in zzso biology studied by zzso live cell zzso
