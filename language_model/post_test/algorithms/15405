zzso of zzso is presumed to reduce zzso rates in zzso zzso blood donation zzso and unnecessary providing and zzso in zzso zzso The clinical utility of published zzso in predicting zzso was zzso 

In a cohort of 195 patients undergoing total hip zzso after zzso expected zzso needs were predicted with two published zzso (A and zzso The zzso were then compared to actual zzso zzso and zzso of these zzso were varied in an attempt to improve their zzso zzso 

The optimal variation of A resulted in zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and a zzso rate of zzso units or unnecessary zzso of zzso compared to zzso and zzso respectively, for the original zzso The original version of zzso B resulted in zzso zzso of zzso and a zzso rate or unnecessary zzso of zzso The former could be improved by a variation of the zzso to zzso Comparing the optimal variations of both zzso the more elaborate zzso A reduced overall zzso risk significantly better zzso zzso The two zzso were not statistically different in reducing resource consumption zzso zzso 

Although the zzso utility of zzso A was significantly better for reducing overall zzso risk, both zzso were unable to zzso identify patients who would benefit from zzso or zzso The zzso could not increase the percentage of zzso patients zzso or the percentage of zzso patients zzso in the zzso zzso Furthermore, they could neither reduce zzso risk nor resource zzso
