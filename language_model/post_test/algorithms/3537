zzso resuscitation from zzso shock is intended to abolish zzso disorders and to restore adequate tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso oxygen carrier zzso with zzso zzso zzso fluid resuscitation from severe zzso shock using zzso was expected to improve zzso pressure and tissue zzso of zzso and zzso 

In 20 zzso domestic pigs with an zzso induced coronary zzso shock zzso zzso pressure 45 zzso was induced by controlled withdrawal of blood and maintained for 60 zzso zzso resuscitation zzso of the plasma volume withdrawn during zzso was performed with either zzso zzso zzso group, zzso zzso 10) or zzso human serum zzso zzso zzso matched to zzso zzso group, zzso zzso zzso zzso of resuscitation was followed by a zzso observation zzso Regional blood flow to the zzso and the zzso was measured by use of the radioactive zzso method at zzso after shock and 60 zzso after fluid zzso 

All animals zzso zzso with zzso survived the zzso observation period, while zzso control animals died within 20 zzso due to zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso survivors, zzso and zzso of zzso animals revealed lower total and regional organ zzso and regional oxygen zzso Renal and pancreatic blood flow zzso was higher in the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso afforded superior zzso zzso but impaired regional zzso of the zzso and the zzso
