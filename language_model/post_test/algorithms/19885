zzso the diffusion properties of cortical tissue is complicated by zzso zzso in the relative locations of zzso and zzso Here we extend methods of measuring the average diffusion properties of zzso and zzso structures after they have been aligned to a common template of cortical surface zzso zzso zzso image zzso data were gathered from 82 young subjects and zzso with high-resolution zzso images that had been inflated and zzso to a zzso unified zzso coordinate system based on zzso We analyzed fractional zzso zzso mean zzso zzso and the novel quantity of cortical primary diffusion direction zzso at five surfaces parallel to the zzso zzso spanning approximately 5 zzso from the zzso surface into white zzso zzso increased with increasing depth, whereas MD and zzso were zzso There were highly significant and reliable regional differences in zzso MD and zzso as well as systematic differences between cortical zzso and between the two zzso The influence of nearby cortical spinal fluid zzso local cortical zzso and zzso and zzso depth was also zzso We found that zzso correlated significantly with cortical zzso and zzso depth, while MD was strongly influenced by nearby zzso The measurement of zzso MD and zzso near the cortical surface zzso the organization of fiber projections to and from the zzso
