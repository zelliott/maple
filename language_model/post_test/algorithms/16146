We aimed to determine practical constraints on the zzso of the spatial extent of zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso of spatial extent is a zzso for accurate models of electrical activity, allows one to estimate current density, and enables zzso monitoring of functional recovery following zzso The output of an zzso zzso is maximum when the correct source model is used, so that the spatial extent of a source can in principal be determined through evaluation of different source models with the zzso Here, we simulated zzso zzso data using sources of varying spatial zzso that followed the cortical zzso These data were subsequently used to estimate the spatial extent of generic disc elements without knowledge of the underlying surface, and we compared these results to estimates based on cortical surface geometry (with and without error in surface zzso We found that zzso source models are too simplistic, particularly for areas with high zzso For areas with low zzso spatial extent was underestimated, although on average there was a linear relationship between the true and estimated zzso In contrast, cortical surface models gave accurate predictions of spatial zzso However, adding small errors zzso zzso to the estimated location of the cortical surface abolished this relationship between true and estimated extent, zzso that accurate zzso is needed with such zzso Our results show that models exploiting surface information are necessary in order to model spatial extent and in turn current density, but in order to render such models zzso in practical situations, the accuracy of the cortical surface model itself needs to zzso
