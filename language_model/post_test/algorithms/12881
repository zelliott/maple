We theoretically investigate coupled zzso structures which combine the characteristics of both directly coupled zzso cavities zzso and a zzso integrated spaced sequence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in a single and zzso zzso unit are zzso derived based on zzso zzso It is found that zzso zzso units show a special zzso zzso zzso This structure shows an index changing sensitivity of zzso about two orders higher than that of the single zzso zzso which is promising for index sensor zzso A unique frequency zzso method of zzso like zzso is also found in the zzso zzso zzso The multiple coupled zzso unit structure demonstrates zzso for applications of zzso optical filter and slow light, whereas for the latter it shows much higher group delay than that of zzso and zzso with the same zzso
