The authors evaluated a modular zzso diagnosis zzso method for mass detection that uses zzso of features in three zzso zzso level, zzso and directional zzso Their objectives were to improve the sensitivity of detection and reduce the zzso zzso detection zzso 

The directional zzso transform zzso method, which uses both zzso and zzso zzso zzso to improve image zzso and zzso of suspicious areas and to extract both zzso and directional texture features, was evaluated with a previously reported image database containing 50 normal and 45 abnormal digitized zzso zzso The zzso contained all mass types and included 16 minimal zzso This method was compared with the zzso random field zzso method to avoid issues related to case selection zzso zzso receiver operating characteristic zzso were compared for both zzso and zzso zzso 

For the zzso method, the sensitivity was zzso and the zzso detection rate was zzso zzso findings per zzso For the zzso method, the sensitivity was zzso and the zzso detection rate was zzso zzso findings per zzso 

The zzso method applied to the full zzso image is automatic and independent of mass zzso The zzso of masses as performed with this method may potentially allow visual interpretation according to American College of zzso zzso
