To calculate zzso profiles for zzso correction of zzso and primary zzso zzso 

zzso Palmer Eye Institute, University of Miami, Miami, Florida, zzso 

The primary zzso aberrations of the zzso surfaces of an zzso eye model were calculated before and after simulated zzso for correction of zzso ranging from 0 to 10 zzso The zzso zzso to correct primary zzso aberration and the corresponding zzso profiles were also zzso 

The zzso zzso factor that produces zero primary zzso aberration ranges from zzso to zzso The calculated zzso profiles are zzso in first zzso and the zzso depth varies zzso with the amount of zzso To control residual primary zzso aberration with a tolerance of one-quarter zzso the precision of the zzso must range from zzso to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso topography can be used to calculate zzso for the correction of zzso and primary zzso zzso zzso control of zzso zzso aberration appears to be feasible in zzso
