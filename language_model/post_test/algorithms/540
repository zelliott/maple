Set enrichment zzso methods have become commonplace tools applied to the analysis and interpretation of biological zzso The statistical techniques are used to identify zzso biases within lists of zzso zzso or zzso The goal is to discover the shared functions or properties of the biological items represented within the zzso Application of these methods can provide great biological insight, including the discovery of participation in the same biological activity or pathway, shared interacting genes or regulators, common cellular zzso or association with zzso The methods require ordered or zzso lists of biological items as zzso understanding of the reference set from which the lists were selected, zzso zzso describing the items, and a statistical zzso to assess bias of each zzso Due to the complexity of most zzso and the number of calculations performed, computer software is almost always used for execution of the algorithm, as well as for presentation of the zzso This chapter will provide an overview of the statistical methods used to perform an enrichment zzso zzso for assembly of the requisite information will be zzso with a focus on careful definition of the sets used by the statistical zzso The need for multiple test correction when working with large libraries of zzso is emphasized, and we outline several options for performing the zzso Finally, interpreting the results of such analysis will be discussed along with examples of recent research utilizing the zzso
