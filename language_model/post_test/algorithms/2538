zzso equations for body composition analysis using zzso zzso zzso in zzso obese zzso subjects are zzso Thus, our aim was zzso new equations from physical and zzso parameters to estimate zzso and zzso body composition zzso subjects, with zzso X-ray zzso as the reference zzso 

A zzso study on 159 Caucasian zzso subjects zzso zzso age zzso zzso zzso years, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso divided in two groups was zzso model building cohort zzso zzso zzso and model validation cohort zzso 0 zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to develop specific fat free mass zzso and fat mass zzso zzso 

zzso body weight, and zzso accounted, respectively, for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso in the two zzso Using the new zzso the mean difference between the zzso and zzso estimates was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso p 0 zzso and the resulting limits of agreement were zzso and zzso zzso Similarly, good estimates of zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso and zzso parameters could be obtained from weight, zzso and waist and hip zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso p zzso zzso 

The new equations derived from physical and zzso parameters provide accurate estimates of body composition in zzso zzso
