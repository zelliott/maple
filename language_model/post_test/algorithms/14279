A lightweight zzso zzso zzso array was designed and built for cardiac zzso It comprises an anterior array of 21 copper rings (75 zzso zzso and a zzso array of 11 rings zzso zzso zzso that are arranged in zzso zzso so as to zzso nearest neighbors, and curved around the left side of the zzso Imaging experiments on zzso and human volunteers show that it yields superior performance relative to an zzso cardiac array as well as a zzso zzso array for both traditional zzso cardiac imaging and zzso parallel imaging with acceleration factors as high as zzso
