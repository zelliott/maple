zzso the relationship between an zzso zzso sequence and its zzso is a fundamental challenge that remains largely zzso zzso predicting microbial zzso solely based on zzso features will allow us to zzso relevant zzso characteristics when the availability of a zzso sequence precedes experimental zzso a scenario that is favored by the advent of novel zzso and single cell sequencing zzso 

We present a novel approach to predict the zzso of zzso directly from their protein domain zzso Our zzso machine learning approach provides high prediction accuracy of relevant zzso such as zzso oxygen requirement or spore zzso Moreover, the set of zzso zzso provides biological insight into the underlying zzso relationship and enables zzso hypotheses on the possible functions of zzso zzso 

Fast and accurate prediction of microbial zzso based on zzso protein domain content is feasible and has the potential to provide novel biological zzso First results of a systematic check for zzso errors indicate that our approach may also be applied to zzso correction and completion of the existing zzso zzso
