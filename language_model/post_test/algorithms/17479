As zzso complex data become more common, new zzso schemes tailored to those data are zzso In this paper we present a scheme for zzso diffusion zzso magnetic resonance zzso data, and more generally zzso data defined by a direction map and one or several magnitude zzso The scheme is divided in two zzso First, a zzso method is proposed to restore direction fields with preservation of zzso Its theoretical aspects are zzso as well as its application to the direction field that defines the main orientation of the diffusion zzso The second step makes use of an zzso diffusion process to zzso the magnitude zzso The main idea is that for a range of data it is possible to use the restored direction as a prior to drive the zzso process in a way that preserves zzso and respects the local zzso of the magnitude zzso We show that zzso diffusion is a convenient framework to implement that idea, and define a zzso process for the magnitude maps from our zzso zzso Both steps are zzso on synthetic and real diffusion zzso magnetic resonance zzso
