To evaluate the use of zzso for the zzso detection of maternal zzso dysfunction and prediction of subsequent development of zzso zzso zzso 

This was a zzso study of maternal plasma samples collected at zzso zzso gestation from 30 women who had subsequently developed zzso requiring delivery before 34 weeks and 60 unaffected zzso Nuclear magnetic zzso zzso zzso was used to identify and zzso zzso changes in cases versus zzso Both genetic computing and standard statistical analyses were performed to predict the development of zzso from the zzso zzso alone as well as the combination of zzso zzso with maternal characteristics and zzso zzso artery zzso zzso index zzso 

zzso differences between cases and controls were found for 20 zzso A combination of four of these zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso appeared highly zzso of zzso with an estimated detection rate of zzso at a zzso rate zzso of zzso The zzso performance was improved by the addition of zzso artery zzso zzso and fetal zzso length zzso and with an estimated detection rate of zzso at a zzso of zzso 

A profound change in the zzso zzso profile was noted in women who had subsequently developed zzso zzso zzso zzso appeared highly sensitive for first zzso prediction of early onset zzso
