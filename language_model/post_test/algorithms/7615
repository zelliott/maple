Respiratory motion compensation using zzso zzso gating with a 5 zzso gating window is conventionally used for zzso cardiac zzso Because of the narrow gating window, scan efficiency is low resulting in long scan times, especially for patients with irregular breathing zzso In this work, a new retrospective motion compensation zzso is presented to reduce the scan time for zzso cardiac zzso that increasing the gating window to 15 zzso without compromising image zzso The proposed zzso zzso zzso for zzso cardiac motion by zzso the sharpness of the zzso To evaluate this technique, two coronary zzso zzso with zzso zzso resolution were acquired from 11 healthy subjects zzso zzso 25 zzso 9 zzso one using a zzso with a 5 zzso gating window acquired in zzso zzso zzso zzso and one with a 15 zzso gating window acquired in zzso zzso zzso zzso The images acquired with a 15 zzso gating window were corrected using the proposed zzso and compared to the zzso images acquired with the 5 and 15 zzso gating zzso The image quality score, zzso and length of the three major coronary arteries were equivalent between the corrected images and the images acquired with a 5 zzso gating window zzso zzso zzso while the scan time was reduced by a factor of zzso
