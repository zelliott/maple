We consider a simple model to study the dynamics of zzso zzso in a population of zzso The zzso patterns observed during an epidemic in Italy are reconstructed and key parameters of the model are estimated from field zzso In particular, we calculate the basic zzso ratio R zzso a threshold value for zzso density for the occurrence of an epidemic and the speed of propagation of the epidemic zzso The model is then used to obtain indications on the effect of zzso as a possible control measure in a closed population and extended to zzso the spatial diffusion of the zzso Our results are in agreement with zzso epidemiology and zzso and suggest that intervention could be zzso in reducing the impact of an zzso
