Adult growth hormone zzso zzso is characterized by obesity and associated with increased zzso concentration and decreased zzso zzso Growth hormone replacement zzso results in a decrease in zzso concentration and increase in zzso zzso followed by reduction in body fat mass zzso In both health and zzso women exhibit relatively higher zzso zzso compared to zzso The effect of gender on zzso rhythm and pulse parameters in zzso is yet to be defined and the gender difference in the response of zzso zzso pattern to zzso has not been zzso Therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of gender on zzso and pulse parameters of zzso zzso in zzso and examine the gender variation in response of these parameters to zzso 

A zzso open treatment design study to determine the effect of gender on zzso rhythm and pulse parameters in zzso and treated zzso zzso was commenced at a daily dose of zzso zzso and zzso up by increments of zzso zzso at zzso intervals to achieve and maintain zzso zzso between the median and upper end of the age-related reference zzso 

Twelve patients (six men, six zzso with severe zzso following zzso surgery, defined as peak zzso response zzso 9 zzso to provocative testing were zzso All patients required additional zzso replacement hormones following zzso surgery and were on optimal doses at zzso 

Plasma zzso was measured at zzso intervals for 24 zzso before and 1 month after initiation of zzso zzso analysis was used to determine the zzso rhythm zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso used for pulse zzso Body composition was measured using zzso zzso 

zzso was higher in women than men at both visits zzso zzso zzso but there was no significant change in zzso in either gender following 1 month of zzso Women had a higher mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and pulse zzso both before and after zzso zzso zzso zzso Following treatment, mean zzso concentration and zzso decreased significantly in both men and women zzso zzso zzso with no significant difference in percentage change between the zzso Pulse frequency increased and duration decreased significantly after zzso in both groups, without any significant gender zzso zzso and zzso zzso were similar in both genders at baseline zzso zzso zzso However, after 1 month zzso the increase in both zzso was greater in men than women zzso zzso zzso and men had significantly higher zzso and zzso zzso than women zzso zzso zzso 

As in healthy individuals, zzso levels were higher in women with zzso than men, both prior to and after zzso zzso in zzso zzso and increase in zzso zzso following 1 month of zzso treatment were similar in both zzso Changes in zzso zzso parameters appeared to occur without any significant decrease in zzso suggesting a regulatory role for zzso Additionally, the action of zzso on zzso zzso pattern does not appear to be zzso by zzso Our data suggest that changes in zzso concentration and rhythm parameters following zzso are independent of zzso
