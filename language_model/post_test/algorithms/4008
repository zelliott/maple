There is accumulating evidence that at current acquisition resolutions for zzso zzso zzso the vast majority of white matter zzso contains zzso zzso referring to complex fiber zzso in which multiple and distinctly differently oriented fiber populations zzso zzso zzso based techniques are appealing to characterize this zzso zzso signal zzso as they provide a balanced zzso between constraints on the required hardware performance and acquisition time on the one hand, and the reliability of the reconstructed fiber orientation distribution function zzso on the other zzso Recent findings, however, suggest that an inaccurate zzso of the response function zzso which represents the zzso signal profile of a single fiber orientation, can lead to the detection of zzso zzso zzso which, in turn, can have a severe impact on zzso zzso Currently, the zzso of this zzso is either zzso or estimated from selected zzso that have a fractional zzso zzso value above a zzso zzso For both approaches, however, there are zzso settings that affect the zzso and, consequently, zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, these settings still rely on the zzso diffusion zzso which may not be the appropriate model, especially at high zzso In this work, we circumvent these issues for zzso zzso by excluding zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Our approach is evaluated with simulations and applied to in zzso and ex zzso data sets with different acquisition zzso The results demonstrate that with the proposed method the zzso can be zzso in a robust and automated way without needing to define ad-hoc zzso threshold zzso Our framework zzso the use of zzso zzso approaches in data sets in which it is not straightforward to define zzso settings a zzso
