In the past, the only critical point of distinction in the pathological diagnosis of lung cancer was between small cell and zzso cell lung cancer zzso The emergence of new targeted therapies and clinical trials demonstrating differing efficacy and toxicity of treatments according to specific zzso zzso of zzso has resulted in an increasing need for improvements in pathological zzso zzso distinction between zzso and zzso cell zzso is now critical as zzso zzso has the potential to influence clinical decision making and impact on patient zzso While zzso criteria remain the most important feature to distinguish zzso zzso use of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso can be of assistance in difficult small biopsy zzso With the emergence of selective zzso zzso targeting zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso there is a corresponding need to identify the subset of zzso zzso specific genetic zzso associated with sensitivity to these agents, almost all of which are found in zzso In this review, the importance of accurately zzso zzso is discussed, along with a suggested approach for distinguishing zzso zzso in small biopsy zzso The significance of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and the impact of these zzso on pathology and clinical practice are also zzso
