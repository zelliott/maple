An increased risk of fracture in patients with primary zzso zzso compared to the general population has been reported, but available data are zzso 

The aim of the study was to evaluate the rate of zzso fractures zzso by zzso zzso zzso in zzso women with sporadic zzso and compare the results with a control zzso 

A zzso study was performed at a referral zzso 

A total of 150 consecutive patients and 300 healthy women matched for age and zzso age participated in the zzso 

zzso were detected in 37 of 150 zzso patients and 12 of 300 zzso controls zzso zzso zzso The majority of zzso were zzso zzso multiple zzso zzso analysis showed that in zzso patients zzso spine bone mineral density was the only variable independently associated with the prevalence of zzso zzso zzso zzso The rate of fracture was higher in symptomatic zzso than zzso zzso patients, but this difference was not statistically significant zzso zzso zzso Among zzso patients, fracture rate was significantly higher in those who met the criteria for zzso zzso than in those who did not zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared to controls, the fracture rate was significantly higher in patients with symptomatic and zzso zzso who met the criteria for surgery zzso zzso zzso but not in those who did not meet the criteria zzso zzso zzso 

zzso rate is increased in zzso women with zzso compared to controls, independently of whether they are classified as symptomatic or zzso The question of whether the finding of mild zzso zzso in the latter represents an indication for zzso surgery remains to be zzso
