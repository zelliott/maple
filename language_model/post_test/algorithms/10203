zzso zzso transfer imaging zzso using zzso zzso echo sequences with zzso zzso zzso can be a time-consuming zzso A method is presented for selection of an optimum experimental design for quantitative zzso transfer imaging based on the zzso reduction of a discrete sampling of the zzso The zzso of the technique is demonstrated for human brain white matter imaging at zzso T and 3 zzso and optimal designs are produced to target specific model zzso The optimal number of zzso and the zzso ratio required for stable zzso zzso are also zzso In zzso imaging results demonstrate that this optimal design approach substantially improves zzso map zzso The zzso method presented here provides an advantage over free form optimal design methods, in that pragmatic design constraints are readily zzso In particular, the presented method avoids zzso and repeated measures in the final experimental design, an attractive feature for the purpose of zzso transfer model zzso The zzso optimal design technique is general and can be applied to any method of quantitative zzso transfer zzso
