We and others have identified several hundred ancestry zzso markers zzso with large zzso frequency differences between different major ancestral zzso For this study, a panel of 199 widely distributed zzso was used to examine a diverse set of zzso DNA samples including zzso European Americans, West zzso East zzso zzso African Americans, zzso Mexican Americans, Puerto zzso and South zzso Analysis using a zzso zzso zzso zzso showed grouping of individuals with similar ethnic identity without any zzso other than the zzso zzso and showed zzso proportions that clearly distinguished different individuals of mixed zzso Additional analyses showed that, for the majority of samples, the predicted ethnic identity corresponded with the zzso ethnicity at high probability zzso zzso zzso Overall, the study demonstrates that zzso can provide a useful adjunct to forensic medicine, zzso and disease studies in which major ancestry or ethnic affiliation might be linked to specific zzso
