We propose a new zzso learning scheme to extend relevance learning zzso zzso zzso an efficient zzso zzso algorithm, toward a general zzso zzso By introducing a full zzso of relevance factors in the distance measure, correlations between different features and their importance for the zzso scheme can be taken into account and zzso and general metric adaptation takes place during zzso In comparison to the weighted zzso metric used in zzso and its variations, a full zzso is more powerful to represent the internal structure of the data zzso Large margin zzso bounds can be transferred to this case, leading to bounds that are independent of the input zzso This also holds for local metrics attached to each prototype, which zzso to zzso zzso decision zzso The zzso is tested in comparison to alternative learning zzso zzso schemes using an artificial data set, a benchmark zzso problem from the zzso zzso and a problem from zzso the recognition of zzso sites for zzso zzso
