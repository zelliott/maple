One major objective of total body zzso zzso treatments is to deliver a uniform dose in the entire body of the zzso Looking at zzso dose zzso for constant speed zzso and variable speed zzso translating couch zzso treatments, dose uniformity and the effect of body zzso were zzso This study was based on retrospective dose calculations of 10 patients treated with a translating couch zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso treatments have been zzso with zzso treatment planning system in homogeneous zzso and zzso zzso dose calculation zzso A specific beam model was implemented in zzso to allow an accurate dose calculation adapted for zzso special zzso Better dose zzso were obtained with zzso treatments compared to zzso cases including smaller zzso zzso Large differences between zzso and zzso dose calculations were observed in the brain, zzso arms, legs, and lateral parts of the abdomen zzso between zzso mean values up to zzso zzso also showed that dose zzso for patients treated with zzso zzso greatly depend on the patient zzso especially for pediatric and overweight zzso Looking at zzso dose calculations, zzso zzso were found in zzso regions zzso zzso while zzso zzso were found in zzso regions zzso zzso Overall, zzso and zzso dose zzso showed more hot spots than zzso and were greatly dependent on patient zzso zzso zzso treatments allow a simple zzso process but lead to less dose uniformity due to the patient zzso zzso zzso treatments require more complex dose zzso but lead to a better dose uniformity independent of the patient zzso Finally, this study showed that zzso should be considered in dose calculations in order to obtain a better zzso and, therefore, to improve dose zzso
