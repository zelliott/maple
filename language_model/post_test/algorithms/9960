We propose a zzso tracking integral imaging system for viewing angle and viewing zone zzso In the tracking integral imaging system, the pickup angles in each zzso lens in the lens array are decided by the positions of viewers, which means the zzso image can be made for each viewer to provide wider viewing angle and larger viewing zzso Our tracking integral imaging system is implemented with an infrared camera and infrared light emitting zzso which can track the viewers' exact positions zzso For multiple viewers to watch integrated three-dimensional images in the tracking integral imaging system, it is needed to formulate the relationship between the multiple viewers' positions and the zzso zzso We analyzed the relationship and the conditions for the multiple viewers, and verified them by the zzso of zzso tracking integral imaging zzso
