To develop an zzso zzso stepping zzso as an adjunct to zzso zzso zzso zzso that automatically adjusts the stepping size by considering the zzso zzso to properly trace fiber zzso in regions with different degrees of zzso zzso 

A theoretical investigation of the zzso zzso was performed to assess the degree of zzso of the propagation zzso toward the major zzso zzso generated zzso (one with curved fibers and the other with crossing zzso at wide ranges of zzso ratio zzso and human brain images obtained in zzso were used to test the performance of the zzso stepping zzso 

The degree of zzso was found to be zzso related to the stepping zzso A small stepping size was advantageous for tracing single curved fiber zzso whereas a large stepping size was beneficial for passing through fiber crossing zzso The performance of the zzso stepping zzso was superior to fixed stepping in both situations, leading to an approximately zzso zzso of zzso in curved fibers and a nearly zzso successful tracking rate in crossing fibers at typical zzso Human brain images demonstrated similar zzso 

The zzso stepping zzso is a helpful adjunct to zzso zzso
