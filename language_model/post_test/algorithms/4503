zzso and zzso developed the first zzso zzso for the zzso problem of sorting signed zzso zzso Their zzso determines the minimum number of zzso required for rearranging a zzso to another zzso only in the absence of gene zzso However, zzso often account for zzso of a zzso In this paper, we show how to extend zzso and zzso approach to deal with zzso with zzso zzso We propose a new zzso zzso to zzso the nearest reversal distance between two zzso with zzso families via zzso zzso zzso The experimental results on both synthetic and real biological data demonstrate that the proposed zzso is able to find the reversal distance with high zzso
