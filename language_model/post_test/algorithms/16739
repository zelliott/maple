The mechanism by which the hinge regions of zzso hormone receptors couple hormone binding to zzso of downstream zzso is not clearly zzso In the present study, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso directed against the zzso zzso zzso domain were used to zzso role of the hinge region in zzso zzso zzso zzso which identifies the zzso junction zzso zzso increased the affinity of zzso for the hormone while zzso decreasing its zzso whereas zzso zzso recognizing zzso 7-9 zzso zzso acted as a zzso inhibitor of zzso stimulating hormone zzso zzso zzso of zzso was sensitive to the zzso changes caused by the zzso and zzso zzso and exhibited differential effects on hormone binding and response of these zzso By studying the effects of these zzso on zzso and zzso zzso of zzso stimulating hormone zzso zzso this study confirms the zzso inverse zzso role played by the hinge region and maps the interactions between zzso hinge region and zzso responsible for maintenance of the zzso in its zzso zzso zzso studies on the zzso interactions suggest that zzso zzso is an zzso insurmountable zzso and zzso initiation of the hormone induced zzso changes in the hinge region, whereas zzso zzso acts as a partial zzso that recognizes a zzso zzso critical for zzso of hormone binding to zzso zzso The hinge region, probably in close proximity with the zzso in the zzso complex, acts as a zzso switch between hormone binding and zzso zzso
