Because the bulk of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of repetitive zzso sequencing efforts are being targeted to its zzso zzso Traditional assembly programs are inadequate for this approach because they are zzso for a uniform sampling of the zzso and inherently lack the ability to differentiate highly similar zzso 

We report the development of zzso tools for the accurate assembly of the zzso zzso This software, which is based on innovative parallel zzso to ensure zzso assembled zzso zzso survey sequences fragments in 4 h using 64 zzso III zzso zzso processors of a commodity zzso zzso innovations are used to reduce the number of zzso alignments significantly without sacrificing zzso zzso pair information was used to estimate the error rate for improved differentiation of zzso versus sequencing zzso The assembly was also used to evaluate the effectiveness of various filtering strategies and thereby provide information that can be used to focus subsequent sequencing zzso
