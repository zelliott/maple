An zzso model consisting of adult plants and two types of seeds zzso and zzso is considered and successfully tested using experimental data available for some invasive weeds zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from their native and exotic zzso The model accounts for probability distribution functions zzso for times of zzso growth, death and zzso on two dimensions, so the general zzso of individuals is considered with high level of zzso Our work provides for the first time, for a model containing all that zzso information, explicit relationship conditions for the invasive success and expressions for the speed of invasive fronts, which can be useful tools for zzso zzso The expressions derived allow us to prove that the different zzso showed by the weeds in their native zzso ranges can explain their corresponding zzso zzso zzso
