zzso molecular biology research has tended to reduce biological pathways to composite units studied as isolated parts of the cellular zzso With the advent of high zzso zzso that can capture thousands of data points, and powerful zzso approaches, the reality of studying cellular processes at a systems level is upon zzso As these approaches yield massive zzso systems level analyses have drawn upon other fields such as engineering and zzso adapting zzso and statistical approaches to decipher relationships between zzso zzso by high quality zzso and zzso one can begin the process of zzso zzso The findings from such approaches are often surprising and beyond normal zzso We discuss four classes of zzso systems used to model genetic regulatory zzso The discussion is divided into continuous and discrete models, as well as deterministic and zzso model zzso For each combination of these categories, a model is presented and discussed in the context of the zzso cell cycle, illustrating how different types of questions can be addressed by different model zzso
