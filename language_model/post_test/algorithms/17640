The new zzso zzso zzso or zzso acid presents a structural zzso to zzso acid zzso zzso zzso of zzso was studied in the presence and absence of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso at different zzso zzso and different temperatures zzso 30, and 37 degrees zzso using a zzso zzso The influence of zzso zzso concentration upon alkaline zzso at 25 degrees C is also zzso At constant zzso zzso constant zzso decreased with increasing zzso at zzso greater than the zzso and also decreased with increasing zzso at constant zzso and zzso To explain the effect of zzso zzso of zzso upon alkaline zzso the zzso zzso exchange model was zzso The values of the zzso properties such as the critical zzso zzso the degree of zzso zzso and the neutralized fraction of the head group obtained by zzso zzso were determined zzso
