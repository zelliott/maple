The high zzso of connectivity networks zzso the development of methods identifying the connectivity building blocks that not only characterize the patterns of brain pathology but also reveal representative population zzso In this paper, we present a zzso component analysis framework for learning localized and sparse zzso patterns of connectivity zzso by zzso them into two sets of zzso and zzso zzso In order to obtain components that are designed towards zzso population differences, we exploit the geometry of the population by using a zzso scheme that zzso zzso properties as well as maintaining the underlying distance between distant zzso in the original and the projected zzso The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated by applying it to two clinical studies using connectivity zzso derived from zzso to study a population of subjects with zzso as well as a zzso study of structural brain connectivity that extracts gender zzso
