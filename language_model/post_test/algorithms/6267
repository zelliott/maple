A novel approach toward neural networks modeling is presented in the zzso It is unique in the fact that allows zzso weights to change according to changes of some environmental factors even after completing the learning zzso The models of zzso zzso zzso one- and zzso zzso net are zzso with basic learning zzso and examples of zzso The zzso zzso dimension of a zzso zzso is zzso as well as VC dimension of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso properties are discussed and compared with the properties of traditional zzso zzso of applications to zzso and control problems are also outlined and an example zzso
