zzso in the primary sensory zzso may contribute to chronic zzso zzso zzso channels play a central role in zzso zzso and sensory zzso are rich in zzso calcium channels zzso However, the zzso function of these channels is zzso Their possible role in rebound burst firing makes them a candidate for increased zzso after zzso zzso 

This study uses pharmacological methods to isolate zzso in cells from the zzso root zzso of zzso and zzso rats, including the blockade of zzso zzso channels with zzso and selective zzso zzso were examined with conventional whole cell patch clamp zzso zzso 

After chronic zzso injury of the peripheral zzso zzso was significantly reduced compared to sham rats as shown by a zzso reduction in peak current density and an zzso reduction in total calcium zzso A zzso shift in the zzso dependence of zzso and an increase in the rate of zzso and zzso appear to cause this reduction of zzso Either zzso or zzso zzso of zzso applied in the bath to normal zzso root zzso cells during current clamp significantly and zzso increased zzso 

These results suggest that loss of zzso may contribute to decreased spike frequency adaptation and increased zzso after injury to sensory zzso Through decreased zzso influx, the cell becomes less stable and more likely to initiate or transmit bursts of action zzso zzso zzso of zzso currents at the zzso root zzso may be a potential method of therapeutic zzso
