zzso reveals brain electrical activities with high zzso zzso Yet, multiple implicit variables may be involved in limited event related potential zzso zzso Special zzso techniques are needed to recover these zzso In the study of zzso visual spatial attention, we may obtain the zzso in valid cued zzso invalid cued zzso and neutral cued zzso zzso Usually, the effect of zzso attention is zzso by the zzso model with the assumption that zzso and N are zzso Yet, they should be zzso Treating zzso as a function of zzso a linear model zzso zzso W + zzso is zzso where W and G are implicit in the zzso zzso G is the gain control on the neutral zzso zzso G and W are constant over a local brain region, we may use the Total zzso Square zzso zzso to zzso their zzso The values of W and G zzso from an zzso attention experiment data show that multiple implicit variables are involved in obtained zzso Here G acts as a zzso sensory zzso on the neutral zzso and W is related to possible newly involved neural zzso The parameters derived from the new linear model also suggest that there are different mechanisms involved in zzso attention and voluntary allocation of zzso
