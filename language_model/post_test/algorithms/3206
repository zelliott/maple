Phase sensing zzso of spectral domain optical zzso zzso zzso have demonstrated the ability to measure zzso zzso and spatial profiles of zzso However, the phase information suffers from a zzso ambiguity that limits observations of larger sample zzso to lengths less than half the source center zzso We introduce a synthetic wavelength phase zzso technique in zzso that uses spectral zzso and zzso the zzso zzso providing accurate zzso of sample motion with information gained from standard zzso zzso We demonstrate this technique by using a common path zzso of zzso and correctly measure phase profiles from a phantom phase object and human zzso cheek cells which produce multiple wrapping zzso Using a synthetic wavelength for phase zzso could prove useful in zzso or other phase based zzso of zzso
