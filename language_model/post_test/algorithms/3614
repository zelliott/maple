For patients with coronary artery disease and left zzso dysfunction who undergo zzso it is important to estimate the left zzso ejection fraction zzso improvement after zzso as this is a strong indicator of the long-term zzso Identification of viable segments from zzso has been considered a zzso sign of zzso zzso However, a quantitative relation between zzso function recovery and global ejection fraction improvement has not been zzso There is a clinical need to determine parameters that are zzso to zzso zzso A zzso left zzso model is proposed to establish the relation between zzso zzso function and zzso based on a zzso zzso zzso Model results show that zzso improvement is directly related to the contraction ratio in normal segments and a weighted sum of the number of viable segments that recover to normal or zzso which is equal to a weighted sum of the change in wall motion zzso This new combined zzso is a better predictor of the amount of zzso improvement than the total number of viable segments or zzso ejection zzso The zzso value of the model was illustrated in a group of four patients with coronary artery disease who underwent zzso
