We report the first of a series of studies on the obstruction factor zzso in zzso zzso zzso Here, using narrow zzso zzso standards we examine how the zzso obstruction factor zzso depends individually on a number of zzso properties, column zzso and zzso zzso Far from being constant, zzso is seen to vary with zzso zzso mass and zzso as well as with the pore size and particle size of the column packing material, sometimes in seemingly counterintuitive zzso Over the limited temperature range accessible to our equipment, however, no statistically significant change in zzso with temperature was zzso The results presented should be zzso to forms of packed column zzso other than zzso The latter technique, however, presents a convenient test bed for quantitative determination of the obstruction factor, due to minimized zzso mass transfer and zzso diffusion contributions to band broadening in most forms of zzso
