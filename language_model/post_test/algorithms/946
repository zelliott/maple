The zzso ratio zzso was proposed for measurement of noise in sustained zzso A generalized zzso is described here for removing the dependence on the data offset and for reducing the influence of jitter and zzso In addition, a new zzso is proposed that zzso periodic zzso zzso are presented that can be zzso in a single pass through the data under certain zzso thus simplifying the zzso of an efficient analysis zzso A mathematical analysis of the effect of small errors in zzso zzso is zzso The analysis indicates that the sensitivity to zzso errors depends on the preponderance of zzso zzso and significant zzso is predicted for zzso and zzso zzso A method for correcting zzso and zzso errors in zzso markers is zzso The method is shown to be effective at reducing zzso errors for all but the most severely zzso zzso Examples of the use of this method for zzso zzso are zzso Finally, a comparison with recent work by zzso zzso Speech zzso zzso 30, zzso zzso is zzso
