Taking advantage of the current rapid development in imaging systems and computer vision zzso we present zzso a zzso zzso platform for plant growth modeling and functional analysis, which produces better understanding of energy distribution in regards of the balance between growth and zzso zzso has two zzso zzso zzso Area zzso and zzso zzso Modeling and zzso In zzso by taking the complex leaf overlap problem into consideration, the area of every plant is measured from zzso images in four zzso Given the abundant zzso obtained with zzso in the second module zzso a zzso growth model is applied to generate growth curves, followed by functional data zzso 

Experimental results on model plant zzso zzso show that, compared to an existing approach, zzso reduces the error rate of measuring plant area by zzso The application of zzso on the zzso zzso plants under fluctuating light reveals the correlation between low zzso rates and small plant area zzso to wild zzso which raises a hypothesis that knocking out zzso changes the sensitivity of the energy distribution under fluctuating light conditions to repress leaf zzso 

zzso is available at zzso
