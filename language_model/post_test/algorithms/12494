We present an zzso to zzso images distorted by motion and zzso captured in cameras that use a scanning zzso sensor with an zzso zzso In particular, the method is developed for images captured by a staggered time delay and integration camera distorted by zzso The zzso improves the zzso image by adjusting its fields irrespective of the type of motion that occurs during the zzso The zzso performs two tasks: zzso of the field relative motion during the exposure by a normal zzso zzso technique and improvement of the zzso image from such motion zzso The zzso uses zzso zzso therefore it has a zzso advantage over zzso based on the technique of searching for a zzso The zzso is successfully demonstrated on both simulated and real zzso
