The aim of the study was to prove the importance of the zzso mixture composition and zzso speed on zzso zzso zzso from different zzso zzso of zzso cellulose zzso and zzso zzso zzso were prepared with a zzso zzso and zzso at different zzso The water content of the zzso for the production of zzso zzso was zzso The zzso were characterized in terms of size, shape, zzso mechanical properties, and zzso The fraction of zzso in the zzso zzso had the highest impact on the zzso zzso With an increasing fraction of zzso more water was required for successful zzso size and zzso of the zzso zzso and the surface zzso stress zzso These observations were evaluated using the zzso and the zzso models for zzso The latter led to the conception that an zzso consists of two zzso a percolating zzso phase formed by zzso and water during zzso and a zzso phase formed by the second component of the zzso zzso This zzso concept provides explanations for the extent of shrinking during drying and for the disintegration zzso The zzso speed had an influence on the size but not on zzso or surface zzso stress of the zzso The best results were obtained at intermediate zzso zzso of 10 and zzso zzso Fundamental properties of zzso and zzso can be described by applying a zzso concept of the zzso zzso
