Clinical and pathological parameters may overestimate the need for chemotherapy in patients with zzso breast zzso More accurate determination of the risk of distant recurrence is now possible with use of genetic tests, such as the zzso zzso zzso 

A health technology assessment performed by a medical insurer in 2009 introduced a set of test eligibility criteria - the zzso zzso Algorithm zzso - applied in this study to determine the clinical usefulness of a zzso genetic testing strategy, aimed at the reduction of zzso zzso An zzso study was designed to take advantage of the fact that the zzso profile excludes analysis of hormone zzso and human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso status, which form part of the zzso based partly on zzso routinely performed in all breast cancer zzso The study population consisted of 104 South African women with zzso breast zzso referred for zzso For the zzso test, zzso was extracted from 60 fresh zzso (in 58 zzso and 46 zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso 

When applying the zzso for selection of patients eligible for zzso testing, 95 of the 104 patients zzso In this zzso zzso zzso were classified as low zzso Similar distribution patterns for risk zzso were obtained for zzso extracted from fresh zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso 

The zzso profile zzso approximately zzso of zzso breast cancer patients as low-risk compared with zzso using conventional zzso In comparison, more than zzso were shown to be low risk with use of the zzso validated in this study as an appropriate strategy to prevent chemotherapy zzso in patients with zzso breast zzso
