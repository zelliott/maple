A major strength of zzso zzso as a model lies in the availability of a large number of naturally occurring zzso zzso Recent studies of zzso population structure, using thousands of zzso from stock center and natural collections, have revealed a robust pattern of isolation by distance at several spatial zzso such that genetically identical individuals are generally found close to each zzso However, some individual zzso zzso from this zzso While some of these may be the products of rare long-distance zzso events, many zzso may be the result of zzso in the sense that the data regarding location of origin data are zzso Here, we aim to identify such zzso Of the zzso zzso zzso we conclude that zzso deserve special attention as being potentially zzso We describe these suspicious zzso and their possible origins, and advise caution with regard to their use in experiments in which accurate information on geographic origin is zzso Finally, we discuss possibilities for maintaining the integrity of stock zzso
