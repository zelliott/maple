It is often reminded that if the zzso calcium is not measured, the interpretation of total zzso should consider serum zzso Two formulas are usually zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso measured zzso + zzso or zzso (40 - zzso zzso This adjustment formula arises from works of zzso published in zzso In a control population, we established the median values of zzso zzso and zzso calcium zzso to pH zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with our zzso methods zzso - zzso green and zzso - zzso on a Modular zzso Roche zzso zzso calcium with zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on this, we zzso compared for 71 patients who do not belong to the control population the zzso zzso resulting from the two formulas and the measured zzso to the zzso calcium corrected at pH zzso This comparison shows that in our laboratory, the two formulas lead to a rising zzso of the calcium for zzso values greater than 40 zzso reaching zzso zzso for zzso values above 44 zzso The use of this formulas may also mask an zzso indeed half of our patients' zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is not zzso These results agree with zzso recommendations for the use of his adjustment formula: the clinically justified adjustment of a low zzso due to an zzso should not be extended to other situations, particularly when zzso is zzso
