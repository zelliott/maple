The relative importance of local and long range interactions in the characteristics of the protein folding process has long been a matter of zzso Computer simulations based on zzso models have been widely used to study this topic, but without much agreement on which type of interactions is more relevant for the zzso of a zzso In this work, the authors also employ a zzso potential and simulation model to analyze the influence of local and long range interactions on the thermodynamics of the folding zzso The former are mainly used to control the degree of flexibility (or zzso of the chain, mostly appreciable in the unfolded zzso zzso Our results show the different effects that local and zzso interactions have on the zzso and the energy of the zzso This implies that a balance between both types of interactions is required, so that a free energy barrier exists between the native and the zzso zzso The variations in the contribution of both types of interactions have also a direct effect on the stability of the chain zzso including the possible appearance of zzso folding zzso
