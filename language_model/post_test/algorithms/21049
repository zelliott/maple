The promise of mass zzso as a tool for probing zzso is predicated on reliable identification of zzso zzso zzso are key zzso of cellular zzso yet are hard to zzso partly because of unusual fragmentation patterns of zzso In addition to being accurate, zzso identification software must be robust and efficient to deal with increasingly large spectral data zzso Here, we present a new scoring function for the zzso software for zzso zzso tandem mass zzso for zzso instruments, without the need for manual zzso The scoring function was modeled by learning fragmentation patterns from zzso validated zzso zzso We compare our zzso against zzso and zzso on testing and training data zzso At a zzso false positive rate, zzso identified the greatest total number of zzso zzso zzso more than zzso and zzso more than zzso zzso identified by zzso tended to score better in several spectral quality zzso Furthermore, zzso runs much faster than either zzso or zzso making zzso zzso zzso Finally, we used our new models to zzso a corpus of zzso zzso zzso acquired for a zzso analysis of zzso zzso DNA damage and repair pathways and discovered zzso more zzso than the previous zzso
