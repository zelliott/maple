The capability to systematically zzso between different types of animal zzso will give us insights into how the features of vocal sounds are perceived by listening zzso Following behavioral study, zzso recordings in nonhuman animals, could reveal how zzso support the perception of communication zzso Signal processing zzso are now available for creating sophisticated zzso between complex sounds, like human zzso However, most morphing approaches have been applied to harmonic sounds whose frequency components can be readily zzso We show that auditory morphing can be more generally applied by describing a procedure for using the STRAIGHT signal processing package to gradually zzso between: zzso zzso from different zzso zzso zzso zzso dissimilar types of monkey zzso such as a zzso and a zzso and zzso monkey and human zzso We then evaluated the quality of the zzso and obtained zzso zzso from human listeners who seemed to categorize the monkey zzso much like the ones produced by zzso The outlined procedures prepare zzso zzso for zzso study and the approach establishes basic principles that will assist in creating suitable zzso of other natural sounds and animal zzso
