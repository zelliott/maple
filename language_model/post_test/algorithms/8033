A method for reconstructing the potential energy landscape of simple zzso chains is zzso We show how to obtain a faithful representation of the energy landscape in terms of a suitable directed zzso zzso and zzso indicators of the graph are shown to yield an effective estimate of the time scales associated with both folding and zzso zzso This conclusion is drawn by comparing molecular dynamics simulations at constant temperature with the dynamics on the zzso defined as a zzso zzso zzso The main advantage of the graph representation is that its dynamics can be naturally zzso by collecting zzso into zzso while redefining their zzso We show that the zzso properties at large time scales are preserved by the zzso zzso Moreover, we obtain clear indications that the zzso exhibit common zzso properties, at zzso with the zzso whose peculiar graph structure stems from its spatial zzso In order to distinguish between zzso and zzso folders, one has to look at the kinetic properties of the corresponding directed zzso In particular, we find that the average time needed to the fast folder for reaching its native zzso is two orders of magnitude smaller than its zzso time while for the bad folder these time scales are zzso
