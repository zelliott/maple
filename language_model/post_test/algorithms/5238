A three factor, zzso zzso experimental design combining with response surface modeling zzso and zzso programming zzso was employed for maximizing zzso removal from zzso solution by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shells based on 17 different experimental data obtained in a zzso batch zzso Three independent variables zzso pH of solution zzso ranging from zzso to zzso initial concentration of zzso zzso zzso ranging from 5 to 50 zzso and contact time zzso ranging from 5 to 120 zzso were zzso coded as zzso zzso and zzso at three levels zzso 0 and 1), and a zzso zzso zzso equation was then derived to predict zzso The significance of independent variables and their interactions were tested by means of the analysis of zzso zzso with zzso confidence limits zzso The standardized effects of the independent variables and their interactions on the dependent variable were also investigated by preparing a zzso zzso The optimum values of the selected variables were obtained by solving the zzso zzso model, as well as by zzso the response surface zzso zzso The optimum coded values of three test variables were zzso as zzso zzso and zzso by using a zzso zzso zzso The experimental conditions at this global point were determined to be zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the corresponding zzso removal efficiency was found to be about zzso
