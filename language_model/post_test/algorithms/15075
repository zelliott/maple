To formulate and test an zzso using minimal zzso criteria for accurately diagnosing clinical zzso 

zzso cornea practice and zzso zzso Research zzso 

Both eyes of 86 zzso patients who had never worn contact zzso and 195 normal participants were studied with the zzso zzso to evaluate the zzso index, an zzso that zzso zzso the zzso features of zzso The diagnostic efficacy of the zzso index was compared with that of the modified zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The same zzso were calculated for an additional 8 eyes with zzso topography and 12 eyes with early zzso 

The mean zzso was significantly greater in the zzso group zzso than in the normal control group zzso with minimal zzso At a zzso point for zzso of 100, 280 of 281 participants zzso were correctly zzso In contrast, the correct zzso rate for the other zzso were zzso zzso of 281 zzso zzso zzso of 281 zzso K, 272 of 281 zzso zzso zzso of 281 zzso Six of the 8 eyes with zzso topography had a zzso between zzso and zzso and 11 of the 12 eyes with early zzso had a zzso greater than zzso 

The zzso index set at 100 was highly sensitive and specific for diagnosing zzso a range of zzso to zzso may be useful for designating zzso This index is more useful than any of the other currently available tools for zzso patients with zzso for computerized segregation analysis and for distinguishing eyes with zzso from normal eyes in zzso screening of zzso surgical zzso
