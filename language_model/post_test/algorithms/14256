An zzso for zzso calculating the zzso for zzso zzso electrical zzso zzso zzso image reconstruction zzso is proposed and compared to existing zzso zzso is an zzso problem in which zzso is used to calculate a stable and accurate solution by incorporating some form of prior knowledge into the zzso A zzso is used to control the zzso between zzso to data and zzso to the zzso A remaining challenge is to develop and validate methods of zzso selecting the zzso In this paper, we evaluate and compare five different strategies for zzso zzso We propose a zzso method of objective zzso selection, called zzso that leads to zzso and stable image reconstructions that are indistinguishable from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso selections of zzso are inconsistent among experts, zzso generalized zzso approaches produce zzso solutions, zzso zzso approaches are unreliable for zzso and zzso zzso produces good solutions comparable to expert zzso Additionally, we show that it is possible to reliably detect an inverse crime based on analysis of these zzso
