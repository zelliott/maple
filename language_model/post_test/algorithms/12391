A 3 T zzso zzso zzso sequence employing zzso zzso and very selective zzso suppression zzso was tested in 25 prostate cancer zzso At an echo time of 85 zzso the zzso sequence resulted in zzso upright inner zzso and minimal outer zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso resonance zzso imaging zzso exams performed at both 3 and zzso T for 10 patients demonstrated a zzso increase in zzso ratio zzso at 3 T as compared with zzso T for the center zzso zzso This permitted the acquisition of zzso data with a nominal spatial resolution of zzso zzso at 3 T with similar zzso as the zzso data acquired at zzso zzso Due to the twofold increase in spectral resolution at 3 T and the improved magnetic field zzso provided by zzso zzso zzso the zzso resonance was better resolved from zzso and zzso zzso as compared with zzso T zzso In prostate cancer patients, the zzso of zzso and the reduction of zzso were more clearly observed at 3 zzso as compared with zzso T zzso The increased zzso and corresponding spatial resolution zzso at 3 T reduced partial volume effects and allowed improved detection of the presence and extent of abnormal zzso levels in prostate cancer patients, as compared with zzso T zzso
