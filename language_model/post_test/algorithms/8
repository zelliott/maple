We applied zzso zzso zzso to the selection of a new indicator strain set for the zzso typing of zzso zzso The new indicator set is composed of selected indicator strains from the sets described in 1966 by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in 1974 by Jones, zzso Thomas, and Farmer zzso zzso zzso and is designated the G-F zzso This indicator set consists of 14 indicator strains which typed zzso of 114 test cultures, has a high degree of discrimination (10 patterns zzso 50% of the test zzso and provides zzso zzso of the same typing pattern in duplicate tests done on different zzso The G-F set of indicator strains provides slightly higher percentages of zzso cultures than either of the other two sets, has greater zzso zzso and is more zzso than they zzso We recommend that the G-F set of indicator strains be used instead of the two other sets for zzso typing of zzso zzso We also tested a recently described overlay procedure for zzso testing of zzso zzso and found it to be superior to previous methods in that it is easier to perform, it provides answers in only 24 h instead of 48 zzso and it can be used to type zzso strains (which previous techniques could not readily zzso Thus, the application of zzso zzso zzso and use of a revised typing procedure have produced an improved system for zzso typing of zzso zzso Similar procedures may be zzso to other typing zzso
