As children grow, body and limb zzso zzso For serial zzso zzso growth increases the distance between the bone region of interest and X-ray source over time, thereby increasing zzso zzso To isolate bone zzso from zzso error in growing subjects, we developed a correction method based on waist zzso a common zzso zzso This correction was applied to zzso X-ray zzso output obtained in a cohort of zzso zzso and zzso After correcting for zzso results for projected area and bone mineral content zzso increased by zzso at the zzso spine and zzso at the zzso neck, decreasing zzso bone mineral density zzso by zzso at both zzso The effects of zzso correction were similar in magnitude to zzso and zzso gains previously reported in zzso studies of zzso zzso Because of body size differences, the effect of correction for zzso and zzso was zzso greater in zzso than in zzso which increased the observed zzso differential between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso true changes in bone mineral measures in growing zzso girls and, therefore, may obscure additional zzso changes during zzso Our correction technique may enhance detection of skeletal adaptation, particularly in pediatric zzso
