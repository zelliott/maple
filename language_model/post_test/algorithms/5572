zzso by zzso is a promising cost-effective technology for zzso DNA sequencing via zzso zzso However, due to the effects of spectrum errors rooted in experimental conditions, an accurate and fast reconstruction of original sequences has become a challenging zzso In the last decade, a variety of analyses and designs have been tried to overcome this problem, where different strategies have different zzso in speed and zzso zzso by the idea that the errors could be identified by analyzing the zzso of spectrum zzso this paper presents a constructive zzso algorithm, featuring an accurate reconstruction guided by a set of zzso criteria and zzso Instead of directly reconstructing the original zzso the new zzso first builds several accurate short fragments, which are then carefully assembled into a whole zzso The experiments on benchmark instance sets demonstrate that the proposed method can reconstruct long DNA sequences with higher accuracy than current approaches in the zzso
