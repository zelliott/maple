Many biological systems are modeled zzso with discrete models, such as zzso zzso networks, logical models, zzso zzso and zzso models, to gain a better understanding of zzso The zzso complexity to analyze the complete dynamics of these models grows zzso in the number of zzso which zzso working with complex zzso There exist software tools to analyze discrete models, but they either lack the zzso functionality to analyze complex models zzso or they are zzso to many users as they require understanding the underlying zzso and zzso do not have a zzso user zzso or are hard to zzso zzso analysis methods that are accessible to zzso and easy to use are zzso 

We propose a method for efficiently identifying zzso and introduce the zzso tool Analysis of Dynamic zzso Models zzso which provides this and other analysis methods for discrete zzso zzso converts several discrete model types automatically into zzso zzso systems and analyzes their dynamics using tools from computer zzso Specifically, we propose a method to identify zzso of a discrete model that is equivalent to solving a system of zzso zzso a zzso problem in computer zzso Based on extensive zzso with both discrete models arising in systems biology and randomly generated networks, we found that the zzso zzso presented in this manuscript are fast for systems with the structure maintained by most biological systems, namely zzso and zzso For a large set of published complex discrete models, zzso identified the zzso in less than one zzso 

zzso modeling techniques are a useful tool for analyzing complex biological systems and there is a need in the biological community for accessible efficient analysis zzso zzso provides analysis methods based on mathematical zzso as a zzso tool for several different input formats, and it makes analysis of complex models accessible to a larger community, as it is platform independent as a zzso and does not require understanding of the underlying zzso
