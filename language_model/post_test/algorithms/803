Deep zzso zzso zzso and its zzso pulmonary zzso is a significant clinical zzso Once zzso zzso treatment is based on the age of the zzso There are no good zzso methods, however, to determine zzso zzso Previously, we demonstrated that imaging internal mechanical strains can identify and possibly age zzso in a deep zzso In this study the deformation geometry for zzso elasticity imaging and its effect on Young's zzso estimates is zzso A zzso reconstruction method is presented to estimate elasticity in which the zzso vessel is modeled as a layered zzso Compared to an zzso approach in zzso elasticity imaging, the proposed zzso approach has several zzso only one component of the strain zzso is zzso the zzso procedure is very zzso the method is highly efficient because an zzso solution of the forward elastic problem is zzso and the method is not very sensitive to the details of the external load zzso characteristic that is important for zzso zzso zzso zzso The approach was tested theoretically using a zzso model, and zzso on both zzso zzso and an animal model of zzso zzso suggest that elasticity reconstruction may prove to be a practical adjunct to triplex scanning to zzso zzso and stage zzso
