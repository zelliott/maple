This study compared a small bone joint zzso calculated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Carlo simulation using zzso zzso zzso zzso The performance of the AAA in the joint dose calculation was evaluated using zzso Carlo zzso and zzso of joint dose on its zzso and beam angle were zzso Small bone joint zzso containing a vertical water layer zzso zzso sandwiched by two bones (2 zzso 2 zzso 2 zzso were zzso by the 6 and 15 zzso zzso beams with field size equal to 4 zzso 4 zzso zzso doses along the central beam axis in a joint zzso were calculated with and without a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso added on top of the zzso Different beam angles zzso were used with the zzso set to the center of the bone joint for dose calculations using the AAA zzso treatment planning zzso and zzso Carlo simulation (the zzso zzso For zzso comparison and zzso dose calculations were repeated in homogeneous water zzso with the bone zzso by zzso Comparing the calculated zzso between the AAA and zzso Carlo zzso the AAA underestimated joint doses varying with its zzso by about zzso for 6 zzso and zzso for 15 zzso without zzso and by zzso for 6 zzso and zzso for 15 zzso with zzso Moreover, joint doses calculated by the AAA did not vary with the joint zzso and beam zzso From zzso Carlo results, there was a decrease in the calculated joint dose as the joint zzso increased, and a slight decrease as the beam angle zzso When zzso was added to the zzso it was found that variations of joint dose with its zzso and beam angle became less significant for the 6 zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso in small bone joint calculated by the AAA and zzso Carlo simulation was studied using the 6 and 15 zzso zzso zzso The AAA could not predict variations of joint dose with its zzso and beam angle, which were predicted by the zzso Carlo zzso
