To zzso assess the relationship between the time to peak enhancement of zzso zzso zzso and that of the zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The study zzso included 43 patients with known zzso All underwent abdominal CT imaging by using zzso CT zzso The CT data acquisition was initiated with a delay of zzso from the beginning of the contrast material zzso The zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and the zzso were zzso The times to peak enhancement of the zzso and the zzso were recorded and the correlation between the time to peak enhancement of the zzso and that of the zzso was zzso 

There were three tendencies of zzso of the zzso enhancement, only zzso of them were similar to that of the zzso The mean time to peak enhancement of the zzso and the zzso zzso was zzso s and zzso zzso zzso The time to peak enhancement of most zzso was positively and zzso correlated with the time to peak zzso enhancement zzso zzso 

The result may potentially allow scan delay zzso at contrast zzso CT image in the detection of zzso according to zzso zzso
