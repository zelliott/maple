The zzso zzso is one of the most commonly known biological zzso zzso zzso recordings are zzso in the zzso by skilled zzso However, pathological conditions may not always be obvious in the original zzso zzso zzso analysis provides frequency information but has the disadvantage that time characteristics will be zzso zzso analysis, which provides both time and frequency information, can overcome this zzso Here a new method, the combination of zzso analysis and feature zzso is applied with the intent to investigate its suitability as a diagnostic zzso zzso signals with normal and abnormal beats were zzso There were two stages in zzso zzso zzso feature extraction and feature zzso To extract features from zzso signals, zzso decomposition was first applied and feature zzso of zzso energy and zzso were zzso These feature zzso were used to zzso zzso The results showed that normal beats and abnormal beats composed different clusters in most zzso In conclusion, the combination of zzso transform and feature zzso has shown potential in detecting abnormalities in an zzso zzso It was also found that zzso energy and zzso are features, which are suitable for zzso of zzso zzso
