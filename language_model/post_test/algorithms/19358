We determined the value of zzso correction zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso in overweight patients by comparison of zzso zzso zzso zzso and corrected (an zzso zzso with a measured zzso zzso map zzso zzso relative zzso to zzso data obtained in the same patients with zzso zzso In addition, the impact of zzso correction for the assessment of zzso viability with zzso zzso was determined using zzso PET as the reference zzso 

Thirty consecutive overweight patients zzso with left zzso dysfunction underwent a resting zzso zzso and a PET study zzso and zzso zzso zzso scans were reconstructed without zzso correction zzso and with zzso correction zzso The left zzso was divided into 16 zzso in which the relative zzso was zzso using zzso zzso A relative zzso zzso or zzso zzso was considered consistent with viable zzso for zzso and zzso 

The absolute difference between zzso zzso and zzso PET zzso was less pronounced in the inferior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regions zzso zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity of zzso for diagnosing zzso viability increased from 83 to zzso zzso without loss in zzso 

zzso correction improves zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso in the inferior, zzso and zzso regions and increases its sensitivity for the diagnosis of zzso zzso
