To define the mechanism of the protection by zzso sodium of the gastric zzso the characteristics of protein binding of this drug were investigated using a zzso zzso zzso zzso The binding rate zzso zzso and the binding amounts zzso zzso were obtained from time courses of the frequency decrease zzso zzso of the zzso The binding zzso to proteins of two zzso zzso zzso zzso type and zzso zzso zzso zzso were dependent on the zzso leading to large zzso values at the zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso values of zzso with the addition of bovine serum zzso zzso and bovine serum zzso zzso at the acid region were larger than those of zzso The difference in zzso values between zzso and zzso for zzso gastric zzso zzso is hardly zzso zzso seems to be more heavily distributed in the zzso areas than in the intact zzso judging from the large binding zzso of this drug to zzso and zzso compared with those to zzso It is suggested that zzso is bound to proteins by zzso interaction, moreover, the zzso interaction between this drug and proteins zzso and zzso occurs at zzso pH zzso On account of these zzso zzso sodium seems to have a more protective effect on an zzso at zzso acidity than zzso Finally, QCM was found to be a useful technique for detecting zzso the time course of binding proteins with zzso
