Biological zzso represent a valuable source of information for the identification and zzso zzso of zzso One of the most commonly used zzso for this task is the zzso zzso The zzso zzso system presented here supports large-scale identification tasks by comparing zzso zzso restriction patterns to a database of restriction patterns derived from sequence zzso zzso efficiency and zzso against experimental errors are gained by employing a new distance measure for restriction patterns, the zzso length zzso zzso from the application of the system to the identification of zzso zzso associated with the zzso zzso zzso show the reliability of the zzso
