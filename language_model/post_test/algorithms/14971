The functional and zzso properties of a zzso or zzso zzso current zzso responsible for the generation of zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso principal zzso (the zzso zzso were investigated with zzso zzso zzso Both acutely zzso cells and slices derived from adult rat zzso zzso were zzso zzso activated by either slow zzso ramps or long-lasting zzso zzso was prominent in both isolated and, especially, in zzso zzso The analysis of the gating properties of the transient zzso current zzso in the same zzso revealed that the resulting zzso zzso current zzso had both zzso and zzso dependence not compatible with those of the observed zzso thus zzso the existence of an alternative mechanism of persistent zzso zzso The zzso zzso currents evoked by slow zzso ramps decreased in zzso with decreasing ramp slopes, thus suggesting that a zzso zzso was taking place during ramp zzso When ramps were preceded by increasingly positive, long-lasting zzso zzso zzso was zzso and eventually completely, zzso The zzso of zzso steady state zzso was approximately zzso zzso The time dependence of the development of the zzso was also studied by varying the duration of the zzso zzso time zzso ranging from approximately zzso to approximately zzso zzso depending on the zzso level, were zzso Moreover, the zzso and zzso properties of zzso were such as to zzso within a relatively broad zzso range, a really persistent window current zzso zzso zzso was zzso at about the same zzso level at which zzso zzso are expressed by the zzso zzso Indeed, at zzso zzso the zzso was shown to contribute to zzso of the persistent zzso current that sustains the zzso zzso whereas only the remaining part can be attributed to a classical zzso zzso Finally, the single-channel bases of zzso slow zzso and zzso generation were investigated in zzso zzso Both phenomena were found to be zzso by zzso relatively prolonged late channel openings that appeared to undergo zzso in a nearly irreversible manner at high zzso levels zzso zzso but not at more negative zzso zzso zzso
