The zzso resistance zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed at the human zzso barrier zzso zzso actively zzso a wide variety of drugs from the central nervous system, including zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated zzso activity at the human zzso using PET of zzso distribution into the brain in the absence and presence of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso Here we extend the initial zzso analysis of these data and apply zzso modeling to these human zzso imaging zzso 

Healthy volunteers were injected with zzso to assess blood flow, followed by zzso to assess zzso zzso zzso zzso blood samples and PET images were obtained at frequent intervals for 5 and 45 zzso respectively, after zzso After a zzso infusion of zzso zzso zzso zzso to inhibit zzso a second set of water and zzso PET studies was conducted, followed by zzso imaging to measure regional blood zzso Blood flow was estimated using dynamic zzso data and a zzso zzso Dynamic zzso data were assessed by a zzso zzso model of delivery and retention and a zzso model using the first 10 zzso of data zzso 

The zzso model was able to fit the full zzso both before and during zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased zzso transfer zzso of zzso into the brain by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This increase was significantly greater than changes in blood flow zzso range, zzso zzso zzso 12, P zzso zzso Estimates of zzso from the zzso model correlated to estimates from the zzso model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that a short study could effectively estimate zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso analysis can estimate zzso activity at the zzso by imaging before and during zzso zzso by zzso indicated by a change in zzso transport zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in brain tissue that requires a zzso model for long imaging times; however, transport can be effectively measured using a short scan time with a zzso model, avoiding complications with labeled zzso and zzso zzso
