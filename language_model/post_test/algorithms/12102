In zzso dissolution zzso has been assessed through profile comparison between the test and reference zzso for zzso zzso zzso of the absolute mean difference and average squared mean differences were two of the zzso criteria to evaluate distance or similarity between general zzso The two functions and their method of moment zzso are studied in this paper as an application to similarity assessment of two dissolution zzso Due to the complexity of the zzso of these zzso the confidence intervals obtained from the zzso method were used for testing the hypothesis of dissolution zzso The size and power of two procedures are examined with a simulation zzso A zzso example is used to illustrate the application of the zzso
