zzso signals such as zzso blood pressure zzso pulse zzso zzso and zzso pressure zzso contain useful information such as heart rate, respiratory rate, and pulse pressure variation zzso We present a novel zzso model of cardiovascular signals and describe how it can be used with the extended Kalman filter zzso to simultaneously estimate and track many cardiovascular parameters of interest using a unified statistical zzso We analyze data from four databases containing cardiovascular signals and present representative examples intended to illustrate the versatility, zzso and zzso of the zzso Our results demonstrate the ability of the zzso to estimate and track several clinically relevant features of cardiovascular zzso We illustrate how the zzso can be used to elegantly solve several actively researched and clinically significant problems including heart and respiratory rate zzso artifact zzso pulse zzso zzso and zzso zzso
