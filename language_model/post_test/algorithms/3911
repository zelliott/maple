zzso zzso of zzso elements is the influential parameters in the performance of high power airborne zzso zzso to control the optimum zzso without material zzso The zzso zzso of elements of provided high power airborne zzso was determined by measuring temperature of the provided high power airborne zzso zzso zzso The results showed that simple zzso can be used both to measure the zzso zzso of zzso element and an indicator to power transmission to the zzso To verify our approach, the power transmission to the air has been investigated by other common method zzso The experimental results displayed good agreement with presented zzso
