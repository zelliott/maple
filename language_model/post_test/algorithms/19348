zzso variation within individuals holds information regarding the relationships of organisms, which is expected to be particularly important for reconstructing the evolutionary history of closely related zzso However, little effort has been committed to incorporate such information for reconstructing the zzso of zzso zzso trees represent a solution when one zzso marker is considered, but there is no satisfying method when multiple genes are to be zzso In this paper, we propose an zzso that converts a distance zzso of zzso to a distance zzso among zzso This zzso allows the incorporation of zzso variation for reconstructing the zzso of organisms from one or more zzso The method is applied to reconstruct the zzso of the seven native zzso species of Rosa zzso zzso in North zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso genes were zzso for 40 individuals from these zzso The three genes had little genetic variation, and most species showed incomplete lineage zzso suggesting these species have a recent zzso Despite these difficulties, the networks zzso of organisms reconstructed from the zzso obtained with the zzso recovered groups that more closely match zzso boundaries than did the zzso zzso The combined network of individuals shows that species west of the Rocky zzso Rosa zzso and zzso zzso form exclusive groups and that together they are distinct from eastern zzso In the east, three groups were found to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These groups are zzso with the zzso and the ecology of zzso The method is also useful for representing hybrid individuals when the relationships are reconstructed using a zzso zzso
