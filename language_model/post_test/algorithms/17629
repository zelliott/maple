Although early zzso is a powerful predictor of stroke outcome after zzso some stroke patients remain disabled despite tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we sought to investigate whether the zzso accuracy of early zzso on stroke outcome is improved when combined with clinical and zzso zzso 

We evaluated 177 patients with zzso strokes in the middle cerebral artery zzso treated with intravenous zzso who were followed up during 3 zzso zzso zzso monitoring of zzso was conducted during the first hours after zzso zzso The relative contribution of clinical, zzso zzso and zzso information on stroke outcome was zzso We used zzso zzso to derive a zzso model for good outcome zzso Rankin zzso score zzso or zzso after zzso 

Median National Institutes of Health Stroke zzso zzso score before zzso was zzso At 3 months, 87 patients zzso became functionally independent zzso Rankin zzso score zzso or zzso In a zzso zzso model, degree of zzso within 300 minutes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso baseline zzso score zzso zzso blood pressure zzso and early zzso changes on CT zzso independently predicted outcome at 3 zzso A zzso score was developed on the basis of the factors significantly associated with stroke outcome in the zzso zzso zzso score range, 0 to zzso The likelihood of good outcome at 3 months was zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso in patients who scored 0 to 2, zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso in those who scored 3 to 4, and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso in those who scored 5 to 7 zzso 

The combination of clinical, zzso and zzso information predicts with a high accuracy long-term stroke outcome during or shortly after intravenous zzso zzso
