This study aims to investigate the ability of zzso acid bacteria zzso to remove zzso zzso from zzso solution with respect to the bacterial zzso initial zzso zzso incubation time, temperature, and zzso The removal of zzso determined by zzso liquid zzso zzso coupled with zzso zzso The maximum zzso zzso was achieved by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso for viable and zzso and zzso for zzso cells after 24 h zzso The highest removal of zzso was at pH zzso and 37 zzso and increased with decreasing of toxin zzso The removal ability of selected strains could represent new strategies for a possible application in contaminated food products and animal zzso
