This study sought to assess the feasibility of performing zzso zzso imaging zzso with half the zzso activity using zzso expectation zzso with resolution recovery zzso an zzso reconstruction software developed to improve count statistics and acquisition zzso 

Two hundred zzso patients referred for zzso were randomly allocated to undergo zzso or zzso protocols with standard zzso zzso injections of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso injections and zzso zzso zzso activities were adjusted individually by zzso The groups were compared for image quality and clinical zzso 

The groups were similar for mean patient age, weight, and body mass index, sex distribution, zzso probability of zzso and zzso zzso Mean zzso activities for the zzso and high-dose stages were as zzso zzso group: zzso zzso 85 zzso and zzso zzso 200 zzso HD group: 263 zzso 129 zzso and 629 zzso 85 zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso Mean effective dose per study was zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the HD group zzso zzso zzso Over all image quality was zzso in zzso and zzso of the groups, zzso However, when we analyzed the zzso stage zzso image quality was slightly worse in the HD than the zzso though still within the zzso excellent zzso 

zzso with nearly half the radiation dose is feasible with good image zzso
