Studies of pediatric inflammatory zzso disease zzso have varied in the criteria used to zzso patients as having zzso disease zzso zzso colitis zzso or indeterminate colitis zzso Patients undergoing an initial evaluation for zzso will often undergo a series of diagnostic tests, including zzso upper gastrointestinal series with small zzso zzso abdominal CT, upper zzso and zzso with zzso Other tests performed less frequently include magnetic resonance imaging scans, zzso testing, and capsule zzso The large amount of clinical information obtained may make a physician uncertain as to whether to label a patient as having CD or zzso Nevertheless, to facilitate the conduct of zzso studies in children, to allow the entry of children into clinical trials, and to allow physicians to more clearly discuss diagnosis with their patients, it is important that clinicians be able to differentiate between CD and zzso 

A consensus conference regarding the diagnosis and zzso of pediatric zzso was organized by the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of zzso The meeting included 10 pediatric zzso and 4 pediatric zzso The primary aim was to determine the utility of zzso and zzso in establishing the diagnosis of CD and zzso Each member of the group was assigned a topic for zzso Topics evaluated included zzso inflammatory zzso disease from acute zzso zzso zzso and zzso features that allow differentiation between CD and zzso upper zzso features seen in both CD and zzso zzso inflammation and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso sparing in pediatric zzso zzso inflammation in CD and zzso and definitions of zzso 

Patients with UC may have zzso features such as microscopic inflammation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and relative zzso sparing at the time of zzso These findings should not prompt the zzso to change the diagnosis from UC to zzso Other zzso findings, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso disease, and multiple zzso in the small zzso or colon more strongly suggest a diagnosis of zzso An zzso is provided to enable the zzso to differentiate more reliably between these 2 zzso 

The recommendations and zzso presented here aim to assist the zzso in zzso childhood UC from zzso We hope the recommendations in this report will reduce zzso among practitioners in how they use the terms zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The authors hope that progress being made in zzso zzso and imaging studies leads to more reliable zzso
