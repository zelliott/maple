The Logan plot is a powerful zzso used to generate zzso images from dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso images in zzso zzso However, it requires zzso blood sampling and zzso correction to provide an input function, and clinically it is preferable that this need for zzso blood sampling be zzso zzso of the input function with zzso correction using an zzso searching zzso zzso has been zzso The zzso seeks the input function from the intersection between the planes spanned by measured zzso zzso in tissue and their cumulative zzso in data zzso However, the zzso is sensitive to noise included in measured curves, and it often fails to estimate the input zzso In this paper, we propose a robust zzso of the cumulative integral of the plasma zzso curve zzso using zzso zzso zzso to overcome noise zzso The zzso reduces noise in the measured PET data using averaging and zzso that gathers zzso zzso with similar kinetic zzso We confirmed that a little noise made the zzso of the input function extremely difficult in the zzso The robust zzso was validated by application to eight real dynamic zzso PET data sets used to zzso zzso zzso receptors and four real dynamic zzso PET data sets used to zzso zzso zzso zzso the latter showed faster metabolism than the zzso The zzso operation improved the zzso ratio for the PET data sufficiently to estimate the input function, and the calculated zzso images had a quality equivalent to that using measured zzso after zzso zzso Our proposed method zzso yields an alternative input function for Logan zzso allowing the Logan plot to be more useful in zzso zzso
