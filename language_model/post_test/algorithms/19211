The quantitative study of the zzso structural behavior of individual zzso requires high-resolution experimental approaches with longtime zzso We present a new technique to explore the dynamics of weak zzso zzso It is based on the analysis of the zzso zzso fluctuations of a zzso glass zzso that is zzso to a flat surface by the zzso of zzso A continuous zzso mechanism allows us to maintain or adjust the height of the optical trap with zzso accuracy over long periods of zzso The resulting remarkably stable zzso potential adds a zzso zzso force bias to the energy landscape of molecular zzso A combination of optical zzso and advanced zzso zzso provides the zzso zzso positions with zzso spatial and zzso zzso zzso zzso The analysis of accumulated zzso positions has allowed us not only to identify small single zzso but also to characterize their zzso behavior, for example, the zzso relations of short zzso and the zzso transitions of small protein zzso
