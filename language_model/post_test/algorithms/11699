We present a model of zzso zzso that zzso the output of the usual zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso It allows for hardware zzso of standard zzso networks, trained zzso with any classical learning zzso zzso zzso and its zzso The model is validated on hand-written digits recognition, and image zzso zzso A digital architecture is proposed and zzso The area needed for implementing the zzso zzso on a chip is 10 times smaller than that for the corresponding zzso zzso The accuracy of the network's output increases with time, and reaches that of the zzso zzso neural network after an adequate integration zzso Single errors in the spike trains, or interruption of the relaxation process, due for example to zzso in harsh zzso are zzso
