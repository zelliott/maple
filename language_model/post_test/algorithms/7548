True immersion of a player within a game can only occur when the world simulated looks and behaves as close to reality as zzso This implies that the game must correctly read and understand, among other things, the player's focus, attitude toward the zzso in focus, zzso and zzso In this paper, we proposed a novel system that zzso eye gaze zzso head pose zzso facial expression recognition, speech recognition, and zzso components for use in real-time zzso Both the eye gaze and head pose components zzso underlying 3-D models, and our novel head pose zzso zzso uniquely combines scene flow with a generic head zzso The facial expression recognition module uses the local zzso patterns with three zzso planes approach on the zzso shape index domain rather than the zzso domain, resulting in improved zzso Our system has also been extended to use a zzso camera driven by the zzso allowing us to track a moving zzso A test game, Art zzso is also zzso which not only demonstrates the utility of our system but also provides a template for zzso character zzso interaction in a gaming zzso The player alters zzso view of the 3-D world using head pose, looks at zzso using eye zzso and makes an evaluation based on the player's expression and zzso The zzso artist will respond with facial expression and synthetic speech based on its zzso Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the system are performed to illustrate the system's zzso
