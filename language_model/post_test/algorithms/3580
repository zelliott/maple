Phase contrast zzso imaging of small animal lungs reveals a speckled intensity pattern not seen in other zzso making the lungs highly visible in comparison to other zzso Although bearing a superficial resemblance to zzso the cause of this zzso has not been zzso With a view to determining the mechanism for the formation of zzso this paper details the results of zzso phase contrast experiments performed on mice zzso together with packed glass zzso used to emulate lung zzso These experimental studies are compared to zzso simulations, based on wave propagation zzso We find that zzso arises from focusing effects, with multiple zzso acting as zzso compound zzso zzso Both experiments and zzso suggest that this zzso phenomenon may lead to better screening methods for human lungs than conventional zzso
