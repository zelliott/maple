Acute inflammation is a severe medical condition defined as an inflammatory response of the body to an zzso Its rapid progression requires quick and accurate decisions from zzso zzso and delayed decisions makes acute inflammation the 10th leading cause of death overall in United States with the estimated cost of treatment about $17 billion zzso However, despite the need, there are limited number of methods that could assist clinicians to determine optimal therapies for acute zzso We developed a zzso method for suggesting optimal therapy by using machine learning model that is learned on historical patients' zzso To reduce both the risk of failure and the expense for clinical trials, our method is evaluated on a virtual patients generated by a mathematical model that zzso inflammatory zzso In conducted experiments, acute inflammation was handled with two complimentary zzso and zzso medications which adequate timing and doses are crucial for the successful zzso Our experiments show that the dosage regimen assigned with our zzso method significantly improves the percentage of healthy patients when compared to results by other methods used in clinical practice and found in zzso Our method saved zzso of patients that would otherwise die within a week, while the best method found in literature saved only zzso of zzso At the same time, our method used lower doses of medications than zzso In addition, our method achieved better results than alternatives when only incomplete or noisy zzso were available over time as well as it was less affected by therapy zzso The presented results provide strong evidence that models from the artificial intelligence community have a potential for development of personalized treatment strategies for acute zzso
