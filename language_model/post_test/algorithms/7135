zzso is the most common zzso bone tumor among children and zzso In this study, image texture analysis was made to extract texture features from bone zzso images to evaluate the recognition rate of zzso To obtain the optimal set of features, zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were applied to the image, with statistical methods being used to maximize the feature zzso To evaluate the performance of these methods, a support zzso machine zzso was zzso The experimental results demonstrated that the zzso zzso had a higher zzso accuracy zzso than the zzso zzso with respect to zzso occurrence in the zzso whereas the zzso zzso had a higher zzso accuracy zzso for zzso occurrence in the zzso zzso including zzso sensitivity, specificity and zzso zzso obtained using the zzso were all higher than those obtained using the features derived from the zzso zzso It is concluded that, a set of texture features can be extracted from the zzso and used in zzso zzso diagnosis zzso In addition, this study also confirms that zzso analysis is a useful tool for texture feature extraction during bone zzso image zzso
