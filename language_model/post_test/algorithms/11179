We present the zzso zzso Algorithm zzso a fast and accurate zzso for zzso electrical spiral waves and their associated breakup in cardiac zzso The zzso performed by zzso is an essential component of the detection and analysis of various cardiac zzso disorders, including zzso zzso and zzso Given a digitized frame of a zzso wave, zzso zzso a highly accurate representation of the front and the back of the wave, zzso zzso this representation with cubic zzso and subjects the result to an accurate zzso zzso This analysis is more comprehensive than methods based on zzso zzso as it considers the entire wave front and zzso To increase the zzso of the resulting symbolic zzso the zzso uses weighted overlapping of adjacent segments which increases the zzso at join zzso zzso has been applied to a number of representative types of spiral waves, and, for each type, a distinct zzso evolution in time zzso has been zzso zzso signatures have also been identified for spiral zzso These results represent a significant first step in automatically determining zzso ranges for which a zzso zzso network accurately reproduces a particular kind of cardiac zzso such as zzso zzso
