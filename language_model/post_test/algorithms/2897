We propose a novel method for detecting sites of molecular zzso in multiple zzso Our approach is a compromise between previous extremes of zzso prohibitive but zzso rigorous methods and imprecise zzso zzso Using a combined zzso for zzso tree structure and hidden zzso model zzso our program detects changes in zzso tree zzso over a multiple sequence zzso We evaluate our method on benchmark zzso from previous studies on two zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as simulated zzso We show that we are not only able to detect zzso regions of vastly different sizes but also the location of zzso with great zzso We show that our method does well zzso zzso zzso while at the same time maintaining practicality for larger zzso In all cases, we confirm the zzso predictions of previous studies, and in many cases we offer novel zzso
