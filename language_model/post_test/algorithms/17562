alpha and beta zzso are zzso zzso with similar structures and zzso We zzso the zzso of every zzso acid position in both zzso from the aligned sequences of their numerous known zzso By aligning the zzso profiles, we identify zzso that differ significantly in zzso between alpha and beta zzso Most of these zzso are part of zzso secondary structures and are clustered around the zzso binding pocket, the site of greatest functional difference between the two zzso The remaining zzso of large difference in zzso are located in the zzso loop between zzso and zzso We therefore predict that certain zzso in this zzso region also contribute to a functional difference between alpha and beta zzso Furthermore, we find the most restrictive zzso alignment is nearly identical to the true zzso zzso Thus, by using a stringent zzso alignment to approximate the true zzso the method introduced here may predict sites of functional distinction between zzso proteins even in the absence of structural zzso
