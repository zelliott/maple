A finite image I is a function assigning colors to a zzso zzso array of discrete zzso Thus, the information directly zzso by I is purely zzso Such zzso information is of little visual use in itself: perception of visual structure requires extraction of zzso image zzso A very elementary form of zzso information about I is provided by its zzso zzso zzso A zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso horizontal and zzso zzso zzso and alpha and beta zzso For any such zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gives the number of zzso pairs zzso zzso zzso zzso of I such that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and, zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Note that zzso explicitly encodes no zzso zzso Although zzso is uniquely determined by (and easily constructed zzso I, it is not obvious that I is uniquely determined by zzso Here we prove that any finite image I is uniquely determined by its zzso zzso zzso Two zzso are zzso both are zzso zzso provide zzso for reconstructing I from zzso In addition, a proof is given that any zzso two-dimensional image I can be constructed using only the shorter zzso of I: those zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that have magnitude of zzso zzso or zzso zzso columns in zzso and magnitude of zzso zzso or zzso zzso rows in zzso where zzso denotes the greatest zzso zzso or zzso zzso
