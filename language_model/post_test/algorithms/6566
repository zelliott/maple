Although there are several databases storing zzso zzso most such data still exist only in the scientific zzso They are scattered in scientific literature written in natural languages, defying data mining zzso Much time and labor have to be spent on zzso protein pathways from zzso Our aim is to develop a robust and powerful methodology to mine zzso interactions from biomedical zzso 

We present a novel and robust approach for zzso zzso interactions from zzso Our method uses a dynamic programming zzso to zzso distinguishing patterns by aligning relevant sentences and key zzso that describe protein zzso A matching zzso is designed to extract the interactions between zzso zzso only with a dictionary of protein names, our system achieves a recall rate of zzso and precision rate of zzso 

The program is available on request from the zzso
