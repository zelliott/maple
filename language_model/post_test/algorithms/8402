Recent experiments have shown that intense zzso magnetic fields can alter the geometry of the early cell zzso of zzso zzso zzso The changes depend on field orientation, strength, and zzso We present a model that zzso accounts for these effects and which zzso that the structures involved in cell division are zzso zzso and zzso zzso and that the geometry of the zzso replication and spreading processes dictates the nominal zzso zzso Within this model, the altered zzso geometry results from the magnetic zzso realignment of zzso structures, which causes a realignment of the zzso replication and spreading zzso
