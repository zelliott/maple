We show that the zzso zzso protein zzso binds to DNA as several different zzso This situation has precluded discovering a high correlation between any sequence property and binding affinity for proteins that bend zzso zzso zzso affinities of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso the zzso coli zzso zzso also zzso and DNA were analyzed to zzso describe, and make zzso the relationship of DNA sequence and binding affinity in a given zzso Here, sequence logos and weight zzso were built to model zzso binding zzso Comparing the weight zzso model to binding affinity revealed several distinct binding zzso These zzso zzso were zzso zzso
