The generalized order zzso zzso calculated from MD simulation trajectory using zzso internal zzso Motion zzso zzso agrees well with zzso derived zzso processed with the extended zzso analysis zzso However, the former lies considerably lower comparing to simple zzso derived data from zzso zzso In the present study we analyze possible reasons of such zzso In the general case we propose to use zzso factors from expression for internal zzso rather than ordinary zzso zzso zzso in case of the simple zzso zzso experimental values we suggest comparing them with zzso zzso from MD simulation zzso We show that the zzso values are in a good agreement with zzso derived zzso values obtained using the simple zzso zzso
