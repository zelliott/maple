Edge detection has been widely used in medical image processing, automatic diagnosis, et zzso A novel edge detection algorithm, based on the fusion model, is proposed by combination with the two proposed models as zzso the zzso of most probable distribution of edge point and the zzso of the difference weight of each zzso The most probable distribution of edge point can be obtained by analyzing the zzso among zzso neighborhood points around each zzso under zzso in the image to label the all candidate edge points in the zzso The difference weight of each point can be gotten by analyzing the brightness difference between the neighborhood point and the zzso zzso to represent the probability of being zzso The two zzso gotten from the different descriptions of spatial structure are fused together and derive from the final edge image with zzso method on the fusion zzso The experiments are performed based on the public diabetic zzso database zzso According to the edge images zzso the proposed method is zzso analyzed to be complete and close to the Ground Truth image with very low noise in comparison with the zzso zzso and zzso edge zzso The F1 measure, zzso measure and zzso measure are separately adopted to make quantitative evaluation of the proposed edge detection zzso Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to improve the effect of edge detection on medical zzso
