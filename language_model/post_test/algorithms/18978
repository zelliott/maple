Once chamber geometry is determined, the zzso zzso zzso mapping system can create a zzso map during a single cardiac zzso The zzso uses an inverse solution to the zzso equation to process the amplified zzso signals from the zzso zzso This process creates a three-dimensional zzso potential map from a single cardiac zzso Dynamic zzso mapping zzso is an zzso designed to identify zzso zzso such as zzso scars based on zzso distribution within the corresponding zzso 

The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso areas and to identify a suitable zzso zzso zzso 

A total of eight dogs were zzso Four healthy zzso underwent zzso of the left anterior descending coronary zzso Evidence of zzso zzso including zzso changes and elevated cardiac zzso T levels, was noted in all zzso zzso zzso scan was performed 29 zzso 2 days after zzso of the left anterior descending coronary zzso zzso zzso mapping of the left zzso was obtained in each dog, and zzso zzso size was determined using zzso at different filter zzso As a control group, another four zzso underwent sham zzso 

A significant linear correlation of zzso size using zzso compared with zzso zzso was found at the filter setting zzso negative zzso zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso Mean relative zzso size was zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso Compared with the sham group, a significant reduction in left zzso ejection fraction was found after zzso of the left anterior descending coronary artery zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso studies were performed to confirm the measured zzso zzso No scars were zzso in zzso dogs using zzso or zzso 

zzso mapping allows identification of zzso tissue within the left zzso An excellent correlation was observed between zzso surface and zzso zzso zzso zzso and marking these areas can be useful when planning an zzso strategy in the clinical setting of zzso heart zzso
