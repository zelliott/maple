We describe a novel zzso zzso framework for zzso obtained from diffusion zzso zzso is an attractive means of zzso a large set of zzso into zzso relevant zzso For most existing methods, however, the large zzso produced in high resolution or multiple subject studies are zzso To achieve good zzso our method repeatedly divides the data into subsets, which are then zzso using zzso zzso A final partition is obtained by zzso the zzso In addition, the zzso scheme provides a consistency measure for cluster assignment of individual zzso which is used to clean up the final zzso The clusters have good anatomical zzso and we show that three clusters corresponding to the three known segments of the zzso zzso show excellent agreement with zzso A major advantage of the method is the fact that it can find clusters in zzso of essentially arbitrary zzso This fact is exploited to find consistent clusters in zzso zzso data from multiple zzso We expect the identification of zzso across subjects to be an important application of the zzso
