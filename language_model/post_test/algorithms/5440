A methodology is proposed for zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso images of principally zzso zzso The methodology exploits spectral diversity and spatial zzso to find anatomical differences between materials zzso zzso and background) present in the zzso It consists of zzso rational variety mapping zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso constraint implies duality between zzso zzso zzso and zzso pattern assignment zzso zzso not zzso zzso in the original input space become zzso with high probability in the zzso mapped zzso zzso zzso mapping has two zzso it takes implicitly into account zzso present in the image zzso they are not required to be known) and it increases spectral diversity zzso zzso between materials, due to increased zzso of the mapped zzso This is expected to improve performance of systems for automated zzso and analysis of microscopic zzso zzso The methodology was validated using zzso of the second and third orders of the experimental zzso zzso images of zzso zzso nerve fibers zzso zzso and of zzso white pulp in the zzso zzso compared with a manually defined ground truth labeled by two trained zzso The methodology can also be useful for additional contrast enhancement of images of stained zzso
