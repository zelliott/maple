zzso zzso signals, recorded from the zzso region of brain on 110 patients were transferred to a personal computer by using a zzso sound zzso The fast zzso transform zzso method was applied to the recorded signal from each zzso Since zzso method inherently can not offer a good spectral resolution at jet blood flows, it sometimes causes wrong interpretation of zzso zzso zzso To do a correct and rapid diagnosis, zzso zzso blood flow signals were statistically arranged so that they were classified in artificial neural zzso Back propagation neural network and zzso map zzso of artificial neural network were used for training, whereas momentum and zzso zzso were used for zzso The results of these zzso were compared in the case of zzso and zzso
