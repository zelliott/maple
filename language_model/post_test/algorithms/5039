The method of the First zzso usually fails to detect overlapped peaks, especially when they appear as shoulders of the main zzso Furthermore, the determination of the position of the maximum with this method is based on a single point, and it is highly dependent of the noise level of the experimental zzso In this work, we propose an easy method to accurately estimate peak positions, based on a zzso of zzso zzso The method, which we called Natural zzso zzso zzso zzso is also able to detect to a certain extent overlapping peaks, even when appearing as zzso Several factors such as the zzso influence in the peak shape, the experimental error in the zzso calculations, or the minimum separation between zzso in order to be properly resolved are zzso The method is zzso with real samples, demonstrating the possibility of finding overlapping zzso in zzso and in zzso of zzso
