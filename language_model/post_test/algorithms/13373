Currently, the tandem mass zzso zzso of peptides is a dominant technique used to identify peptides and consequently zzso The zzso fragmentation inside the mass zzso typically offers a spectrum containing several different groups of zzso The mass to charge zzso values of these zzso can be exactly calculated following simple rules based on the possible zzso fragmentation zzso But the zzso zzso of the particular zzso cannot be simply predicted from the zzso sequence of the zzso This study presents initial work towards developing a theoretical fundamental approach to zzso intensity zzso by utilizing quantum mechanical zzso 

zzso zzso of the doubly charged zzso zzso were collected on zzso zzso trap mass zzso using low energy modes of zzso zzso functional theory zzso calculations were performed on the population of zzso precursors to determine the zzso zzso zzso corresponding to a zzso distribution of the zzso of zzso in the zzso backbone zzso zzso 

We were able to a) predict the y and b zzso zzso order in concert with the experimental zzso b) predict relative zzso of y zzso with errors not exceeding the experimental zzso 

These results suggest that the zzso zzso fragmentation process in the zzso trap mass zzso is predominantly driven by the zzso stability of the precursor zzso formed upon zzso of the zzso The zzso approach presented in this manuscript successfully calculated zzso zzso in the mass zzso of this doubly charged zzso zzso based solely on its zzso acid zzso As such, this work indicates a potential of incorporating quantum mechanical calculations into mass zzso based zzso for molecular zzso
