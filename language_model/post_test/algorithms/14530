This paper presents a zzso framework in which the zzso properties of smooth muscle cells may be zzso The zzso of smooth muscles is considered in a three-dimensional zzso model which is key to realistically capture the function of hollow zzso such as blood zzso On the basis of a general zzso framework the mechanical and chemical zzso are specialized in order to zzso the coupled zzso zzso A zzso function is proposed as the sum of a mechanical energy stored in the passive zzso a zzso between the mechanical and chemical zzso and an energy related purely to the chemical zzso and the calcium zzso zzso For the chemical phase it is shown that the zzso model of Hai and Murphy zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso is included in the developed evolution law as a special zzso In order to show the specific features and the potential of the proposed zzso model a zzso extension test of a tissue strip is zzso in detail and the related zzso and zzso relations are zzso zzso studies point to zzso zzso in particular the tissue response is zzso in terms of the calcium zzso zzso The model for smooth muscle contraction may significantly contribute to current zzso efforts of smooth muscle tissue zzso
