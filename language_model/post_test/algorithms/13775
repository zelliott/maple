We propose a newborn zzso zzso zzso screening test based on the analysis of dried blood spot DNA by a strategy involving simple or multiplex zzso zzso gel zzso zzso of zzso products of zzso gene fragments, in conjunction with the zzso zzso zzso From May 1988 to May 1992 we have performed a zzso screening zzso of 42,000 newborns in zzso We identified 450 infants with an elevated zzso zzso From this zzso to evaluate the feasibility of measuring zzso in conjunction with zzso analysis in zzso cards, a pilot study was initially conducted on 200 individuals with normal zzso and 150 with raised zzso zzso Furthermore, a retrospective study was performed on 189 zzso positive cards, involving zzso scanning of zzso 10 and 11 of the zzso zzso which contains a number of frequent zzso including the deletion delta zzso We show that this approach has several implications for zzso zzso screening especially in decreasing the recall rate and detecting zzso zzso
