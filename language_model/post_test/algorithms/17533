SMART zzso Modular Architecture Research zzso is a web tool zzso for the identification and zzso of protein zzso and provides a platform for the comparative study of complex domain zzso in genes and zzso The January 2004 release of SMART contains 685 protein zzso New developments in SMART are zzso on the integration of data from completed zzso zzso SMART now uses predicted proteins from complete zzso in its source sequence databases, and zzso these with predictions of zzso New zzso tools have been developed to allow analysis of gene zzso structure within the context of protein domain structure, and to align these displays to provide zzso comparisons of zzso zzso or multiple transcripts from the same zzso Other improvements include the ability to query SMART by Gene zzso terms, improved structure database searching and batch retrieval of multiple zzso
