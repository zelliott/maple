In order to obtain a reasonably accurate model for the spread of a particular infectious disease through a population, it may be necessary for this model to possess some degree of structural zzso Many such models have, in recent years, been found to exhibit a phenomenon known as backward zzso which generally implies the existence of two zzso endemic zzso It is often possible to refine these models yet further, and we investigate here the influence such a refinement may have on the dynamic zzso of a system in the region of the zzso space near zzso We consider a natural extension to a so-called Core Group model for the spread of a sexually transmitted disease, arguing that this may in fact give rise to a more realistic zzso From the deterministic viewpoint we study the possible shapes of the resulting zzso zzso and the associated stability zzso zzso versions of both the original and the extended models are also developed so that the probability of extinction and time to extinction may be zzso allowing us to gain further insights into the complex system dynamics near zzso A number of interesting phenomena are observed, for which zzso explanations are zzso
