Several earlier studies have noted the shortcomings with existing geometric design guides which provide deterministic zzso In these standards the safety margin of the design output is generally unknown and there is little knowledge of the safety implications of zzso from the zzso To mitigate these shortcomings, zzso geometric design has been advocated where reliability analysis can be used to account for the uncertainty in the design parameters and to provide a mechanism for risk measurement to evaluate the safety impact of zzso from design zzso This paper applies reliability analysis for zzso the safety of highway zzso The paper presents an original methodology to select a suitable combination of zzso elements with restricted sight distance to result in reduced zzso and consistent risk zzso The purpose of this zzso method is to provide designers with a proactive approach to the design of zzso elements in order to zzso minimize the risk associated with restricted sight distance, zzso balance the risk across the two zzso of the highway, and zzso reduce the expected collision zzso A case study involving nine zzso that are parts of two major highway developments in British Columbia, Canada, was zzso The results showed that an additional reduction in zzso can be realized by incorporating the reliability zzso zzso zzso the probability of zzso in the zzso zzso The proposed approach results in reduced and consistent risk levels for both travel directions in addition to further collision zzso
