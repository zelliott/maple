An important aspect of kinetic modeling is the ability to provide zzso information on network control and dynamic responses to genetic or environmental zzso based on innate zzso zzso In a zzso approach to model zzso unknown kinetic parameters are calculated using experimental data such as zzso pool zzso and transient labeling patterns after supply of an zzso labeled zzso These kinetic parameters can then be used to calculate flux control zzso for every reaction in a network, which aids in the identification of zzso reactions that exert the most control over the network as a zzso This chapter describes a modeling approach to estimate kinetic parameters which are then used to perform zzso control zzso An example is provided for the zzso network of zzso zzso however, the zzso can be applied to any small segment of zzso
