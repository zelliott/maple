zzso zzso is a critical zzso step to the analysis of swallowing signal zzso In an effort to automatically segment zzso we investigated artificial neural networks zzso with information from cervical zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our objectives were zzso to investigate the relationship between zzso performance and the number of signal sources and zzso to identify the signals or signal combinations most useful for swallow zzso zzso were acquired from 17 healthy adults in both discrete and continuous swallowing tasks using five zzso Training and test feature zzso were constructed with zzso from single or multiple signals, estimated within 200 zzso moving windows with 50% zzso zzso zzso target labels zzso or zzso were derived by manual zzso A separate zzso ANN was trained for each zzso zzso and all possible signal combinations were zzso As more signal sources were included, zzso performance improved in terms of sensitivity, zzso zzso and adjusted zzso The combination of all four signal sources achieved the highest mean accuracy and adjusted accuracy of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso proved to be the most zzso source, while the inclusion of zzso or zzso zzso resulted in the least performance zzso These findings suggest that an zzso zzso fusion approach to zzso is worthy of further investigation in swallowing zzso
