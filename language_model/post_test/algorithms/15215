In the past years, mass zzso statistical analyses of zzso data have been zzso by the use of zzso pattern zzso especially based on machine learning zzso While these allow an increased sensitivity for the detection of zzso distributed effects compared to zzso techniques, they lack an established and accessible software zzso The goal of this work was to build a zzso zzso all the necessary zzso for zzso analyses of zzso data, based on machine learning zzso The zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso therefore being suitable for both cognitive and clinical zzso zzso In addition, it is designed to facilitate novel contributions from developers, aiming to improve the interaction between the zzso and machine learning zzso Here, we introduce zzso by presenting examples of possible research questions that can be addressed with the machine learning framework implemented in zzso and cannot be easily investigated with mass zzso statistical zzso
