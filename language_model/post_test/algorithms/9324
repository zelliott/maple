The idea that zzso mediates the reinforcing effects of stimuli persists in the field of zzso The present study shows that haloperidol, a zzso zzso does not eliminate the reinforcing value of food zzso The ratio of zzso changed seven times across two levers within sessions, modeling a dynamic zzso The magnitude of the zzso was manipulated independently of the zzso zzso Four doses of zzso zzso were assessed over periods of 12 daily zzso zzso did not impair the discrimination that the rats established between rich and lean zzso the response zzso favored the lever associated with the higher probability of reinforcement and the larger zzso The parameters of the generalized matching law zzso and zzso were used to estimate effects of zzso upon the motor system and upon the zzso motivation for food zzso
