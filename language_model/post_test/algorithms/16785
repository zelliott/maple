We propose to assess the contribution of zzso genetic zzso zzso to the combined test zzso as a method of zzso sequential screening zzso zzso CT, 2nd zzso zzso for zzso abnormalities in the general population of pregnant zzso 

Prospective zzso During a 4 year study period zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso underwent a CT combined with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as a screening method for zzso zzso We assessed sensitivity and false positive rate zzso zzso zzso 

We offered a zzso abnormalities screening test to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso cases are analyzed zzso zzso CT, 2nd zzso zzso including 49 zzso abnormalities and 35 zzso syndrome zzso The sensitivity of CT for zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for all zzso abnormalities zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso If zzso was combined with CT, the sensitivity for zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for all zzso abnormalities zzso zzso zzso zzso for a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The addition of an zzso to combined zzso screening test for zzso improved sensitivity by zzso while only increasing the zzso by zzso
