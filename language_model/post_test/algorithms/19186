zzso zzso therapy zzso has seen a zzso partially prompted by the development of zzso with longer zzso zzso that enable the treatment of larger tissue zzso Here, we study whether using zzso with zzso zzso zzso profiles, rather than conventional ones with flat zzso profiles, improves our ability to conform the light dose to the zzso We present a modified zzso linear feasibility zzso to solve the treatment planning problem, which improves upon previous zzso by zzso correctly minimizing the cost function that penalizes zzso from the prescribed light dose, and zzso zzso the inverse zzso Based on this algorithm, treatment plans were obtained under a variety of light delivery scenarios using zzso standard or tailored zzso The sensitivity of the resulting light dose zzso to uncertainties in the optical properties, and the placement of zzso was also zzso We find that tailored zzso only marginally outperform conventional ones in terms of prostate coverage and zzso zzso Furthermore, it is shown that small zzso in optical properties can lead to large changes in the light dose distribution, but that those changes can be largely corrected with a simple light dose zzso Finally, we find that prostate coverage is only minimally affected by small changes in zzso zzso Our results suggest that prostate zzso is not likely to benefit from the use of tailored zzso Other locations with more complex zzso might see a better zzso
