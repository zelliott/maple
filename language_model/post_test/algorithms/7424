The zzso staging system is based on three zzso zzso factors: zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, cancer is no longer considered an zzso zzso zzso the zzso should be expanded to accommodate new zzso factors in order to increase the accuracy of zzso cancer patient zzso The ensemble zzso for zzso cancer data zzso by Chen et zzso reflects an effort to expand the zzso without changing its basic zzso Though results on using zzso have been reported, there has been no study on the analysis of the zzso In this report, we examine various aspects of zzso using a large breast cancer patient zzso We compared the output of zzso with the corresponding survival curves, investigated the effect of different settings in zzso and compared zzso with alternative zzso zzso 

Using the basic T and N zzso zzso generated a zzso that shows a graphic relationship among the survival zzso of the breast cancer zzso The zzso from zzso are robust for large values of m (the number of runs in the learning zzso When m is large, the zzso depend on the linkage zzso The statistical tests, however, employed in the learning step have minimal effect on the zzso for large zzso In addition, if omitting the step for learning zzso in zzso the resulting approaches can have a zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso only based on zzso factors could generate misleading zzso and direct use of zzso techniques could lead to misleading assignments to zzso 

When only the zzso Around zzso zzso zzso is involved in the step of learning zzso large values of m are required to obtain robust zzso and for a large m zzso can effectively cluster cancer patient zzso
