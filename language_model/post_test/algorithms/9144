Protecting the ownership and controlling the copies of digital data have become very important issues in Internet-based zzso zzso zzso technology allows the zzso recovery of zzso databases after the embedded zzso data are detected or zzso In this paper, we propose a new, blind, zzso robust zzso scheme that can be used to provide proof of ownership for the owner of a zzso zzso In the proposed zzso a zzso zzso algorithm, which is referred to as zzso shifting of adjacent zzso zzso zzso is used to obtain zzso The proposed scheme can detect successfully zzso of the embedded zzso data, even if as much as zzso of the zzso zzso database is zzso Our extensive analysis and experimental results show that the proposed scheme is robust against a variety of data attacks, for example, zzso attacks, deletion attacks, zzso attacks, and sorting zzso
