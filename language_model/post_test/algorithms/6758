The relative success of chemical oxygen demand zzso removal models to describe measured rates of zzso removal in a zzso constructed zzso designed for treatment of zzso winery wastewater are evaluated using retention times determined from zzso zzso Not surprisingly, zzso residual and zzso models better fit the measured removal data than zzso zzso zzso models for wastewater at average zzso zzso up to nearly zzso zzso The residual and zzso models yielded nearly equivalent fits to the measured zzso However, the zzso model had more consistent parameters for zzso removal data across different depth levels in the constructed zzso and at different zzso and a slightly smaller sum of zzso zzso The zzso model seems to be appropriate for constructed zzso design because it allows a steady decrease in zzso with increased treatment time rather than a constant residual zzso zzso zzso From the zzso zzso procedure used to estimate model parameters (a zzso rate constant, zzso range of 3 to 12 zzso zzso or physically meaningless, large zzso values zzso range of 23 to 450 zzso zzso that were dependent on zzso loading were zzso potentially zzso the constructed zzso system's actual winery wastewater treatment zzso The optimal parameters for the zzso model applied to the zzso constructed zzso ranged from 9 to 12 zzso for the initial degradation rate constant, zzso and 2 to 5 zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso These values should be verified for zzso field systems based on field zzso currently zzso
