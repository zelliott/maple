In this paper, we propose a simple frequency offset zzso zzso zzso for high-speed coherent optical zzso zzso zzso zzso systems, which avoids the exhaustive search zzso on the zzso part of zzso by using a merit zzso In time domain, the zzso zzso can estimate all the frequency offset in the range of zzso zzso for satisfying the practical application requirement, based on only one redesigned training zzso In addition, we provide the theoretical analysis about the quantitative influences of the residual frequency offset zzso on zzso zzso In order to reduce the final zzso error, a new zzso residual frequency offset zzso zzso zzso is also proposed in this zzso Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed zzso and zzso zzso are demonstrated in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso system by the zzso and zzso results validate the proposed zzso
