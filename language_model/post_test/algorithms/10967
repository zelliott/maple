The crystal structure of zzso a protein zzso by a hypothetical open reading frame zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined at zzso A zzso The only sequence similarity exhibited by the zzso sequence of zzso was a zzso identity with the sequence of zzso from zzso zzso The 19 zzso zzso protein was observed to consist of a right-handed zzso assembled from a tandem repeat of ten zzso A structural zzso search using the zzso and zzso zzso indicates that this protein can be classified as a zzso repeat zzso
