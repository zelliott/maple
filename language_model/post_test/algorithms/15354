There is convincing experimental evidence that cellular action potential duration zzso zzso is zzso but its relationship with body surface zzso zzso zzso zzso remains zzso We investigated the relationship between zzso and zzso zzso induced by alternating cycle length zzso pacing in a pig zzso 

In 10 zzso zzso in the right atrium zzso and right zzso and left zzso zzso allowed pacing and recording of zzso action zzso zzso During zzso pacing at stable zzso zzso zzso was paced at alternating zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the alternating zzso zzso pacing delay changes the size of the region with alternating zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso was correlated with body surface zzso In a similar setup (during alternating pacing in RV and zzso we investigated zzso versus zzso zzso zzso 

zzso the zzso with subtle alternating cycle lengths at short zzso delay leads to broad zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso body surface zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and positive zzso zzso At longer zzso zzso not resulting in zzso widening zzso zzso 5 zzso body surface zzso zzso was absent but zzso remained zzso and was even more pronounced zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso During both zzso and zzso pacing zzso was zzso The zzso leads were better for detecting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso is a potent technique to detect subtle and isolated zzso zzso zzso that is artificially induced by alternating zzso In the same model, zzso zzso zzso can only be zzso from zzso when using a zzso approach of zzso zzso
