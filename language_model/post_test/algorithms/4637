In recent years, several authors have used zzso zzso models to learn expression zzso and their regulatory programs from gene expression zzso Despite the demonstrated success of such zzso in uncovering biologically relevant regulatory relations, further developments in the area are hampered by a lack of tools to compare the performance of alternative module network learning zzso Here, we demonstrate the use of the synthetic data generator zzso for the purpose of testing and comparing module network learning zzso We introduce a software package for learning module networks, called zzso which incorporates a novel strategy for learning regulatory zzso zzso include the use of a bottom-up zzso zzso zzso to construct the regulatory programs, and the use of a conditional zzso measure to assign regulators to the regulation program zzso Using zzso data, we test the performance of zzso in a completely controlled situation and assess the effect of the zzso changes we made with respect to an existing software package, namely zzso Additionally, we assess the effect of various zzso such as the size of the data set and the amount of noise, on the zzso zzso 

Overall, application of zzso and zzso to simulated data sets gave comparable zzso However, zzso offers some advantages, one of them being that the learning process is considerably faster for larger data zzso Additionally, we show that the location of the regulators in the zzso regulation programs and their conditional zzso may be used to prioritize regulators for functional zzso and that the combination of the bottom-up zzso strategy with the conditional zzso assignment of regulators improves the handling of missing or hidden zzso 

We show that data zzso such as zzso are very well suited for the purpose of developing, testing and improving module network zzso We used zzso data to develop and test an alternative module network learning strategy, which is incorporated in the software package zzso and we provide evidence that this alternative strategy has several advantages with respect to existing zzso
