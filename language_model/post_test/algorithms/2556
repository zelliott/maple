An zzso for blind zzso of zzso time zzso in speech signals is zzso Analysis is restricted to the zzso regions of the zzso where the zzso effect zzso yielding a more accurate zzso estimate at a reduced zzso zzso A spectral decomposition is performed on the zzso signal and partial zzso estimates are determined in all signal zzso providing more data to the zzso stage of the algorithm, which yields the final zzso zzso Algorithm performance is assessed using two distinct speech databases, achieving zzso and zzso correlation with the zzso measured by a standard zzso method, indicating that the proposed method blindly estimates the zzso in a reliable and consistent zzso
