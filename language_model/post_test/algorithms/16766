Automatic and accurate lung field zzso is an essential step for developing an automated zzso diagnosis system for chest zzso Although active shape model zzso has been useful in many medical imaging applications, lung field zzso remains a challenge due to the superimposed anatomical zzso We propose an automatic lung field zzso technique to address the zzso of zzso in lung field zzso Experimental results using both normal and abnormal chest zzso show that the proposed technique provides better performance and can achieve zzso improvement on zzso sensitivity and specificity compared to traditional zzso zzso
