We report on the first zzso of a zzso avalanche zzso zzso in zzso complementary metal oxide semiconductor zzso zzso The detector features an zzso zzso region and a guard ring to prevent premature edge breakdown using a standard mask set zzso The proposed structure emerged from a systematic study aimed at zzso while zzso overall zzso The guard ring design is the result of an extensive modeling effort aimed at constraining the zzso region within a zzso area where the electric field exceeds the critical value for impact zzso The device exhibits a dark count rate of zzso zzso a maximum zzso detection probability of zzso and the jitter of zzso at a wavelength of zzso all of them measured at room temperature and zzso of excess bias zzso An zzso probability of zzso is achieved at the nominal dead zzso zzso include zzso zzso vision, zzso lifetime imaging zzso zzso correlation zzso and zzso zzso zzso Standard characterization of the zzso was performed in different bias zzso and zzso
