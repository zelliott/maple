This paper suggests a method for zzso damage zzso The method is based on zzso zzso of Lamb waves combined with a baseline zzso technique in the zzso zzso Small zzso converted zzso generated during the interaction of zzso waves with damage, can thus be detected with minimal a zzso information regarding their expected location in the zzso zzso This method is applied in the present paper to a case of notches with varied zzso zzso element simulations are carried out in the zzso domain to mimic results zzso in real-world zzso Two cases are zzso namely when each of the two pure fundamental modes are incident on a zzso The advantages of the method are zzso The procedure to implement this method is described in the context of zzso Health Monitoring zzso or zzso Testing zzso
