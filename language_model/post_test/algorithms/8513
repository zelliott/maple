Many real-world medical applications require timely actions to be taken in time pressured zzso zzso approaches to dynamic decision modeling have provided relatively efficient methods for representing and reasoning, but the process of computing the optimal solution has remained zzso A major reason for this difficulty is the lack of models that are capable of modeling zzso processes and dealing with zzso zzso This paper presents a zzso called the zzso dynamic influence zzso that provide the capability for both zzso and space zzso To deal with the time zzso we exploit the concept of space and zzso abstraction to reduce the zzso complexity and propose an anytime zzso for the solution zzso We illustrate through out the paper, the various approaches with the use of a medical problem on the treatment of cardiac zzso
