zzso monitoring of zzso activity is a prerequisite for modern zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso ought to be distinguished by zzso template analysis of the zzso zzso A prerequisite is that zzso signals are stable under different zzso 

A zzso routine was developed to analyze zzso zzso of 23 patients at least 3 months after zzso of a dual chamber zzso under several conditions including at rest, bipolar at rest, in an upright position, during treadmill exercise, and zzso A zzso and zzso template was created and zzso zzso and slew rates were zzso In bipolar zzso zzso zzso at rest was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at peak zzso zzso zzso at rest was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at peak exercise zzso for bipolar zzso No overall significant changes were observed for zzso and zzso zzso and slew rates during zzso zzso zzso distances of the zzso zzso lead position, and the presence of zzso zzso disease did not have any impact on overall zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso differences between rest and peak exercise were moderate zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso 

zzso near and far fields can be automatically classified and zzso by automated signal zzso zzso did not change during exercise or change of zzso This is a prerequisite for the zzso of zzso template analysis into zzso
