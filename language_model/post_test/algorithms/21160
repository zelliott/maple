zzso zzso imaging zzso has not been used widely for zzso imaging zzso of the spinal cord, because of the magnetic field zzso around the spine, the small zzso size of the spinal cord, and the increased motion in that area due to breathing, zzso and zzso fluid zzso zzso These result in artifacts with the usually long zzso duration of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso methods decrease the required zzso duration for zzso thereby enabling its practical application to imaging of the zzso In this work, a reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso method is proposed, in which a zzso zzso selective zzso zzso zzso pulse and a 180 degrees zzso pulse reduce the zzso in the zzso zzso direction, while suppressing the signal from fat zzso With this method, zzso slice images with higher zzso resolutions zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso are achieved at zzso zzso without the need for a longer zzso
