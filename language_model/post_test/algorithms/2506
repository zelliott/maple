The zzso pressure dependent zzso zzso of bovine zzso bone is investigated through experimental and zzso zzso Two loading zzso are zzso zzso and confined zzso providing two distinct loading paths in the von zzso stress zzso Experimental results reveal distinctive yielding followed by a constant nominal stress plateau for both zzso and confined zzso zzso simulation of the experimental tests using the zzso and zzso plasticity models fails to capture the confined zzso zzso of zzso zzso The high pressure developed during confined zzso does not result in plastic deformation using these zzso and a near elastic response is zzso In contrast, the zzso foam plasticity models provide accurate simulation of the confined zzso tests, with distinctive yield and plateau zzso being zzso The elliptical yield surfaces of the zzso foam zzso in the von zzso stress plane accurately zzso the plastic zzso of zzso zzso zzso reveal that the zzso yield stress is equal to the zzso yield stress for zzso bone, demonstrating the importance of accurate zzso and simulation of the pressure dependent zzso It is also demonstrated in this study that a commercially available zzso bone analogue material, cellular rigid zzso foam, exhibits similar pressure dependent yield zzso despite having a lower zzso and strength than zzso zzso This study provides a novel insight into the pressure dependent yield zzso of zzso bone, demonstrating the zzso of zzso testing zzso For the first time, zzso foam plasticity zzso are implemented for zzso zzso The enhanced understanding of the zzso zzso of zzso bone established in this study will allow for more realistic simulation of zzso device zzso and zzso
