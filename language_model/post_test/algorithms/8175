In zzso clinical trials, a zzso measurement is often taken at zzso and zzso effects are measured at several time points zzso say zzso zzso zzso At the end of the trial, it is of interest to assess the treatment effect based on the mean change from baseline at the last time point zzso We consider statistical methods for zzso a point estimate and 95 per cent confidence zzso for the mean change from baseline at time T for each treatment group, and zzso a zzso and 95 per cent confidence zzso for the zzso difference in the mean change from zzso The manner in which the baseline responses are used in the analysis influences both the accuracy and the efficiency of items zzso and zzso In this paper, we will consider the zzso approach with change from baseline as a dependent variable and compare that with a constrained zzso data analysis zzso model proposed by Liang and zzso zzso Indian zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in which the baseline is modeled as a dependent variable in conjunction with the constraint of a common baseline mean across the treatment zzso Some drawbacks of the zzso model and potential advantages of the zzso approach are discussed and illustrated using zzso zzso
