Earlier diagnosis of zzso cancer could help improve survival so better tools are needed to help zzso 

To derive and validate an zzso to zzso the absolute risk of zzso cancer in patients in primary care with and without zzso 

zzso study using data from 375 UK zzso general practices for development and 189 for zzso 

Included patients were aged zzso years, free at baseline from a diagnosis of zzso cancer and without zzso zzso abdominal pain, appetite loss, or weight loss in the previous 12 zzso The primary outcome was incident diagnosis of zzso cancer recorded in the next 2 zzso zzso factors examined were age, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol status, zzso diabetes, inflammatory zzso disease, family history of gastrointestinal cancer, gastrointestinal zzso history of another cancer, zzso zzso abdominal pain, abdominal zzso appetite loss, weight loss, zzso zzso change of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Cox zzso hazards models were used to develop separate risk equations in males and zzso zzso of zzso and discrimination assessed performance in the validation zzso 

There were zzso incident cases of zzso cancer from zzso million zzso in the derivation zzso Independent zzso in males and females included family history of gastrointestinal cancer, zzso zzso zzso abdominal pain, appetite loss, and weight zzso Alcohol consumption and recent change in zzso habit were also zzso in zzso On zzso the zzso explained zzso of the variation in females and zzso in zzso The receiver operating curve statistics were zzso zzso and zzso zzso The D statistic was zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of patients with the highest predicted risks contained zzso of all zzso zzso diagnosed over the next 2 zzso 

The zzso has good discrimination and zzso and could potentially be used to help identify those at highest risk of current zzso cancer, to facilitate early referral and zzso
