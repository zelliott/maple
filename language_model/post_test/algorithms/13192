The zzso evolution of gene networks functions like a forward genetic screen to zzso without zzso all networks that can be assembled from a defined list of parts to implement a given zzso Frequently networks are subject to multiple design criteria that cannot all be zzso zzso To explore how these tradeoffs interact with evolution, we implement zzso zzso in the context of gene network zzso In response to a zzso pulse of a zzso we evolve networks whose output turns on slowly after the pulse begins, and shuts down rapidly when the pulse zzso The best performing networks under our conditions do not fall into categories such as feed forward and negative feedback that also zzso the zzso relation we used for zzso zzso evolution can more efficiently search the space of networks than zzso based on a single ad hoc combination of the design zzso
