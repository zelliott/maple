The zzso DNA of the zzso contains both sequence information directly relating to the protein and zzso coding as well as functional and structural information relating to protein zzso Only recently is the importance of DNA shape in this recognition process being fully zzso and it also appears that minor groove zzso potential may contribute significantly in guiding proteins to their zzso binding sites in the zzso Based on the zzso probing results, we have derived an zzso that predicts the minor groove zzso potential in a DNA zzso of any given zzso We have validated this model on a series of zzso binding sites known to involve minor groove zzso recognition as well as on stable zzso core zzso The zzso allows for the first time a full minor groove zzso description at the zzso resolution of any zzso and it is illustrated how such detailed studies of this sequence dependent, inherent property of the DNA may reflect on zzso organization, gene expression and zzso zzso
