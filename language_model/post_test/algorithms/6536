An attractive application of expression technologies is to predict drug efficacy or safety using expression data of zzso To evaluate the performance of various zzso methods for building zzso models, we applied these methods on six expression zzso These zzso were from studies using zzso technologies and had either two or more zzso From each of the original zzso two zzso were generated to simulate two scenarios in zzso zzso First, a zzso subset was used to simulate a candidate gene approach when it might not be practical to measure a large number of zzso Next, a zzso subset was used to simulate a whole zzso zzso We evaluated the relative performance of several zzso methods by using zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although all methods perform well in both zzso for a relative easy zzso with two classes, differences in performance do exist among methods for other zzso Overall, partial least squares zzso analysis zzso and support zzso machines zzso outperform all other zzso We suggest a practical approach to take advantage of multiple methods in zzso zzso
