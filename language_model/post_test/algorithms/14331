Combining the concept of lateral zzso zzso zzso within a digital zzso zzso we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain quantitative optical phase measurement in zzso by a new zzso zzso zzso lateral zzso of the reconstructed zzso in the image plane makes it possible to retrieve the zzso of the zzso and remove the zzso aberration term introduced by the microscope zzso The method is tested to investigate a silicon structure and a mouse cell zzso
