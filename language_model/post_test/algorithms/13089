A drastic reduction of the time required for two-dimensional zzso experiments can be achieved by reducing or skipping the recovery delay between successive zzso Novel zzso Recovery Times zzso methods use zzso zzso field zzso in three spatial directions to select the desired pathways and suppress interference zzso zzso zzso of dilute zzso acids with zzso as low as 2 zzso can be recorded in about zzso s per zzso in the indirect zzso
