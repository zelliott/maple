The optimal zzso trajectory is needed to assist surgeons in planning Deep Brain zzso zzso A method for zzso trajectory planning was developed and zzso 

Rules governing the zzso surgical procedure were defined with geometric zzso A formal geometric solver using zzso brain images and a template built from 15 brain zzso scans were used to identify a space of possible solutions and select the optimal zzso For zzso a retrospective study of 30 zzso zzso zzso from 18 patients was zzso A trajectory was zzso in each case and compared with the zzso of the zzso that were actually zzso 

zzso zzso had an average difference of zzso compared with reference zzso and achieved a better overall score based on satisfaction of geometric zzso zzso were zzso in 2 zzso for each zzso 

A zzso solver using zzso MR brain images can automatically zzso relevant and accurate zzso zzso zzso zzso
