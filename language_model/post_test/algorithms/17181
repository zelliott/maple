zzso have been used in optical zzso to zzso the distribution and intensity of substances to which they are zzso zzso measures of optical density in the microscopic images can in principle be used to determine the amount of the zzso When multiple zzso are used to simultaneously zzso several substances to which they are specifically zzso zzso of each stain cannot be made using any single wavelength because zzso from the several stain components contributes to the total optical zzso Although various zzso used as optical zzso are perceived as specific colors, they, in fact, have complex zzso zzso In this paper, we present a technique for multiple wavelength image acquisition and spectral decomposition based upon the zzso zzso zzso This zzso is implemented based on the different spectral properties of the various stain zzso By using images captured at N zzso N components with different colors can be zzso This zzso is applied to zzso images of doubly and zzso labeled prostate tissue zzso zzso applications are zzso
