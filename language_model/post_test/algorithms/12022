This paper describes a zzso and experimental investigation of flow in a zzso model geometry of a fully zzso 45 zzso zzso zzso zzso Previous investigations have considered a similar zzso where the zzso of the bypass and host vessels lie within a plane, thereby producing a plane of symmetry within the zzso We have extended these investigations by zzso the bypass vessel out of the plane of zzso thereby breaking the symmetry of the flow and producing a zzso zzso Experimental data were obtained using magnetic resonance imaging of flow within zzso models and zzso data were obtained from simulations using a zzso zzso element zzso We found that the zzso three-dimensional flow notably alters the distribution of wall zzso stress at the bed of the zzso reducing the peak wall zzso stress peak by approximately 10 percent when compared with the zzso zzso Furthermore, an increase in the absolute flux of zzso into the zzso region, zzso to the zzso of 80 percent was observed in the zzso geometry when compared with the zzso zzso
