The supervised learning of zzso neural networks zzso for prediction of protein secondary structures from the underlying zzso acids sequence is zzso Modular zzso zzso neural networks zzso are proposed to model the strong correlations between adjacent secondary structure zzso Besides, a zzso zzso zzso neural network zzso is introduced to capture the long-range zzso interactions between zzso acids in formation of the secondary zzso The final modular prediction system is devised based on the interactive integration of the zzso and the zzso structures to arbitrarily engage the neighboring effects of the secondary structure types concurrent with zzso the sequential zzso of zzso acids along the protein zzso The advanced combined network zzso the percentage accuracy zzso to zzso and boosts the segment overlap zzso up to zzso when tested on the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
