Extension of the dynamic range of liquid crystal zzso zzso filter is demonstrated by incorporating with it a liquid crystal variable zzso as an zzso for the third and fourth order zzso The filter is continuously zzso in the range 500 zzso to 900 zzso with a nominal zzso in the range zzso Design procedure is described including the exact solution to the zzso director profile and the suitability for biomedical optical imaging zzso zzso in the design is proposed by applying different zzso to the different liquid crystal zzso thus zzso for small thickness zzso from the nominal values and obtaining the high dynamic zzso
