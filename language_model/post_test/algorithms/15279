The purpose of the research was to introduce a procedure to derive a powder zzso zzso zzso zzso representing particle yield stress using an effective medium equation and to compare the zzso A zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso 16 pharmaceutical zzso including drugs and zzso were compressed in a materials testing instrument and powder zzso profiles were derived using the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso profiles thus obtained could be zzso into regions among which one region was approximately linear and from this region, the zzso parameters zzso A and zzso were zzso A linear relationship between the zzso A zzso and the zzso zzso was obtained with a strong zzso The slope of the plot was close to 1 zzso and the intercept of the plot was small in comparison to the range of zzso values zzso The relationship between the theoretical zzso A zzso and the zzso zzso supports the interpretation of the empirical zzso zzso as being a measure of yield zzso It is concluded that the combination of zzso and zzso equations represents a suitable procedure to derive a value of particle plasticity from powder zzso zzso
