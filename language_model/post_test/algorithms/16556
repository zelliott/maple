Most animals exhibit significant neurological and zzso change throughout their zzso No robots to date, however, grow new zzso structure while zzso This is due to technological limitations but also because it is unclear that zzso change provides a benefit to the acquisition of robust behavior in zzso Here I show that in evolving populations of simulated robots, if robots grow from zzso into zzso robots during their lifetime in the early stages of evolution, and the zzso body plan is gradually lost during later stages of evolution, zzso are evolved for the final, zzso form of the robot more zzso the evolved zzso are more zzso to evolving populations of zzso robots that do not transition through the zzso body zzso This suggests that zzso change, as well as the evolution of development, are two important processes that improve the automatic generation of robust behaviors for zzso It also provides an experimental platform for investigating the relationship between the evolution of development and robust behavior in biological zzso
