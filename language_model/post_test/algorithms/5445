Copy number data are routinely being extracted from zzso association study chips using a variety of zzso We zzso evaluated and compared four zzso software packages designed for zzso zzso chips to estimate copy zzso zzso Power zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our evaluation used 1,418 zzso samples that were zzso on the zzso zzso Human zzso zzso zzso We compared bias and zzso in the zzso copy number data, the zzso amongst regions of copy number zzso and the zzso rate amongst deleted zzso 

zzso had median zzso copy numbers closest to a value of two, whereas zzso and zzso had the smallest zzso associated with the median copy zzso Of those zzso only zzso provides copy number specific quality-control metrics and identified 136 poor zzso zzso zzso of copy number variation zzso were detected using the hidden zzso models provided within zzso and zzso zzso detected more zzso than zzso the median number of zzso detected per sample was 39 and 30, zzso zzso detected most of the regions that zzso did as well as additional zzso zzso The median zzso between zzso and zzso was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso The estimated zzso rate associated with deletions was similar for zzso and zzso 

If the objective is to perform statistical tests on the zzso copy number data, our empirical results suggest that zzso or zzso is zzso If the objective is to perform statistical tests on the summarized segmented data then zzso would be preferred over zzso Specifically, zzso allows the analyst to estimate zzso copy number, perform zzso and evaluate zzso quality-control metrics within a single software zzso zzso has relatively small bias, small zzso and detects more regions while maintaining a similar estimated zzso rate as zzso More generally, we advocate that software developers need to provide guidance with respect to evaluating and choosing optimal settings in order to obtain optimal results for an individual zzso Until such guidance exists, we recommend trying multiple zzso evaluating zzso and subsequently consider the union of regions for downstream association zzso
