More than three zzso factors often work together to enable cells to respond to various zzso The detection of zzso regulation by multiple zzso factors, however, is not only zzso zzso but also extremely unlikely because of multiple testing zzso The exponential growth in the number of tests forces us to set a strict limit on the maximum zzso Here, we propose an efficient zzso zzso called the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to count the exact number of testable combinations and zzso the zzso factor to the smallest possible zzso zzso lists significant combinations without any limit, whereas the zzso error rate is rigorously controlled under the zzso In the human breast cancer zzso zzso discovered statistically significant combinations of as many as eight binding zzso This method may contribute to uncover pathways regulated in a coordinated fashion and find hidden associations in zzso zzso
