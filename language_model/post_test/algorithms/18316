zzso density is one of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso acids zzso which help in characterizing these entities in terms of their chemical composition and physical zzso In recent years equilibrium zzso in zzso buoyant density zzso has been proved to be a powerful tool for zzso zzso The method enables one to obtain information such as the absolute and the relative buoyant density of the material and its molecular zzso This communication describes a program in zzso which zzso these parameters from the raw data obtained directly from the zzso The program is fully zzso zzso and written keeping in view biologists and zzso as the main zzso The program has a built-in option to calculate either the absolute or the relative buoyant density and the molecular zzso
