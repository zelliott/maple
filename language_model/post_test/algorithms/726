Nearly 30 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are infected with zzso While recent commitment of resources from international donors is zzso rational use of these resources for AIDS prevention and care will require a major zzso up of zzso diagnostic services in affected zzso 

This paper considers the various settings and populations in which zzso testing might be zzso and the goals to be achieved by that zzso It also defines the practical information that public health decision makers in sub-Saharan Africa should have in order to choose an appropriate test or combination of tests for use in a particular clinical zzso 

Using a conditional probability model and published performance characteristics of rapid zzso zzso tests, the clinical effectiveness and costs of three major testing strategies are zzso zzso a single, highly sensitive zzso zzso a serial algorithm, where positive results on a first test are confirmed with a more specific second zzso and zzso a parallel algorithm, where each zzso is tested with two separate rapid tests, and zzso results are resolved with a third, different rapid zzso This analysis was performed in zzso 

We suggest that in any setting, both a serial and a parallel zzso yield fewer incorrect results than does a single screening zzso but are more zzso A parallel testing zzso yields fewer incorrect results than does a serial algorithm, but is more zzso 

We suggest that while a parallel testing zzso has the advantage of avoiding indeterminate results, that strategy may be zzso costly for many developing world zzso Furthermore, we suggest that different testing zzso are appropriate for different clinical zzso
