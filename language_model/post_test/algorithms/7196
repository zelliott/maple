This paper investigates zzso zzso zzso for resource allocation in direct sequence code division multiple access wireless visual sensor zzso We consider a zzso network zzso where each sensor zzso directly to a zzso control unit zzso that manages the available network zzso Our aim is to enable the zzso to jointly allocate the transmission power and zzso coding rates for each zzso under four different zzso criteria that take into consideration the varying motion characteristics of each recorded zzso For this purpose, we studied two approaches with a different zzso of quality and zzso The first one zzso the resources individually for each zzso whereas the second clusters them according to the recorded level of zzso In order to address the dynamic nature of the recorded scenery and zzso the resources whenever it is dictated by the changes in the amount of motion in the zzso we propose a mechanism based on the particle swarm zzso algorithm, combined with two zzso schemes that either exploit the previously determined resource allocation or conduct a rough zzso of zzso Experimental simulations demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed zzso
