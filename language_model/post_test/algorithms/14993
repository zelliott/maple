Renal transplant candidates are at high risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiac zzso 

This study evaluated five clinical risk zzso at least 50 years, zzso diabetes zzso zzso zzso heart failure and an abnormal zzso zzso zzso left zzso zzso had been used in the first tier of a two-tiered zzso applied risk zzso zzso 

Using multiple zzso zzso analysis, age at least 50 years, abnormal zzso and diabetes zzso were independently zzso of cardiac zzso Of the two remaining clinical risk factors, the presence of angina had independent zzso value for nonfatal cardiac events zzso zzso coronary zzso bypass surgery, and unstable zzso The independent zzso value of zzso heart failure approached statistical zzso 

Clinical zzso analysis is helpful in identifying zzso transplant candidates at high risk for fatal or nonfatal cardiac zzso
