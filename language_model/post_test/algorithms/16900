On the one hand, the critical nitrogen zzso content curve allows the minimal N content necessary for maximum growth rate at any stage of crop development to be zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso zzso zzso transfer N from the soil to the plants and its growth and activity depends on the availability of soil zzso Our objective was to investigate how the availability of N in the soil affects growth and the zzso of N in zzso zzso zzso Root zzso dry matter zzso and the critical zzso curve were studied during growth of zzso and zzso zzso plants grown at several N zzso 

zzso The increase in the availability of N zzso root zzso by zzso zzso The effect of zzso on plant growth depended on N availability and the plant zzso zzso zzso The critical zzso zzso were fitted by the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso plants, respectively (where zzso is the weight of leaf dry matter, in g zzso 

N availability was a key factor for root zzso by zzso and for its contribution to plant zzso The patterns of the critical zzso zzso suggest that zzso modified the zzso N use zzso
