In the program zzso we provide a methodology for quickly ordering random clones into a physical zzso The process of ordering individual clones with respect to their position along a zzso is based on the similarity of zzso signatures assigned to each zzso This zzso signature is obtained by zzso each clone to a panel of zzso zzso By using the fact that the amount of overlap between any two clones is reflected in the similarity of their zzso signatures, it is possible to reconstruct a zzso by minimizing the sum of linking distances between an ordered sequence of zzso Unlike other programs for physical zzso zzso is very general in the types of data that can be zzso for zzso zzso Any trait that can be scored in a zzso manner, such as zzso synthetic zzso restriction zzso recognition sites or single copy landmarks, can be used for zzso Furthermore, the zzso requirements for the construction of large physical maps can be measured in a matter of hours on zzso such as the zzso
