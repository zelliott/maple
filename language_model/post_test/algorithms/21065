zzso employs freezing for targeted destruction of zzso zzso such as zzso Ice front imaging has made controlled treatment of deep body tumors zzso One promising method, recently explored for this task, is zzso which recovers images of electrical zzso from zzso made at boundary zzso However, since frozen tissue near the ice front zzso ice front imaging is zzso Monitoring treatment effect would enable zzso zzso where zzso of zzso and need for further treatment are assessed upon zzso Since zzso zzso are strong barriers to low frequency electrical current and cell destruction implies impaired zzso zzso should be able to detect the desired effect of zzso cell zzso Previous work has tested zzso for ice front imaging with tank studies while others have simulated zzso in detecting zzso but in zzso tests have not been reported in either zzso To address this, we report zzso images of differential zzso throughout the zzso cycle in a rat liver model in zzso with zzso zzso first testing our system for ice front imaging in a gel and for viability imaging zzso in a raw potato zzso
