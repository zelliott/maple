zzso cancer has the worst survival for any cancer and is often diagnosed late when the cancer is zzso Chances of survival are more likely if patients can be diagnosed zzso 

To derive and validate an zzso to estimate absolute risk of having pancreatic cancer in patients with and without symptoms in primary zzso 

zzso study using data from 375 UK zzso general practices for development and 189 for zzso 

Included patients were aged zzso years, free at baseline from a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and had not had zzso abdominal pain, abdominal zzso appetite loss, or weight loss recorded in the preceding 12 zzso The primary outcome was incident diagnosis of pancreatic cancer recorded in the following 2 zzso zzso factors examined zzso age, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol, zzso diabetes, zzso previous diagnosis of cancer apart from pancreatic cancer, zzso abdominal pain, abdominal zzso appetite loss, weight loss, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Cox zzso hazards models were used to develop separate risk equations in males and zzso zzso of zzso and discrimination assessed performance in the validation zzso 

There were a total of zzso incident cases of pancreatic cancer from zzso million zzso in the derivation zzso Independent zzso in both males and females were age, smoking, type 2 diabetes, chronic zzso abdominal pain, appetite loss, and weight zzso zzso zzso was a predictor for females only; zzso and zzso were zzso for males zzso On zzso the zzso explained 59% of the variation in females and zzso in zzso The receiver operating characteristic statistics were zzso zzso and zzso zzso The D statistic was zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of patients with the highest predicted risks contained zzso of all pancreatic zzso diagnosed over the following 2 zzso 

The zzso has good discrimination and zzso and could potentially be used to help identify those at highest risk of pancreatic cancer to facilitate early referral and zzso
