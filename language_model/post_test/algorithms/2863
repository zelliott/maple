zzso percent of zzso children live in sub-Saharan zzso In the absence of diagnosis and zzso therapy, approximately 50% die before 2 zzso

A total of zzso children zzso age zzso zzso were screened for zzso zzso of whom 144 zzso were zzso Of these, zzso zzso underwent zzso DNA testing and 80 zzso were found to be zzso zzso Compared with zzso DNA testing, sensitivity and specificity of the zzso criteria were zzso and zzso and for zzso criteria zzso and zzso zzso zzso of severe immune zzso determined by zzso improved sensitivity of zzso and zzso criteria to zzso and zzso zzso however, specificity declined to zzso and zzso zzso 

Diagnosis of zzso infection among exposed children less than 18 months in a zzso zzso setting remains a challenge, and current recommended zzso have low zzso This underscores the need for rapid zzso of viral zzso for early infant zzso
