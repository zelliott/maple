zzso are usually discovered broken or zzso therefore reconstruction is inevitably the first step towards any comparative zzso We outline a general zzso framework by which missing information about biological specimens can be estimated using geometric zzso methods and discuss how this relates to effective zzso use of incomplete and distorted zzso Combining digital data resources with geometric zzso we go beyond the assembly of fragments on the zzso As in a three-dimensional zzso puzzle, we first assemble the virtual pieces zzso Then we use landmarks, several hundred zzso and information from complete specimens to estimate missing coordinates and correct for distortion zzso One can thus incorporate information from incomplete specimens in a comparative zzso analysis while keeping track of the uncertainties that result from partial preservation or zzso We exemplify our approach by reconstructing the fossil zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso As different assumptions and zzso lead to different zzso there exists no zzso zzso Instead one creates multiple zzso zzso distribution in a zzso zzso This distribution reflects uncertainty due to missing data values and sensitivity to prior zzso While there will typically be shape differences among equally plausible zzso these different estimates might still support a single zzso
