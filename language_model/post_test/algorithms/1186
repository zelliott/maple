This paper describes a pattern recognition architecture, which we term zzso zzso network zzso that learns to exploit image structure at multiple resolutions for detecting clinically significant features in zzso zzso The zzso architecture consists of a hierarchy of neural networks, each network receiving feature zzso at a given scale as well as features constructed by networks lower in the zzso Networks are trained using a novel error function for the supervised learning of image zzso tasks when the position of the objects to be found is uncertain or ill zzso We have evaluated the zzso ability to eliminate false positive zzso regions of interest generated by the University of Chicago's zzso zzso diagnosis zzso systems for zzso and mass zzso zzso show that the zzso architecture, trained using the uncertain object position zzso error function, reduces the zzso rate of a zzso zzso system by approximately 50% without significant loss in zzso Investigation into the types of zzso that the zzso eliminates suggests that the pattern zzso is automatically learning and exploiting contextual zzso Clinical utility is demonstrated through the evaluation of an integrated system in a clinical reader zzso We conclude that the zzso architecture learns contextual relationships between features at multiple scales and zzso these features for detecting zzso and breast zzso
