zzso experiments have revolutionized the study of gene expression with their ability to generate large amounts of zzso This article describes an alternative to existing approaches to zzso of gene expression zzso the key idea is to cluster in stages using a hierarchy of distance zzso This method is motivated by the way in which the human mind sorts and so groups many zzso The distance measures arise from the zzso breakup of zzso distance, giving us a set of independent measures of different attributes of the gene expression zzso zzso of these distances is closely related to the statistical design of the zzso zzso This zzso method not only zzso missing data but also leads to an associated zzso zzso 

The performance of the zzso and zzso methods was tested on a simulated zzso a zzso cell cycle zzso and a central nervous system development zzso Based on the Rand and adjusted Rand zzso the zzso method is more consistent with the biological zzso of the data than commonly used zzso zzso The zzso method, at varying levels of zzso zzso most zzso methods, based on root mean squared error zzso 

Code in R is available on request from the zzso
