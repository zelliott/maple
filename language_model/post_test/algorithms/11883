Gene identification in zzso DNA from zzso is complicated by the vast zzso possibilities of potential zzso zzso If the gene encodes a protein that is closely related to known zzso gene identification is aided by matching similarity of potential translation products to those target zzso The zzso DNA and protein sequences can be aligned directly by scoring the implied zzso of zzso zzso triplets against the protein zzso in conventional ways, while allowing for long gaps in the alignment corresponding to zzso in the zzso zzso We describe a novel method for such spliced zzso The method derives an optimal alignment based on scoring for both sequence similarity of the predicted gene product to the protein sequence and intrinsic zzso site strength of the predicted zzso Application of the method to a representative set of 50 known genes from zzso zzso showed significant improvement in prediction accuracy compared to previous spliced alignment zzso The method is also more accurate than zzso zzso gene prediction methods, provided sufficiently close target proteins are zzso In view of the fast growth of public sequence zzso we argue that close targets will be available for the majority of novel zzso making spliced alignment an excellent practical tool for zzso automated zzso zzso
