Development of a zzso cell takes place when it zzso to respond to zzso signals and zzso zzso and can zzso and move to other parts of the zzso the process called as zzso A particular set of zzso zzso are very active during cancer zzso zzso being one of zzso They are involved in tumor growth and zzso and have also been reported to be zzso in tumor cell zzso In the present study, a zzso approach zzso three-dimensional quantitative zzso relationship zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and search followed by zzso L zzso high zzso screening was carried out using an initial set of 28 zzso zzso derivatives as zzso L zzso A zzso zzso was derived using the alignment of a common zzso zzso Essential structural features responsible for biological activity were taken into account for development of a zzso model based on 29 zzso zzso zzso This model was used to carry out an exhaustive search on a large zzso of natural zzso A further zzso L zzso screen identified two top scoring compounds as potent zzso zzso 

The generated zzso zzso model showed statistically significant results with an zzso value of zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso of zzso and a zzso zzso value for test zzso of zzso Apart from these, a high F test value of zzso suggested low probability of the zzso zzso The zzso hypothesis chosen for searching the natural compound libraries was identified as zzso where two Ds zzso 2 hydrogen donors, H represents a zzso group and two zzso represent aromatic rings, all of which are essential for the biological zzso We report two potential drug leads zzso zzso and zzso zzso obtained after a combined approach of zzso search and zzso virtual zzso These two compounds displayed extra precision zzso scores of zzso and zzso respectively suggesting considerable binding affinity for zzso zzso High activity values of zzso and zzso predicted using the zzso zzso model further substantiated the zzso potential of these identified zzso 

The present study attempts to correlate the structural features of zzso group with their biological activity by development of a robust zzso zzso zzso Being statistically zzso this model provides near accurate values of the activities predicted for the zzso set on which it is zzso These predicted activities are good for the test set compounds making it indeed a statistically sound zzso zzso zzso The identified zzso model zzso comprised of all the essential features required to interact with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso A search for natural compounds based on this zzso followed by zzso studies further screened out two top scoring zzso zzso and zzso The high binding affinity and presence of essential structural features in these two compounds make them ideal for consideration as natural zzso zzso zzso prediction using zzso zzso model further validated their potential as worthy drug candidates against zzso L for treatment of zzso
