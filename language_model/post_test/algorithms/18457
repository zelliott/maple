The zzso of zzso acid in zzso zzso has been determined at 25 degrees zzso The generated zzso data sets have been used to assess the accuracy of different zzso analyses for the excess free energy model and a new zzso method for zzso prediction in zzso zzso based on four experimental zzso is zzso The accuracy of a previously presented zzso method to fit all data points is compared with that of a proposed analysis using average percentage zzso zzso The zzso obtained are zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively for previous and proposed zzso A minimum number of three and four data points employed to train the original forms of the excess free energy model and the zzso at other zzso compositions were zzso The zzso obtained were zzso and zzso zzso The zzso produced for the proposed zzso method was zzso
