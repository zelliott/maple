The decision-making processes used for zzso trauma zzso and hospital selection in zzso trauma systems remain poorly zzso The objective of this study was to assess the process of field zzso decision making in an established trauma zzso 

We used a mixed methods approach, including emergency medical services zzso records to zzso zzso decisions and reasons for hospital selection in a zzso injury cohort zzso plus a focused zzso to understand zzso cognitive reasoning in making zzso zzso The study included 10 zzso agencies providing service to a zzso regional trauma system with three trauma centers and 13 zzso zzso For qualitative zzso we conducted field observation and interviews with 35 zzso field providers and a round table discussion with 40 zzso management personnel to generate an empirical model of zzso decision making in trauma zzso 

A total of zzso injured patients were evaluated by zzso of whom zzso zzso were transported to acute care hospitals and zzso zzso of zzso were field trauma zzso For zzso zzso zzso preference and proximity accounted for zzso of destination zzso zzso provider judgment was cited in zzso of field trauma zzso and was the sole criterion in zzso of trauma zzso The empirical model demonstrated that trauma zzso is driven primarily by zzso provider zzso zzso zzso and relies heavily on provider experience, mechanism of injury, and early visual cues at the zzso 

zzso cognitive reasoning for field trauma zzso is more zzso than zzso and driven primarily by provider judgment, rather than specific zzso zzso
