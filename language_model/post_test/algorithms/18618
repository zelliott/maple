As the regulations of zzso quality are increasingly zzso the zzso monitoring of wastewater treatment processes becomes very zzso zzso statistical process control such as principal component analysis zzso has found wide applications in process fault detection and diagnosis using measurement zzso In this work, we propose a consensus zzso zzso for zzso wastewater treatment process zzso The method overcomes the problem of changing operating conditions by updating the zzso structure zzso The zzso does not require any zzso compared to typical zzso zzso zzso With this method process disturbances are detected in real time and the responsible zzso are directly zzso The presented methodology is successfully applied to a zzso sequencing batch reactor for wastewater zzso
