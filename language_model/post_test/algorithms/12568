We provide evidence that zzso zzso reduction, zzso and data set zzso can be solved within one and the same zzso The main idea is to define a system of coordinates with an explicit metric that reflects the connectivity of a given data set and that is robust to zzso Our construction, which is based on a zzso random walk on the data, offers a general scheme of simultaneously zzso and zzso zzso and arbitrarily shaped data sets in high dimensions using intrinsic zzso We show that zzso in embedding spaces is equivalent to zzso zzso The objective of data zzso and zzso is to zzso the random walk on the data while at the same time preserving a diffusion operator for the intrinsic geometry or connectivity of the data set up to some zzso We show that the zzso distortion in diffusion space bounds the error of zzso of the operator, thus giving a rigorous justification for zzso zzso in diffusion space and a precise measure of the performance of general zzso zzso
