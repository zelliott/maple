zzso sensing zzso is a form of gene regulation based on zzso that depends on zzso zzso While there are a variety of models for bacterial colony zzso there is little work linking zzso genes to movement in an open zzso 

The onset of swarming in environmental zzso zzso zzso was described with a simplified zzso model in which cells in random motion communicate via a zzso signal (representing zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that regulate the intensity of movement and metabolism in a zzso zzso As a result, an zzso zzso emerges in which nutrients and other public goods are present in sufficient zzso and swarming is the spontaneous displacement of this high zzso zone towards nutrients and/or zzso zzso The model correctly predicts the zzso of zzso knockout zzso in which the zzso genes responsible either for the synthesis zzso zzso or the sensing zzso zzso of AHL signals were zzso For wild type cells the model predicts sustained colony growth that can however be collapsed by the overconsumption of zzso 

While in more complex models include zzso abilities that allow cells to follow concentration zzso of nutrients and zzso agents, in this model, displacement towards nutrients or environmental signals is an emergent property of the community that results from the action of a few, zzso zzso genes and their zzso Still the model zzso describes the salient properties of zzso bacteria, zzso the zzso onset of swarming as well as the response to zzso signals or zzso
