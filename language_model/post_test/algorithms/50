We have investigated the application of ultrasound modulated coherent light for quantitative determination of the ratio of dye zzso and total concentration of zzso in a blood zzso zzso A zzso tube containing the mixture of zzso inside an zzso gel with optical properties similar to tissue was interrogated by two different laser zzso in combination with intense zzso ultrasound zzso The use of zzso zzso allowed us to extract quantitative information on the ratio of dye zzso with the accuracy of better than zzso as well as on the total zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated the feasibility to obtain a quantitative 3-D map of the absorbing structure with a spatial resolution of better than 3 zzso These findings give an outlook to apply this technique for zzso 3-D mapping of oxygen zzso and total concentration of zzso in zzso
