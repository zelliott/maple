Improvement in the diagnostic accuracy of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cancer by zzso the reconstruction parameters was zzso including a phantom study and clinical zzso 

In the experimental study, the contrast ratio was evaluated using a standard image quality zzso changing the iteration number of ordered zzso expectation zzso zzso from 2 to zzso In the clinical study, 89 patients with zzso zzso cancer who received zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso Their zzso zzso were visually assessed when systematically changing the iteration number, and the optimal iteration number was zzso After the appropriate zzso value of maximum standardized zzso value was determined, the improvement of the diagnostic accuracy of zzso zzso was evaluated for the zzso zzso and the zzso ones using the reconstructed images with the optimal iteration zzso This was compared with the conventional method that had an iteration number of zzso 

In the phantom study, it was confirmed that the contrast ratio improved when the iteration number zzso In clinical zzso the optimal iteration number was determined to be 5 by visual zzso When the zzso value of zzso was used, which happened to be the best number, the zzso improved from zzso to zzso for the zzso zzso and from zzso to zzso for the zzso zzso zzso 

When the iteration number of the reconstruction zzso was zzso the sensitivity of zzso zzso improved by more than zzso and the accuracy exceeded zzso zzso of the image reconstruction parameters in the diagnosis of zzso zzso using zzso is clinically zzso
