zzso factors are needed to improve the currently used serum zzso and risk of zzso index zzso in zzso zzso cancer zzso from other pelvic masses, thereby achieving precise and fast referral to a zzso center and correct selection for further zzso The aim was to evaluate serum Human zzso protein 4 zzso and the risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso for these zzso 

zzso from zzso patients in the prospective ongoing pelvic mass study was collected prior to zzso The zzso and zzso data were registered and evaluated separately and combined in zzso and compared to zzso 

zzso benign tumors, 79 borderline zzso tumors, 252 OC zzso early and 188 late zzso 9 zzso zzso tumors and 69 zzso zzso were zzso zzso between OC and benign disease the specificity was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at a set sensitivity of zzso which zzso to zzso The areas under the curve zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for benign zzso early stage zzso For zzso benign zzso OC zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso helps zzso OC from other pelvic masses, even in early stage zzso zzso performs equally well as the ultrasound depending zzso and might be valuable as a first line zzso for selecting high risk patients for referral to a zzso center and further zzso Further improvements of zzso and zzso in zzso pelvic masses are still needed, especially regarding zzso zzso
