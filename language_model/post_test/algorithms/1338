Digital imaging fiber-optic zzso zzso is a novel method to detect and monitor dental zzso using light, a zzso device zzso camera, and computer-controlled image zzso The advantages of zzso over zzso include: no zzso radiation, no film, real-time diagnosis, and higher sensitivity in detection of early zzso not apparent to zzso as demonstrated in zzso Here, we present a method of processing zzso images, acquired at different times, for monitoring zzso Of central importance to this application is pattern matching of image frames that is zzso to translation and rotation of a zzso relative to the field of view of the imaging camera, and that is robust to changes in zzso source zzso Our method zzso 1) zzso zzso zzso representations for zzso of teeth zzso 2) first and second moments of gray level representations of zzso images in the spatial domain, to estimate tooth location and zzso and 3) zzso zzso magnitude representations for quantitative zzso Even with zzso source intensity variation, it is demonstrated in zzso that such zzso representations can facilitate detection of simulated clinical changes in light transmission that cannot be detected in the spatial zzso
