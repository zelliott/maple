Currently, the genetic zzso identified by zzso wide association study zzso generally only account for a small proportion of the total zzso for complex zzso One crucial reason is the zzso of zzso joint effects commonly encountered in zzso which includes their main effects and zzso However, zzso zzso is often zzso put into the framework of zzso interaction zzso From the zzso graph perspective, we zzso in detail the concept and zzso of zzso zzso as well as its relationship with traditional zzso interaction, and propose two Fisher zzso zzso simple statistics to detect zzso Three series of simulations further highlight that zzso zzso refers to the extent to which the joint effects of two genes differs from the main effects, not only due to the traditional interaction under the nearly independent condition but the correlation between two zzso The proposed statistics are more powerful than zzso zzso under various situations, cannot be affected by linkage zzso and can have acceptable false positive rate as long as strictly following the reasonable zzso data analysis zzso Furthermore, an application to gene zzso analysis associated with zzso confirms in practice that our proposed zzso zzso concepts as well as the zzso proposed statistics are strongly in line with zzso
