zzso linkage analysis is being performed routinely in medical genetic studies to zzso disease zzso This zzso method is very zzso zzso zzso zzso are thus formidable for problems with large number of genetic markers and complex zzso This paper proposes a zzso Carlo method to estimate the required zzso The space of zzso zzso is sampled using a hybrid zzso with a mixture of Gibbs samplers and zzso jumping zzso These samples are essentially zzso of a zzso chain, and are distributed approximately according to the conditional zzso distribution given the observed zzso zzso We present a simulation study with several zzso analyses to demonstrate the feasibility of the current zzso
