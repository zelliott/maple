zzso being hailed as the remedy to the world's zzso cities will need to adapt in the zzso zzso In particular, the role of public transport is likely to increase significantly, and new methods and zzso to better plan transit systems are in dire zzso This paper examines one fundamental aspect of zzso network zzso By applying the notion of zzso zzso to 28 worldwide zzso systems, the main goal of this paper is to study the emergence of global trends in the evolution of zzso with network size and examine several individual systems in more zzso zzso was notably found to consistently become more evenly distributed with size zzso no zzso takes zzso unlike other complex network zzso Two distinct regimes were also observed that are representative of their zzso Moreover, the share of zzso was found to decrease in a power law with size (with zzso 1 for the average zzso but the share of most central zzso decreases much slower than least central zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally the zzso of individual stations in several systems were zzso which can be useful to locate stations where passengers can be redistributed to relieve pressure from overcrowded zzso Overall, this study offers significant insights that can help planners in their task to design the systems of tomorrow, and similar zzso can easily be imagined to other urban infrastructure systems zzso electricity grid, zzso system, zzso to develop more sustainable zzso
