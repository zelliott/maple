We present a simple and efficient scheme that combines multiple descriptions coding with zzso transform under zzso image coding zzso To reduce packet losses, controlled amounts of zzso are added to the zzso transform zzso to produce multiple descriptions of zzso zzso during the zzso process to produce multiple descriptions zzso of a compressed zzso Even if a receiver gets only parts of descriptions zzso descriptions being zzso it can still reconstruct image with acceptable zzso Specifically, the scheme uses not only zzso zzso transform to improve zzso efficiency, but also multiple descriptions technique to enhance the zzso of the compressed image that is transmitted through unreliable network zzso
