zzso interactions are important to understanding cell zzso however, our theoretical understanding is zzso There is a general zzso between the zzso physical and chemical forces that drive zzso interactions and the large collections of identified zzso interactions in various zzso zzso are short functional zzso sequences that provide a basis to bridge this gap in zzso However, there is no systematic way to study zzso in the context of zzso interactions or vice zzso Here we have engineered a set of zzso that can be used to identify zzso in known zzso interactions and implemented this for use by scientists in zzso zzso By globally testing these zzso on verified data and on 100 individual proteins as test cases, we demonstrate the utility of these new zzso zzso This tool also can be used to reduce zzso predictions in the discovery of novel zzso The statistical significance of these zzso is demonstrated by an zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso
