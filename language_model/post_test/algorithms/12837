Adolescent idiopathic zzso zzso progression is clinically monitored by a series of full spinal zzso To decrease radiation exposure, an artificial progression surface zzso is proposed to predict zzso zzso acquisitions zzso zzso zzso and zzso were obtained from 11 zzso patients zzso zzso zzso Cobb zzso zzso zzso were constructed through zzso zzso zzso Three previous serial spinal zzso zzso zzso were used to construct an zzso with a zzso zzso zzso surfacing zzso Future progression was achieved by aligning the zzso on the zzso using the generalized zzso zzso zzso With three and four previous serial spinal curves, the prediction zzso of future progression at the next zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso for Cobb angles and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso lateral zzso Apex locations and Cobb regions varied within one zzso zzso The proposed technique shows potential as an accurate three-dimensional prediction method for zzso progression and could help zzso make decisions about zzso However, it could only be applied once before more zzso data would be zzso
