zzso of zzso images is considered in this zzso The task is to distinguish different classes of zzso of the central nervous system on the basis of features extracted from microscopic zzso The number of extracted features is relatively high and some of them seem to be irrelevant for zzso of the zzso Thus, the main objective of this study is to select such a feature subset that improves the zzso accuracy of the zzso The wrapper approach is chosen to obtain this aim, where a search for the good subset of features is made using a zzso zzso zzso To guide a search process, a forward beam selection zzso is zzso It zzso adds relevant features in a parallel way for the most promising zzso It is shown that the proposed approach gives good zzso accuracy for the considered zzso zzso
