zzso and experiments on simple oriented systems have been used to estimate the relative ratio of zzso to zzso zzso in zzso experiments based on zzso zzso during zzso zzso The density zzso prior to zzso evolution is considered and for an isolated spin pair, it is shown that direct calculations of the ratios match well with simulations and experimental zzso Along with the standard zzso pulse zzso two other pulse sequences namely zzso with polarization inversion zzso and another novel variation of the standard zzso experiment zzso reported recently have been zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been observed to increase the zzso zzso In combination with zzso zzso zzso experiments on an oriented liquid zzso sample have been carried out and the performance of the pulse schemes have been zzso The zzso of the new pulse sequence for different samples and different zzso is zzso Such studies are expected to lead to a better understanding of the experiments and to the design of useful pulse zzso
