Automatic zzso of words is challenging, not least because the syllable is not easy to define zzso zzso no accepted standard zzso for automatic zzso zzso There are two broad zzso zzso and zzso The zzso method effectively embodies some theoretical position regarding the zzso whereas the zzso paradigm tries to zzso zzso zzso from examples assumed to be correctly zzso zzso This article compares the performance of several zzso of the two basic zzso Given the problems of definition, it is difficult to determine a correct zzso in all cases and so to establish the quality of the zzso zzso corpus used either to evaluate zzso the output of an automatic zzso or as the zzso on which zzso methods zzso zzso Thus, we look for consensus in the entries in multiple zzso databases of zzso zzso In this work, we have used two independent zzso and extracted from them the same zzso words with their corresponding zzso zzso zzso We have also created a third lexicon corresponding to the zzso words that share the same zzso in these two zzso As well as two zzso approaches zzso and zzso zzso of zzso three zzso techniques are zzso a zzso zzso an zzso zzso technique, and zzso by zzso zzso The results on the three databases show consistent and robust zzso First, the zzso techniques outperform the zzso systems in word and juncture zzso by a very significant margin but require training data and are zzso Second, zzso in the zzso domain is easier than in the spelling zzso Finally, best results are consistently obtained with zzso
