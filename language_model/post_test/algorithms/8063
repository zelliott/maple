We present a software package for pedigree reconstruction in natural populations using zzso zzso markers such as zzso and single zzso zzso zzso If available, the zzso makes use of prior information such as known relationships zzso or the age and sex of zzso zzso confidence is estimated by zzso zzso zzso Carlo zzso zzso The accuracy of the zzso is demonstrated for simulated data as well as an empirical zzso with known zzso The parentage zzso is robust even in the presence of zzso zzso 

The C source code of zzso can be obtained under the zzso from zzso
