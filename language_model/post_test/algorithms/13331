zzso refers to the extraction and analysis of large amounts of advanced quantitative imaging features with high zzso from medical images obtained with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or magnetic resonance zzso zzso these data are designed to be extracted from zzso images, leading to a very large potential subject zzso zzso data are in a zzso form that can be used to build descriptive and zzso models relating image features to zzso or zzso zzso The core hypothesis of zzso is that these models, which can include biological or medical data, can provide valuable zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso enterprise can be divided into distinct zzso each with its own challenges that need to be zzso zzso image acquisition and zzso zzso image zzso and zzso zzso feature extraction and feature zzso and zzso databases and data sharing for eventual zzso ad hoc zzso zzso Each of these individual processes poses unique zzso For example, optimum protocols for image acquisition and reconstruction have to be identified and zzso Also, zzso have to be robust and involve minimal operator zzso Features have to be generated that robustly reflect the complexity of the individual volumes, but cannot be overly complex or zzso Furthermore, zzso databases that allow incorporation of image features and image zzso along with medical and genetic data, have to be zzso Finally, the statistical approaches to analyze these data have to be zzso as zzso is not a mature field of zzso Each of these processes will be discussed in turn, as well as some of their unique challenges and proposed approaches to solve zzso The focus of this article will be on images of zzso lung zzso
