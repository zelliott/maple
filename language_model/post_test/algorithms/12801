We report the performance of the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso rounds zzso and introduce a novel measure atom contact frequency zzso To zzso zzso we identify the zzso that most often make contact with the binding partner in the complete set of zzso predictions for each zzso We used zzso to predict the interface of the zzso which, in combination with the biological data available in the literature, is a valuable addition to our zzso zzso Furthermore, we incorporated a straightforward and efficient zzso zzso with two purposes: zzso to determine clusters of similar zzso poses zzso to energy zzso and zzso to remove redundancies from the final set of zzso With these new developments, we achieved at least one acceptable prediction for targets 29 and 36, at least one zzso prediction for targets 41 and 42, and at least one high-quality prediction for targets 37 and 40; thus, we succeeded for six out of a total of 12 zzso
