The performance of face recognition systems that use two-dimensional images depends on factors such as lighting and zzso zzso We are developing a face recognition system that zzso three-dimensional shape information to make the system more robust to arbitrary pose and zzso For each subject, a zzso face model is constructed by zzso several zzso face scans which are captured from different zzso zzso is a simplified zzso zzso zzso zzso surface representation that contains at most one depth value zzso zzso for every point in the zzso zzso zzso Two different zzso provided by the facial zzso zzso shape and texture, are zzso and integrated for face zzso The recognition engine consists of two zzso surface matching and zzso zzso The surface matching component is based on a modified zzso zzso Point zzso zzso The candidate list from the gallery used for appearance matching is zzso generated based on the output of the surface matching zzso which reduces the complexity of the zzso matching zzso zzso models in the gallery are used to zzso new appearance samples with pose and zzso variations and the zzso face images are used in zzso zzso zzso The weighted sum rule is applied to combine the scores given by the two matching zzso Experimental results are given for matching a database of 200 zzso face models with zzso zzso independent test scans acquired under different pose and some lighting and expression zzso These results show the feasibility of the proposed matching zzso
