This paper proposes a zzso zzso method to differentiate between individuals with and without zzso or swallowing zzso zzso sound signals, both normal and abnormal zzso at risk of some degree of zzso were recorded with zzso over the zzso zzso based on zzso dimension trajectory (a zzso zzso was developed to segment the zzso swallowing sound zzso Two characteristic sections emerged, Opening and zzso and 24 characteristic features were extracted and subsequently reduced via zzso zzso A zzso zzso was also employed for zzso with the system trained and tested using the zzso zzso Overall, 350 signals were used from three zzso zzso zzso thick and thin zzso A final screening zzso correctly classified 13 of 15 control subjects and 11 of 11 subjects with some degree of zzso and/or neurological zzso The proposed method has great potential to reduce the need for zzso swallowing studies (the current gold standard method for swallowing assessment, which is invasive and zzso and to assist in the overall clinical assessment of swallowing sound zzso
