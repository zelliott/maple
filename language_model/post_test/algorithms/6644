zzso the most appropriate way to represent the relationships between bacterial zzso is complicated by the differing rates of zzso within zzso In many cases, a zzso tree can be positively zzso The recently described program zzso can be used with zzso data to define groups or zzso complexes of related zzso derived from a common zzso the patterns of descent linking them together, and the ancestral zzso zzso has recently been extensively updated to include additional tools for exploring the relationships between zzso We discuss the advantages of this approach and describe its use to explore patterns of descent within zzso complexes identified using zzso sequence zzso
