General zzso behavior of zzso zzso was examined in a wide range of zzso at the mercury zzso by recording zzso zzso zzso It was demonstrated that zzso detection is sensitive to polar zzso in zzso zzso We identified a narrow potential window around the point of zero charge of the zzso where the interaction of polar zzso of zzso zzso with the zzso is zzso in the form of zzso zzso The zzso signal is composed of the charge flow due to the zzso interaction of zzso zzso and spreading and of the charge flow due to a specific interaction of the zzso charged zzso and the most exposed positively charged zzso zzso These signals are expected to appear only when the zzso surface charge density is less than the surface charge density of the zzso groups at the contact zzso In comparison, for the zzso charged zzso zzso we identified the potential window at the mercury zzso where charge compensation takes place, and zzso signals were not zzso
