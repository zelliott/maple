The construction of a smooth surface zzso a mesh of arbitrary zzso type is an important problem in many graphics zzso This paper presents a zzso process, based on a zzso modification of the control mesh and a subsequent zzso zzso to construct a smooth surface that zzso some or all of the zzso of a mesh with arbitrary zzso It is also possible to zzso the surface to have specified zzso planes at an arbitrary subset of the zzso to be zzso The method has the following features: 1) It is guaranteed to always work and the zzso is zzso stable, 2) there is no need to solve a system of linear equations and the whole zzso complexity is zzso where K is the number of the zzso and 3) each zzso can be associated with a zzso shape handle for local shape zzso These features make zzso using zzso surfaces simple and, thus, make the new method itself suitable for interactive zzso shape zzso
