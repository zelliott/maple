The sensitivity of the standard zzso zzso for detecting zzso zzso is low perhaps because in the printed zzso only three to five complexes are zzso only absolute zzso zzso criteria are used, and zzso changes are sought only in the ST segment and T wave zzso A computerized method is proposed for evaluating the significance of zzso zzso changes detected in one state compared with another zzso rest and zzso zzso changes were considered significant if they were consistently greater than the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a graphic measure introduced in this study, calculated from the reference zzso zzso zzso and stress simulation zzso zzso were zzso Mean rest zzso complex was zzso from rest and stress zzso complexes to result in rest and stress zzso zzso zzso The percentage of the zzso cumulative sum zzso of the zzso during stress (and zzso lying outside the zzso served as a measure for evaluating zzso changes associated with stress (and zzso With this method, zzso changes of magnitude similar to that of the noise, which were difficult to detect zzso were easily detected and accurately allocated to the component of the zzso complex where they zzso The proposed method may be useful in cases where zzso changes are too subtle and thus overlooked or not detected by the standard examination of three to five complexes or underestimated due to zzso clinical zzso criteria, or occur in zzso components that are not regularly zzso
