Land cover data represent a fundamental data source for various types of scientific zzso The zzso of land cover based on satellite data is a challenging task, and an efficient zzso method is zzso In this study, an automatic scheme is proposed for the zzso of land use using zzso remote sensing images based on change detection and a zzso zzso The satellite image can be automatically classified using only the prior land cover map and existing zzso therefore human involvement is reduced to a zzso ensuring the zzso of the zzso The method was tested in the zzso District of Shanghai, zzso Using Environment Satellite zzso images of 2009 with 30 m spatial resolution, the areas were classified into five main types of land cover based on previous land cover data and spectral zzso The results agreed on validation of land cover maps well with a Kappa value of zzso and statistical area biases in proportion less than zzso This study proposed a simple zzso approach for land cover zzso by using prior maps with satisfied zzso which integrated the accuracy of visual interpretation and performance of automatic zzso zzso The method can be used for land cover mapping in areas lacking ground reference information or identifying rapid variation of land cover regions (such as rapid zzso with zzso
