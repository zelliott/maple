Many zzso traits show zzso that is, the disease zzso in different families may be caused by genes at different zzso In linkage analysis, this zzso type of zzso zzso zzso has often been zzso with one of the zzso programs, which thus far have been restricted to at most two disease gene zzso Here, an extension to an arbitrary number of disease locations is zzso It has been implemented in a computer program, zzso This approach is also suitable as an approximation to the situation of complex traits, in which multiple disease genes may occur in the same zzso
