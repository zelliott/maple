A new data filtering method for zzso zzso zzso zzso data is zzso We examined technical repeats (2 per zzso of intensity versus zzso zzso of bone zzso cell zzso for two groups of childhood leukemia zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso and acute zzso leukemia zzso As others have noted, the type of data processing as well as experimental zzso can have a disproportionate impact on the list of zzso proteins (see zzso et zzso zzso We propose a list of processing and multiple testing techniques to correct for 1) background zzso 2) filtering using smooth zzso and zzso bandwidth zzso 3) peak zzso and 4) methods to correct for multiple testing zzso der zzso et zzso zzso The result is a list of proteins zzso by zzso where average expression is significantly different among disease (or treatment, zzso zzso The procedures are intended to provide a sensible and statistically driven algorithm, which we argue provides a list of proteins that have a significant difference in zzso Given no sources of zzso bias (such as zzso of experimental conditions with disease zzso proteins found to be statistically significant using this technique have a low probability of being false zzso
