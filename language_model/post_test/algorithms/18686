zzso zzso flexibility is challenging for database zzso We consider a method that treats multiple flexible regions of the binding site zzso zzso them to generate different discrete zzso This zzso scales zzso rather than zzso with the zzso degrees of zzso The method was first evaluated for its ability to identify known zzso of a zzso cavity zzso of T4 zzso zzso Some zzso molecules of the Available Chemical zzso zzso were zzso against an ensemble of cavity zzso Surprisingly, the enrichment of known zzso from among a much larger number of zzso in the zzso was worse than simply zzso to the zzso zzso zzso Large zzso zzso in the larger cavity zzso sampled in the ensemble, were ranked better than known small zzso The calculation was zzso with an energy correction term that considered the cost of forming the larger cavity zzso zzso improved, as did the balance between high-ranking large and small zzso In a second retrospective test, the zzso was zzso against a zzso ensemble of zzso zzso Compared to zzso against individual zzso zzso the flexible zzso zzso approach improved enrichment of known zzso Including a zzso zzso energy weighting term improved enrichment zzso To test the method zzso the zzso database was zzso against another cavity zzso of zzso zzso A total of 18 new compounds predicted to bind this polar cavity and to change its zzso were tested zzso 14 were found to zzso The bound structures for seven zzso were determined by X-ray zzso The predicted zzso of these zzso all corresponded to the observed zzso to within zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso changes of the cavity were observed in all seven zzso In five structures, part of the observed accommodations were correctly zzso in two structures, the zzso zzso changes were unanticipated and thus never zzso These results suggest that although sampling zzso flexibility can lead to novel zzso that would have been missed when zzso a rigid structure, it is also important to consider zzso zzso zzso
