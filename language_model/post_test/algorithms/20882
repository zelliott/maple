We use a simple mathematical model to estimate the probability and its time dependence that one or more zzso zzso successfully zzso target zzso For the transfer of a given number of zzso to target cells we derive expressions for the probability zzso of zzso Thus, in the case of zzso transfer we determine zzso and an approximate time window for zzso prophylaxis zzso For zzso transmission, where the transfer process is more complicated, a zzso gamma is employed which measures the strength of the infection zzso For the smaller value of zzso zzso is from 6 zzso zzso to zzso or from zzso zzso zzso to zzso where the lower figures are for the transfer of 100 zzso and the upper figures are for the transfer of zzso million zzso We estimate the reductions in zzso which occur with a zzso of a given zzso It is found that reductions may be approximately as stated when the number of zzso transferred is less than about zzso but declines to zero for viral loads above that zzso It is concluded that zzso should always be applied immediately after a zzso zzso Further, manufacturers of zzso should be encouraged to investigate and report their effectiveness at various transferred viral zzso
