An zzso was developed to estimate zzso orbit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso detector radius on a zzso imaging system using the CT images, for incorporation into zzso resolution modeling for zzso zzso zzso zzso male abdominal zzso zzso male head and neck zzso zzso and female chest zzso zzso zzso zzso and ten patient, zzso zzso scans were acquired on a hybrid imaging zzso The zzso simulated inward zzso detector zzso motion and object zzso detection at each projection angle, employing the calculated average CT image and a fixed zzso unit zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared to the observed true zzso and optimal CT threshold values, corresponding to patient bed and clothing surfaces, were found to be between zzso and zzso zzso The zzso was constrained by the 45 zzso CT zzso zzso which limited the detected zzso to zzso or zzso zzso zzso and led to occasional radius zzso in the case of object zzso by zzso Two methods incorporating the zzso were zzso physical model zzso and best fit zzso The PM method zzso an offset that produced maximum overlap of calculated and true zzso for the phantom scans, and applied that offset as a zzso radius zzso For the zzso method, the zzso radius transformation was based upon a linear zzso between calculated and true zzso For the PM method, a fixed offset of zzso zzso provided maximum zzso radius overlap for the phantom study, which accounted for the camera system's object zzso detect sensor zzso face zzso For the zzso method, a linear zzso of true versus calculated radius from a reference patient scan was used as a zzso radius zzso Both methods were applied to ten patient zzso For zzso and zzso zzso zzso the combined overall average zzso zzso error in zzso position for eight patient scans without zzso were zzso zzso zzso for PM and zzso zzso zzso for zzso indicating zzso is superior to PM in the absence of zzso For two patient scans with zzso the zzso error was zzso zzso zzso for PM and zzso zzso zzso for zzso The slightly better performance of PM in the case of zzso is zzso due to zzso edge zzso artifacts in the CT zzso and thus is zzso The calculated zzso zzso for a patient zzso scan was used with an zzso reconstruction zzso that incorporated compensation for system zzso The resulting image was zzso superior to the image obtained by reconstructing the data using the fixed radius stored by the zzso The result was also superior to the image reconstructed using the zzso zzso provided with the system, which does not incorporate resolution zzso These results suggest that, under conditions of no or only mild lateral zzso of the CT zzso the zzso is capable of providing radius estimates suitable for zzso zzso reconstruction zzso geometric resolution zzso
