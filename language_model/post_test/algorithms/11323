zzso and diversity are two important aspects to evaluate the performance of zzso zzso Two zzso methods were proposed respectively inspired by the mass diffusion zzso and heat zzso zzso processes on zzso It has been pointed out that MD has high recommendation accuracy yet low diversity, while HC succeeds in seeking out novel or niche items but with relatively low zzso The zzso dilemma is a long-term challenge in zzso zzso To solve this problem, we introduced a background temperature by adding a ground user who connects to all the items in the zzso zzso zzso Performing the HC zzso on the network with ground user zzso it showed that the accuracy can be largely improved while keeping the zzso Furthermore, we proposed a weighted form of the ground user zzso by assigning some weights to the newly added links between the ground user and the zzso By turning the weight as a free zzso an optimal value subject to the highest accuracy is zzso Experimental results on three benchmark data sets showed that the zzso zzso the state-of-the-art method MD for both accuracy and zzso
