Principal zzso Analysis zzso and Principal zzso Analysis zzso are classic techniques in statistical data analysis, feature extraction and data zzso Given a set of zzso zzso zzso and zzso provide a smaller set of zzso zzso with less zzso and a zzso spanned by them, zzso zzso zzso and neural networks have been shown to perform zzso and zzso when zzso ascent zzso learning rules are used, which is related to the constrained zzso zzso of statistical objective zzso Due to their low complexity, such zzso and their zzso in neural networks are potentially useful in cases of tracking slow changes of correlations in the input data or in updating zzso with new zzso In this paper we propose zzso learning zzso that is fully homogeneous with respect to zzso The zzso is obtained by modification of one of the most famous zzso learning zzso Learning Algorithm zzso zzso of the zzso is based on zzso zzso zzso zzso The method uses two distinct time zzso On a faster time scale zzso zzso is responsible for the zzso of all output zzso On a slower scale, output zzso will compete for fulfillment of their zzso zzso On this scale, basis zzso in the principal zzso are rotated toward the principal zzso At the end of the paper it will be briefly analyzed how (or zzso zzso zzso method can be used for transformation of any of the existing neural network zzso method, into zzso zzso
