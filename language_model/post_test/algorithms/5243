Addressing the issue of effective zzso this study focuses on effects of indirect connections on zzso stable zzso zzso partial transfer zzso We introduce a zzso causality measure based on a zzso version of transfer zzso The statistic takes into account the influence of the rest of the network zzso on observed zzso between two given zzso This zzso allows us to zzso for a specific pathway, the total amount of indirect zzso zzso by the zzso We show that partial transfer zzso is a more sensitive technique to identify robust zzso relations than its zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrate the zzso effects of the variation in indirect zzso on the zzso of robust zzso zzso Finally, we consider the problem of model zzso and its effect on the zzso of the observed connectivity patterns, showing that zzso the model may be an issue even for zzso zzso zzso
