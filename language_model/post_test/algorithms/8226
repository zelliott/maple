In circular zzso CT the zzso zzso zzso zzso is the most prominent image reconstruction zzso For example, in radiation zzso images reconstructed with the zzso zzso are used for accurate patient zzso The scan and reconstruction volumes are limited by the size of the flat panel zzso Flat panel zzso however, are expensive and difficult to manufacture in large zzso For numerous treatment techniques, extending this scan volume would be very zzso In most applications, data from 360 degrees or more are zzso However, usually only those slices are reconstructed where each zzso is seen under the full 360 degree zzso Yet for a 360 degree scan there are regions that are seen by less than 360 degrees, zzso those that lie further off the plane of the circular source zzso Performing a reconstruction also for those slices where all zzso are seen at least by 180 degrees will extend the zzso range and therefore increase the dose zzso In this work a new method is presented that reconstructs also those slices where some or all zzso receive less than 360 degrees but at least 180 degrees of the zzso The procedure significantly increases the zzso range of the reconstructed zzso As opposed to the existing techniques, the proposed method does not zzso any multiple zzso or multiple zzso lending itself therefore for a very efficient zzso To validate the abilities of the extended zzso the authors performed an evaluation of the image quality by using simulated and measured CT zzso The method shows good image quality on simulated phantom data as well as on clinical patient zzso Image noise and spatial resolution behave as zzso This means that the noise equals zzso values in the normal region and increases in the extended region due to reduced data zzso The extended zzso demonstrates its ability to extend the zzso zzso range and appears to be useful in clinical zzso
