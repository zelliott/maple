The zzso technique in zzso zzso is used for dating archaeological zzso and for accident zzso During routine applications of this technique, the zzso of the zzso samples is measured as a function of the zzso temperature, yielding the so-called zzso zzso characteristic zzso The measurement of multiple zzso and the study of the effect of zzso on the zzso sensitivity of zzso are important zzso and diagnostic zzso In this paper, it is shown that a modified Zimmerman model for zzso can successfully model the experimental steps undertaken during a measurement of multiple zzso
