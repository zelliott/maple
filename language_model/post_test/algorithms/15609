In this work, the potential of waxes for preparing with the zzso spray zzso technique zzso for controlling the in zzso release of zzso zzso was zzso The first part of the study zzso the zzso of the zzso to achieve an efficient drug incorporation together with a satisfactory in zzso drug release zzso In particular, zzso zzso zzso alcohol and zzso of the two were zzso Also a zzso zzso zzso was added to the zzso After the particle size analysis, the zzso of the zzso involved the study of the solid state of drug and carriers in the systems zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso and chemical analyses of the zzso surface zzso and zzso Finally, the drug release mechanism from these devices was evaluated using the statistical moment zzso The results of this study show that by selecting the type and the amount of the carriers, zzso with a zzso shape and a good zzso efficiency were zzso These particles showed a zzso release for 8 zzso without zzso the solid state properties of the zzso zzso zzso zzso prepared by the zzso spray zzso technique are promising zzso devices for controlling the release of zzso zzso
