This paper addresses the zzso zzso optimal zzso zzso of embedded zzso into independent source zzso in order to limit error propagation in transmission of images over packet noisy zzso The input embedded stream is assumed to be an zzso of K independently zzso basic zzso To form independent source zzso the set of basic zzso is zzso into N zzso The zzso within each group are then zzso to generate a source zzso zzso protection may be further applied zzso source zzso to produce the channel packets to be zzso The zzso problem previously formulated by Wu et zzso has the goal of finding the zzso that zzso the distortion when all source packets are zzso We extend the problem zzso such that to also include the zzso of the expected distortion for general transmission scenarios that may apply uneven zzso error zzso Further, we show that the dynamic programming zzso zzso of Wu et zzso can be extended to solve the general zzso zzso The main contribution of this paper is a fast zzso zzso zzso to find the globally optimal solution, under the assumption that all basic zzso have convex zzso zzso zzso in obtaining the fast solution is our result which proves that the problem can be formulated as a series of zzso search problems in totally monotone zzso The proposed zzso reduces the running time from zzso where L is the size of each packet achieved by the zzso solution to zzso log zzso zzso on zzso coded images demonstrate that the zzso is significant in zzso
