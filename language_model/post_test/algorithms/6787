zzso maps of proteins are predicted with neural network-based methods, using as input zzso of increasing complexity including evolutionary information, sequence zzso correlated zzso and predicted secondary zzso zzso networks are trained on a data set zzso the contact maps of 173 zzso proteins as zzso from their well resolved three-dimensional zzso zzso are selected from the zzso Data Bank database provided that they align with at least 15 similar sequences in the corresponding zzso The zzso are trained to learn the association rules between the zzso structure of each protein and its contact map with a standard back propagation zzso and tested on the same protein set with a zzso zzso Our results indicate that the method can assign protein contacts with an average accuracy of zzso and with an improvement over a random predictor of a factor zzso which is higher than that previously obtained with methods only based either on neural networks or on correlated zzso Furthermore, filtering the network zzso with a procedure based on the zzso coordination numbers, the accuracy of predictions increases up to zzso for all the zzso with an zzso zzso from a random zzso These scores are the highest reported so far for predicting protein contact zzso
