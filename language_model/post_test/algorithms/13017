In 2008, the hypoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico, measuring 20 zzso zzso was one of the two largest reported since measurement of the zone began in zzso The extent of the hypoxic zone is related to nitrogen and zzso zzso originating on agricultural fields in the upper zzso This study combines the tools of evolutionary zzso with a water quality model and cost data to develop a zzso frontier for the Upper Mississippi River zzso specifying the least cost of achieving zzso reductions and the location of the agricultural conservation practices zzso The frontier allows policymakers and zzso to explicitly see the zzso between cost and zzso zzso For example, the cost of reducing annual zzso zzso by zzso is estimated to be zzso zzso with a zzso zzso reduction in P and the cost of reducing annual P zzso by zzso is estimated to be zzso zzso with a zzso zzso reduction in zzso
