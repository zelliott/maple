zzso show that proteins are translated in sharp zzso similar zzso phenomena have been observed for protein import into zzso Here we investigate the effect of zzso in protein expression and import on the zzso properties of downstream zzso We consider two identical pathways with equal mean input rates, except in one zzso proteins are input one at a time and in the other proteins are input in zzso zzso the dynamics of these two pathways are zzso However the zzso behavior falls in three zzso zzso both pathways display or do not display zzso zzso zzso the zzso input zzso displays zzso zzso whereas the zzso one does not; zzso the reverse of zzso We derive necessary conditions for these three cases to zzso systems involving zzso zzso and genetic feedback zzso Our results suggest that single cell rhythms can be controlled by regulation of zzso in protein zzso
