Current computer zzso that interpret cardiac rhythms based solely on the surface zzso are zzso yet offer many benefits to health zzso To address the limitations, novel computer zzso for the automatic diagnosis of complex cardiac rhythms based solely on the surface zzso are zzso Using the zzso zzso a zzso model of the cardiac zzso system and production zzso knowledge are combined to reason about the zzso and zzso characteristics of complex heart zzso In addition, an evaluation of a zzso zzso of the zzso is zzso A database of the time of zzso zzso and shape zzso of each P wave, zzso complex, and T wave from 59 zzso strips was developed from an introductory textbook by zzso using zzso The database was not used in the development of the zzso The zzso diagnoses were reviewed by a clinical cardiac zzso who was not involved in the development zzso zzso comparisons among the prototype, textbook, and cardiac zzso assuming either the textbook or zzso as the gold standard, were zzso The specific comparisons performed were zzso versus textbook, zzso versus textbook, zzso versus zzso and textbook versus zzso For all diagnostic categories, sensitivities of zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, were zzso When accounting for design and zzso limitations of the prototype, sensitivities of zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, were zzso The results indicate that these zzso offer clinical advantages over currently available zzso analysis zzso
