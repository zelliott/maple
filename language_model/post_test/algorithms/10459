The universal zzso equation has been commonly used to zzso describe the energy dependence of the secondary electron yield zzso It is even used as a first reliability test for experimental zzso The equation is based on the assumption that the stopping power is constant along the electron zzso In this article, we derive a novel zzso expression based on a more advanced model which considers linear stopping power dependence on penetration zzso Although coinciding with the universal equation at low zzso the novel function has lower intensity in the higher energy zzso The models were compared with experimental zzso data of different metals, taken from literature, as well as freshly zzso highly oriented zzso zzso measured in the frame of this zzso It is confirmed that the novel expression better describes the experimental zzso
