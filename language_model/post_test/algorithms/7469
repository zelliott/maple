Our proposed method combines zzso supervised learning zzso and active learning zzso for automatic detection and zzso of Crohn's disease zzso from abdominal magnetic resonance zzso zzso Random forest zzso zzso are used due to fast zzso zzso and capacity to interpret learned zzso zzso samples for zzso are selected by a novel information density weighted approach using context information, semantic knowledge and labeling zzso Experimental results show that our proposed method combines the advantages of zzso and zzso and with fewer samples achieves higher zzso and zzso accuracy over fully supervised zzso
