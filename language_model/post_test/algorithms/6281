This paper proposes a novel zzso neural network zzso model for finding the principal singular zzso of a zzso zzso between two zzso data zzso We introduce a novel zzso criterion zzso for searching the optimum weights of two linear neural networks zzso The zzso exhibits a single global minimum attained if and only if the weight zzso of the left and right neural networks span the left and right principal singular zzso of a zzso zzso zzso The other stationary points of the zzso are zzso zzso zzso We develop an zzso zzso based on the zzso for tracking the principal singular zzso of a zzso zzso between two zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso provides a fast online learning of the optimum weights for two zzso The global zzso stability of the zzso zzso is zzso The zzso zzso has several key advantages such as faster zzso which is illustrated through zzso
