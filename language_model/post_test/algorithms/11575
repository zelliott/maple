zzso oxide zzso has been implicated in the zzso of multiple sclerosis zzso and its animal model, experimental zzso zzso zzso and zzso of NO synthesis has been proposed to be a possible mechanism of action of drugs to treat zzso In the present study, we investigated the zzso effect on NO synthesis of various steroids, zzso and drugs used or proposed for the treatment of zzso As a model system, we used primary rat zzso cells which produce NO zzso and subsequently release NO upon stimulation with zzso zzso Among the substances tested, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as transforming growth zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and NO zzso In contrast, zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as the steroids zzso testosterone, and zzso zzso showed no zzso zzso zzso slightly, but not significantly, increased zzso zzso oxide zzso We conclude from the present study that with respect to treatment of zzso zzso of NO synthesis may be an important mechanism of action of zzso and transforming growth zzso but not of other drugs used or proposed to treat zzso
