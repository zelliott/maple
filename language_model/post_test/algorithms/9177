zzso zzso MR images contain information about the orientation of brain white matter zzso that potentially can be used to study human brain connectivity in zzso using zzso zzso Currently, the diffusion zzso model is widely used to extract zzso directions from zzso data, but fails in regions containing multiple zzso zzso The zzso zzso technique has recently been proposed to address this zzso It provides an estimate of the zzso orientation distribution zzso by assuming the zzso signal measured from any zzso bundle is adequately described by a single response zzso However, the zzso is zzso and susceptible to noise zzso This tends to introduce zzso negative regions in the zzso which are clearly physically zzso In this study, the introduction of a constraint on such negative regions is proposed to improve the conditioning of the zzso zzso This approach is shown to provide zzso estimates that are robust to noise whilst preserving angular zzso The approach also permits the use of zzso zzso more zzso parameters are estimated than were actually measured, improving the angular resolution of the zzso The method provides much better defined zzso orientation estimates, and allows zzso to be resolved that are separated by smaller angles than previously zzso This should allow zzso zzso to be designed that are able to track reliably through crossing zzso zzso
