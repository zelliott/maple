zzso mass zzso instruments have been used to provide data for accurate mass and retention time zzso tag zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso transform mass zzso zzso An important attribute of these instruments, beside mass zzso is their spectral zzso In fact, the ability to separate zzso with close zzso values is likely to play a major role in enabling species identification and matching in analyses of very complex zzso zzso In zzso resolution is directly zzso to the detection period and can therefore be easily zzso We took advantage of this feature to investigate the effect of resolution on species identification and matching in an zzso tag zzso Using an zzso zzso zzso protein extract as zzso zzso sample, we have compared the number of detected features, the optimal mass tolerance for species matching, the number of matched species and the false discovery rate obtained at various resolution zzso It appears that while the total number of matches is not significantly affected by a reduction of resolution in the range investigated, the confidence level of identifications significantly drops as evidenced by the estimated false discovery zzso
