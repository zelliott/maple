zzso in the zzso superior zzso zzso area of the zzso visual zzso respond selectively to complex motion patterns defined by expansion, zzso and zzso zzso they are often hypothesized to be involved in important behavioral functions, such as zzso the zzso of moving objects and surfaces relative to the zzso However, the zzso underlying such selectivity are zzso In this work we have developed a unique, zzso motion stimulus and used it to probe the complex selectivity of zzso zzso The resulting data were then used to estimate the properties of the zzso zzso to each zzso This analysis yielded models that successfully accounted for much of the observed stimulus zzso provided that the zzso were combined via a zzso integration mechanism that zzso a zzso interaction among zzso zzso In simulations we found that this type of integration has the functional role of improving estimates of the zzso zzso of moving zzso As this zzso is of general utility for detecting complex stimulus features, we suggest that it may represent a fundamental aspect of zzso sensory zzso
