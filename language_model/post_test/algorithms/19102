zzso zzso zzso is widely used in the structural characterization and secondary structure determination of zzso The vacuum zzso region zzso 190 zzso where zzso transitions have an influence on the CD zzso can be zzso using zzso radiation circular zzso zzso zzso Recently, zzso transitions in a zzso diverse set of zzso have been characterized zzso zzso using complete active space zzso field calculations, and the relevant charge zzso have been zzso for use in the zzso method for calculations of protein zzso Here, we present calculations of the vacuum zzso CD zzso of 71 zzso for which experimental zzso zzso and X-ray crystal structures are zzso The theoretical zzso are calculated considering zzso and side chain zzso This significantly improves the agreement with experiment, raising the zzso correlation zzso between the calculated and the experimental intensity at 175 zzso from zzso to zzso The influence of the zzso on zzso transitions is analyzed in detail, showing that the zzso zzso zzso zzso transitions are most important in zzso zzso whereas in beta strand proteins the zzso zzso zzso zzso transition along the chain in the zzso to zzso direction is most zzso
