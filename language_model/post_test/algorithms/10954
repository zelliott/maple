Chemical structure provides exhaustive description of a compound, but it is often proprietary and thus an impediment in the exchange of zzso For example, structure disclosure is often needed for the selection of most similar or dissimilar zzso Authors propose a zzso zzso based on structural fragments zzso that can be efficiently used for the similarity and diversity selections without disclosing structures from the reference zzso For an increased security purposes, authors recommend that such set contains at least some tens of zzso Analysis of reverse engineering feasibility showed that the problem difficulty grows with decrease of the zzso zzso The zzso is illustrated with concrete calculations on known zzso zzso and zzso zzso We also investigate a problem of scaffold identification in zzso library zzso The results show that relatively small screens of radius equal to 2 bond lengths perform well in the similarity zzso while radius 4 screens yield better results in diversity zzso The software zzso of the zzso taking zzso file with a reference set generates screens of various zzso which are subsequently used for the similarity and diversity sorting of external zzso Since the reverse engineering of the reference set molecules from their screens has the same difficulty as the zzso zzso encryption algorithm, generated screens can be stored openly without further zzso This approach ensures an end user transfers only a set of structural fragments and no other zzso Like other zzso of zzso the zzso zzso cannot give zzso guarantee of protecting a chemical structure from zzso but probability of initial structure identification is very zzso of zzso in typical zzso
