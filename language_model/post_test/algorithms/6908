This paper describes zzso for signal extraction for use as a front-end of zzso devices, speech recognition systems, as well as hearing aids that operate in noisy zzso The development was based on some independent, hypothesized theories of the zzso mechanics of biological systems in which directional hearing is enabled mainly by zzso processing of zzso directional zzso Our system uses two microphones as input devices and a signal processing method based on the two input zzso The signal processing procedure comprises two major zzso zzso source zzso and zzso cancellation of noise sources based on knowledge of the locations of all sound zzso The source zzso detailed in our previous paper zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1888 zzso was based on a zzso biological architecture zzso a dual zzso and a coincidence detection zzso This paper focuses on description of the noise cancellation zzso We designed a simple zzso method which, when zzso employed over the dual zzso structure in the broadband manner, can effectively cancel multiple interfering sound sources and consequently enhance the desired zzso We obtained an 8-10 zzso enhancement for the desired speech in the situations of four zzso in the zzso acoustic test (or zzso zzso enhancement in the situations of six zzso in the computer zzso when all the sounds were equally intense and temporally zzso
