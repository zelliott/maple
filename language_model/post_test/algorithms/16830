zzso causes an abnormal three zzso zzso of the spine that is often treated by an zzso device called zzso The objective of this research was to develop a new approach to automatically identify the optimal design of zzso brace, based on clinical and patient zzso In this approach, torso geometry of the zzso patient was achieved using a 3-D imaging system that generated a 3-D torso surface model, which was modified using a custom zzso system to design the 3-D brace surface zzso Two design zzso a zzso correction factor and a zzso correction factor, were selected to design the brace geometry from the torso zzso The 3-D digital brace was evaluated by three clinical evaluation measures zzso rib zzso and principal axis angle zzso and one patient evaluation measure zzso A zzso zzso method was employed to identify the optimal design parameters considering both clinical and patient zzso
