In this study, we have developed a statistical zzso zzso method to extract statistical atomic interaction zzso from known, zzso protein zzso Our method zzso the long-standing reference state problem in zzso traditional zzso scoring functions, by using rapid zzso through a physical, global convergence zzso The rapid convergence of this zzso method, unlike other zzso zzso methods, warrants the feasibility of zzso zzso zzso statistical zzso to keep the scoring zzso The derived zzso referred to as zzso have been validated using three diverse zzso the high-resolution decoy set, the zzso benchmark decoy set, and the zzso decoy zzso zzso improvement in performance has been zzso Finally, comparisons between the zzso of our model and zzso of a zzso scoring function with a zzso reference state have revealed the reason for the better performance of our scoring function, which could provide useful insight into the development of other physical scoring zzso The zzso developed in this study are generally zzso for structural selection in protein structure zzso
