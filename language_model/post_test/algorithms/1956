The risk of zzso tissue damage to zzso cage, heart, and lung during MR guided zzso zzso of breast cancer can be greatly reduced if a phased array zzso design with a lateral beam direction is used in combination with a large zzso The disadvantage is an increased sensitivity to focus aberrations due to tissue zzso Here, the authors propose to restore the focal zzso by using a matched zzso phase zzso which is based on a zzso obtained tissue zzso 

The method combines high resolution zzso with ultrasound wave zzso of different tissue types to determine a phase zzso which compensates focal point aberrations caused by tissue zzso zzso zzso of tissue is used to zzso the relative proportion of each tissue type along a line running from the center of each element of the phased array to the target focal zzso 

For tissue types with a zzso difference of zzso the proposed method allows to zzso the phase aberration with an accuracy of zzso and a correlation factor zzso Using the zzso method for a complex zzso phantom resulted in zzso of the zzso pressure, whereas only zzso of the zzso pressure is obtained in absence of any phase zzso 

Since the proposed zzso zzso is compatible with a standard zzso zzso and requires only a minimal amount of processing, it presents a promising approach to compensate for aberration in zzso zzso such as the human zzso
