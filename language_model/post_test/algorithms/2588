Identification of DNA motifs from zzso zzso zzso zzso data is a powerful method for understanding the zzso regulatory zzso However, most established methods are designed for small sample sizes and are inefficient for zzso zzso Here we propose a new zzso occurrence model to reflect the fact that functional DNA zzso often cluster around zzso peak zzso With this model, we introduced a new measure to discover functional zzso Using zzso we demonstrated that our method is more robust against noises in zzso data than available zzso A novel word zzso method is also implemented to group similar zzso into position weight zzso zzso Our method was applied to a diverse set of zzso experiments to demonstrate its high sensitivity and zzso zzso our method is much faster than several other methods for large sample zzso Thus, we have developed an efficient and effective motif discovery method for zzso zzso
