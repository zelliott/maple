zzso methods for identifying protein coding regions in zzso DNA have progressed significantly in recent years, but there is still a strong need for more accurate zzso solutions to the gene finding zzso zzso zzso sequencing projects depend greatly on gene finding to generate accurate and complete gene zzso zzso in gene finding software are being driven by the development of better zzso zzso a better understanding of the cell's mechanisms for zzso and translation, and the enormous increases in zzso sequence zzso This paper reviews some of the most widely used zzso for gene finding in plants, including technical descriptions of how they work and recent zzso of their success on the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso
