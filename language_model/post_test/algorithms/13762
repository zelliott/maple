This work presents a method to compare local clusters of interacting zzso as observed in a known three-dimensional protein structure with corresponding clusters zzso from zzso protein zzso assuming zzso protein zzso For this purpose the local environment of a selected zzso in a known protein structure is defined as the ensemble of zzso acids in contact with it in the folded zzso Using a multiple sequence alignment to identify corresponding zzso in zzso zzso a detailed comparison can be performed between the local environment of a selected zzso acid in the template protein structure and the expected local environments at the sets of equivalent zzso derived from the aligned protein zzso The comparison makes it possible to detect zzso local features such as hydrogen bonding or zzso in zzso zzso A global measure of environmental similarity is also zzso to search for zzso zzso acid clusters subject to functional or structural zzso The proposed approach is useful for investigating protein function as well as for zzso zzso experiments, where appropriate zzso acid zzso can be suggested by observing naturally occurring protein zzso
