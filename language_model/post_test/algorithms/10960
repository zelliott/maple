Because of the ongoing development to more complex zzso techniques in zzso the use of modem computer graphics while designing a dose plan becomes increasingly essential and more zzso In this paper, we describe a concept to simulate zzso zzso treatment techniques on the zzso All important components of the treatment device and relevant patient structures are mapped to an internal model, which allows simulation of motion sequences as well as the interactive adjustment of treatment zzso The intention of this user interface is to save time by using mainly zzso zzso in the zzso process instead of running through the dose calculation every zzso
