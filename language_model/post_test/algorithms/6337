The present paper describes the zzso zzso of protein structure comparison in three dimensions, which includes an original procedure of matching zzso built on the zzso zzso zzso followed by an zzso three-dimensional alignment of protein backbone zzso zzso The zzso results are compared with those obtained from other protein comparison zzso and the advantages and disadvantages of different scores that are used for structure recognition are zzso A new score, balancing the zzso and alignment length zzso is zzso It is found that different servers agree reasonably well on the new score, while showing considerable differences in zzso and zzso
