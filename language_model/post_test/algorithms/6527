Clinical trials necessary for the development of new treatment often require testing of multiple zzso for zzso or zzso relative to an existing effective standard zzso An example is a vaccine study with multiple zzso zzso in zzso of subjects receiving a combination vaccine such as a zzso zzso which contains many different zzso of the zzso zzso This article describes testing methods for the demonstration of simultaneous marginal zzso or zzso of two treatments on each component of the response zzso that follows a zzso normal zzso zzso simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the testing method and to examine under what conditions the power is substantially different if the multiple zzso are assumed to be independent when they are actually strongly zzso Data from an illustrative example are used to describe how the study power can be evaluated in the design of the zzso
