An zzso medical image zzso zzso based on zzso transform and improved zzso zzso is zzso The goal of the proposed method is to maintain the zzso information of the medical image at a high zzso zzso zzso transformation was first applied to the zzso For the zzso zzso of zzso zzso a zzso zzso method was zzso for each of the zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso with variable block size was zzso In the novel zzso zzso method, local zzso dimension zzso was used to analyze the local complexity of each zzso zzso zzso Then an optimal zzso method was employed to partition each zzso zzso zzso into several sizes of zzso After that, a modified zzso approach which is based on energy function was used in the zzso training zzso At last, zzso zzso coding was implemented in different types of zzso In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, zzso zzso and zzso coding approach were chosen as contrast zzso Experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the zzso performance and can achieve a balance between the zzso ratio and the image visual zzso
