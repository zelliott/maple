This work presents the first high level correlated zzso zzso study of the zzso potential energy surface of the ground electronic state of the zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso study was carried out using the zzso level of theory with the zzso basis sets, where X zzso D, zzso zzso and zzso All calculated energies were corrected using the zzso zzso The lowest energy geometry and the shape of the zzso potential energy surface showed significant dependence on the size of the basis set as well as the zzso zzso The most accurate results were obtained using the zzso and zzso combinations with the zzso zzso These calculations yield a global minimum of zzso zzso where zzso axes of the zzso and zzso zzso are parallel to each zzso For this zzso the zzso value is zzso zzso which is in excellent agreement with the CBS limit of zzso zzso The distance between centers of masses of the zzso and zzso zzso within the complex is zzso zzso zzso heights to rotation of the zzso and zzso units by 180 degrees about the axis that connects their centers of masses are 24 and 159 zzso zzso The current results should stimulate zzso zzso detection of the zzso zzso
