We present a measurement protocol that effectively eliminates both the zzso and the zzso drift typically observed in the channel zzso of zzso carbon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso during the application of gate zzso Before each resistance zzso the gate is first stepped through a series of alternating positive and negative zzso to produce a neutral charge distribution within the zzso This process is highly effective at removing the zzso in the channel zzso and zzso zzso further demonstrate that the drain current is stable and zzso independent of the prior measurement zzso The effectiveness of this method can be understood within the zzso zzso model, which we demonstrate as a useful framework to predict the observed zzso
