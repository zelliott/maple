Two different artificial intelligence techniques namely artificial neural network zzso and genetic zzso zzso were integrated for zzso zzso medium for the production of zzso The experimental data reported in a previous study were used to build the neural zzso The ANN was trained using the back propagation zzso The ANN predicted values showed good agreement with the zzso reported ones from a response surface based zzso The zzso of three medium zzso zzso zzso 80, zzso and zzso served as zzso to the neural network model and the zzso activity as the output of the zzso A model was generated with a zzso of correlation zzso of zzso for the training set and zzso for the test zzso A genetic zzso was used to zzso the input space of the neural network model to find the optimum settings for maximum zzso zzso This artificial neural network supported genetic zzso predicted a maximum zzso activity of zzso at medium composition of zzso zzso zzso 80, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso predicted model gave a zzso increase of zzso activity over the zzso based prediction for zzso zzso zzso The maximum zzso activity zzso obtained using the zzso designed medium was zzso which was in good agreement with the predicted zzso
