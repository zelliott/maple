zzso zzso controlled trials zzso are frequently used in health service zzso Assuming an average cluster size, required sample sizes are readily zzso for both zzso and continuous zzso by zzso a design effect or inflation zzso However, where the number of clusters are fixed in advance, but where it is possible to increase the number of individuals within each zzso as is frequently the case in health service zzso sample size zzso have been less well zzso 

We systematically outline sample size zzso (including required number of zzso units, zzso difference and power) for zzso with a fixed number of zzso to provide a concise summary for both zzso and continuous zzso zzso to the case of unequal cluster sizes are zzso 

For trials with a fixed number of equal sized clusters zzso the trial will be feasible provided the number of clusters is greater than the product of the number of individuals required under individual zzso zzso and the estimated zzso correlation zzso So, a simple rule is that the number of clusters zzso will be sufficient zzso zzso in zzso Where this is not the case, investigators can determine the maximum available power to detect the zzso difference, or the minimum zzso difference under the zzso value for zzso 

zzso a zzso with a fixed number of clusters might mean that the study will not be zzso leading to the notion of a minimum zzso difference (or a maximum achievable zzso irrespective of how many individuals are included within each zzso
