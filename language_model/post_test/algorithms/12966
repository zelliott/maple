We report the three-dimensional mapping of 150 zzso gold metallic zzso dispersed in a homogeneous transparent zzso zzso using zzso zzso We demonstrate that the position of single zzso can be well defined using only one incident fundamental beam and the harmonic zzso detection performed at right zzso The fundamental laser beam properties are determined using its spatial zzso function and used to prove that single zzso are zzso zzso resolved zzso are also performed allowing for a clear separation of the zzso response of the single gold metallic zzso from that of zzso of such zzso
