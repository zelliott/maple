zzso alter the loading pattern in zzso For example zzso hip implants cause the cortical bone to zzso and the zzso interface to zzso To date, simulations of zzso bone adaptations have succeeded for the bulk bone zzso zzso In this study we use an approach based on a combined zzso zzso to simultaneously predict both bulk and zzso zzso bone adaptation around a zzso hip zzso The influence of stem zzso is zzso a flexible zzso stem zzso an titanium zzso stem zzso and a stiff zzso chrome zzso stem zzso The results predict that an zzso stem reduces zzso bone loss because stress shielding is prevented but it increases zzso interface zzso due to zzso zzso On the other hand, a stiff zzso chrome stem increases zzso zzso zzso but does not induce zzso zzso zzso zzso however zzso zzso surrounding the zzso tip is predicted to increase with stiffer zzso zzso for the titanium stem were predicted to zzso both strain and damage related zzso We propose that this combined zzso zzso zzso can provide realistic simulations of the response of bone around zzso zzso zzso
