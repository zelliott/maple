The extent and severity are two important parameters when describing a regional zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these two parameters should be independent of each other, but we have shown in a previous study that there is an zzso This zzso has been investigated in two commercially available analysis programs zzso and zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso 

An zzso digital computer phantom and a zzso Carlo program were used to generate zzso zzso Several defects of different volumes and zzso activity zzso reductions were simulated and zzso zzso of the measures of extent and severity with their corresponding known values led to the development of a correction model based on zzso zzso zzso This model was then applied to a test group consisting of 10 different zzso zzso 

Our results showed that the zzso was reduced significantly for most of our test cases after applying the correction zzso The application of the correction model to the test group demonstrated that the model was robust with respect to different patient zzso A further test with projections that simulated a perfect zzso system revealed that the zzso between the extent and severity was not caused by the limited spatial resolution of the zzso system, but rather the inherent design of the zzso of the analysis zzso 

A model has been developed to take into account the zzso of the extent and zzso
