zzso cortical field zzso are widely used in zzso studies into cortical zzso but insight in the underlying neural mechanisms is severely hampered by ambiguities in the interpretation of the field zzso The present study aimed at identifying the precise relationships between the primary evoked cortical field potential (the zzso zzso and the zzso and spatial sequence in which different local cortical zzso are zzso We zzso zzso the median nerve and recorded field zzso using a zzso depth probe in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Current source density analysis was used and a grand average was constructed based on all individual animals taking into account individual differences in cortical zzso zzso of stimulus strength, selective averaging of single trial responses, and zzso zzso were used to help zzso overlapping zzso and to determine the sequence of zzso zzso We zzso three zzso in the generation of the zzso zzso In the first phase, specific zzso zzso zzso both layer III and layer V zzso zzso In the second phase, superficial zzso cells are zzso via zzso zzso zzso In the third phase, population spikes are generated in layer zzso zzso cells, associated with a distinct fast zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso of layer zzso zzso cells produce an enhanced zzso of the zzso zzso cells in layer zzso which generates zzso
