New systematic methods developed for equilibrium isotope exchange zzso have been used to analyze the effects of zzso zzso and inhibitor zzso with zzso coli zzso zzso This zzso approach requires zzso variation of zzso with fixed zzso levels of zzso and zzso variation of at least three combinations of zzso pairs in constant ratio at zzso zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso held constant, in the presence and absence of added zzso Both zzso and zzso had much stronger effects on the zzso in equilibrium zzso exchange rate than on zzso in equilibrium zzso The zzso analog zzso zzso then zzso zzso in equilibrium zzso more strongly than zzso in equilibrium zzso zzso gave complete zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso of either exchange was only zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence and absence of zzso indicate that zzso and zzso zzso the observed values of zzso and zzso in different fashions without appreciably changing the observed Hill zzso Computer simulations indicate that the primary site of zzso and zzso action is the association rate for zzso not the zzso zzso zzso This finding is substantiated by previous studies in which modified zzso zzso had lost cooperative zzso binding without loss of sensitivity to zzso or in which sensitivity to one zzso could be deleted zzso The present results, with newly devised computer simulation and analysis methods, illustrate the usefulness of equilibrium isotope exchange kinetic zzso for providing unique insights to zzso regulatory mechanisms, to define exactly which steps are altered in a given kinetic zzso
