zzso of zzso zzso zzso signals is challenging in view of the complex and often unpredictable behaviors and interactions of the action potential trains of different motor units that constitute the zzso zzso zzso These phenomena create a myriad of problem situations that a decomposition technique needs to address to attain zzso and accuracy levels required for various scientific and clinical zzso Starting with the maximum a zzso probability zzso adapted from the original precision decomposition system zzso I) of zzso and De zzso zzso 26), an artificial intelligence approach has been used to develop a zzso system zzso zzso for addressing some of the zzso identified problem zzso On a database of zzso zzso signals reflecting such conditions, the fully automatic zzso II system is found to achieve a decomposition accuracy of zzso despite the fact that its results include zzso action potential trains that are not zzso at all via systems such as zzso zzso zzso was established by comparing the zzso of zzso zzso signals obtained from two zzso At the end of the automatic zzso II decomposition zzso the accuracy may be enhanced to nearly zzso via an interactive editor, a particularly significant fact for the previously zzso zzso
