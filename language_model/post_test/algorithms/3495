We present a set of techniques for embedding the physics of the imaging process that generates a class of magnetic resonance images zzso into a zzso or registration zzso This results in substantial zzso to acquisition zzso as the effect of these parameters on the contrast properties of various brain structures is explicitly modeled in the zzso In addition, the integration of image acquisition with tissue zzso allows the derivation of sequences that are optimal for zzso zzso Another benefit of these procedures is the generation of zzso models of the intrinsic tissue parameters that cause MR contrast zzso zzso zzso density, zzso allowing access to these zzso relevant parameters that may change with disease or zzso resulting in zzso zzso in MR images that are otherwise difficult to zzso Finally, we also present a high band zzso zzso zzso pulse sequence that results in high zzso ratio with minimal image distortion due to zzso zzso This sequence has the added benefit of allowing the explicit zzso of zzso and of reducing zzso intensity zzso
