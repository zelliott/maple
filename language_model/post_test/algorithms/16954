zzso are rapidly becoming a powerful and ubiquitous tool for the analysis of protein structure and for event detection in zzso protein zzso Despite their rise in popularity, however, the graph representations employed to date have shared certain features and parameters that have not been thoroughly zzso Here, we examine and compare variations on the construction of graph zzso and graph zzso We propose a graph representation based on chemical groups of similar atoms within a protein rather than zzso or secondary structure and find that even very simple analyses using this representation form a powerful event detection system with significant advantages over zzso graph zzso We additionally compare graph edges based on probability of contact to graph edges based on contact strength and analyses of the entire graph structure to an alternative and more zzso zzso zzso zzso We develop the simplest useful technique for analyzing protein simulations based on these comparisons and use it to shed light on the speed with which zzso protein structures adjust to a zzso environment at room temperature in zzso
