The growing popularity of zzso evolutionary zzso zzso for solving zzso problems warrants the careful investigation of their search controls and failure zzso This study contributes a new diagnostic assessment framework for rigorously evaluating the effectiveness, zzso efficiency, and zzso of zzso as well as identifying their search controls and failure zzso The framework is demonstrated using the recently introduced zzso zzso zzso see zzso zzso see zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on 33 instances of 18 test problems from the zzso zzso and zzso 2009 test zzso The diagnostic framework exploits zzso zzso decomposition to provide guidance on the zzso zzso zzso controls when performing a zzso zzso This study represents one of the most comprehensive empirical assessments of zzso ever zzso
