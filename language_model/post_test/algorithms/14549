In this work, we focus on the problem of training ensembles or, more generally, a set of zzso maps zzso In the light of new theory behind ensemble learning, in particular negative correlation learning zzso the question arises if zzso ensemble learning can benefit from zzso learning when the individual learning stages are zzso by a term zzso correlation in zzso We can show that zzso are well suited as weak ensemble components with a small number of zzso Using our approach, we obtain efficiently trained zzso ensembles outperforming other reference zzso Due to the transparency of zzso we can give insights into the zzso between diversity and zzso accuracy inside zzso We are able to shed light on the diversity arising over a combination of several factors: explicit versus implicit as well as zzso versus zzso zzso fully exploits the potential of zzso ensemble learning when the single neural networks zzso at the highest level and stability is zzso The reported zzso zzso exhibit high correlations to the prediction zzso
