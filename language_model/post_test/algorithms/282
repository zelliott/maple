An zzso zzso controller was developed based on previous work using the intrinsic pump zzso Those intrinsic parameters were measured by long-term reliable zzso The zzso controller was designed to track the varying total peripheral resistance and update the controller parameters zzso The controller was studied in computer simulation on two different types of pumps, whose zzso characteristics are described by zzso and dynamic zzso zzso The pump pressure rise of both pumps is zzso With the designed zzso zzso the abnormal zzso values indicating zzso heart failure, including total blood flow, mean zzso pressure, left zzso zzso pressure, are all successfully restored to normal zzso This good performance is consistent for both pumps in the variation of activities and left zzso failure zzso The results show that the designed controller can be zzso for rotary blood pumps whose pump pressure rise can be measured or derived from pump intrinsic zzso
