The geometry of the carotid siphon has a large zzso between subjects, which has prompted its study as a potential geometric risk factor for the onset of vascular zzso on and off the internal carotid artery zzso In this work, we present a methodology for an objective and extensive geometric characterization of carotid siphon zzso by a set of anatomical zzso We introduce a complete and automated characterization zzso Starting from the zzso of zzso from zzso image and its zzso zzso we first identify zzso by characterizing vessel tree zzso and training a support zzso machine zzso to detect zzso terminal zzso On zzso zzso curve, we detect anatomical landmarks of carotid siphon by modeling it as a sequence of four zzso and selecting their centers and zzso between zzso zzso are detected from the trajectory of the zzso zzso expressed in the parallel transport frame of the zzso Finally, using the detected landmarks, we characterize the geometry in two complementary zzso First, with a set of local and global geometric features, known to affect zzso Second, using large deformation zzso metric curve mapping zzso to zzso zzso shape zzso We processed 96 images acquired with zzso zzso zzso zzso identification had a zzso success rate of zzso zzso landmarking was validated by computing limits of agreement with the reference taken to be the locations of the manually placed landmarks averaged across multiple zzso For all but one landmark, either the bias was not statistically significant or the zzso was within 50% of the zzso zzso The subsequently zzso values of geometric features and zzso were commensurate to the ones obtained with manual zzso The characterization based on zzso zzso proved better in zzso the carotid siphon shape classes than the one based on geometric zzso The proposed characterization provides a rich description of geometry and is ready to be applied in the search for geometric risk factors of the carotid zzso
