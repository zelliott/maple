Root system traits are important in view of current challenges such as sustainable crop production with reduced fertilizer input or in zzso zzso We present a novel approach for recovering root architectural parameters based on zzso zzso It is based on a graph representation of the segmented and zzso image of the root system, where individual roots are tracked in a fully automated zzso Using a dynamic root architecture model for deciding whether a specific path in the graph is likely to represent a root helps to distinguish root zzso from branches and favors the analysis of root development over a sequence of zzso After the root tracking step, global traits such as zzso characteristics as well as root architectural parameters are zzso Analysis of zzso zzso root system images of zzso zzso zzso grown in zzso filled with sandy soil results in a set of root architectural zzso They are used to simulate the dynamic development of the root system and to zzso the corresponding root length zzso in the zzso The graph representation of the root system provides global information about connectivity inside the zzso The underlying root growth model helps to determine which path inside the graph is most likely for a given zzso This zzso the systematic investigation of root architectural traits, in particular with respect to the zzso of dynamic root architecture zzso
