zzso zzso procedures zzso zzso zzso zzso graft zzso provide minimally invasive therapy to treat a wide range of zzso These procedures involve the use of flexible tipped zzso to advance diagnostic or therapeutic zzso into a patient's vascular or visceral zzso This paper presents a real-time physically based hybrid modeling approach to simulating zzso zzso The long, slender body of the zzso zzso is simulated using zzso elastic zzso zzso and the shorter flexible tip composed of a straight, zzso or angled design is modeled using a more efficient generalized zzso zzso zzso the proposed approach efficiently zzso intrinsic dynamic behaviors of zzso interactions within vascular zzso The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated using detailed zzso simulations inside 3-D blood vessel structures derived from zzso zzso zzso A validation study compares positions of four physical zzso deployed within a vascular zzso with the zzso of the corresponding simulated zzso within a virtual model of the zzso An zzso zzso is also implemented to further improve the accuracy of the zzso The presented simulation model is suitable for interactive virtual reality-based training and for treatment zzso
