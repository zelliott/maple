zzso zzso based on a zzso zzso zzso were used to simultaneously zzso seven zzso acid zzso on one face of a zzso alpha zzso zzso a zzso binding site in the light harvesting II antenna of zzso zzso This pigmented protein provides a model system for developing complex zzso schemes, because simple zzso zzso can be used to zzso protein zzso structure, and zzso Colony screening by Digital Imaging zzso showed that zzso of the zzso library bound zzso in two distinct zzso zzso This is approximately 200 times the zzso zzso zzso of conventional zzso cassette zzso using zzso zzso zzso evaluated in this model system are generally zzso and should enable simultaneous zzso at more positions in a protein than currently possible, or zzso decrease the screening size of zzso zzso
