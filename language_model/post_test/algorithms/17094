Application of the zzso zzso for zzso in the generalized mixed model has been largely unsuccessful because the zzso cannot be determined in most zzso The zzso zzso the conditional expectation of the complete data zzso and when the random effect distribution is normal, this expectation remains an intractable zzso The problem can be approached by zzso or zzso zzso however, the zzso burden imposed by zzso integration methods and the absence of an accurate zzso approximation have limited the use of the zzso zzso In this paper, zzso method is adapted for zzso approximation within the zzso The proposed zzso is zzso straightforward and retains much of the conceptual simplicity of the conventional zzso algorithm, although the usual convergence properties are not zzso The proposed zzso zzso multiple random factors and random effect zzso besides the normal, zzso the zzso zzso zzso estimates obtained for several data sets and through simulation show that this modified zzso zzso compares favorably with other generalized mixed model zzso
