This paper describes a complete system to create zzso accurate zzso volume deformation and animation of articulated body regions, starting from multiple in zzso volume scans of a specific zzso In order to solve the correspondence problem across volume scans, a template volume is registered to each zzso The wide range of pose variations is first zzso by volume blend deformation zzso providing proper zzso of the articulated subject in different zzso A novel registration method is presented to efficiently reduce the zzso cost while avoiding strong local zzso inherent in complex articulated body volume zzso The zzso highly zzso the degrees of freedom and search space involved in the zzso zzso using zzso volume structures and locally constrained deformation based on the zzso clamped zzso Our registration step establishes a correspondence across scans, allowing a zzso deformation approach in the volume zzso The results provide an zzso zzso zzso human body model, zzso accurate inner tissue zzso and realistic volume animation of articulated movements driven by standard joint control estimated from the actual zzso Our approach also addresses the practical issues arising in using scans from living zzso The zzso of our zzso is tested by their applications on the hand, probably the most complex articulated region in the body, and the knee, a frequent subject area for medical imaging due to zzso
