In a zzso approach to zzso transport in zzso suspensions, the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso flow zzso are derived from zzso zzso with slip boundary conditions imposed by zzso zzso zzso The resulting fluid zzso field zzso significantly differs from that induced by an zzso driven zzso We find, in particular, that zzso due to surface forces is insensitive to zzso zzso As a consequence, the zzso diffusion zzso zzso of zzso solutions is independent of molecular weight and zzso
