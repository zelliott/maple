This paper describes the development of a methodology for performing a mechanical analysis of hair cell zzso zzso The zzso were modeled as zzso zzso beams, and zzso were modeled as zzso zzso These models were incorporated into software, which performs a finite element analysis of a zzso zzso The zzso incorporates aspects of the bundle such as geometric realignment and zzso of compressed side zzso A sample bundle is introduced and results of modeling it are zzso
