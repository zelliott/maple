The Ottawa zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Zone Algorithm are assessment rules designed to minimize zzso performed on children with ankle zzso We aim to determine the criterion zzso of the zzso 3 rules for predicting clinically important ankle fractures in zzso 

This was a prospective cohort study performed in a pediatric emergency zzso Children aged 16 years and younger and with acute ankle trauma were zzso Physicians were initially trained to assess patients according to the Ottawa zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Zone zzso Furthermore, they implemented each rule with a standardized zzso zzso and referral to zzso were left to the zzso zzso The primary outcome was the confirmation of a clinically important fracture confirmed during the orthopedic zzso Patients who did not require orthopedic follow-up were contacted by zzso 

zzso was performed for 245 of the 272 zzso All patients with no zzso were reached by zzso zzso participants had a clinically important zzso The sensitivity and specificity of the rules were zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for the Ottawa zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for the zzso Zone zzso 

The Ottawa zzso Rules identified all children with a clinically important zzso whereas the zzso zzso and the zzso Zone Algorithm showed lower zzso The zzso zzso showed the best specificity for clinically important fractures, decreasing the need for zzso by zzso but had missed 6 important zzso
