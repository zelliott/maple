zzso are zzso imaging techniques that record brain activity with high zzso zzso However, zzso of brain source currents from surface recordings requires solving an zzso inverse zzso zzso lines of evidence in zzso from zzso network models to zzso imaging and zzso suggest that cortical zzso is a distributed zzso dynamic process, supported by both local and long-distance zzso zzso Because zzso dynamics of this kind are central to brain zzso inverse solutions could be improved by incorporating models of these zzso In this article, we present a model for cortical activity based on zzso zzso that incorporates local zzso interactions between distributed sources in a manner consistent with zzso and zzso We develop a dynamic maximum a zzso zzso zzso source zzso zzso for zzso of cortical sources and model parameters based on the Kalman zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso We apply the zzso zzso to simulated experiments as well as to human experimental zzso Furthermore, we derive expressions to relate our dynamic zzso formulas to those of standard zzso models, and show how dynamic methods zzso zzso past and future zzso Our results establish the feasibility of zzso dynamic zzso in large-scale distributed source spaces with several thousand source locations and hundreds of sensors, with resulting inverse solutions that provide substantial performance improvements over zzso zzso
