Digital zzso is an imaging technique to produce a zzso image from a series of angular digital images in a manner similar to conventional focal plane zzso Unlike film focal plane zzso the acquisition of the data in a zzso geometry causes the image zzso to be positioned at various angles to the reconstruction zzso The digital nature of the data allows for input images to be combined into the desired plane with the flexibility of generating zzso of many separate planes from a single set of input zzso zzso zzso were obtained of a low contrast zzso zzso phantom and zzso breast utilizing a zzso zzso biopsy unit with a coupled source and digital detector in a zzso zzso zzso of 9 and 41 zzso projections were collected over a 30 degrees angular zzso zzso images were reconstructed using a zzso zzso algorithm, an zzso zzso zzso zzso that allows the partial zzso of zzso planes, and an zzso Reconstruction zzso zzso These were compared with single view digital zzso The zzso effectiveness at enhancing visibility of an obscured LCD phantom was zzso in terms of the Signal to Noise zzso zzso and Signal to zzso zzso zzso all zzso to the metric value for the single projection zzso The zzso effectiveness at removing zzso artifacts in a zzso breast was zzso in terms of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The technology proved effective at partially removing out of focus structures and enhancing zzso and zzso The zzso zzso was highest at zzso for the obscured LCD zzso using nine projections and IS zzso The zzso zzso was highest at zzso for the obscured LCD zzso using 41 projections and an zzso zzso The highest zzso metric values occurred with the obscured zzso This supports the assertion that the greatest value of zzso is in imaging zzso zzso The zzso performance was best with the zzso technique and nine zzso
