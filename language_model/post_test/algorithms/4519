This paper described a simple zzso method for determining the merit of a set of zzso sequence assignments made using tandem mass zzso The method involved comparing a prediction based on the known zzso behavior of a sequence assignment zzso with the assignments generated from a particular data zzso A particular zzso of this comparison was defined through the construction of a plot of the data, the zzso as well as a zzso derived from this plot, the zzso This plot and zzso were shown to be able to readily characterize the relative quality of a set of zzso sequence assignments and to allow the straightforward determination of probability threshold values for the interpretation of zzso zzso This plot is independent of the zzso or scoring scheme used to estimate the statistical significance of a set of experimental results; rather, it can be used as an objective test of the correctness of those zzso The zzso can also be used as a zzso to evaluate the relative merit of protein zzso such as those made across zzso species zzso zzso
