Dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso has proven to be a highly sensitive imaging zzso in diagnosing breast zzso However, analyzing the zzso is time-consuming and prone to errors due to the large volume of zzso zzso models to zzso contrast zzso such as the black box methods and zzso analysis, are zzso sensitive to noise and depend on a large number of external factors such as imaging zzso patient zzso zzso input function, and fitting zzso leading to inaccurate zzso In this paper, we have developed a novel zzso Learning Algorithm for zzso zzso zzso based on Hidden zzso Models to zzso regions of zzso corresponding to zzso The zzso zzso has been trained to identify zzso belonging to the tumor class using the zzso curve, first and second derivatives of the intensity zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a composite zzso consisting of a zzso of the intensity, zzso and acceleration zzso The results of zzso trained for the four zzso has been shown for 22 zzso zzso Carcinoma zzso and 19 zzso Carcinoma In zzso zzso zzso The zzso trained for the zzso zzso shows the best performance in zzso the tumors when compared with the zzso performed by an expert zzso and the output of a commercially available software, zzso
