In this paper, we describe a polarization sensitive zzso subcutaneous and muscular imaging system based on common path optical zzso zzso zzso using a near infrared zzso The zzso and lateral resolutions of the zzso system are 9 and 6 zzso zzso The main goal of this work is to build a high-resolution and minimally invasive optical zzso for examining various kinds of zzso zzso with intrinsic or form zzso The internal structural information is extracted by the real-time signal analysis zzso zzso of the modulated spectral intensity depending on the beam and tissue zzso The preliminary results using fresh beef zzso muscle and in zzso zzso zzso zzso show that it is possible to zzso the zzso effect of the tissue collagen fibers in the samples in order to achieve superior image contrast and sensitivity for the detection of hidden zzso zzso Compared to conventional zzso the proposed zzso system provides zzso images, which reflect the tissue zzso
