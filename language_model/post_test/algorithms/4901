The duration of a zzso zzso transfer is a representative measure of a person's status of physical zzso This paper measured the duration zzso and automatically using a pressure sensor array under a bed mattress and a floor plate beside the zzso zzso sequences were extracted from frames of sensor data measuring bed and floor pressure over zzso The start time was determined by an zzso based on the motion of the center of pressure zzso on the mattress toward the front edge of the zzso The end time was determined by modeling the foot pressure exerted on the floor in the zzso domain as the step response of a zzso transfer zzso As expected, young and old healthy adults generated shorter zzso zzso of around zzso and zzso zzso respectively, whereas zzso fracture and zzso adults produced longer zzso zzso of around zzso and zzso zzso The unobtrusive nature of pressure sensing techniques used in this paper provides valuable information that can be used for the ongoing monitoring of patients within zzso facilities or within the smart home zzso
