The brain is one of the most studied and highly complex systems in the biological zzso While much research has concentrated on studying the brain directly, our focus is the structure of the brain itself: at its core an interconnected network of zzso zzso A better understanding of the structural connectivity of the brain should zzso some of its functional zzso In this paper we analyze the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Consisting of only zzso zzso it is one of the zzso neural zzso Using a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the network, we use an zzso counting function to look for zzso self zzso This zzso representation is also used to plot zzso of the neural network in zzso zzso zzso properties of the system are zzso including average path length and zzso zzso We test for zzso of zzso using graph energy and zzso zzso on these zzso To better understand results, all calculations are also performed on random networks, branching trees, and known zzso as well as zzso which have been zzso to have zzso zzso We propose zzso for generating zzso zzso of each of these zzso
