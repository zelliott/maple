Mass zzso de zzso zzso sequencing is generally more reliable on high-resolution instruments zzso to their high resolution and mass zzso On a lower resolution instrument such as the more widely used zzso zzso zzso de zzso zzso sequencing is not so reliable or requires more zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso spectrum has been demonstrated to be quite zzso on an zzso trap instrument and can be predicted with good zzso A new de zzso zzso sequencing technique, zzso combining a zzso zzso for zzso sequence candidates and spectrum simulation for sequence zzso is developed for zzso acquired on an zzso trap zzso When zzso was used to sequence peptides zzso zzso in mass generated from zzso zzso of zzso and zzso the success rate was zzso with a false positive rate of only zzso when zzso and zzso zzso were not zzso
