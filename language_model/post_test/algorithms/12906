Whether in design or the various stages of fabrication and testing, an effective representation of an zzso shape is zzso Some zzso are given for implementing tailored zzso that are zzso suited to these zzso With minimal coding, these results allow a recently introduced zzso zzso basis to be employed to arbitrary zzso Interestingly, these robust and efficient methods are enabled by the introduction of an auxiliary zzso zzso
