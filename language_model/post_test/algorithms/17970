We present a method for simultaneous three-dimensional zzso structure generation and zzso alignment using a zzso zzso called zzso Proximity zzso zzso Current flexible molecular alignment methods either start from a single low-energy structure for each zzso and tweak bonds or zzso angles, or choose from multiple zzso of each zzso zzso that generate structures and align them zzso zzso genetic zzso are often zzso In earlier work, we used zzso to generate zzso zzso zzso by zzso adjusting zzso distances between atoms based on a set of geometric rules, and showed that it samples zzso space better and runs faster than earlier zzso In this work, we run zzso on the entire ensemble of molecules to be zzso Additional information about which atoms or groups of atoms in each zzso zzso to points in the zzso can come from an automatically generated hypothesis or be specified zzso We add distance terms to zzso to bring zzso points from different molecules closer in space, and also to line up zzso zzso associated with these zzso We also permit zzso points to be constrained to lie near external coordinates from a binding zzso The aligned zzso molecular structures are nearly correct if the zzso hypothesis is chemically zzso zzso by zzso of suitable distance and energy functions further improves the structures and weeds out zzso zzso The method can be used to test zzso zzso for a diverse set of active zzso starting from only a hypothesis about corresponding atoms or zzso
