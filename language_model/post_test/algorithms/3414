It has been shown in several studies that zzso zzso improves the life span and aspects of life performance of laboratory zzso To obtain further details on the beneficial effects of zzso a long-term study has been performed on male zzso zzso mice treated with this zzso Four month-old mice were each given 4 zzso of zzso in zzso saline via zzso zzso injection 3 zzso per zzso zzso were made of the zzso cold tolerance zzso zzso apparent total body protein turnover zzso changes in the major zzso and fatty acid compositions of the liver, zzso zzso activity and formation of zzso and observations on a range of pathological zzso It was found that the zzso zzso temperatures of the treated mice were higher and in the oldest group, heat performance capacity was better than those of the zzso After about 1 year of age the apparent biological zzso time of total body protein zzso was observed to be shorter in the treated zzso zzso increases were observed to occur in the proportions of the zzso fatty acids in the lipids of the liver in the mice injected with zzso Although no differences were observed in the zzso zzso activities, zzso zzso in the zzso of the experimental mice were significantly zzso zzso data showed that zzso associated with zzso occurred more frequently in the zzso zzso
