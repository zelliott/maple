zzso zzso zzso repeats (also referred to as von zzso factor type C zzso zzso have been identified in approximately 200 zzso zzso zzso These repeats, named on the basis of zzso acid conservation of 10 zzso zzso have been shown to bind members of the transforming growth zzso zzso zzso and are proposed to regulate growth factor zzso Here we describe the zzso zzso zzso solution structure, and dynamics of a zzso zzso zzso repeat from zzso zzso zzso which has been previously shown to bind zzso and bone zzso zzso The zzso structure zzso a two zzso architecture zzso by a flexible zzso zzso structures were calculated using zzso a de zzso prediction method, and final structure calculations were performed using zzso within zzso The zzso region contains mainly zzso and the zzso region is more irregular with the fold constrained by zzso zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso on a fast zzso was confirmed using zzso relaxation zzso We speculate that the mobility between the two zzso may decrease upon zzso zzso zzso and sequence comparisons have revealed an evolutionary relationship between the zzso zzso of the zzso module and the zzso type 1 domain, suggesting that these zzso share a common zzso Based on the previously reported mapping of zzso binding sites for vascular zzso growth factor to regions containing zzso type 1 zzso we discuss the possibility that this structural zzso might also have functional zzso
