We describe a software system developed to handle images obtained from different sources, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso single zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance zzso In developing the system, it was necessary to address the following zzso zzso The types of values that were encountered in both the zzso information and the zzso zzso zzso zzso floating point numbers, complex numbers and zzso zzso The use of zzso sets of keys, that is, how to choose keys and how to stabilize the use of keys among the user zzso This is, for example, how information such as the patient name, or the activity in zzso is zzso It is necessary to keep both the key values and the zzso zzso The development of a method for providing a database using flat files, zzso linear zzso zzso The maintenance of a history of values and zzso This is necessary in order to address the problem of determining from an image how that image was zzso The connection between an image and how it was derived is analogous to describing how a secondary standard is derived from a primary zzso
