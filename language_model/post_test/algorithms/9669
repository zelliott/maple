In conventional zzso zzso echo imaging utilizing zzso radio frequency zzso zzso zzso signal zzso are often generated, particularly when repetition time is short and/or zzso flip angle zzso becomes zzso This translates to significant errors in various quantitative applications based on zzso image zzso In this work, a novel zzso scheme is proposed, based on random zzso moments and zzso zzso This scheme results in a zzso condition, but achieves ideal mean signal zzso In order to suppress artifacts created by the zzso signal variations and at the same time attain the ideal signal intensity, zzso data acquisition is zzso The proposed method achieves ideal zzso for a wide range of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Phantom and in zzso experiments demonstrate improved performance for zzso mapping and zzso correction when compared with conventional zzso zzso zzso
