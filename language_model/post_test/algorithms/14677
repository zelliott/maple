zzso diabetic peripheral zzso zzso may not be adequately managed with available therapeutic zzso This phase III, zzso zzso trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of zzso extended release zzso for zzso painful zzso 

Patients zzso with at least a zzso history of zzso and/or zzso zzso use for zzso dissatisfaction with current treatment, and an average pain intensity score of at least 5 on an zzso zzso rating scale zzso zzso zzso zzso as bad as you can zzso were zzso to an optimal dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso during a zzso zzso zzso zzso patients zzso with at least a zzso reduction in pain intensity were zzso zzso to receive zzso or the optimal fixed dose of zzso zzso determined during the zzso phase for a zzso zzso zzso 

zzso 

The primary efficacy outcome was the change in average pain intensity from zzso determined by zzso zzso zzso Safety was assessed throughout the zzso 

The zzso mean difference between groups in the change in average pain intensity from the start of zzso treatment to week 12 was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A total of zzso zzso of patients reported at least a zzso improvement in pain intensity from the start to the end of the zzso zzso zzso of the patients who were zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso reported at least a zzso improvement from zzso to week 12 of the zzso zzso The most common zzso adverse events that occurred during zzso treatment with zzso zzso included zzso anxiety, zzso and zzso Potential limitations of this study are related to the enriched enrollment zzso trial design, which may result in a more homogeneous patient population during zzso treatment and may present a risk of zzso because of changes in side effects from the zzso to the zzso zzso 

Compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso bid provided a statistically significant difference in the maintenance of a clinically important improvement in pain 1 , 2 and was zzso by patients with painful zzso
