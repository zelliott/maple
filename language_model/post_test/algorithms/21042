Under a zzso model of molecular sequence evolution the probability of each possible pattern of a characters is well zzso The Kimura's zzso zzso model of evolution, allows zzso expression for these probabilities of by means of the zzso zzso as a function of the zzso T and the substitution probabilities on each edge of TM zzso In this paper we produce a direct zzso proof of these results, using zzso distances which zzso zzso distances between zzso This interpretation provides us with tools that were proved useful in related problems in the mathematical analysis of sequence zzso
