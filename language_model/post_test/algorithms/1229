The zzso of multiple zzso parameters in zzso source modeling zzso of zzso zzso data is a difficult zzso zzso problem due to multiple local zzso in the cost zzso A straightforward zzso zzso approach to such a problem is very susceptible to being trapped in a local zzso thereby resulting in incorrect estimates of the zzso zzso In this paper, we present and evaluate a more robust zzso approach based on the simulated zzso zzso The complexity of this approach for the zzso problem was reduced by separating the zzso parameters into linear zzso and zzso zzso zzso The effectiveness of the proposed method and its superiority over the traditional zzso zzso technique in escaping local zzso were tested and demonstrated through computer zzso The zzso zzso and its zzso for zzso zzso are also zzso We found the simulated zzso approach to be zzso more effective than the zzso method at zzso to the true global minimum for a number of different kinds of zzso problems simulated in this zzso In addition, the zzso cost of the proposed approach was only marginally higher than its zzso zzso The zzso method also yielded similar solutions irrespective of the initial guesses zzso The proposed simulated zzso method is an attractive alternative to the zzso method that is currently more common in zzso zzso zzso
