Since the beginning of the zzso the development of wireless capsule zzso has represented a major technological zzso The capsule is zzso by the patient and images are transmitted via several sensors positioned on the skin of the patient and downloaded in a computer zzso The first applications were focused on the exploration of the small zzso which was previously considered as an obscure area for conventional zzso Wireless capsule zzso of the small zzso is now an established technique with many acknowledged indications for the diagnosis of obscure zzso anemia of presumed zzso origin, Crohn's disease and small zzso zzso Recently, thanks to technological progresses, novel capsules have been developed for specific segments of the gut namely the zzso and the zzso Recent data suggest that these new capsules could have potential applications for the diagnosis of zzso zzso Barrett's zzso and for the screening and/or surveillance of zzso of the zzso However, further studies are required before such strategies could be approved for clinical use or even replace conventional zzso zzso In the zzso zzso in signal processing as well as in the zzso of sensors or markers may lead to a new generation of zzso zzso This technological breakthrough may ultimately result in new concepts and change current practice of zzso zzso
