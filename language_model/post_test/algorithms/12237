A novel zzso zzso technique is presented for an zzso system in network zzso zzso clusters toward maximum zzso similarity and minimum zzso similarity are generated from training data zzso The novelty of the technique lies in the fact that the parameters needed to construct higher order data models in general zzso zzso functions are zzso derived from the data sets using zzso zzso The technique is implemented in a zzso neural network that uses a zzso zzso basis function as the model zzso An evaluation based on the zzso and zzso of samples with respect to specific criteria is applied to zzso learn the output clusters of the neural zzso One significant advantage of this is its ability to detect individual anomaly types that are hard to detect with other zzso zzso zzso this technique, several feature zzso of the zzso zzso records that give above zzso detection at zzso rates below zzso were zzso
