We consider the image reconstruction problem for optical zzso with diffuse zzso The associated inverse scattering problem is analyzed by making use of particular zzso of the scattering zzso The effects of sampling and limited data are analyzed for several different experimental zzso and zzso efficient reconstruction zzso are zzso These zzso are suitable for the reconstruction of images from very large data zzso
