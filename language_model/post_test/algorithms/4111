To compare the effectiveness of dark blood zzso versus bright blood zzso zzso To assess the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso between zzso versus zzso To evaluate image quality level in the two zzso 

In a setting of 138 patients we performed zzso using cardiac gated zzso single zzso zzso and DB sequences in the middle zzso zzso Each acquisition was repeated during the same zzso zzso method was used to account for background zzso Image quality zzso was assessed using a 5 point grading scale and image analysis was conducted by 2 experienced zzso 

Compared with the conventional zzso zzso the zzso of correlation and significance of the DB technique was superior for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso is also lower for DB sequences for zzso values zzso zzso Assessment of artifacts showed a superior score for DB versus zzso scans (4 versus 3, zzso 

Improvement in terms of zzso observer and zzso study zzso using DB sequences was zzso The greatest disparity between them was seen in zzso zzso and higher zzso in DB was zzso Study demonstrates better performance of DB imaging compared to zzso in presence of comparable zzso
