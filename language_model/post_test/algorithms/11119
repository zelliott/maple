A zzso colony is a zzso composed of a zzso and interconnected network of zzso zzso zzso colonies with increased zzso and ability to exploit nutritionally complex zzso Moreover, zzso formation may be a driver for diversification at the species level by allowing lateral gene transfer between strains that are too zzso related to zzso zzso However, the processes by which zzso diversity develops and is maintained within a single colony are little zzso In particular, both theory and experiments show that genetically diverse colonies may be unstable and spontaneously segregate into genetically zzso zzso By directly measuring patterns of nuclear movement in the model zzso fungus zzso zzso we show that genetic diversity is maintained by complex mixing flows of zzso at all length scales within the zzso zzso zzso modeling and experiments in a zzso zzso reveal some of the exquisite zzso engineering necessary to create the mixing zzso In addition to illuminating zzso and zzso zzso the adaptation of a zzso network for mixing nuclear material provides a previously unexamined organizing principle for understanding zzso diversity in the zzso species of zzso zzso
