In order to predict zzso of DNA fragments, we previously developed a computer program for simply calculating a zzso sum of all individual roll, tilt and twist wedge angles between the nearest base pairs for a given DNA zzso zzso et zzso zzso Now, a new program, called zzso was developed to calculate three-dimensional coordinates of the zzso center of each base pair along the DNA, using zzso axis zzso from zzso DNA by wedge zzso The output file of the new program was designed to become an input file for a graphics program, Insight zzso Thus, we were able to obtain three-dimensional graphic presentations of DNA zzso axis zzso of any zzso It zzso spatial details of the DNA zzso where and how much it curves, and to which zzso It also allowed calculation of the three-dimensional distance between two ends of a DNA fragment, which could provide a measure of its zzso Here, three DNA fragments, both curved and straight, were subjected to the zzso and Insight II zzso The results showed that their zzso details could be zzso to the level of the base pair, whether the DNA fragments contained an zzso track or zzso Their estimated zzso were consistent with the experimental results of zzso gel mobility zzso
