We present a novel and cost-effective zzso optical zzso zzso zzso enhance the imaging speed of swept source zzso systems by acquiring data from multiple lateral positions simultaneously during a single wavelength zzso using a single detector and a virtually zzso phase array zzso as a zzso zzso This technique uses spectral zzso to convert zzso length into higher imaging zzso the speed enhancement factor is independent of the source speed or center zzso and the effective zzso rate scales zzso with sweep zzso The optical zzso requires only a change in the sample arm of a traditional zzso system and preserves the zzso resolution and zzso characteristic of a traditional zzso using the same light zzso Using 10 zzso 20 zzso and 100 zzso sources we provide a first demonstration of image speed enhancement factors of up to 12, 6 and 10, respectively, which yield effective zzso rates of 120 zzso 120 zzso and 1 zzso for zzso imaging, with a sensitivity of up to zzso zzso We also show that zzso can image faster dynamics than traditional zzso zzso imaging and is capable of zzso biological zzso The zzso concept suggests a new route to high-speed zzso imaging for laser zzso that is, by focusing on improving the zzso length and zzso of existing and emerging zzso zzso zzso is a nice complement to ongoing research and commercial efforts to enable faster imaging through development of zzso with faster sweep rates, and offers new hope for existing sources with slow sweep rates and potential for enhancement of zzso length to compete with faster sources to achieve high-speed zzso
