In a recent publication zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Modeling of zzso zzso with combined zzso and zzso methods, zzso zzso zzso zzso 123 zzso zzso zzso a new zzso zzso zzso zzso was presented and used to model the generation of acoustic waves by a zzso zzso and their propagation in the structure and the surrounding zzso In this paper, the model has been extended to simulate the two-dimensional zzso of a complete zzso zzso composed of the zzso a backing and a front matching zzso This further version of the model takes into account the mechanical loss in materials, and enables the calculation of electrical zzso which is a characteristic of high interest to zzso the performance of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso viewed zzso zzso zzso zzso Roth, zzso zzso zzso properties of lead zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a 50 zzso thickness resonant frequency, were compared to those of a zzso model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso New equivalent circuit for elementary zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso in the one-dimensional zzso The zzso properties were also found to be in good agreement with those obtained using the finite element zzso method of zzso software in two-dimensional zzso
