The primary goal was to compare results from a zzso procedure with pigeons zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Shifts in the zzso function and their implications for models of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 74, zzso zzso zzso with new results obtained with zzso The secondary goal was to compare the results of both experiments with dependent variables that were not used in the original zzso As in the original study with pigeons, rats were trained on a zzso zzso zzso procedure in which left lever press responses were reinforced during the first and second quarters of a zzso trial, and right lever press responses were reinforced during the third and fourth quarters of the zzso The quarters were reinforced according to four independent variable zzso zzso schedules of zzso The VI duration was manipulated in each quarter, and shifts in the zzso functions that relate response rate with time since trial onset were zzso The results obtained with rats were consistent with those previously obtained with zzso In addition, results not originally reported were also consistent between rats and pigeons, and provided insights into the perception, memory, and decision processes in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
