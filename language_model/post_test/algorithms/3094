zzso zzso zzso zzso permits reliable imaging of not only the coronary artery zzso but also vessel zzso It is assumed that both zzso plaques and those that display positive zzso are more prone to zzso and erosion with subsequent coronary zzso The purpose of this study was to assess the correlation between the characteristics of coronary arteries by zzso and several measures of coronary heart disease zzso zzso 

This study consisted of zzso consecutive participants who received zzso and coronary zzso zzso We assessed coronary artery findings including coronary artery zzso zzso degree of zzso and narrowing of zzso and characteristics including zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso analyses were conducted for four zzso classified by the presence of significant zzso and positive zzso 

zzso was zzso in positive zzso zzso and zzso zzso group zzso zzso in positive zzso zzso and zzso zzso group zzso zzso in positive zzso zzso and zzso zzso group zzso and zzso in positive zzso zzso and zzso zzso group zzso The results of zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso was higher in zzso compared with the other groups zzso and higher in zzso and zzso compared with zzso zzso 

Regardless of significant zzso positive zzso by zzso zzso to the increase of zzso
