We present an approach to zzso analysis of zzso zzso 

The method zzso on the decomposition of the signal into a set of zzso that have good zzso both in time and in zzso The zzso belong to a highly redundant set of functions - allowing for a very accurate description of signal zzso 

Properties of the method are illustrated by simulations and applications to zzso 

The presented method delivers a common zzso suitable for describing both gross statistical properties of structures present in zzso signals, as well as zzso of chosen zzso
