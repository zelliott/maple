The zzso of solutions containing a mixture of three zzso compounds, zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso solar zzso process was zzso The reactions were carried out in a pilot plant consisting of a compound zzso collector zzso solar zzso An zzso study was performed combining a zzso experimental design and zzso networks that included the following zzso zzso temperature, solar power, air flow and initial zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Under optimal conditions, total elimination of the original compounds and zzso zzso removal of the mixture were achieved in 5 and zzso zzso zzso pH and initial zzso of zzso and zzso were the most significant factors affecting the mixture zzso The zzso correlation between consumed hydrogen zzso and removed zzso was always between 1 and zzso A detailed analysis of the reaction was zzso The values of the zzso zzso kinetic rate constant, zzso increased as initial zzso and zzso zzso and temperature zzso The optimum pH value also slightly increased with greater zzso and hydrogen zzso zzso but decreased when temperature zzso OH and zzso zzso were the main zzso intermediate species in the process, although zzso oxygen zzso also played a role in the zzso zzso
