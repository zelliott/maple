The Circle of Willis zzso is a zzso structure of blood vessels found beneath the zzso at the base of the zzso Its main function is to distribute zzso zzso blood to the cerebral zzso A zzso model of the zzso has been created to simulate a series of possible clinical scenarios such as zzso in zzso zzso absent or zzso zzso vessels, or zzso zzso The model captures cerebral zzso zzso by using a zzso zzso controller to modify zzso zzso and maintain optimal zzso zzso for a given circle geometry and zzso blood zzso zzso match limited clinical data and results obtained in prior studies to within zzso In addition, a set of boundary conditions and geometry is presented for which the zzso system cannot provide the necessary zzso zzso and zzso representing a condition with increased risk of stroke and highlighting the importance of zzso the zzso of the zzso The system model created is zzso simple so it can be used to identify zzso cerebral zzso zzso and conditions prior to surgery or other clinical zzso
