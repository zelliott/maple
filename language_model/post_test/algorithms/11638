zzso methods play a central role in the rational design of novel zzso The present work describes a new hybrid exact zzso zzso zzso method that builds on previous dead-end elimination zzso to yield dramatic performance zzso Measured on zzso validated physical models, these improvements make it possible to perform previously intractable designs of entire protein core, surface, or boundary zzso zzso demonstrations include a full core design of the variable zzso of the light and heavy chains of zzso zzso zzso zzso with 74 zzso and zzso zzso a full zzso design of the zzso domain of protein G with 25 zzso and zzso zzso and a full surface design of the zzso domain of protein G with 27 zzso and zzso zzso In addition, a full sequence design of the zzso domain of protein G is used to demonstrate the strong dependence of zzso performance on the exact form of the potential function and the zzso of the zzso zzso These results emphasize that search zzso performance for protein design can only be zzso evaluated on physical models that have been subjected to experimental zzso The new zzso greatly zzso ongoing efforts to engineer increasingly complex protein zzso
