The need for improved zzso support for zzso zzso and zzso identification in personal zzso data is widely zzso We previously presented the zzso zzso zzso and Search zzso zzso which employs an zzso zzso association test that combines both zzso acid substitution zzso and zzso zzso Here we describe and benchmark zzso zzso which uses a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso to incorporate information about zzso zzso We show that the zzso approach improves zzso zzso zzso accuracy compared to its previous zzso and compared to zzso zzso and zzso We also show that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and variable threshold zzso using published zzso zzso for zzso disease zzso zzso zzso and breast cancer zzso zzso zzso also improves search accuracy on simulated zzso across a wide range of zzso zzso zzso disease risks, and zzso zzso factors that compromise the zzso of other zzso zzso association zzso We also demonstrate that, although most zzso zzso association tests are designed for common genetic diseases, these tests can be easily adopted as rare zzso zzso zzso with a simple zzso zzso and the performance compares very favorably to zzso filtering zzso The latter, despite their popularity, have zzso performance especially with the increasing case sample zzso
