We have developed a new method for detecting determinism in a short time series and used this method to examine whether a stationary zzso is deterministic or zzso The method is based on the observation that the trajectory of a time series generated from a zzso zzso system behaves smoothly in an embedded phase zzso The angles between two successive directional zzso in the trajectory reconstructed from a time series at a minimum embedding dimension were calculated as a function of zzso We measured the zzso of the angle variations obtained from the time series using zzso difference plots and central tendency measures, and compared these values with those from surrogate zzso The ability of the proposed method to distinguish between chaotic and zzso dynamics is demonstrated through a number of simulated time series, including data from Lorenz, zzso and Van der Pol zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We then applied this method to the analysis of stationary segments of zzso recordings consisting of 750 data points zzso zzso from five normal zzso The stationary zzso segments were not found to exhibit deterministic zzso This method can be used to analyze determinism in short time series, such as those from zzso recordings, that can be modeled using zzso zzso zzso
