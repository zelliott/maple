The zzso of zzso zzso is a zzso modification zzso that plays a critical role in the zzso mechanisms of several important zzso It occurs spontaneously under certain zzso conditions, but is difficult to detect zzso Its full impact is zzso In this work, the signature zzso of zzso sites has been zzso In addition, a zzso method called zzso of zzso zzso zzso for the detection of zzso zzso in proteins with available three-dimensional structures has been zzso The likely prevalence of zzso zzso in the zzso was assessed through large-scale zzso The results suggest that about zzso of large proteins may contain a zzso zzso zzso This unexpected prevalence of zzso zzso implies an enrichment of reactions in which it may play functional zzso The results also suggest that by switching zzso on and off under appropriate zzso conditions spontaneous zzso may serve as an important and widely used efficient biological machinery for zzso
