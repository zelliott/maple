The aim of this study was to determine if the presence of focal normal bone zzso fat signal within a tumor on magnetic resonance imaging excludes zzso 

One hundred zzso zzso proven tumors with available magnetic resonance imaging zzso of the zzso skeleton and pelvis from 184 patients were collected and reviewed at two separate zzso There were 111 zzso and 73 benign zzso Two zzso at each institution, blinded to the diagnosis, reviewed the zzso independently and reported the presence or absence of normal zzso fat signal within the tumor based upon zzso imaging without fat suppression and zzso imaging with fat suppression and/or short zzso inversion recovery zzso zzso were then reviewed in consensus to determine the presence or absence of focal normal zzso zzso For each institution, a zzso exact test was used to compare the frequency of focal normal zzso fat signal in benign and zzso zzso This comparison was performed for each reader, as well as for the consensus reading at each zzso Positive and negative zzso values were also calculated for each reader, as well as the consensus reading at each zzso zzso exact test was also used to compare the frequency of zzso fat in benign and zzso zzso for the pooled zzso zzso zzso was used to calculate the positive and negative zzso values for the pooled consensus zzso zzso percent confidence intervals were constructed for the pooled estimates using a zzso zzso 

There was good zzso reliability of zzso and zzso at sites 1 and 2, zzso There were three discrepancies (one zzso and two zzso at site 1 and four discrepancies zzso zzso and two zzso at site zzso Reader consensus at site 1 identified normal zzso fat signal within 1 of 50 zzso zzso and three of 14 zzso benign zzso zzso were statistically significant with a p value of zzso The positive zzso value zzso and negative zzso value zzso at site 1 was zzso and zzso zzso Reader consensus at site 2 identified normal zzso fat signal within three of 61 zzso zzso and 14 of 59 zzso benign zzso zzso were statistically significant with a calculated p value of zzso The zzso and zzso at site 1 was zzso and zzso zzso For the pooled consensus, the frequency of zzso fat in benign zzso zzso zzso is significantly greater than the frequency in zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

The presence of focal normal zzso signal within a tumor is highly suggestive of a benign zzso
