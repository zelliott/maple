This article describes applications of extensions of zzso rank sum statistics to the crossover design with four sequence groups for two zzso A zzso clinical trial in zzso provides motivating background for the zzso The bilateral design for this study has four sequence groups zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for T as test treatment or P as zzso in the corresponding order for the left and right zzso This article describes how to use the average of the separate zzso rank sum statistics for the left and right eyes for the overall comparison between T and P with the correlation between the two eyes taken into zzso An extension of this criterion with better sensitivity to potential differences between T and P through reduction of the zzso zzso has discussion in terms of a conceptual model with constraints for zzso zzso of groups with the same treatment and zzso zzso of the differences between T and zzso zzso of fit for this model can have assessment with test statistics for its corresponding zzso zzso studies for the conceptual model confirm better power for the extended test statistic with its full zzso than other criteria without this zzso The methods summarized here are illustrated for the motivating clinical trial in zzso but they are zzso to other situations with the crossover design with four sequence groups for either two locations for two treatments at the same time for a patient or two successive periods for the assigned treatments for a zzso zzso This article also notes that the methods based on its conceptual model can have unsatisfactory power for departures from that model where the difference between T and P via the zzso and zzso groups is not similar to that via the zzso and zzso groups, as might occur when T has a systemic effect in a bilateral zzso For this situation, more robust test statistics have zzso but there is recognition that the parallel groups design with only the zzso and zzso groups may be more useful than the bilateral design with four sequence zzso
