In this study we evaluated alternative zzso zzso counting methods in clients of a zzso zzso in rural zzso 

The Coulter Manual zzso Count method for zzso zzso zzso zzso and an automated method zzso zzso flow zzso zzso were compared with a standard, zzso flow zzso protocol zzso zzso 

zzso and precision of agreement were higher for the zzso method zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso when compared to zzso than for the zzso method zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Multiple linear zzso analysis showed that zzso cell counts by the zzso method were a stronger predictor for results of zzso than those of the zzso method zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso When compared to zzso the zzso method generated higher zzso cell counts than the zzso method, as expressed by a higher median and mean difference zzso and zzso cells for zzso zzso and zzso cells for zzso 

Both, the manual zzso method and the zzso method can be used for the zzso of zzso cells in zzso zzso Under supervised conditions, the zzso method produced results more consistent with the reference method than the zzso zzso
