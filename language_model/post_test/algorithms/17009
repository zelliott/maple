Besides its use in the treatment of a variety of presumed zzso diseases, zzso is given as an zzso to patients who have had zzso zzso Though zzso studies have provided zzso evidence of its zzso in humans, the zzso tests in rats and mice are considered to be zzso because of limitations in the design and results of these tests zzso 1981, zzso zzso and zzso (1991) used the CASE program to identify the structural features responsible for its zzso They concluded that this zzso chemical was a zzso due to the presence of the molecular zzso zzso The finding was based on the presence of this zzso zzso in five other compounds, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Recently, zzso (1992) has expressed concern over the zzso of their zzso With the aim of contributing to this debate on the mechanism of zzso of zzso we have analyzed the structural basis of zzso of zzso and the five support compounds using the zzso predictor of our toxicity prediction program, zzso The results, more in line with zzso concerns, indicate that no molecular zzso involving the S atom is associated with the zzso properties of these zzso According to the zzso program the zzso if any, of zzso is due to the zzso zzso because its other major structural features are found to be either associated with zzso or do not discriminate zzso from zzso
