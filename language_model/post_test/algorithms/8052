It has been demonstrated that decision levels zzso and their confidence intervals zzso can be estimated from the second zzso f '' zzso of the zzso zzso probability curve zzso Although this method generally provides smooth zzso from which DL and zzso can be zzso there are zzso that generate zzso zzso making these zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to develop a procedure to zzso this noise, thus allowing the more facile zzso of DL and zzso Data from two clinical studies were zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed and the first zzso f ' zzso were fitted to zzso zzso The derivatives of these surrogate f ' zzso were generated to provide f '' zzso and were compared with data from receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso For both sets of data, the surrogate zzso demonstrated strong fits to the natural f ' zzso with zzso zzso zzso for one study and zzso for the zzso The f '' zzso generated from the surrogate zzso demonstrated single zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared with the f '' zzso generated from the natural f ' zzso in which multiple M and m were zzso zzso discernible DL and zzso were observed for both zzso with differences from zzso DL of zzso for the first study and zzso for the zzso The use of a surrogate zzso simulation of f ' zzso may be a useful alternative to natural f ' zzso when using the f '' zzso of the zzso to determine DL and zzso
