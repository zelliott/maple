In this study, a simplified zzso zzso zzso higher order diffusion model is employed for 3-D diffuse optical zzso of zzso in the finger zzso We find that the use of a zzso diffusion model in a zzso framework provides significant improvement in reconstruction accuracy over the diffusion approximation zzso However, we also find that this is not the case in the zzso setting when spatial prior knowledge from zzso is zzso The results show that the reconstruction error between these two models is about 15 and zzso respectively, for zzso and zzso zzso
