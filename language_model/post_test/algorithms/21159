This study examines the effect of feature extraction methods prior to automated pattern recognition based on magnetic resonance zzso zzso for brain tumor zzso Since individual inspection of zzso is time-consuming and requires specific zzso expertise, the introduction of clinical decision support systems zzso is expected to strongly promote the clinical use of zzso This study focuses on the feature extraction step in the zzso protocol of MRS when using a zzso On two independent data sets, encompassing zzso and zzso data, it is observed that the use of the full zzso together with a zzso technique, handling high zzso data, or using an automated pattern recognition method based on independent component analysis or zzso achieves accurate zzso In addition, these approaches have low cost and are easy to zzso When sophisticated zzso methods are used in a zzso user interaction should be zzso The zzso intensive zzso techniques do not tend to increase the performance in these zzso The results suggest to simplify the feature reduction step in the zzso protocol when using a zzso purely for zzso zzso This can greatly speed up the execution of zzso and zzso and may accelerate their introduction into clinical zzso
