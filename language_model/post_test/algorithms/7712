The zzso of fibers into zzso is an important task in studying the structure and function of white zzso zzso technology mostly relies on geometrical features, such as the shape of zzso and thus only provides very limited information about the zzso function of the zzso We advance this issue by proposing a zzso representation of fibers decoding their connectivity to gray matter zzso We then simplify the zzso task by first zzso a compact zzso of our representation via the zzso zzso Furthermore, we define a distance between fibers that is in theory zzso to zzso biases and is equivalent to a family of zzso metrics on the zzso of zzso zzso We apply our method to zzso scans of two healthy subjects showing high zzso of the resulting fiber zzso without needing to register the corresponding scans to a common coordinate zzso We confirm these qualitative findings via a simple statistical zzso of the fiber zzso
