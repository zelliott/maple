This article compares the operation of a zzso zzso platform before and after zzso carbon zzso zzso between its zzso The diverse performance of the zzso system is assessed by separating 1 and 5 zzso polystyrene zzso In the absence of zzso both particles can only be trapped by operating the system at low medium zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso applying zzso to the system, some zzso coat the surface of particles and increase their overall zzso and zzso whereas the rest of them are patterned between the zzso and induce strong zzso forces at their free ends, which can effectively trap the coated zzso The first development extends the range of medium zzso and zzso at which the zzso of both particles is achievable, whereas the second development zzso the selective deposition of particles along the surface of curved zzso Setting the medium zzso to zzso and the frequency to 20 zzso most of 5 zzso particles are trapped at the entry region of the first zzso pair, whereas most of 1 zzso particles are trapped at the tips, and this distinction zzso their zzso The zzso of 1 zzso particles can be improved by decreasing the frequency to zzso This study demonstrates how the integration of zzso into zzso systems enables them to operate beyond their zzso
