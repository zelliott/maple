To conduct a systematic review of the literature on the validation of zzso identifying infections in administrative data for future use in populations with rheumatic zzso 

zzso and zzso were searched using the themes zzso zzso and zzso between 1950 and October zzso zzso criteria consisted of validation studies of administrative data identifying infections in adult zzso Article quality was assessed using a validated zzso 

A total of zzso articles were identified, 90 articles underwent detailed review, and 24 studies were zzso The majority (17 of 24) examined bacterial infections and 9 examined opportunistic zzso zzso studies were from the US and all but 4 studies used International zzso of zzso Ninth Revision zzso zzso arthritis patients were studied in 6 of 24 zzso The studies on bacterial infections in general reported highly variable sensitivity and positive zzso value zzso for the diagnosis of infections using administrative data zzso range zzso zzso range zzso zzso to identify opportunistic infections similarly had a highly variable sensitivity zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thirteen studies compared the diagnostic accuracy of different zzso which revealed that strategies including a comprehensive zzso using a greater number of diagnostic codes or codes in any position had the highest sensitivity for the diagnosis of zzso zzso that incorporated zzso or pharmacy data in combination with diagnostic codes had improved zzso for identification of zzso 

zzso for identifying infections using administrative data should be selected based on the purpose of the study, with careful consideration as to whether a high sensitivity or zzso is zzso
