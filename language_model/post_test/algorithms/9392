In this paper, we study the problem of computing the similarity of two protein structures by measuring their zzso zzso zzso overlap abstracts the problem of computing the similarity of two zzso chains as a zzso zzso In zzso we present the first zzso time zzso with any guarantee on the approximation ratio for the zzso zzso More precisely, we give an zzso for the zzso overlap problem with an approximation ratio of zzso where zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a decomposition zzso depending on the input zzso chains zzso and zzso In zzso we improve the running time of the previous best known approximation zzso from zzso to zzso log zzso at the cost of decreasing the approximation ratio by zzso We also give zzso results for the problem in three dimensions, suggesting that zzso it better than zzso for some zzso zzso 0, is zzso
