zzso embedded networks are important in several zzso The zzso spatial network we assume is the Random Geometric zzso of which many properties are zzso Here we present new results for the zzso degree correlation function in terms of the zzso zzso of the zzso for two-dimensional space in particular, with extensions to arbitrary finite zzso
