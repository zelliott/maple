In this paper we present a method for the statistical assessment of cancer zzso which make use of gene expression zzso The methodology is applied to a new data set of zzso gene expression data collected in Casa zzso zzso zzso Hospital, zzso The data set is made up of normal zzso and tumor (25) specimens extracted from 25 patients affected by colon zzso We propose to give answers to some questions which are relevant for the automatic diagnosis of cancer such zzso Is the size of the available data set sufficient to build accurate zzso What is the statistical significance of the associated error zzso In what ways can accuracy be considered zzso on the adopted zzso zzso How many genes are correlated with the pathology and how many are sufficient for an accurate colon cancer zzso The method we propose answers these questions whilst avoiding the potential pitfalls hidden in the analysis and interpretation of zzso zzso 

We estimate the zzso error, evaluated through the zzso Cross zzso error, for three different zzso schemes by varying the number of training examples and the number of the genes zzso The statistical significance of the error rate is measured by using a zzso zzso We provide a statistical analysis in terms of the zzso of the genes involved in the zzso Using the whole set of zzso we found that the zzso Voting Algorithm zzso zzso learns the distinction between normal and tumor specimens with 25 training examples, providing e zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as an error zzso This remains constant even when the number of examples zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso zzso and Support zzso Machines zzso zzso can learn with only 15 training examples, with an error rate of e zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and e zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the error rate decreases as the training set size increases, reaching its best performances with 35 training zzso In this case, zzso and zzso have error rates of e zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and e zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the number of zzso we found about zzso genes zzso zzso zzso correlated with the pathology, resulting from the zzso zzso zzso the performances of zzso and zzso zzso do not change when zzso of genes is zzso They progressively reduce up to e zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when only 2 genes are zzso The biological relevance of a set of genes determined by our statistical analysis and the major roles they play in zzso zzso is zzso 

The method proposed provides statistically significant answers to precise questions relevant for the diagnosis and prognosis of zzso We found that, with as few as 15 examples, it is possible to train statistically significant zzso for colon cancer zzso As for the definition of the number of genes sufficient for a reliable zzso of colon cancer, our results suggest that it depends on the accuracy zzso
