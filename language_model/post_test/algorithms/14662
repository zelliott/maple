A central goal of human zzso is to identify zzso genes for common human zzso An important challenge is zzso zzso interaction or zzso that can result in zzso of genetic zzso The zzso zzso reduction zzso method was developed as a machine learning alternative to zzso zzso zzso for detecting interactions in the absence of significant marginal zzso The goal of zzso is to reduce the zzso inherent in zzso combinations of zzso using a zzso approach called constructive zzso Here, we propose a zzso zzso zzso Reduction zzso method that performs constructive induction using a zzso zzso Test rather than a predetermined zzso The advantage of this approach is that only statistically significant zzso combinations are considered in the zzso zzso We use simulation studies to demonstrate that this approach will increase the success rate of zzso when there are only a few zzso combinations that are significantly associated with zzso zzso We show that there is no loss of success rate when this is not the zzso We then apply the zzso method to the detection of zzso interactions in zzso data from a zzso study of zzso cancer in New zzso
