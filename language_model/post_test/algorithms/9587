A fully zzso fast method to detect the zzso and the zzso disc in digital color photographs of the zzso is zzso The method makes few assumptions about the location of both structures in the zzso We define the problem of zzso structures in a retinal image as a zzso zzso A zzso zzso is zzso to predict the distance in zzso in the image to the object of interest at any given location in the image based on a set of features measured at that zzso The method combines cues measured directly in the image with cues derived from a zzso of the retinal zzso A distance prediction is made for a limited number of image locations and the point with the lowest predicted distance to the zzso disc is selected as the zzso disc zzso Based on this location the search area for the zzso is zzso The location with the lowest predicted distance to the zzso within the zzso search area is selected as the zzso zzso The method is trained with 500 images for which the zzso disc and zzso locations are zzso An extensive evaluation was done on 500 images from a diabetic zzso screening program and 100 specially selected images containing gross zzso The method found the zzso disc in zzso and the zzso in zzso of regular screening images and for the images with abnormalities these numbers were zzso and zzso zzso
