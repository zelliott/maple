In this study a zzso dynamic neural network zzso was designed to process gait analysis parameters to evaluate zzso zzso in ambulatory children with cerebral zzso The aim was to differentiate dynamic calf muscle tightness from fixed muscle zzso Patients underwent clinical examination and had zzso gait analysis before evaluating their zzso under zzso and muscle relaxation at the time of surgery to improve zzso The performance of the clinical examination, the zzso interpretation of gait analysis results, and the application of the neural network to assess ankle function were compared to the examination under zzso zzso of zzso by a zzso Network showed high sensitivity and specificity values with a likelihood ratio of zzso The results indicate that dynamic calf muscle tightness can be differentiated from fixed calf muscle zzso with considerable precision that might facilitate clinical zzso
