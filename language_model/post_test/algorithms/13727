An zzso gas analysis method has been developed to perform zzso real time determination of pulmonary blood flow using a zzso zzso This technique is based on a mathematical model describing mass balance of two zzso gases which are zzso using an open gas zzso The zzso using this method are zzso easy to zzso and do not disturb normal zzso zzso As well, since data are collected on a zzso basis, it is possible to estimate other zzso zzso and zzso parameters simultaneously in a zzso zzso Special consideration was given to developing effective data processing zzso to minimize the influence of measurement noise and respiratory zzso Experimental studies to compare this method with other accepted techniques were conducted to validate the present zzso
