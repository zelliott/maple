Robert zzso zzso are a class of zzso models with a structure that defines a necessary distinguishing feature of zzso That feature is an zzso hierarchy of constraint on the properties of the model that zzso to the closure of an zzso zzso relations with respect to efficient zzso As a consequence, a zzso model cannot be an zzso This has been zzso zzso and hence zzso Nevertheless, zzso zzso of the zzso in an zzso have been zzso This paper explains the logical impossibility of the existence of these zzso In particular, it examines the errors in the construction of one of the most interesting among zzso The relevance of this result to neuroscientists is that the same structure of closure to efficient cause is observed in brain zzso
