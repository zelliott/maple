A new method for characterization of zzso zzso is presented which is based on the zzso distribution of an zzso zzso zzso A set of parameters are derived which describe fundamental frequency, zzso shape, and zzso zzso The method uses zzso of an zzso updated spectral profile, representing the shape of the zzso zzso in order to match each new spectrum of the zzso The method tracks how well the spectral profile fits each spectrum as well as if a valid zzso signal is zzso The results are based on the analysis of a learning database with signals from 40 subjects, of which 24 have zzso zzso and an evaluation database with 211 patients diagnosed with zzso zzso It is shown that the method robustly estimates zzso frequency and zzso and produces spectral profiles with zzso zzso and more discernible zzso when compared to the conventional power zzso The results suggest that a rather strong correlation exist between zzso zzso frequency and f wave zzso The developed set of parameters may be used as a basis for automated zzso of different zzso zzso
