We present a novel procedure for absolute, zzso profile measurement with high dynamic range for large, moderately flat optical zzso The profile is reconstructed from many zzso measured by a small zzso which is scanned along the zzso under zzso Additional angular and lateral distance zzso are used to account for the tilt of the zzso and its precise lateral location during the zzso zzso positioning of the zzso is not zzso The zzso proposed for the analysis of the data allows systematic errors of the zzso and height zzso of the scanning stage to be eliminated and it does not reduce the zzso By utilizing a realistic simulation scenario we show that zzso in the zzso range can be zzso
