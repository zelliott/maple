This study assessed the utility of CT zzso for quantitative assessment of liver function and zzso zzso blood flow zzso tissue blood volume zzso mean transit time zzso and zzso zzso fraction zzso were measured with CT zzso using the zzso zzso in 38 patients with chronic liver diseases and 10 patients without liver zzso Using zzso zzso 21 patients were classified as Child A, 10 as Child B, and 7 as Child zzso In 20 patients, the degree of zzso was zzso in zzso specimens and compared with the zzso zzso The mean zzso zzso zzso and zzso of patients zzso liver disease were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively zzso The mean zzso of patients with Child A, B and C were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tended to decrease with the severity of chronic liver zzso The mean zzso of patients with Child A, B and C were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of patients without liver disease was significantly different from those of Child B and C zzso zzso However, there were no significant differences in zzso and zzso between each zzso zzso correlated significantly with the degree of zzso zzso zzso Our results showed that parameters of CT zzso correlated significantly with the severity of liver zzso and zzso zzso measurement of zzso tissue blood flow by CT zzso is useful for evaluation of the severity of disease and zzso zzso
