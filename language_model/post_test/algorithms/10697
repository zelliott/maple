Bone as most of living zzso is able, during its entire zzso to adapt its internal zzso and subsequently its associated mechanical properties to its specific mechanical and zzso environment in a process commonly known as bone zzso Bone is therefore continuously renewed and zzso accumulated by fatigue or zzso is removed minimizing the risk of zzso Nevertheless, bone is not always able to repair itself zzso Actually, if bone repairing function is slower than zzso zzso a type of bone zzso usually known as zzso zzso can finally zzso In this paper, we propose a bone zzso continuous model able to simulate zzso growth and repair in a coupled way and able therefore to predict the occurrence of zzso zzso The biological bone zzso process is zzso in terms of equations that describe the activity of basic zzso zzso The predicted results show a good correspondence with experimental and clinical zzso For example, in zzso bone zzso increases until an equilibrium situation is zzso In zzso bone zzso decreases unless the damage rate is so high that causes zzso or zzso zzso
