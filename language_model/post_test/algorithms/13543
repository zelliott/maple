zzso zzso structures with zzso in general is an zzso zzso zzso several authors have suggested zzso that provide zzso time prediction zzso by allowing zzso zzso certain structural zzso In this article, we introduce a unifying zzso view on most of these zzso That way it becomes possible to find linear time recognition zzso that decide whether or not a given structure is member of a class (we offer these zzso as a web service to the scientific zzso Furthermore, by presenting a general translation scheme of our zzso descriptions into multiple zzso zzso and proving a new correspondence of multiple zzso zzso and generating functions, it becomes possible to derive the precise zzso size of all the classes, solving some open problems such as enumerating the Rivas & Eddy class of zzso
