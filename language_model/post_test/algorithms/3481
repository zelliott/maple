In this paper, we present a linear setting for statistical analysis of shape and an zzso approach based on a recent derivation of a conservation of momentum law for the zzso of zzso zzso Once a template is zzso the space of initial momentum becomes an appropriate space for studying shape via zzso flow since the flow at any point along the zzso is completely determined by the momentum at the origin through zzso shooting zzso The space of initial momentum provides a linear representation of the zzso zzso shape space in which linear statistical analysis can be zzso zzso to the landmark matching problem of zzso zzso we derive an zzso for solving the zzso problem with respect to the initial momentum and demonstrate principal component analysis zzso in this setting with three-dimensional face and zzso zzso
