zzso zzso arises when a subject misses zzso visits at which the failure is to be zzso Most existing approaches for zzso zzso failure time data assume that the zzso mechanism is independent of the true failure zzso However, there are situations where this assumption may not zzso In this paper, we consider such a situation in which the dependence structure between the zzso variables and the failure time can be zzso through some zzso variables and a method for zzso analysis of failure time data is zzso The method makes use of the zzso hazards frailty model and an zzso zzso is presented for zzso zzso sample properties of the proposed zzso of zzso parameters are examined through simulation studies and we illustrate the method with data from an AIDS zzso
