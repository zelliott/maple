Contemporary brain theories of cognitive function zzso zzso zzso and zzso reorganization as mechanisms for neural information zzso zzso brain imaging results underwrite this perspective of large-scale zzso As we show here, a suitable choice of experimental control tasks allows the zzso of the spatial and zzso components of reorganization to a quantifiable degree of zzso When using zzso or zzso zzso or zzso our approach relies on the identification of lower zzso spaces obtained from the high zzso data of suitably chosen control task zzso zzso data from task conditions are reconstructed within these control zzso We show that the residual signal zzso of the task signal not captured by the control zzso allows the zzso of the degree of spatial zzso such as recruitment of additional brain zzso
