In many applications of supervised learning, automatic feature zzso is often desirable for a better understanding of the interaction among the various features as well as the interplay between the features and the class zzso In addition, for high zzso data sets, feature zzso has the potential for improvement in zzso accuracy and reduction in zzso zzso In this paper, a method is developed for simultaneous zzso and feature zzso by extending zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso method derived from the principle of minimum description length using source coding zzso The method incorporates feature zzso with zzso performed by fusing features in the same zzso To illustrate its effectiveness, the method has been applied to zzso gene expression data for human zzso zzso It is demonstrated that incorporating feature zzso improves zzso zzso and the clusters generated match well with biological meaningful gene expression signature zzso
