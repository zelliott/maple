We are interested in a zzso model of trait and zzso population undergoing zzso and zzso We start with a continuous time, discrete zzso population zzso Taking the large population and rare zzso limits under a zzso zzso separation condition, we obtain a jump process that zzso the zzso zzso zzso process describing zzso zzso for populations without age zzso Under the additional assumption of small zzso we derive an zzso ordinary differential equation that extends the zzso zzso These evolutionary approximations have never been introduced to our zzso They are based on ecological phenomena represented by zzso that zzso the zzso equation in zzso Another zzso is that they involve an establishment zzso describing the probability of invasion of the resident population by the zzso one, that cannot always be zzso zzso Examples illustrate how adding an zzso enrich the zzso of structured population by including life history features such as zzso In the cases considered, we establish the evolutionary approximations and study their long time behavior and the nature of their evolutionary zzso when zzso is zzso zzso procedures and simulations are zzso
