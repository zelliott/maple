zzso scanning zzso such as zzso or circular zzso have been used or proposed for zzso zzso zzso zzso because they provide sufficient data for zzso stable and exact image reconstruction within the scanned zzso Analytic zzso have been developed for image reconstruction from zzso data acquired with a zzso circular zzso zzso In this work, we propose an innovative imaging approach in which a zzso circular zzso trajectory is used for acquiring data sufficient for exact zzso image zzso A filtered zzso zzso zzso based on zzso reconstruction formula is applied for image reconstruction in zzso circular zzso zzso We have conducted zzso studies to demonstrate the zzso approach and to validate the zzso reconstruction zzso in the proposed zzso The proposed scanning method can contribute to increasing the zzso of a zzso while improving the image quality compared to a conventional circular zzso
