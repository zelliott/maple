zzso interference zzso zzso screening zzso enables massive parallel gene zzso and is increasingly being used to reveal novel connections between genes and zzso zzso The application of zzso zzso relies on the development of high quality zzso zzso The zzso factor statistic provides a way to evaluate whether or not screening run conditions zzso zzso zzso zzso and other conditions not directly related to the test zzso are zzso zzso factor, introduced by Zhang et zzso ( 1) is a zzso value that represents both the zzso and the dynamic range between two sets of sample control zzso This paper describe a new extension of the zzso factor, which zzso zzso zzso zzso compounds for screening quality zzso Currently presented zzso factor is based on positive and negative control, which may not be sufficient for zzso experiments including zzso zzso with lack of zzso This paper proposes an zzso which extends existing zzso by using additional controls zzso from zzso zzso
