To zzso investigate cervical zzso 6 months after large loop zzso of the transformation zone zzso zzso for cervical zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Prospective zzso zzso 

University Hospital zzso 

Women having zzso zzso for zzso zzso in response to abnormal zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso dimensions were estimated before zzso and at 6 months with three-dimensional zzso and use of zzso zzso zzso depth was measured using a ruler before zzso and cone volume was measured using a zzso tube and the fluid displacement zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso 

zzso of cervical volume zzso with percentage of initial cervical volume excised and remaining cervical tissue immediately after zzso 

A cohort of 112 women were initially recruited over a zzso period and 73 women presented for ultrasound follow up at 6 zzso zzso linear zzso analysis showed that for women matched for age and initial cervical volume, if cervical volume excised was increased by zzso then zzso of tissue deficit at the cervical crater was reduced by zzso There also seemed to be a zzso point suggesting that when zzso of initial cervical volume was zzso the tissue deficit at the cervical crater at 6 months was restored by zzso and there was zzso of remaining tissue zzso 

zzso zzso at 6 months after zzso is dependent on the percentage of initial cervical volume excised and on the remaining cervical tissue immediately after zzso The greater the cone and the less cervical tissue remaining, the less the degree of cervical zzso zzso
