zzso dose calculations in lung are important to assess lung and zzso dose in various zzso cancer zzso Those patients of particular relevance are zzso lung and zzso zzso patients because large volumes of lung are zzso to high zzso In this paper, zzso results for zzso X-ray beams obtained in a lung phantom are compared with dose zzso produced by zzso effective path zzso zzso equivalent zzso ratio, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Carlo dose calculation zzso The zzso dose error at 10 zzso for a 5 zzso 5 zzso field is zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Tests at the lower energy of 6 zzso with a field size of 10 zzso 10 zzso show a zzso error of only zzso for the equivalent tissue air ratio zzso At this energy it appears that central axis dose voids are sufficiently small to enable the routine use of the equivalent tissue air ratio zzso At the higher energies tested, 10 and 18 zzso this method is zzso zzso and zzso Carlo methods are presented which show good agreement with experimental results in a lung phantom even in regions of lateral electron zzso
