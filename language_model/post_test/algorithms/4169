During the zzso zzso zzso gather in mixed groups of individuals of different sex and zzso Group social zzso which may vary on a daily basis, is likely to have strong influences on zzso zzso with emerging properties at the zzso To date, few studies have considered the influence of group composition on male and female behavioral time budget in mating zzso Focusing on a wild population of Alpine zzso we investigated the influence of group composition zzso sex ratio, the proportion of dominant to subordinate zzso and group zzso on three behavioral axes obtained by Principal zzso zzso describing male and female group zzso For both zzso the first behavioral axis discerned a zzso between grazing and zzso zzso In zzso group vigilance behavior increased with increasingly zzso sex ratio, whereas in zzso the effect of adult sex ratio on zzso behavior depended on the relative proportion of dominant males in the mating zzso The second axis characterized courtship and zzso zzso behavior in zzso and moving and zzso zzso behavior in zzso zzso group composition did not substantially influence this axis in zzso However, moving and zzso zzso behavior increased at highly biased sex ratios zzso zzso in zzso Finally, the third axis highlighted a zzso between moving and lying behavior in zzso and distinguished moving and zzso zzso behavior from lying behavior in zzso For zzso those behaviors were influenced by a complex interaction between group size and adult sex ratio, whereas in zzso moving and zzso zzso behaviors increased in a zzso fashion at highly biased sex ratios, and also increased with increasing group zzso Our results reveal complex behavioral zzso depending on group composition in the Alpine zzso and emphasize the importance of social factors in influencing behavioral zzso of wild zzso during the zzso
