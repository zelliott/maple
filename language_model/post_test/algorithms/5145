We investigate the role of zzso expression of zzso and zzso in generating diverse elementary zzso zzso It has been shown zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Newton et zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso 1994; zzso et zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso 1997) that zzso express various proportions of zzso and zzso zzso and this expression is zzso regulated zzso et zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso in zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso zzso Although many previous theoretical studies have investigated the dynamics of localized calcium release sites zzso et zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Soft Matter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Smith in Cell zzso zzso 2005; zzso et zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso 2005), so far all such studies focused on release sites consisting of identical channel zzso We have extended an existing mathematical model zzso et zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to release sites with two (or more) zzso types, each with its distinct channel zzso zzso the release site is represented by a transition probability zzso for a collection of zzso zzso gating channels coupled through a shared zzso zzso We demonstrate that under certain conditions a previously defined zzso approximation of the zzso strength does not accurately reproduce the release site zzso We develop a novel approximation and establish that its performance in these instances is zzso We use this mathematical framework to study the effect of zzso in the zzso of two zzso channel types on the release site zzso We consider release sites consisting of channels with both zzso and zzso zzso zzso and channels with zzso only zzso zzso and show that for the appropriate zzso values, zzso channel openings within a release site with any proportion of two-state to zzso channels are possible, however, the larger the proportion of two-state channels, the more sensitive the dynamics are to the exact spatial positioning of the channels and the distance between zzso Specifically, the zzso of even a small number of two-state channels interferes with zzso termination and increases puff zzso or leads to a zzso zzso
