In a previous paper, conversion zzso for the personal dose zzso zzso for photons were zzso This note reports values for electrons calculated using similar zzso The personal dose equivalent is the quantity used to approximate the protection quantity effective dose when performing personal zzso zzso and in practice the personal dose equivalent is determined using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to 1 zzso have been calculated for zzso zzso and zzso in the recommended slab zzso Although the conversion zzso were determined for discrete incident zzso zzso fits of the conversion zzso over the energy range are provided using a similar zzso as in the zzso results previously zzso The conversion zzso for the personal dose equivalent are compared with the appropriate protection zzso calculated according to the recommendations of the latest International Commission on zzso Protection zzso zzso of zzso on zzso are also zzso
