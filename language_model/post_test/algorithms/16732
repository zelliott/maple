Forward calculation of the zzso induced field shift by zzso procedures requires spatial zzso to prevent zzso artifacts zzso zzso zzso with a factor of two gives accurate results, however, halves the zzso zzso resolution, and slows down the zzso which may hamper the feasibility of real-time zzso zzso is proposed to first perform the calculation at the original zzso zzso to remove zzso with an additional zzso in a lower resolution, to alleviate these restrictions regarding memory size and calculation speed, a procedure we termed zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso tested and validated with conventional zzso and the zzso solution (in the case of zzso on several zzso A demonstration of the increased efficiency is given by implementing virtual zzso in a dynamic calculation zzso The improved efficiency is expected to be relevant regarding the ongoing increase in spatial and zzso resolution in zzso zzso zzso are presented for circular zzso using the discrete Green's function and zzso filtering using the continuous Green's zzso
