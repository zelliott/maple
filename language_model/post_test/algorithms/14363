We develop a novel zzso reference frame zzso image and landmark registration zzso The zzso uses the fixed zzso reference frame to define the map between coordinate systems, but also generates and stores the inverse map from the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso both maps allows facile zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso We apply this zzso to zzso a putative evolutionary change of coordinates between a population of zzso and human zzso zzso functional zzso fix the map zzso where they are known, while image similarities guide the alignment zzso This map allows detailed study of the zzso change between zzso and human zzso Instead of basing the zzso study on a single species atlas, we zzso connect the mean shape and intensity templates for each zzso The human statistics then map zzso into the space of the zzso zzso providing a comparison between zzso The population statistics show a significant doubling of the relative prefrontal lobe size in humans, as compared to zzso
