Producing soluble proteins in zzso coli is still a major bottleneck for structural zzso zzso screening for soluble expression on a small scale is an attractive way of identifying zzso that are likely to be amenable to structural zzso A variety of zzso methods have been developed within the zzso zzso In Europe zzso consortium and to assist the further refinement of such approaches, eight laboratories participating in the network have zzso their zzso For this study, the zzso profiles of a common set of 96 zzso proteins were assessed by expression screening in zzso zzso The level of soluble expression for each target was scored according to estimated protein zzso By reference to a subset of the zzso it is demonstrated that the small-scale result can provide a useful indicator of the amount of soluble protein likely to be produced on a large scale zzso sufficient for structural zzso In general, there was agreement between the different groups as to which targets were not soluble and which were the most zzso However, for a large number of the targets there were wide discrepancies in the results reported from the different screening methods, which is correlated with variations in the procedures and the range of parameters zzso Given finite resources, it appears that the question of how to most effectively explore zzso zzso is similar to several other zzso problems faced by zzso such as zzso
