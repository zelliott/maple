By application of the zzso technique, we measure the zzso of the zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso relaxation time zzso for a series of molecular zzso We demonstrate that such zzso zzso studies can be used for determining diffusion zzso A broad frequency range of 10 zzso zzso is zzso By scanning zzso one directly zzso the spectral density of the diffusion zzso The value of the diffusion zzso D can be determined from a linear dependence of the zzso zzso relaxation rate on the square root of the frequency at which it is zzso The power of this method lies in its zzso which allows one to determine zzso independently of the zzso zzso The results obtained are in very good agreement with those of field zzso zzso zzso
