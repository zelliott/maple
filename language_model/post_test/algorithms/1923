It had previously been shown that the zzso law does not apply to the zzso relationship in the case of a long, thin magnet with one end in close proximity to its image in a permeable plane when simple zzso poles are zzso Treating the system instead as having a zzso zzso arising from an assumed bundle of zzso led to a double integral that could only be evaluated zzso and a relationship that still did not match observed zzso Using an elaborate zzso exponential zzso to represent the position of an zzso polar disc resulted in a fair representation of the physical response, but this was essentially merely the fitting of an arbitrary zzso The present purpose was therefore to find an explicit formula for the zzso relationship in the zzso problem and assess its fit to the previously obtained experimental zzso 

Starting from zzso law a corrected integral formula for the zzso relationship was zzso The integral in this formula was evaluated explicitly using zzso changes of order of integration, reduction by zzso and change of zzso The resulting formula was then fitted to data that had been obtained for the force exerted by zzso zzso magnets zzso zzso 3 zzso diameter, 170 zzso zzso perpendicular to a large steel plate, as a function of distance, at small zzso zzso zzso zzso the fit of alternative functions was zzso 

An explicit formula in terms of zzso zzso was obtained for the zzso zzso Despite the greater zzso this too was found not to fit the observed physical zzso Given that failure, nevertheless a simple formula that zzso closely and zzso to the actual magnet data was zzso A key feature remains the marked departure from zzso zzso 

The failure of the explicit formula to fit the data indicates an inadequate model of the physical zzso Nonetheless it constitutes a useful tool for zzso the zzso relationship on the premise of polar zzso Given these zzso it may now be possible to address the original motivating problem of the behavior of real dental zzso
