zzso of the human body surface area has important applications in medical practice, garment design, and other engineering zzso zzso it is not surprising that several expressions zzso body surface area with direct zzso of body mass and length have been reported in the zzso In the present study, based on the assumption that the exterior shape of the human body is the result of convex and zzso zzso from a basic cylinder, we derive a theoretical equation minimizing body surface area zzso at a fixed volume zzso zzso zzso where L is the reference length of the zzso Assuming a body density value of 1,000 zzso the equation becomes zzso where zzso is in square meters, zzso is the body mass in zzso and zzso is the body height in zzso zzso values calculated by means of this equation fall within zzso of the values obtained by means of the equations available in the literature, in the range of zzso from children to zzso It is also suggested that the above zzso which is obtained by minimizing the outer body surface at a fixed volume, implies a fundamental relation set by the geometrical constraints governing the growth and the development of the human zzso
