The zzso regions of ten zzso zzso were zzso by zzso The images were combined into a zzso model of the zzso using a technique based on a dynamic programming zzso to find an optimal estimate of the location of the bone boundaries in the CT zzso The resulting set of surface points on each bone was used to zzso volumes and principal and zzso axes for the zzso A spatial coordinate system was established based on the positions of the zzso of three bones in the zzso zzso zzso The angular zzso of all zzso bones were determined with respect to this zzso The principal axes for the same bone among ten wrist specimens proved to be more widely dispersed than the zzso axes for the same zzso The zzso axes also zzso more closely to an intuitive notion of the zzso zzso of the zzso We conclude that the zzso axis is a more reliable and useful measure of bone orientation than the principal zzso
