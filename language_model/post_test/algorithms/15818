A method is developed to estimate the frequency feature of alpha generators from zzso signals of different zzso This method is based on principal component analysis and a constrained zzso zzso zzso zzso of the method gives a variation range of the power zzso Experimental results for zzso the generator zzso of the brain alpha activity in anterior and zzso regions over the scalp are zzso Finally, the noise problem with this method is also zzso
