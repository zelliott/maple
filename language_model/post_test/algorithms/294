The recruitment of cells to the vascular wall in zzso or the capture of cell zzso at the surface of a zzso device requires the formation of bonds between specific molecular pairs on the cell and the zzso The ability of a zzso to form a bond depends critically on its zzso relative to the cell surface zzso In this report, we present a framework for the quantitative assessment of molecular availability that accounts for the zzso of the cell surface and the balance of forces in the zzso as well as the zzso of surface zzso lengths and the preference for molecules to reside at or away from the tips of surface zzso We also examined how molecular availability should change with increasing zzso of the cell against the zzso Finally, we zzso the distribution of molecules at the interface with a zzso zzso zzso to predict the zzso intensity in total internal zzso zzso zzso which can provide a quantitative measure of the relative availability of different molecules at a zzso zzso Model predictions show good agreement with zzso of zzso intensity of different molecules labeled zzso on the surface of a human zzso compressed against a glass zzso
