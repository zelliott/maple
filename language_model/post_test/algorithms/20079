zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso molecules that are involved in zzso gene zzso Using global zzso expression zzso we found zzso zzso and zzso to be highly zzso in rat zzso following zzso injury induced by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso also showed decreased expression patterns in blood and urinary zzso in both models of kidney zzso Furthermore, urinary levels of zzso increased zzso in patients with clinical diagnosis of acute kidney injury zzso zzso zzso zzso as compared with healthy volunteers zzso zzso 25) zzso zzso zzso and zzso decreased zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso We identified 29 zzso zzso core targets of these 3 zzso using the context likelihood of zzso zzso and found these predicted gene targets to be highly enriched for genes associated with zzso or cell zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso and zzso could potentially serve as zzso zzso for detection of zzso and may play a critical role in the zzso of kidney injury and tissue repair zzso
