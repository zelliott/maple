zzso zzso dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso has been proposed for the assessment of regional zzso The aim of this work was the zzso of an zzso for a zzso zzso zzso of lung zzso using different cutting planes and volume zzso Our zzso was based on zzso zzso data of the lungs of five patients and five healthy zzso Using the indicator dilution theory, the regional zzso zzso tissue blood flow, blood volume and mean transit time were zzso Due to the required zzso resolution, the volume elements of dynamic MR data sets show a reduced spatial resolution in the zzso zzso zzso zzso volumes were zzso Linear zzso and a combination of linear and zzso zzso were zzso Additionally, ray tracing was applied for zzso zzso The linear zzso zzso caused zzso errors at the lung zzso Using the combined zzso zzso of zzso information in arbitrary cutting planes and in zzso using volume rendering was zzso This facilitated the zzso of zzso deficits compared with the zzso zzso source zzso The zzso zzso of zzso parameters using a combined zzso zzso is zzso Further studies are required to evaluate the additional benefit from the zzso zzso
