A cable model is formulated to estimate the spatial distribution of zzso electric potential and zzso from the cement line to the zzso of an zzso as the frequency of the loading and the zzso of the gap junction are zzso The model predicts that the characteristic diffusion time for the spread of current along the membrane of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is nearly the same as the predicted pore pressure relaxation time in Zeng et zzso zzso of zzso zzso 1994) for the draining of the bone fluid into the zzso zzso This approximate equality of characteristic times causes the cable to behave as a zzso zzso filter cascade with a maximum in the spectral response for the zzso potential at approximately 30 zzso This behavior could be related to the experiments of Rubin and zzso zzso Academic Press, zzso which show that live bone appears to be selectively responsive to mechanical loading in a specific frequency range zzso zzso for several zzso
