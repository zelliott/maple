In this study, zzso zzso zzso is hypothesized to be controlled by a zzso deterministic and possibly chaotic zzso A procedure for zzso the presumably zzso structure of the zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso for zzso the correlation dimension, zzso is zzso The procedure developed showed zzso against zzso zzso this method to zzso signals from 10 healthy subjects and 10 patients suffering from vertigo showed a statistically significant lower mean v value for the zzso
