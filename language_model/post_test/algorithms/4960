Mechanical zzso was used to study the zzso characteristics of gelatin zzso zzso profile analysis zzso showed that the zzso of fish and zzso gelatin increased significantly as the zzso of gels zzso zzso attributes of zzso fish skin gel showed significant differences from those obtained from zzso and zzso zzso In bovine and zzso cases, such generic trends were not zzso Mechanical characteristics of zzso gels of gelatin from fish skin, determined from one cycle zzso were significantly lower than other sources of gelatin gels, while bovine and zzso gels did not show any significant zzso In the case of zzso zzso of bovine gelatin gel was highest at 41 N for zzso zzso followed by zzso (30 N) then fish skin (5 N) gelatin zzso The gels prepared from different sources did not show any generic trends when all other mechanical attributes were zzso
