The objective of this study was to develop an zzso for liver mass diagnosis using zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso in 92 patients were evaluated with zzso 115 zzso zzso zzso zzso 44 zzso (29 zzso zzso 12 zzso two peripheral zzso and one zzso zzso and 52 benign zzso zzso zzso 20 focal zzso zzso and six zzso All had continuous zzso imaging through the zzso and portal zzso zzso A zzso blind review evaluated single images at zzso early and peak zzso zzso and through the extended portal zzso with a movie showing zzso phase zzso zzso assessed zzso zzso and enhancement blindly but did not make a zzso zzso of answers were compared with independently determined final diagnoses to develop an zzso for liver mass zzso 

zzso phase enhancement comprises the first step of the algorithm, with positive or sustained enhancement identifying 48 zzso of 52 benign zzso and negative enhancement or zzso present in 41 zzso of 44 zzso zzso portal phase enhancement with zzso phase peripheral zzso and zzso progression predicted 24 zzso of 26 of the zzso diffuse zzso phase enhancement greater than the liver identified 19 zzso of 20 of the focal zzso zzso With negative portal phase enhancement, zzso phase information was less effective at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of 29 zzso from another zzso zzso (11 zzso of 15 zzso 

A simple diagnostic zzso for interpretation of zzso zzso provides sensitive and accurate diagnosis of commonly encountered liver zzso
