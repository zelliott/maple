The authors compared the behavior of two calculations of zzso spectral zzso state zzso zzso and response zzso zzso with the zzso zzso Index zzso and the zzso Index zzso and as measures of zzso drug zzso They compared the measures for baseline zzso burst suppression, and prediction zzso They also developed zzso models relating SE, zzso zzso and zzso to the calculated zzso zzso concentration zzso 

With institutional review board approval, the authors studied 10 zzso All patients received 50 zzso zzso until either burst suppression greater than zzso or mean zzso pressure less than 50 zzso was zzso SE, zzso zzso and zzso were continuously zzso zzso was calculated from the zzso infusion zzso zzso zzso prediction of burst suppression, prediction zzso and zzso rank correlation were calculated for SE, zzso zzso and zzso The relations between zzso and the zzso measures of drug effect were estimated using zzso mixed effect zzso 

zzso zzso was lowest when using zzso and zzso zzso suppression was most accurately detected by spectral zzso zzso probability and individualized zzso rank correlation were highest for zzso and lowest for zzso zzso mixed effect modeling generated reasonable models relating all four measures to zzso 

Compared with zzso and zzso both zzso and zzso seem to be useful zzso measures of zzso drug effect, with low baseline zzso and accurate burst suppression zzso The ability of the measures to predict zzso was best for zzso
