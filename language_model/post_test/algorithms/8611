The zzso complex of zzso in water solution at pH zzso zzso was characterized by zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso complex is formed in these zzso The temperature dependence of zzso relaxation rates was measured, showing that all zzso behave in a similar fashion and slow exchange conditions zzso The zzso relaxation rate enhancements were interpreted by the zzso zzso zzso dynamics of the complex was zzso by evaluating the zzso correlation time of free zzso in water zzso The observed zzso and carbon relaxation rate enhancements allowed us to calculate zzso and zzso distances that were used for building a molecular model of the zzso The obtained data provide an interpretation of the relatively high stability zzso
