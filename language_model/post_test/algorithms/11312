The human pulmonary zzso zzso in response to zzso and zzso with important consequences for zzso and zzso One function of these responses is to direct blood flow away from zzso regions of the zzso In humans it is not known whether the stimuli of zzso and zzso zzso the pulmonary blood vessels independently of each other or whether they act zzso such that the combination of zzso and zzso is more effective than the sum of the responses to each stimulus on its zzso We independently controlled the zzso partial pressures of carbon dioxide zzso 2) and oxygen zzso 2) to examine their possible interaction on human pulmonary zzso Nine volunteers each experienced zzso possible combinations of four levels of Paco 2 zzso zzso zzso and -9 zzso relative to zzso with four levels of zzso 2 zzso 100, 75 and 50 zzso During each of these zzso protocols zzso zzso was used to evaluate cardiac output and zzso zzso pressure zzso an index of pulmonary zzso The degree of zzso varied zzso with both Paco 2 and the calculated zzso oxygen zzso zzso Mixed effects zzso delivered zzso defining the zzso of cardiac zzso zzso zzso pressure zzso zzso Paco 2 and zzso No interaction was observed in the effects on pulmonary zzso of carbon dioxide and oxygen zzso zzso effects of the zzso gases on zzso zzso pressure zzso greatly exceeded indirect effects arising from concurrent changes in cardiac zzso
