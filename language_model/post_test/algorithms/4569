Several medications are recommended for relief of zzso zzso zzso A sequential treatment zzso has been suggested, but its zzso is zzso We developed a decision model to estimate the zzso of this zzso compared with other sequential medication strategies in zzso with zzso using literature data to model zzso zzso relief while also accounting for severe medication side zzso zzso patients with and without coronary artery disease zzso were considered zzso with and without localized zzso zzso medication switches occurred as the result of inadequate relief or intolerable side zzso zzso sensitivity analyses were performed to estimate the zzso of each medication early in treatment zzso In patients without zzso zzso and zzso were equally favored as initial therapy if mortality with zzso use was not increased, but zzso was strongly favored if it zzso In patients with zzso zzso was overwhelmingly zzso In either patient group, zzso zzso and zzso were not favored as initial therapy but were sensible choices later in treatment zzso The zzso patch was a reasonable first choice in patients with localized zzso Our analysis supports the suggested treatment algorithm, with zzso ratios within acceptable ranges for medications given zzso based on zzso estimates of effectiveness and zzso 

This article examines the zzso of recommended sequential treatment strategies for zzso zzso This decision zzso synthesis of effectiveness and cost data found that recommended treatment zzso are also economically zzso
