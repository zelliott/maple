zzso genetic diversity in viral populations within infected hosts and the divergence of zzso from existing reference zzso impede the analysis of deep viral sequencing zzso A de zzso population consensus assembly is valuable both as a single linear representation of the population and as a backbone on which zzso zzso can be accurately zzso The availability of consensus zzso and robustly mapped zzso are crucial to the genetic study of viral disease zzso transmission zzso and viral zzso zzso de zzso assembly techniques fail to robustly assemble zzso sequence data from genetically zzso populations such as viruses into full-length zzso due to the presence of extensive genetic zzso zzso and variable sequence zzso 

We present zzso a de zzso assembly zzso suitable for generating consensus zzso from genetically zzso zzso We demonstrate its effectiveness on zzso Human zzso and West Nile viral zzso representing a range of zzso zzso Compared to state-of-the-art zzso designed for zzso or zzso systems, zzso recovers full-length consensus and captures zzso zzso in diverse zzso Final zzso maintain a high base calling zzso zzso program is publicly available at: zzso zzso 

We developed zzso a publicly available software zzso that enables consensus assembly of zzso sequence derived from diverse viral zzso While zzso was developed for the analysis of viral zzso its application to other zzso sequence data sets such as zzso or tumor cell population samples may prove beneficial in these fields of zzso
