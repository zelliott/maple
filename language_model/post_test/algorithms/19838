zzso is widely used in biological and biomedical zzso zzso for the zzso of the zzso abundance using zzso data have been zzso zzso many of which are based on the assumption that the zzso of zzso are zzso distributed along the zzso However, the zzso are found to be zzso distributed along the zzso which can greatly reduce the zzso of these methods based on the uniform zzso Several methods are developed to adjust the biases induced by this zzso utilizing the zzso empirical distribution in zzso As an alternative, we found that zzso degradation plays a major role in the formation of the zzso zzso distribution and thus developed a new approach that zzso the zzso zzso distribution by precisely modeling zzso zzso Our model of zzso degradation fits zzso data quite well, and based on this model, a new statistical method was further developed to estimate transcript expression level, as well as the zzso degradation rate, for individual genes and their zzso We showed that our method can improve the accuracy of transcript zzso expression zzso The zzso degradation rate of individual transcript we estimated is consistent across samples and/or zzso In addition, the zzso degradation rate from our model is independent of the zzso zzso consistent with previous studies on zzso zzso zzso
