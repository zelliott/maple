Variations in anatomical zzso principally due to a combination of zzso contributions and zzso remain one of the most significant impediments to zzso zzso zzso of spatial zzso of the delineated contours zzso a structure can be made with a variety of zzso and the availability of software tools to apply such metrics to data collected during zzso or zzso studies would allow their zzso A suite of such tools have been developed which use an zzso zzso Language format for the exchange of delineated zzso structures with zzso planning or review zzso These tools provide basic operations for manipulating and operating on individual structures and related structure sets, and for zzso statistics on spatial variations of contours that can be mapped onto the surface of a reference zzso Use of these tools on a sample zzso is demonstrated together with import and display of results in the zzso treatment plan review zzso
