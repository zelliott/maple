Previous studies have evaluated the safety of relatively complex combinations of clinical decision rules and diagnostic tests in patients with suspected pulmonary zzso 

To assess the clinical effectiveness of a simplified zzso using a zzso clinical decision rule, zzso testing, and zzso zzso zzso in patients with suspected pulmonary zzso 

Prospective cohort study of consecutive patients with clinically suspected acute pulmonary zzso conducted in 12 centers in the Netherlands from November 2002 through December zzso The study population of zzso patients included zzso zzso and 57% zzso 

Patients were zzso as zzso embolism zzso or zzso embolism zzso using a zzso version of the Wells clinical decision zzso Patients classified as unlikely had zzso testing, and pulmonary embolism was considered excluded if the zzso test result was zzso All other patients underwent CT, and pulmonary embolism was considered present or excluded based on the zzso zzso were withheld from patients classified as zzso and all patients were followed up for 3 zzso 

zzso or fatal zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso 

Pulmonary embolism was classified as unlikely in zzso patients zzso The combination of pulmonary embolism unlikely and a normal zzso test result occurred in zzso patients zzso of whom zzso were not treated with zzso subsequent nonfatal zzso occurred in 5 patients zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed pulmonary embolism in zzso patients zzso zzso zzso excluded pulmonary embolism in zzso patients, of whom zzso patients were not treated with zzso in these patients the zzso zzso of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso Pulmonary embolism was considered a possible cause of death in 7 patients after a negative CT scan zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was completed and allowed a management decision in zzso of zzso 

A diagnostic management strategy using a simple clinical decision rule, zzso testing, and CT is effective in the evaluation and management of patients with clinically suspected pulmonary zzso Its use is associated with low risk for subsequent fatal and nonfatal zzso
