A method that can be used to evaluate the performance of zzso methods for detecting discrete regional zzso using functional zzso is zzso Computer derived zzso zzso zzso have been used to evaluate zzso a range of conditions encountered in functional zzso zzso zzso analysis allows multiple acquisition strategies and multiple zzso strategies to be zzso and zzso zzso The authors first present this analysis technique and then illustrate its use for assessing the relative performances of different functional zzso data acquisition strategies using different zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso In addition, the authors have used the zzso analysis to evaluate and compare several methods for analyzing functional zzso data to extract regions of zzso This approach to assessing the performance of different methods is of general use and can be applied to evaluate other data acquisition protocols and zzso zzso
