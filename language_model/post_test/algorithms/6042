Visual interpretation of zzso images has been shown to be inadequate for assessing the severity of intermediate coronary zzso An approach for evaluating both the zzso and functional impact of a zzso is zzso An automated technique for determining both coronary blood flow and zzso volume based on a zzso analysis zzso of coronary zzso and a template matching zzso was zzso 

zzso zzso of a zzso animal model were obtained during power injections of contrast material into the left coronary zzso zzso anatomy was zzso with an automated phase matching zzso A template matching zzso and zzso analysis were then used to zzso coronary blood flow and zzso zzso zzso blood flow and zzso volume zzso were validated with a zzso ultrasound flow probe and a zzso cast of the coronary zzso zzso 

In 14 independent zzso the mean coronary blood flow measured with zzso showed strong correlation with the mean flow measured with the ultrasound flow probe zzso zzso zzso - zzso r zzso zzso standard error of estimate zzso zzso zzso The zzso volumes determined with zzso and cast zzso demonstrated excellent correlation and can be related to each other by zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso zzso standard error of estimate zzso zzso zzso 

The proposed automated method for accurate determination of coronary blood flow and zzso volume can supplement visual evaluation of coronary anatomy with quantitative zzso zzso This automated technique potentially offers a clinically feasible method of zzso coronary blood flow and zzso volume in conjunction with routine cardiac zzso
