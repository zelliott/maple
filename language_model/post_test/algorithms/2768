The zzso pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of the zzso safety of early intensive blood pressure zzso zzso and effects on zzso expansion within zzso of onset of zzso zzso zzso This article describes the design of the second, main phase, zzso zzso aims to compare the effects of a management strategy of early intensive zzso lowering with a more conservative zzso zzso management policy in patients with acute zzso This article also compares the baseline characteristics of the patients included in France with the baseline characteristics of the patients included in the pilot study zzso 

zzso is an zzso zzso zzso open, zzso outcome zzso zzso controlled zzso Patients with a zzso zzso greater than zzso are centrally zzso to either to an intensive zzso lowering treatment zzso zzso within zzso or to a conservative treatment strategy (target zzso zzso of zzso A projected zzso subjects are to be enrolled from approximately 140 zzso worldwide to provide zzso power zzso zzso to detect a beneficial effect of early treatment on the primary zzso 

The primary outcome is the combined zzso of death and dependency according to the modified Rankin zzso zzso at 90 zzso The key secondary outcome is the primary zzso in those patients treated within zzso of zzso Other zzso secondary outcomes are the separate components of the primary zzso grades of physical function on the zzso zzso quality of life on the zzso zzso stroke and other vascular events, days of zzso requirement for permanent residential care, and unexpected serious adverse zzso The study is registered under zzso zzso and zzso 

As of early July, 152 patients have been included in zzso When compared with the patients zzso in the zzso pilot study, these patients are older, less likely to have had a previous zzso more often on zzso or zzso therapy, have a lower zzso zzso zzso more severe clinically zzso zzso and experience their first zzso
