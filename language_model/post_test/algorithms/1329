This paper describes a new approach to reconstruction of the zzso field in electrical zzso zzso Our goal is to improve the zzso between the quality of the images and the zzso complexity of the reconstruction zzso In order to reduce the zzso load, we adopt a zzso approximation to the forward problem that describes the relationship between the unknown zzso and the zzso In this zzso we focus on finding a proper way to cope with the zzso nature of the problem, mainly caused by strong zzso zzso this is done by devising zzso techniques well suited to this particular zzso First, we propose a solution which is based on zzso zzso of the zzso Second, we introduce an original zzso reconstruction method in which the zzso zzso is determined by zzso of the zzso of the reconstructed zzso Both methods are zzso zzso all tuning parameters are automatically determined from the measured zzso Tests performed on simulated and real data indicate that zzso zzso provides results similar to those obtained with zzso methods, but with a much smaller amount of zzso zzso using a zzso zzso constraint yields further improvements, particularly in the central region of the unknown object where zzso is most zzso We anticipate that the zzso zzso approach could be adapted to zzso methods that preserve the zzso of the forward zzso More generally, it appears as a useful tool for solving other severely zzso reconstruction problems such as zzso current zzso
