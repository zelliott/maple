zzso experiments show that the strength of synaptic connections can undergo substantial changes on a short time zzso These changes depend on the history of the zzso zzso Using zzso techniques, we study how zzso dynamics of synaptic connections influence the performance of zzso neural networks in terms of their memory capacity and capability to process external zzso For zzso zzso as well as for firing rate zzso neural networks, the fixed points of the network dynamics are shown to be unaffected by synaptic zzso However, the stability of patterns changes zzso zzso depression turns out to reduce the storage zzso On the other hand, synaptic depression is shown to be advantageous for processing of pattern zzso The zzso results on stability, size of the zzso of attraction and on the switching between patterns are zzso by zzso zzso
