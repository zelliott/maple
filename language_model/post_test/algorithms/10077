zzso zzso of zzso zzso are routinely used to understand zzso events occurring in remote portions of zzso These studies often assume the zzso space is zzso We questioned this assumption in auditory and zzso hair cells with respect to their zzso based on earlier studies showing that zzso with zzso dimensions similar to zzso are not always zzso under zzso To explore this, we modeled the zzso as passive cables with zzso channels located at their zzso We found that the input zzso measured at the zzso changes when the zzso channels at the tips of the zzso are open compared to when the channels are zzso The maximum zzso is felt with the zzso closed but will decrease as the zzso opens due to a zzso zzso drop along the zzso zzso This potential drop is zzso to the zzso resistance and zzso tip zzso and can produce a maximum zzso error on the order of zzso for single zzso and zzso for the zzso
