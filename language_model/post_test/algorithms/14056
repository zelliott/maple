zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso application that clusters complex zzso zzso data derived from single zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments using zzso based zzso zzso such as arrayed primer extension zzso Spot intensity output files from zzso experiments across multiple samples are imported into zzso The zzso can include four channels of intensity data for each spot, replica spots for each zzso probe and multiple probe types zzso and zzso zzso zzso on both DNA strands for each zzso zzso automatically clusters these zzso zzso for each zzso across multiple zzso zzso of additional array zzso from known samples that have previously validated zzso zzso calls allows unknown samples to be automatically assigned a zzso based on the zzso along with zzso measures of confidence for each zzso zzso Calling accuracy by zzso exceeds zzso when applied to zzso data from zzso zzso and can be increased to zzso by applying thresholds to the confidence zzso
