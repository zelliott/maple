zzso of multiple zzso components within single imaging zzso typically proceeds in one of two zzso a zzso grid approximation to a continuous distribution is made and a zzso zzso least squares zzso is employed to perform the zzso zzso or a zzso zzso model is assumed with a maximum likelihood zzso for the component zzso In this work, we present a zzso zzso based on the principle of progressive correction for the latter choice of a discrete zzso zzso We demonstrate in application to simulated data and two experimental zzso that our zzso approach provides robust and accurate estimates of both the zzso model parameters and zzso flip zzso The second contribution of the paper is to present a zzso analysis of zzso component zzso zzso To this end, we introduce a zzso zzso and continuous model based on a mixture of zzso zzso This analysis supports the notion that zzso spread is difficult, if not zzso to estimate from zzso data acquired with a typical clinical zzso These results justify the use of the discrete distribution zzso
