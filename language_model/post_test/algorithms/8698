Some sick leave of patients waiting for zzso surgery could be avoided if these patients were treated with less zzso One way of achieving this is to give priority to patients on sick zzso zzso of fairness that such a policy would raise might be solved by assuring that part of the production gains stemming from avoided sick leave were used to increase treatment capacity to benefit all patients, including those not on sick zzso Another way to reduce sick leave due to waiting time is to increase supply temporarily and reduce treatment backlog without changing priorities among patient zzso If treatment thresholds are zzso such a temporary increase in supply will relieve all later patients of some of their waiting and render a production gain that may exceed marginal zzso If treatment thresholds are lowered as a result of waiting time's being reduced, there will still be production gains in patients benefiting by the temporary increase in supply, but in this situation the gains may cover only part of marginal zzso
