zzso zzso and zzso are essential components of modern zzso zzso Similar devices will be needed in future zzso quantum zzso In this work we investigate zzso the time evolution of zzso splitting in a zzso phase zzso under the application of a control tone zzso coupled to the second zzso A zzso model that includes independently determined parameters for relaxation and zzso gives excellent agreement with the zzso The results demonstrate that the zzso can be used as a zzso switch with zzso operating zzso for the zzso of photons coming from an applied probe zzso zzso The ON state is realized when the control tone is sufficiently strong to generate an zzso zzso suppressing the zzso of the probe tone photons and resulting in a maximum of zzso
