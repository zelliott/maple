The governing equations of a porous zzso zzso are presented in zzso form, though they were well established in differential zzso zzso principle is applied to the motions of a regular region of the zzso and a zzso zzso principle is obtained with some constraint zzso By removing the constraint conditions that are usually zzso in zzso through an zzso zzso a unified zzso principle is presented for the region with a fixed internal surface of zzso The unified principle zzso as its zzso zzso to all the governing equations of the region, including the jump conditions but excluding the initial zzso Certain special cases and zzso zzso principles are recorded, and they are shown to recover some of the earlier zzso
