In this letter, we propose a novel zzso method for computing generalized zzso based on a novel zzso zzso The proposed zzso zzso requires making four zzso and zzso zzso at each iteration and thus has low zzso zzso The proposed method is proved to be globally zzso without any zzso Furthermore, for fast computing generalized zzso we present an acceleration scheme based on the proposed zzso zzso The global convergence of the proposed acceleration zzso is also zzso Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed zzso zzso is evaluated zzso
