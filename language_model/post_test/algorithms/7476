Today's follow-up of patients presenting abdominal tumors is generally performed through acquisition of dynamic sequences of zzso zzso zzso parameters of appropriate models of contrast intake diffusion through zzso should help characterizing the tumor zzso but is zzso by the high level of noise inherent to the acquisition zzso To improve the quality of zzso we consider zzso zzso in zzso as a zzso learning problem (one task per zzso that takes advantage from the similarity between two zzso We introduce a zzso similarity between tasks based on a robust distance between observed zzso profiles of zzso Using synthetic images, we compare zzso learning using this zzso zzso a spatial similarity and a zzso zzso The similarities based on zzso profiles are shown to bring significant improvements compared to the spatial zzso zzso on real CT sequences also confirm the relevance of the zzso
