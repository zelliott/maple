zzso sequencing and zzso methods are dramatically increasing the number of zzso genetic zzso differences that can be exploited as genetic zzso In addition, automated zzso platforms and zzso profiling technologies further enlarge the set of quantifiable zzso and molecular traits at an ever-increasing zzso zzso both lines of technological advances create unparalleled opportunities to identify candidate gene regions and, ideally, even single genes responsible for observed variations in a particular trait via association zzso However, as of yet, this new potential is not sufficiently matched by enabling software solutions to easily exploit this wealth of zzso zzso We have developed zzso a Web-based platform to address this zzso Initially, we built the infrastructure to support association studies in zzso zzso zzso based on several zzso efforts covering up to zzso zzso zzso Based on the zzso trait information, associated zzso zzso markers and zzso zzso or zzso genes are identified using both the zzso and zzso libraries developed for zzso Additional interrogation is facilitated by displaying candidate regions and genes in a zzso browser and by providing relevant zzso zzso In the future, we plan to broaden the scope of organisms to other plant species as more zzso information becomes zzso zzso is freely available at zzso and can be zzso using any zzso zzso
