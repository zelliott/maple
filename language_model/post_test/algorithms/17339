An accurate zzso zzso identification of an zzso cerebral zzso is an important objective of magnetic resonance imaging zzso This study describes a novel application of a zzso zzso analysis algorithm, the zzso zzso zzso to experimental zzso The zzso is a linear filter that zzso the projection of a desired tissue zzso zzso while it zzso the projection of zzso zzso zzso zzso onto a composite image called an zzso zzso zzso were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were acquired on separate groups of zzso The animals were immediately sacrificed after each imaging session for zzso analysis of tissue at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso h after stroke zzso zzso areas from zzso were defined using zzso The zzso defined zzso areas were zzso and warped to the corresponding zzso zzso The zzso zzso as defined by zzso exhibited zzso cell damage ranging from scattered acute cell damage to pan zzso zzso cellular damage was not detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso areas zzso on zzso sections were significantly correlated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso methodology can accurately segment zzso damage after zzso zzso from zzso h after zzso
