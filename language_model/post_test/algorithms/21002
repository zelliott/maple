zzso zzso zzso zzso can be used to locate zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso lobe zzso zzso by measuring multiple parameters of the zzso We investigated a series of patients with zzso using PET zzso of three zzso the cerebral blood flow measured with zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso an index of the cerebral metabolism rate of zzso and the distribution volume zzso of zzso zzso zzso an index of the binding potential of central zzso zzso We compared zzso values obtained from two zzso a zzso statistical analysis using statistical zzso mapping zzso and an asymmetry index obtained by placing regions of interest zzso on PET zzso 

zzso PET data of 11 patients with surgically confirmed zzso were zzso zzso In the zzso analysis, the PET data were analyzed using zzso by statistically comparing the zzso values of PET parameters between individual patients and the mean values of 12 normal zzso zzso with values significantly lower than the normal control values were mapped on a standard brain zzso In the zzso analysis, the asymmetry index was calculated to depict zzso with zzso decreased values when compared with the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso mapping and zzso analyses of the zzso zzso correctly determined zzso zzso lobe in zzso and zzso zzso zzso The decreased zzso of zzso depicted by zzso revealed the zzso zzso pathology in zzso 

zzso zzso zzso measurement of zzso zzso was most sensitive in detecting the side of the zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso analysis of the zzso of zzso was the most sensitive method for zzso the actual zzso zzso
