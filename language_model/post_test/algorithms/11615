A new zzso time domain model is proposed in this paper for signals of cardiovascular zzso An equation of the dynamic zzso model has been obtained by considering a masking function, which is modulated by a harmonic series with the baseline drift incorporated into the zzso Signal reconstruction using model parameters has established the effectiveness of the model for signal zzso Improvement has been zzso by using neural networks for reducing the time for zzso the initial zzso An improved zzso zzso step size zzso has also been zzso zzso show that the technique is able to provide reasonable zzso with low error between the original and reconstructed zzso One of the main advantages of the model is its potential of being used for zzso of many different types of zzso transmitted in zzso zzso of the zzso model into a zzso system has led to considerable saving in transmission time for patient zzso
