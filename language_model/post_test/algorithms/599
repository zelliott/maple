The hypothesis presented here is that in a given person, the overall zzso of sensory variables at any given moment, zzso everything that the person is seeing, hearing, zzso can be treated as belonging to an infinite sequence of such momentary zzso with the sequence being generated by a particular mathematical zzso The ideas behind this are as zzso If a person's various zzso sensory experiences can all be described within the same coordinate system, then they can be treated as objects that zzso transform into one zzso If they are also zzso by brain events, then the person's own encounters with this zzso zzso when participating in zzso experiments, amount to instances where a given sensory experience inevitably follows other sensory experiences occurring in a specific zzso For example, a person's visual encounters with certain zzso might always be followed by a particular visual zzso If there exist sequences like this for any given momentary sensory experience, then these collectively form the person's sensory code, as it would be encountered from the person's own zzso The person's ongoing flow of sensory experiences may then be treated as part of the infinite sequence implied by the various zzso ways in which sensory experiences can flow from one to the zzso If this sequence can be generated by a finite number of zzso segments that transform into each other and link together end to end, then a person's full range of sensory experiences can be defined in zzso zzso
