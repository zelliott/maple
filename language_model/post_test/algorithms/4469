We sought to analyze the zzso value of zzso clinical and zzso parameters in the identification of patients with suspected zzso and their relationship with zzso respiratory events during zzso We studied zzso 433 patients with zzso zzso men zzso and 72 women zzso with an average age of zzso standard zzso zzso years zzso zzso zzso The study variables for all of the patients were age, sex, zzso neck zzso body mass index zzso zzso zzso scale, zzso examination, zzso examination, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso index zzso Age, neck zzso zzso zzso zzso scale, zzso examination and zzso collapse were the significant zzso Of the patients, zzso were correctly zzso with a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso We found a direct relationship between the variables zzso and zzso Based on these results, we obtained the following zzso to calculate the prediction of zzso for a new zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso neck circumference zzso zzso collapses zzso + zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso age + zzso zzso zzso The ratio zzso in the number of respiratory events explained by the model was zzso zzso zzso zzso The variables given in the zzso are the best ones for predicting the number of respiratory events during sleep in patients studied for suspected zzso The zzso proposed may be a good screening method to the identification of patients with zzso
