Phase error analysis in zzso Phase zzso zzso zzso due to frequency zzso has been to date only performed zzso In this paper, we show an exact zzso expression to obtain this phase error due to zzso using the spectral zzso zzso The new proposed method is based on the zzso representation of the output of the zzso zzso zzso Doing this, the zzso problem is reduced to a ratio of two symmetrical spectral responses of the zzso filter at the zzso zzso Finally, some popular cases of zzso zzso are analyzed to show the usefulness of the proposed zzso
