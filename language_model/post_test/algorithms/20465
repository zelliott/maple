Although analyses of zzso zzso have been done for conventional zzso zzso zzso images, zzso zzso in spiral CT has not been properly zzso We propose a mathematical model of the three-dimensional zzso sampling scheme in spiral CT and analyze its effects on zzso zzso We investigated zzso zzso as a function of the zzso algorithm, pitch, and reconstruction zzso using CT simulations and actual phantom zzso Our model zzso and we verified, that for a zzso uniform object at the zzso the spiral sampling scheme results in zzso varying cancellation of the zzso spectral islands which, in turn, results in zzso varying zzso zzso The zzso is minimal at the scanner zzso but worsens with distance from it and rapidly becomes zzso Our results agree with published results observed at the zzso of the scanner and further provide new insight into the zzso conditions at zzso locations with respect to the pitch, zzso algorithm, and reconstruction zzso We conclude that zzso zzso at zzso locations can be zzso and that its magnitude and effects cannot be predicted by zzso made only at the scanner zzso
