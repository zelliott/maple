zzso matched and low loss transmission lines are essential for optimal energy delivery through an integrated optical or zzso zzso A novel method for the measurement of the zzso and propagation zzso of an zzso zzso strip zzso transmission line is demonstrated at zzso zzso using zzso scanning zzso optical zzso zzso of the zzso optical wave upon an zzso or zzso load at the terminal of the zzso provides a standing zzso wave, which is mapped through the associated zzso zzso electric zzso component at the zzso zzso By fitting the zzso standing wave expression to the zzso data, the transmission line properties are zzso zzso models and measured results are presented and are in excellent zzso
