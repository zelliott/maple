To segment the fetal heart in order to facilitate the zzso assessment of the cardiac function and zzso 

zzso acquisition typically results in zzso artifacts of the chamber zzso The authors outline a level set zzso model to automatically delineate the small fetal cardiac zzso The level set is penalized from growing into an adjacent cardiac compartment using a novel collision detection zzso The region based model allows simultaneous zzso of all four cardiac chambers from a user defined seed point placed in each zzso 

The segmented boundaries are automatically penalized from zzso at walls with signal zzso Root mean square errors of the perpendicular distances between the zzso zzso and manual zzso are within 2 zzso which is less than zzso of the length of a typical fetal zzso The ejection zzso were determined from the zzso zzso We validate the zzso using a physical phantom and obtain volumes that are comparable to those from physically determined zzso The zzso segments volumes with an error of within zzso as determined using a physical zzso 

Our original work in fetal cardiac zzso compares automatic and manual zzso to a physical phantom and also measures zzso observer zzso
