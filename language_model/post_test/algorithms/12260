The zzso correct three-dimensional reconstruction of human coronary arteries by zzso zzso ultrasound zzso and zzso zzso constitutes a promising imaging method for zzso with broad clinical zzso The zzso of the accuracy of the method, however, have not been investigated zzso 

In total, 17 zzso segments zzso coronary artery, zzso left anterior zzso zzso left zzso zzso derived from nine patients were zzso reconstructed by applying three-dimensional zzso zzso The degree of matching between the reconstructed zzso zzso onto each zzso plane and the actual zzso in each plane was used as a measure of zzso zzso The investigated factors that could potentially affect the reliability of the method included the type of the artery zzso anterior zzso left zzso right coronary zzso and several geometrical and zzso characteristics of the reconstructed zzso 

The correlation between the zzso reconstructed zzso and the actual zzso ones was found to be high zzso zzso Neither the category of the reconstructed arteries nor their particular geometrical and zzso characteristics influenced the accuracy of the reconstruction method zzso Nonetheless, the method exhibited slightly less accuracy in the reconstruction of right coronary zzso an observation that could be attributed to the more intense zzso motion that this artery experiences during the cardiac cycle compared to the left anterior descending and left zzso zzso 

The zzso accuracy of three-dimensional zzso ultrasound zzso zzso is significantly high regardless of the type of the coronary arteries or their particular geometrical and zzso zzso This finding further supports the zzso of the method for either diagnostic or zzso zzso
