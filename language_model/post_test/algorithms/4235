zzso images acquired in zzso mode during arc therapy have inaccurate zzso angles recorded in their image zzso In this work, methods were developed to assess the accuracy of the zzso zzso for linear zzso As well, assessments of the accuracy of other, more accessible, sources of zzso angle information zzso treatment log files, analysis of zzso image zzso were zzso The methods used in this study are generally zzso to any linear accelerator unit, and have been demonstrated here with zzso zzso zzso angle data were simultaneously acquired using three zzso zzso a direct zzso zzso zzso zzso an incremental rotary zzso and zzso a custom-made zzso zzso phantom which produced unique wire zzso as a function of zzso zzso All methods were compared to zzso angle data from the zzso image zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso phantom were used to validate the accuracy of the zzso zzso The zzso image zzso zzso angles and the zzso file zzso angles were compared to the zzso The zzso and zzso phantom mean angle differences with the zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso image zzso angles analyzed in this study were within zzso zzso of the zzso angles only zzso of the zzso In some cases, zzso image zzso zzso angles disagreed by as much as zzso with the zzso A time delay in frame acquisition was determined using the continuous acquisition mode of the zzso After correcting for this time zzso zzso of the zzso angles, on average, were within zzso zzso of the true zzso angle, compared to an average of only zzso without the zzso zzso a zzso smoothing filter to the corrected zzso angles further improved the accuracy of the zzso zzso angles to within zzso zzso for almost all images zzso An angle accuracy of zzso zzso zzso was determined using a point-by-point comparison of the zzso angle data in the zzso zzso file and the zzso zzso These simple correction methods can be easily applied to individual treatment zzso images in order to more accurately define the zzso zzso
