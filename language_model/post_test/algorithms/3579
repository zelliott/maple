We describe a newly developed, accelerated zzso Carlo simulator of a small animal zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso are employed to estimate the spectrum of the zzso zzso The simulator incorporating this spectrum is validated with zzso scans of physical water zzso of various zzso some containing stainless steel and Teflon zzso Good agreement is found between simulated and real zzso zzso error of simulated projections, as compared to the real ones, is typically smaller than zzso Also the reconstructions obtained from simulated and real data are found to be zzso zzso effects of scatter are studied using a zzso software phantom representing a rat zzso It is shown that the scatter fraction can reach tens of per cents in specific areas of the body and therefore scatter can significantly affect quantitative accuracy in small animal CT zzso
