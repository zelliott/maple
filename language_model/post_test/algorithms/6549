DNA zzso have revolutionized biological research, but their reliability and accuracy have not been extensively zzso zzso testing of zzso through comparison to dissimilar gene expression methods is necessary in order to determine their zzso 

We have systematically compared three global gene expression methods on all available zzso normal samples from five human organ zzso The data included 25 zzso zzso zzso array experiments, 23 expressed sequence tag based expression zzso experiments and 5 zzso zzso The reported zzso expression patterns showed a wide range of correlations between pairs of zzso This level of agreement was sufficient for accurate zzso of zzso from the same tissue and dissimilar methods, but highlights the need for thorough validation of individual gene expression zzso by zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, analyses of zzso abundance zzso indicate limitations in the zzso and zzso methods at both zzso and zzso zzso
