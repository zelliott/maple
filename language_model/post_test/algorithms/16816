We apply zzso zzso to improve the information transfer in focal series reconstruction to zzso zzso at 300 zzso zzso to single images, which can be taken arbitrarily close to zzso focus in a zzso zzso images in a focal series are taken at a certain zzso This zzso poses limits on the spatial zzso of the zzso and through this, limits on the brightness of the zzso zzso We derive an estimate for the minimum spatial zzso and the minimal brightness needed for a certain resolution at a certain zzso and apply this estimate to our focal series zzso We find that the zzso zzso information transfer would have been difficult and probably impossible to obtain without the exceptionally high brightness of the zzso zzso
