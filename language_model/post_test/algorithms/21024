This paper deals with the problem of tracking cardiac motion and deformation using zzso magnetic resonance zzso We expand upon an earlier described method and fit a zzso motion model to measured zzso zzso We investigate several different spatial elements both zzso and zzso using phantom zzso and data from human zzso In addition, we also use optical flow zzso by the zzso method as complementary data in regions where the zzso zzso are zzso Our results show that it is possible to obtain good motion tracking accuracy in zzso with relatively few spatial zzso if the type of element is properly zzso The use of optical flow can correct some measurement artifacts but may give an zzso of the magnitude of the zzso In human subjects the different spatial elements perform zzso in a similar way but qualitative differences exists, as shown by a zzso visual scoring of the different zzso
