The zzso of nuclear spin interactions results in a unique mapping of structure to the resonance zzso and split zzso observed in zzso zzso however, the determination of molecular structure from zzso measured spectral parameters is complicated by angular ambiguities resulting from the symmetry properties of zzso and chemical shift zzso This issue can be addressed through the zzso inherent in secondary structure zzso which can be used as an index of zzso zzso zzso patterns are observed in two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso chemical shift zzso zzso inversion zzso at the magic zzso zzso of zzso membrane proteins in highly aligned zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso waves are an extension of two-dimensional zzso zzso index slant zzso wheels to map protein structure in zzso zzso of both highly and zzso aligned zzso zzso waves describe the periodic wavelike variations of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso as a function of zzso number in the absence of chemical shift zzso zzso aligned samples of proteins display these same effects, primarily as residual zzso zzso zzso in solution zzso zzso The corresponding properties of the zzso in solution zzso zzso of zzso aligned zzso represent a convergence of solid-state and solution zzso approaches to structure zzso
