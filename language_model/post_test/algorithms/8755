In zzso model systems, the sequential changes in lung zzso resulting from zzso injury are well characterized and are similar to changes in human acute respiratory distress zzso In the injured zzso zzso type two zzso zzso cells play a critical role in restoring the normal zzso zzso Thus characterizing the changes in zzso cells will provide insights into the mechanisms underpinning the recovery from lung zzso We applied an unbiased zzso zzso approach to zzso molecular mechanisms contributing to lung repair in a rat zzso lung injury zzso zzso cells were isolated from rat lungs at predetermined intervals during zzso injury and zzso zzso expression profiles were determined by using zzso with tandem mass zzso Of the 959 distinct proteins identified, 183 significantly changed in abundance during the zzso zzso Gene zzso enrichment analysis identified cell cycle, cell zzso cell zzso zzso zzso programmed cell death, zzso and cell migration to be significantly enriched by these zzso Gene set enrichment analysis of data acquired during lung repair revealed differential expression of gene sets that control zzso zzso development, systems development, organ development, and chemical zzso More detailed analysis identified activity in two regulatory zzso zzso and zzso zzso A novel short zzso expression zzso zzso identified protein clusters with coherent changes during injury and zzso We concluded that coherent changes occur in the zzso cell zzso in response to zzso zzso These findings offer guidance regarding the specific molecular mechanisms governing repair of the injured zzso
