A zzso model has become the standard for interpreting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for converting pre-existing databases from zzso models to the zzso model are needed for ongoing zzso zzso 

To develop the conversion algorithm, 150 consecutive zzso studies (82 zzso were read by both a zzso and the standard zzso zzso zzso stress scores zzso were calculated from a zzso model derived from the zzso data and compared to those of the standard zzso zzso The effect of the conversion zzso on zzso data derived from the zzso model was evaluated in zzso patients from the Duke Nuclear zzso zzso including a sample of zzso patients with known zzso for adjusted zzso The derived zzso zzso from the zzso model was highly correlated (R zzso zzso to the zzso from the standard zzso zzso In both zzso and adjusted analysis, there was no difference in the zzso zzso 

An zzso for conversion of zzso zzso scores to zzso scores has been developed which is highly correlated to visual interpretation by the zzso model with nearly identical zzso zzso
