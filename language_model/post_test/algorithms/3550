In order to draw up a rational sampling plan for the larvae population of zzso zzso an original population and its two zzso zzso random population and sequence population, were sampled and compared with random zzso zzso zzso and a new systematic sampling integrated zzso zzso and random original zzso As for the original population whose distribution was up to zzso and dependence range in line direction was 115 zzso zzso zzso zzso sampling in line direction was more precise than random zzso zzso the population pattern correctly is the key to get a better zzso zzso sampling and random sampling are fit for zzso population and random population, respectively, but both of them are difficult to apply in zzso zzso a new systematic sampling named as zzso sample zzso zzso zzso was developed to estimate the density of partial sample zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and population zzso zzso N zzso zzso As for original population, the estimated precision of zzso sample to partial sample and population was better than that of investigation zzso With the increase of the zzso intensity of population, zzso sample was more effective than investigation sample in both partial zzso and overall zzso in the appropriate sampling gap according to the dependence zzso
