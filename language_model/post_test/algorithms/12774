This article introduces a zzso model with the prey structured by body size, based on reports in the literature that zzso rates are zzso zzso The model is built on the foundation of the zzso zzso structured models studied zzso Three types of zzso are zzso zzso multiple zzso zzso and possibly multiple zzso coexistence zzso The zzso of the zzso are zzso zzso is made with the underlying zzso zzso zzso It turns out that the zzso model can exhibit sustain zzso if there is an zzso effect in the net reproduction rate, that is the net reproduction rate grows for some range of the zzso population zzso In contrast, it is shown that the structured zzso model can exhibit sustain zzso even if the net zzso rate is strictly declining with prey population zzso We find that zzso even zzso linear zzso can destabilize a stable zzso zzso if reproduction is size specific and limited to individuals of large enough zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso zzso can also destabilize the zzso equilibrium in the zzso zzso We zzso that zzso zzso allows for temporary prey escape which is responsible for zzso in the zzso zzso
