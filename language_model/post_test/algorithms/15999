To estimate zzso potential cost savings using zzso in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease zzso in zzso 

In recent years, new members of a class of pharmaceuticals known as zzso zzso have been introduced for the treatment of patients with zzso Two recent studies conducted in the United Kingdom and the United States estimated potential cost savings from the new zzso inhibitor zzso The present study combined the zzso model used in those 2 studies with Canadian costs to estimate zzso potential savings resulting from the treatment of zzso in zzso 

zzso data from 2 zzso phase III clinical trials of zzso were used in a hazard model of disease progression to estimate long-term differences in cognitive functioning between patients receiving zzso and patients receiving no zzso We used the zzso State zzso zzso score as our measure of disease zzso We also used Canadian costs of zzso care, estimated as a function of zzso score, to estimate cost savings experienced by treated patients compared with patients receiving no zzso All costs and cost savings are presented in 1997 Canadian zzso We used a zzso perspective in this zzso 

zzso was estimated to delay the transition to more severe stages of zzso by up to 188 days for patients with mild zzso after 2 years of zzso For patients with zzso and moderate disease, this delay was estimated to be 106 and 44 days, zzso For patients with the mild stage of zzso estimated average daily cost savings zzso the cost of zzso ranged from Can zzso per patient per day at 6 months to Can zzso per patient per day after 2 years of zzso For all patients, these estimated average daily cost savings ranged from a low of Can zzso per patient per day after 6 months of treatment to a high of Can zzso per patient per day after 2 zzso 

On average, treatment with zzso yields savings in the direct cost of caring for zzso patients that exceed the cost of the drug after 2 years of zzso
