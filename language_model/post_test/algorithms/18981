This paper presents two in-depth studies on zzso an evolutionary zzso for zzso secondary structure zzso The first study is an analysis of the performance of two zzso models, Individual zzso zzso zzso and Individual zzso zzso zzso Bond zzso The correlation between the free energy of predicted structures and the sensitivity is analyzed for 19 zzso zzso Although some zzso is zzso there is a clear trend between a lower free energy and an increase in true positive base zzso With increasing sequence zzso this correlation generally zzso In the second experiment, the accuracy of the predicted structures for these 19 sequences are compared against the accuracy of the structures generated by the zzso dynamic programming zzso zzso and also to known zzso zzso is shown to outperform the minimum free energy structures produced by zzso and has comparable performance when compared to zzso structures produced by zzso
