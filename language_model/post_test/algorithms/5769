zzso is a broadly applied notion in evolutionary biology used to justify zzso zzso or zzso as well as in studies of zzso lateral gene transfer, and as evidence for common zzso zzso methods for identifying zzso or zzso using character data were designed for data sets that are both small and expected to be rarely zzso At the same time, methods that assess zzso using comparison of trees test a zzso hypothesis of zzso tree structures, which may be inappropriate for zzso zzso As such, they are ill-suited for the growing number of available zzso zzso most of which are from zzso and zzso either for zzso analysis or for studies of the evolutionary forces and events that have shaped these zzso Specifically, many existing methods scale poorly with large numbers of zzso cannot accommodate high levels of zzso and do not adequately model patterns of missing zzso for different zzso We propose the development of novel zzso assessment methods suitable for the analysis of the molecular evolution of the vast majority of life and support the investigation of zzso of evolutionary process in cases where markers do not share identical tree zzso
