We propose in this paper a reassessment of the original data of zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We zzso using zzso zzso integrated moving average zzso the presence of genuine zzso correlations in stride zzso series in zzso zzso In contrast with the conclusions of the authors, we show that correlations did not disappear in zzso zzso The series of stride intervals presented zzso zzso and zzso fluctuations were evidenced in the zzso to the zzso We show that the super central pattern generator model (West B, zzso zzso zzso Rev E zzso zzso Soft Matter zzso zzso zzso 2003) allows accounting for the zzso observed correlations in both zzso and zzso conditions, by the simple setting of the zzso strength zzso We conclude that zzso fluctuations in gait are not overridden by zzso influences when walking is paced by a zzso The source of zzso noise is still at work in this condition, but expressed differently under the influence of a continuous zzso zzso
