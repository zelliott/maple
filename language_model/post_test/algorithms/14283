The zzso trajectory has found applications in cardiac imaging because of its resilience to zzso and motion zzso Recent work has shown that zzso and weighted zzso imaging can produce images with multiple contrasts from a single data zzso This feature was investigated for inversion recovery imaging of zzso using a zzso zzso The zzso zzso imaging method was modified to acquire zzso zzso projection sets within each acquisition window of the cardiac zzso These data were reconstructed using zzso weightings that used a smaller segment of the acquisition window for the central zzso data, the zzso of image zzso This method generates four images with different zzso zzso The novel approach was compared with zzso zzso imaging, zzso zzso without weightings, and Cartesian imaging in simulations, zzso and seven subjects with clinical zzso zzso The results show that during a typical acquisition window after an inversion pulse, zzso changes zzso The zzso acquisition provided better image quality than the zzso zzso zzso zzso with weighting provided better quality when the inversion time zzso was shorter than zzso otherwise, zzso without weighting was zzso These methods enable a zzso trajectory to be employed in conjunction with preparation zzso for viability zzso
