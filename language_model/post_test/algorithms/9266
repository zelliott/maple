zzso and zzso of optical zzso systems have become an important issue zzso to the increasing role of biological imaging in zzso screening zzso The proper interpretation of data from zzso screening imaging experiments requires detailed information about the capabilities of the systems, including their available dynamic range, sensitivity and zzso Currently available techniques for zzso and zzso of digital zzso commonly used in cell biology laboratories provide an zzso of stability and measurement precision zzso of an imaging system at a single level of signal zzso In addition, only the total noise level, not its characteristics zzso is zzso We propose a novel technique for zzso of zzso zzso of signal and noise in microscopic zzso The method requires registration of a time series of images of any stationary biological zzso The subsequent analysis involves a zzso process, which separates zzso periodic and random components of every zzso intensity change in zzso The technique allows simultaneous determination of dark, zzso and zzso components of noise present in biological zzso zzso a respective confidence zzso zzso zzso is obtained for each level of zzso The technique is validated using test sets of biological images with known signal and noise zzso The method is also applied to assess uncertainty of measurement obtained with two zzso cameras in a zzso zzso
