Although zzso of zzso zzso have traditionally been defined by bone zzso zzso in skeletal zzso and volume are also prevalent and may contribute to significant morbidity in patients with chronic kidney disease zzso The study presented here was undertaken to compare the traditional spectrum of zzso zzso defined by bone turnover to a new zzso system that includes T zzso M zzso and V zzso and to determine the value of zzso parameters as zzso of specific zzso zzso 

zzso patients zzso zzso zzso treated with zzso dialysis were enrolled into the zzso 

Increased bone turnover and abnormal zzso were prevalent zzso and zzso zzso bone volume was normal or increased in all zzso zzso zzso for different skeletal diagnoses were established by zzso and zzso tree zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso less than 400 zzso in combination with alkaline zzso values less than 400 zzso provided the highest correct prediction rate for patients with both normal bone turnover and normal zzso zzso of zzso were higher and serum calcium levels were lower in patients with defective zzso irrespective of bone zzso 

Although no single zzso marker is able to provide a complete assessment of zzso zzso a combination of serum zzso alkaline zzso and zzso levels may lead to a more precise zzso assessment of turnover and zzso abnormalities in this zzso
