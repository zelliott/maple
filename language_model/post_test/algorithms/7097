In this paper, the authors present a formal zzso routine to characterize flaw severity in an zzso aluminum plate using Lamb zzso A rounded rectangle zzso hole is zzso introduced into the plate, and at each depth zzso Lamb wave signals are collected to study the changes in received signal due to mode conversion and scattering from the zzso Lamb wave zzso reconstructions are used to locate and size the flaw at each depth, however information about the severity of the flaw is obscured when the flaw becomes severe enough that scattering effects zzso The dynamic zzso fingerprint is then used to extract features from the raw Lamb wave signals, and supervised pattern zzso techniques are used to identify flaw severity with up to zzso accuracy for a training set and up to zzso accuracy on a series of validation data sets extracted from independent plate zzso
