The relative contributions of transmission and zzso of zzso infection to zzso cases observed clinically has been reported in many situations, but always with some zzso zzso data from zzso organisms obtained from patients have been used as the basis for zzso distinctions between circulating zzso zzso and zzso infections zzso zzso zzso methods previously applied to the analysis of such data are known to provide biased estimates of the proportion of zzso zzso The zzso distribution, which generates probabilities of observing clusters of a given size as realized clusters of all possible sizes, is analyzed in this paper to yield a formal zzso for zzso cluster zzso zzso aspects of zzso stability, bias, and zzso are zzso This formal zzso is seen to be stable with respect to the zzso interesting properties of the cluster size distribution (the number of clusters and the number of zzso though it does not yield satisfactory estimates of the number of clusters of larger zzso The problem that even complete coverage of zzso in a practical sampling frame, will only provide a partial view of the actual transmission network remains to be zzso
