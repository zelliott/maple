zzso for automated identification and building of zzso zzso in zzso maps are zzso An error model of the geometrical features of the molecular structure of a zzso based on a lattice distribution of zzso parameters is obtained via simulation and is used for the construction of an approximate likelihood scoring zzso This scoring function combined with a zzso search technique provides a flexible zzso scheme and its application shows promising initial zzso Several zzso with sizes ranging from 9 to 44 zzso atoms have been identified in various X-ray structures and built in an automatic way using a minimal amount of prior zzso zzso
