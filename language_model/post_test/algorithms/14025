Recently, shape matching in three dimensions zzso has been gaining importance in a wide variety of fields such as computer graphics, computer vision, medicine, and biology, with applications such as object recognition, medical diagnosis, and quantitative zzso analysis of biological zzso Automatic shape matching techniques developed in the field of computer graphics handle object surfaces, but ignore zzso of inner zzso In biology and medical imaging, zzso zzso obtained by zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imagery zzso and zzso zzso are important to determine point zzso Nevertheless, most biomedical volume matching techniques require human zzso and automatic methods assume matched objects to have very similar shapes so as to avoid zzso explosions of zzso This article is aimed at decreasing the gap between the two zzso The proposed method automatically finds dense point zzso between two zzso zzso zzso finds a correspondent in the second volume for every zzso in the first volume, based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso are introduced to reduce zzso load and handle highly plastic zzso We calculate the average shape of a set of similar objects and give a measure of plasticity to compare zzso zzso results can also be used to generate intermediate volumes for zzso We use various data to validate the effectiveness of our method: we calculate the average shape and plasticity of a set of fly brain cells, and we also match a human skull and an orangutan zzso
