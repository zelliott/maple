We measured changes in zzso thickness to estimate zzso zzso The zzso thickness on magnetic resonance imaging with contrast enhancement was compared in a zzso patient before and after shunt zzso zzso thickness also was measured directly using a zzso at zzso for zzso clipping in 11 zzso A small ultrasound probe (5 zzso was held against the zzso scalp of 10 volunteers to extract convoluted interference echoes from the zzso mater using a zzso system for fast zzso zzso analysis and maximum zzso zzso The degree of zzso pressure in the zzso position was varied in the volunteers with transient neck zzso The enhanced zzso thickness of the patient with zzso barely zzso before shunt operation, increased after zzso zzso thickness zzso obtained zzso in the zzso position were similar to direct zzso of zzso Changes in zzso thickness on zzso reflect changes in zzso zzso
