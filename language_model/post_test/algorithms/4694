zzso zzso of images has been considered an important intermediate processing task to extract semantic meaning from zzso We propose an integrated approach for image zzso based on a zzso zzso model combined with coarse shape information and robust zzso zzso The sensitivity of zzso solutions to image variations is measured by image zzso Shape information is included in the zzso process to guide ambiguous groupings of color and texture zzso Shape and zzso grouping information is combined into a semantic likelihood map in the framework of zzso zzso Experimental evidence shows that zzso meaningful segments are zzso even when image data alone gives rise to ambiguous zzso
