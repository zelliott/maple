In this paper, we propose a communication model of evolution and investigate its zzso zzso The process of evolution is modeled as the zzso of information over a protein communication channel, where the transmitted message is the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso We zzso the capacity and the rate distortion functions of the protein communication system for the three zzso of life: zzso zzso and zzso The zzso between the transmission rate and the distortion in noisy protein communication channels is zzso As expected, comparison between the optimal transmission rate and the channel capacity indicates that the biological zzso does not reach the Shannon optimal zzso However, the relationship between the channel capacity and rate distortion achieved for different biological zzso provides tremendous insight into the dynamics of the evolutionary processes of the three zzso of zzso We rely on these results to provide a model of zzso sequence evolution based on the two major evolutionary driving zzso zzso and unequal zzso
