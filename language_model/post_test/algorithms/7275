The reliable zzso of fiber orientation zzso from zzso magnetic resonance imaging is an important processing step for revealing structural connectivity in the human zzso zzso orientation zzso are usually represented in zzso harmonic zzso domain, but many modern spatial zzso techniques were not yet formulated in zzso such that they cannot benefit from the well known zzso In this article we propose a novel zzso of the zzso enhancement zzso zzso zzso which enables to implement a variety of processing steps in zzso
