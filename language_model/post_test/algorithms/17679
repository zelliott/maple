The objectives of this study were to generate a data set of zzso barrier zzso zzso values for zzso compounds and to develop a zzso model to predict zzso zzso from zzso The zzso zzso expressed as zzso area product zzso zzso as zzso was determined for 28 structurally diverse zzso compounds using the in zzso rat brain zzso zzso A linear model containing three zzso zzso van der zzso surface area of basic zzso and polar surface area, was developed based on 23 compounds in our data set, where the penetration across the zzso was assumed to occur primarily by passive zzso The correlation zzso zzso and standard zzso zzso of the zzso zzso against the observed are zzso and zzso zzso If an zzso was removed from the training data set, the zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso This new model was tested in two literature data sets, resulting in an zzso of zzso to zzso and a zzso of zzso to zzso For comparison, four literature models, zzso zzso zzso zzso and linear free energy relationship, were tested using the set of 23 compounds primarily crossing the zzso by passive zzso resulting in an zzso of zzso to zzso and a zzso of zzso to zzso In zzso we have generated the largest zzso data set and developed a robust zzso model that can zzso predict zzso zzso This model may be used in a drug discovery setting to predict the zzso zzso of new chemical zzso
