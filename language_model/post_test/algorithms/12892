We propose a scheme for achieving zzso coherent zzso zzso scattering zzso zzso images with zzso zzso This approach adds structured zzso to the zzso CARS zzso zzso Physics Letters 84, zzso zzso By capturing a number of images at different zzso of the standing wave pattern, an image with up to three times the resolution of the original can be zzso We develop a theoretical treatment of this system and perform zzso simulations for a typical CARS system, which indicate that resolutions around 120 zzso are zzso with the present zzso As an imaging system, this method combines the advantages of zzso resolution, zzso contrast generation, and a wide field of zzso
