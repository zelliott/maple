To evaluate the effect of zzso detection zzso system on observer performance in the detection of zzso lung zzso on chest zzso 

Two hundred chest zzso zzso normal and 100 abnormal with zzso solitary lung zzso were zzso With CT and zzso confirmation serving as a reference, the mean zzso size was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Five chest zzso and five zzso residents independently interpreted both the original zzso and zzso output images using the sequential testing zzso The performances of the observers for the detection of zzso zzso with and without zzso were compared using the zzso zzso receiver operating characteristic zzso 

zzso zzso were detected by the zzso system with a false positive rate of zzso zzso per zzso The detection of zzso lung zzso significantly increased from zzso to zzso for a group of observers, excluding one first-year resident zzso zzso zzso When lowering the confidence score was not allowed, the average figure of merit also increased from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso for all observers after a zzso zzso On average, the sensitivities with and without zzso were zzso and zzso zzso the false positive rates per case with and without zzso were zzso and zzso zzso The number of additional zzso detected following true positive zzso marks ranged from zero to seven for the various zzso 

The zzso system may help improve observer performance in detecting zzso lung zzso on chest zzso and contribute to a decrease in missed lung zzso
