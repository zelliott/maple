The feasibility of determining left zzso zzso ejection fraction zzso from zzso zzso gated zzso zzso is well zzso To improve precision of zzso rules used by observers in processing zzso were zzso for zzso 

zzso centers were estimated from activity zzso of zzso images exceeding 50% of maximum zzso End zzso and end zzso were defined by zzso maximum count zzso zzso borders were generated by fitting maximum locations with zzso two-dimensional zzso searching inward to predetermined zzso and reconciling zzso with valve plane zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso yielded r zzso zzso versus equilibrium gated blood pool in 75 patients and r zzso zzso versus gated first pass in 65 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was r zzso zzso and zzso automatic versus manual linear correlation was r zzso zzso A zzso of 25 studies was analyzed by six independent observers, for whom zzso agreement with the core laboratory ranged from r zzso zzso to r zzso zzso zzso observers judged it necessary to alter zzso or zzso frames in zzso of patients, zzso borders in zzso and zzso centers in zzso 

zzso of automated zzso zzso zzso correlated well with those of manual zzso and gated zzso and equilibrium blood pool values and were highly zzso
