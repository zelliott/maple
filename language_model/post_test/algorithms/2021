The markedly increased degrees of freedom introduced by parallel zzso transmission presents both opportunities and challenges for specific zzso rate zzso zzso On one hand they enable zzso tailoring and zzso reduction while zzso zzso profile zzso On other hand they increase the complexity of zzso behavior and the risk of inadvertently zzso zzso by improper design or zzso of zzso zzso The substantial zzso of zzso in high field magnetic resonance can be a compounding zzso Building upon a linear system concept and a zzso scheme involving a finite number of in zzso zzso this work establishes a clinically zzso method for characterizing global zzso behavior as well as zzso power zzso The method offers a unique capability of zzso for any zzso the zzso and power consequences that are specific to the subject to be scanned and the zzso zzso The method was validated in simulation and experimental studies, showing promise as the foundation to a prospective paradigm where power and zzso are not only monitored but, through zzso zzso zzso zzso
