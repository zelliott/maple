This paper describes the response to selection for optimal zzso in networks of zzso zzso The networks considered are zzso in the sense that they receive an input and produce an zzso The task that the nets are selected to solve is to maximize the mean zzso attained in a fixed number of zzso in zzso that vary in their zzso This is analogous to an zzso with a fixed time budget that attempts to maximize its food intake in an environment where the food concentration varies in zzso The results suggest that it is possible to select simple zzso nets to respond zzso to their zzso zzso on simple environments produces a near zzso zzso The response to complex environments is zzso The results suggest that nets selected on complex environments perform better on environments of different degrees of complexity than those selected on simple zzso Although nets with larger numbers of zzso do not respond markedly better to selection, the zzso in the response to selection is zzso It appears to be difficult to predict the movements of nets from a study of the zzso of net with sensory units clamped at particular zzso The cycle of bits in clamped nets can vary greatly with small changes in the zzso to the zzso The actual movement of nets does not, however, reflect this zzso It is concluded that networks of zzso zzso may be useful models with which to investigate different genetic zzso Furthermore, zzso in such systems may give insights into the nature of zzso and zzso
