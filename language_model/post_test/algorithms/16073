The zzso flow in an zzso realistic zzso human carotid zzso was simulated zzso zzso and mass flow zzso in the carotid arteries were obtained from an individual subject using zzso zzso The geometry of the zzso model was reconstructed from magnetic resonance zzso zzso of zzso wall zzso stress, contours of zzso in the flow field as well as wall movement and zzso stress on the zzso wall are all zzso zzso with previous findings from zzso geometry models, flow in the carotid zzso is dominated by a strong zzso flow accompanied by a single secondary vortex zzso This type of flow is induced primarily by the asymmetry and zzso of the in zzso zzso zzso simulations have been carried out under the rigid wall assumption and for the zzso wall, zzso zzso of the results demonstrates the quantitative influence of the vessel wall zzso Generally there is a reduction in the magnitude of wall zzso stress, with its degree depending on location and phase of the cardiac zzso The region of slow or reversed flow was greater, in both spatial and zzso terms in the zzso model, but the global characteristics of the flow and stress patterns remain zzso The analysis of mechanical stresses on the vessel surface shows a complicated stress zzso Stress concentration occurs at both the anterior and zzso aspects of the zzso internal zzso These are also regions of low wall zzso zzso The comparison of zzso and measured wall movement generally shows good zzso
