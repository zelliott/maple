The zzso zzso inverse problem is zzso and usually solved by zzso zzso These zzso methods, such as the zzso method, are often based on the zzso data and constraint zzso However, zzso methods inherently provide smoothed inverse solutions that are sensitive to measurement zzso and also lack the capability of zzso and distinguishing multiple zzso cardiac electrical zzso This paper presents alternative zzso schemes employing the zzso data term for the reconstruction of zzso zzso zzso from measured body surface zzso zzso During zzso zzso the zzso zzso norm zzso was applied to solve the zzso schemes, and measurement noises were considered in the zzso zzso The proposed zzso data zzso zzso schemes (with zzso and zzso penalty terms of the normal zzso constraint zzso as zzso and zzso were compared with the zzso data terms zzso with zzso and normal zzso constraints, zzso as zzso and zzso and the total variation method zzso as zzso The studies demonstrated that, with averaged measurement noise, the inverse solutions provided by the zzso and zzso zzso have less relative error zzso However, when larger noise occurred in some zzso (for example, signal lost during zzso the zzso and zzso methods can obtain more accurate zzso in a robust zzso Therefore the zzso data zzso solutions are generally less zzso by measurement noises, suggesting that the new zzso scheme is promising for providing practical zzso inverse zzso
