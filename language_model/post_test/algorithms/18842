zzso association can frequently involve significant backbone zzso changes of the protein zzso A zzso rapid method has been developed that allows to approximately account for global zzso changes during systematic zzso zzso starting from many thousands of start zzso The approach employs zzso collective degrees of freedom as additional variables during zzso zzso zzso The global collective degrees of freedom are obtained from normal mode analysis using a zzso network model for the zzso zzso zzso searches were performed on 10 test systems that differed in the degree of zzso change associated with complex formation and in the degree of overlap between observed zzso changes and zzso flexible degrees of zzso The results indicate that in case of zzso searches that minimize the influence of local side chain zzso changes inclusion of global flexibility can significantly improve the agreement of the zzso zzso solutions with the corresponding experimental zzso For zzso of zzso protein partners in several cases an improved ranking of near native zzso solutions was zzso This was achieved at a very modest ( approximately zzso increase of zzso demands compared to rigid zzso For several test cases the number of zzso solutions close to experiment was also significantly enhanced upon inclusion of soft collective degrees of zzso This result indicates that inclusion of global flexibility can facilitate in zzso zzso association such that a greater number of different start zzso results in favorable complex zzso
