The function of automatic zzso devices is difficult to investigate using clinical examinations due to the high zzso of breathing zzso With a flow zzso however, identical breathing patterns can be reproduced so that comparative studies on the zzso of pressure of zzso devices are zzso Because the zzso of zzso devices based on the experience of users can be modified without much effort, also previously investigated devices should regularly be reviewed with regard to zzso zzso 

Had changes occurred in the zzso of 3 selected zzso to the previously published benchmark zzso Do the current versions of these investigated devices differentiate between open and closed zzso 

With a zzso respiratory zzso zzso breathing patterns and, with the help of a zzso zzso zzso of the upper respiratory tract were zzso Three different zzso devices were subjected to a bench test with and without feedback zzso zzso 

Open zzso the 3 devices showed marked differences in the rate of pressure rise but did not differ from the earlier published zzso From an initial pressure of 4 zzso the pressure increased to 10 zzso after a different number of zzso zzso repetitive zzso Only one device differentiated between closed and open zzso Closed zzso due to the pressure increase, the flow generator simulated reduced obstruction of the upper airways zzso changed to zzso zzso changed to zzso but different patterns of pressure regulation could still be zzso 

By applying zzso the zzso of zzso devices can regularly be reviewed to detect changes in the zzso The differentiation between open and closed zzso should be improved in several zzso zzso
