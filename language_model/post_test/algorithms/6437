Several software packages are commercially available for zzso of left zzso ejection fraction zzso and volumes from zzso gated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso all of which display a high zzso However, their accuracy has been questioned in patients with a small zzso This study aimed to evaluate the performances of different software and the influence of modifications in acquisition or reconstruction parameters on zzso and volume zzso depending on the heart zzso 

In 31 patients referred for gated zzso zzso and zzso zzso acquisitions were zzso zzso After reconstruction by filtered zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso order zzso zzso and volumes were zzso with different software zzso versions of zzso zzso zzso zzso the Emory zzso zzso zzso and the Stanford University zzso Medical School zzso and processing zzso Depending upon their zzso volume zzso patients were classified into two groups: group I zzso zzso zzso and group II zzso zzso zzso zzso between the different software packages and the influence of zzso size and sharpness of the filter on zzso and volumes were evaluated in both zzso 

In group I, the correlation zzso between the different methods ranged from zzso to zzso except for zzso zzso and were slightly lower for volumes than for zzso Mean differences between the methods were not zzso except for zzso with which zzso values were systematically higher by more than zzso Changes in zzso size had no significant influence on zzso or zzso On the other hand, a sharper filter was associated with significantly larger volume values though this did not usually result in significant changes in zzso In group II, many patients had an zzso in the higher zzso The correlation zzso between the different methods ranged between zzso and zzso except for zzso zzso and were slightly worse for volumes than for zzso zzso In contrast to group I, however, zzso zzso was quite large and most mean zzso differences were zzso zzso was systematically highest with zzso and lowest with zzso With zzso changes in zzso size from zzso to zzso were associated with significantly larger volumes as well as lower zzso zzso zzso the filter zzso frequency had the same zzso With zzso a larger zzso was associated with larger zzso volumes and smaller zzso resulting in a highly significant increase in zzso zzso the filter zzso on the other hand, had no influence on zzso though the measured volumes were significantly zzso 

In patients with a zzso heart, zzso and volume estimates zzso from different commercially available software packages for quantitative gated zzso are well zzso zzso and volumes are only slightly sensitive to changes in zzso zzso zzso by contrast, is associated with significant changes in volumes but usually not in zzso zzso However, zzso to the specific characteristics of each algorithm, software should not be zzso for follow-up in an individual zzso In small hearts, on the other hand, both the used software and the zzso size or smoothing significantly influence the results of quantitative gated zzso zzso values in the higher range are frequently observed with all the studied software except for zzso A larger zzso or a sharper filter could be suggested to enhance the accuracy of most commercial software, more particularly in patients with a small zzso
