Regional zzso function assessment is essential for diagnosis and evaluation of heart zzso The purpose of this study was to enhance the spatial resolution of a zzso tracking zzso approach and enable zzso analysis of the zzso Following validation with zzso and mechanical zzso versus imposed values, zzso zzso were obtained from 50 zzso The zzso were zzso by a zzso tracking commercial program, and the zzso zzso were processed by a three-dimensional zzso zzso program, instead of the built-in smoothing process of the commercial zzso zzso phantom zzso yielded rotation errors of zzso zzso and zzso for zzso middle, and outer zzso zzso Analysis of a zzso mechanical phantom yielded strain errors of zzso zzso and zzso for the three zzso zzso analysis showed agreement between the commercial and enhanced zzso Thus, zzso analysis is feasible while using zzso even on small animals such as zzso
