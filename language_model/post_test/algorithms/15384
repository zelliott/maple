As one of the most important trace elements within an zzso zinc has been shown to be involved in numerous biological processes and closely implicated in various zzso The zinc zzso is important for proteins to perform their functional zzso To provide in-depth functional zzso of zzso zzso an initial but crucial step is the accurate recognition of zzso zzso zzso by the biological importance of zzso we propose a new method called zzso to predict zzso sites from protein zzso zzso is a hybrid method that can accurately predict zzso sites from protein zzso It zzso the zzso of three different types of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Four types of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso could be predicted using zzso It achieved a high zzso zzso Under zzso zzso of zzso and a precision of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso recall for the zzso on the zzso zzso zzso When tested on an independent zzso containing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso it achieved about zzso higher zzso in comparison to two other zzso zzso Moreover, zzso could also identify the zzso relationships zzso of the predicted zzso sites bound to the same zinc zzso which makes it a useful tool for providing in-depth zzso site zzso
