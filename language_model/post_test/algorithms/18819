Whole zzso zzso zzso at a user specified resolution are becoming a versatile tool in zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso is a powerful application of these zzso Although there is an increasing number of methods for analyzing zzso data, perhaps the most simple and commonly used one, due to its zzso efficiency, is testing with a moving average zzso Current moving average methods assume zzso of the zzso within an zzso They are not tailored to deal with the issues due to array designs such as overlapping zzso that result in correlated zzso We investigate the correlation structure of data from such zzso and propose an extension of the moving average testing via a robust and rapid method called zzso We illustrate the pitfalls of ignoring the correlation structure in simulations and a case zzso Our approach is implemented as an R package called zzso and can be used with any zzso array zzso
