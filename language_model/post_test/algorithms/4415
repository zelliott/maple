zzso research has been carried out in recent years to establish relationships between crashes and traffic flow, geometric infrastructure characteristics and environmental factors for zzso rural zzso zzso models focused on zzso rural roads, however, have rarely been zzso In addition, most research has paid but little attention to the safety effects of variables such as stopping sight distance and pavement surface zzso Moreover, the statistical approaches have generally included zzso and zzso zzso zzso models, whilst zzso zzso zzso model has been used to a lesser zzso Finally, as far as the authors are aware, prediction models involving all the zzso factors have still not been developed in Italy for zzso roads, such as zzso Thus, in this paper zzso models for a zzso zzso Italian zzso were set up on the basis of accident data observed during a zzso monitoring period extending between 1999 and zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso models, applied separately to zzso and curves, were used to model the frequency of accident zzso Model parameters were estimated by the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Test was applied to detect the significant variables to be included in the model zzso zzso was measured by means of both the explained fraction of total variation and the explained fraction of systematic zzso The zzso zzso zzso was also used to test the zzso of a zzso model throughout the range of each zzso The candidate set of explanatory variables was: length zzso zzso zzso annual average daily traffic zzso sight distance zzso side friction zzso zzso zzso slope zzso and the presence of a junction zzso Separate prediction models for total crashes and for fatal and injury crashes only were zzso For zzso it is shown that significant variables are zzso zzso and zzso whereas for zzso they are zzso zzso and zzso The effect of rain zzso was zzso on the basis of hourly zzso data and assumptions about drying zzso It is shown that a wet pavement significantly increases the number of zzso The models developed in this paper for Italian motorways appear to be useful for many applications such as the detection of critical factors, the zzso of accident reduction due to infrastructure and pavement improvement, and the predictions of accidents counts when comparing different design zzso Thus this research may represent a point of reference for engineers in adjusting or designing zzso zzso
