At least zzso of the world's tree species are threatened with extinction and pathogens are increasingly implicated in tree zzso zzso and threats to affiliates as a consequence of the loss or decline of their host trees is a poorly understood zzso Ash zzso is an emerging infectious disease causing severe zzso of common ash zzso zzso throughout zzso We zzso available empirical data on affiliate zzso zzso diversity zzso species and zzso zzso among 20 ash zzso infected host tree populations of zzso zzso on the island zzso in the Baltic Sea, zzso From this, we used structured scenario projections scaled with empirical data of ash zzso disease to generate zzso models for zzso local and regional zzso zzso zzso Average zzso probabilities zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso occurring on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when considering zzso persistence on all tree zzso zzso was strongly linked to local disease zzso levels and generally increasing with zzso host specificity to zzso zzso and decreasing population zzso zzso reduced affiliate community zzso with significant local reductions in species richness and shifts in zzso species zzso zzso were projected to become locally zzso before their zzso illuminating the need to also consider host tree zzso zzso managed open wooded zzso had the highest zzso of ash zzso disease and significantly higher proportions of affiliate species projected to go zzso compared with zzso closed forests and semi-open grazed zzso Most zzso species were not previously zzso which suggest that tree zzso cause many unforeseen threats to zzso Our analysis shows that epidemic tree deaths represent an zzso mostly zzso threat to zzso affiliate communities in forested zzso Current conservation and management strategies must account for secondary zzso associated with epidemic tree zzso
