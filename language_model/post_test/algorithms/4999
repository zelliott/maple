We derive the operating characteristics of three-dimensional zzso testing zzso for case identification in the presence of testing zzso The operating characteristics investigated include efficiency zzso expected number of tests per zzso and error rates zzso sensitivity, zzso positive, and negative zzso zzso The methods are illustrated by comparing the proposed zzso with previously studied zzso and two-dimensional array zzso for detecting recent zzso infections in North zzso Our results indicate that three-dimensional zzso zzso can be more efficient and accurate than previously proposed zzso in settings with test error and low zzso
