The zzso pattern of zzso hormone zzso was determined in turkey zzso during a forced zzso induced by water (1 zzso and feed (5 zzso restriction and switching the zzso from 14 h light zzso h dark zzso zzso to zzso zzso the 1st d of feed and water zzso zzso blood samples were collected from six zzso zzso 10 zzso for 6 zzso then every 4 zzso for 2 zzso at four different times during the zzso The first serial bleeding was done at the end of egg laying and 1 d before forced zzso was zzso the second 7 d after start of forced zzso and zzso zzso the third after 49 d of zzso lighting, and the fourth after 56 d of zzso lighting and 2 day after returning the zzso to zzso zzso zzso production stopped by 5 d after initiation of forced zzso zzso production zzso by 34 d zzso 22 to 34 zzso after returning to zzso zzso zzso and baseline concentration of zzso were low at the end of egg laying and 7 d after the start of forced zzso Number and zzso of zzso of zzso were also low at these zzso zzso and baseline zzso of zzso remained low after 49 d of zzso lighting, with no change in number of zzso zzso per 8 zzso However, the zzso of zzso zzso was increased at this time in comparison to just after initiation of forced zzso At 2 d after switching to zzso lighting, increases in overall, zzso and number of zzso of zzso were zzso Peak zzso did not change 2 d after switching to the zzso zzso It was concluded that in turkey zzso at the end of a relatively long laying period, baseline zzso is low and does not decrease during a forced zzso and subsequent zzso zzso Relatively large increases in circulating zzso are induced by exposing the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso and this increase was associated with an increase in overall and baseline zzso zzso and zzso pulse zzso
