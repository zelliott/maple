A method for determination of the zzso of the procedure for zzso zzso steamed was proposed based on zzso zzso combination with continuous zzso transform and kernel independent component analysis zzso In the proposed method, the raw zzso zzso of the zzso samples during steamed procedure were zzso The raw zzso spectral data were zzso zzso by zzso for elimination of the noise signal and enrichment of the spectral resolution, then the independent components zzso were estimated from the mixed zzso zzso zzso The results show that the zzso are chemical significance with their relative zzso gradually decreasing or increasing during the first steamed period, and the zzso of the steamed procedure can be determined by inspection of the relative concentration profiles, at which the zzso should be approached maximum or zzso Furthermore, the estimated zzso of zzso samples from different areas or with different grades are similar, and the relative concentration of the similar zzso in different groups are increasing or decreasing before the first 14 zzso and nearly steady or some decreasing after 16 zzso Based on the variations of the relative concentration profiles of the zzso the zzso of the steamed procedure can be determined as 15 zzso while that determined by sensory analysis is zzso zzso The proposed zzso method can avoid the higher zzso of the zzso that were determined by sensory zzso It provides an alternative approach for determination of the zzso of the procedure for processing traditional Chinese medicine zzso
