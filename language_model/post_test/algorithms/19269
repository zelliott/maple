Computer zzso zzso scanners with an increasing number of detector rows offer the potential of shorter scanning zzso Nevertheless, the reconstruction problem becomes more challenging, since cone beam artifacts are likely to zzso Here, we consider zzso cardiac zzso We analyze how a relationship can be established between exact reconstruction zzso and the demand to perform a cardiac zzso zzso the redundancies requires the consideration of all kinds of zzso zzso For the reconstruction zzso proposed here, we separate the data into two zzso The first part contains contributions of zzso planes, which are measured with a large number of zzso The second part contains the remaining zzso As it turns out, the second part contributes rather to the zzso contents of zzso zzso zzso we propose to perform a gated zzso only for the first part, while the second part is zzso in an zzso zzso Data from the complete source trajectory are employed in the reconstruction process in contrary to conventional zzso cardiac reconstruction zzso Moreover, all different types of zzso planes are taken into account in the zzso though an zzso cardiac gating is zzso The reconstruction results, which we present for clinical and simulated data, demonstrate the high potential of zzso for zzso cardiac CT with large cone angle zzso
