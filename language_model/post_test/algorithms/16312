The radiation bystander effect is an important component of the overall biological response of zzso and organisms to zzso radiation, but the signaling mechanisms between zzso and zzso bystander cells are not fully zzso In this study, we measured a zzso of gene expression after zzso zzso and applied the Feature Based zzso around zzso Algorithm zzso a new zzso method suitable for sparse time series, to identify signaling zzso that act in concert in the response to direct zzso and bystander zzso We compared our results with those of an alternate zzso method, Short Time series zzso Miner zzso 

While zzso evaluations of both zzso results were similar, zzso provided more biological zzso After zzso gene clusters were enriched for signal zzso cell zzso death and zzso zzso but only zzso separated clusters by zzso In bystanders, gene clusters were enriched for cell zzso signal zzso and inflammation zzso but biological functions did not separate as clearly with either zzso method as they did in zzso zzso Network analysis confirmed zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene clusters in zzso and bystander cells and suggested novel regulators, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which could zzso coordinate gene expression after zzso 

In this study, we have shown that a new time series zzso method, zzso can provide new leads to the mechanisms regulating the dynamic cellular response to zzso The findings zzso zzso control of gene expression in addition to zzso factor zzso
