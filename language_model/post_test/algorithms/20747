The development of a large zzso fraction in zzso DNA and the phenomenon of the code bloat in the field of evolutionary zzso show a striking zzso This seems to suggest that (in the presence of mechanisms of code zzso the evolution of a complex code cannot be attained without maintaining a large inactive zzso To test this hypothesis we performed computer simulations of an evolutionary toy model for Turing machines, studying the relations among fitness and coding versus zzso ratio while varying zzso and code growth zzso The results suggest that, in our model, having a large zzso of zzso states constitutes a great zzso zzso evolutionary zzso
