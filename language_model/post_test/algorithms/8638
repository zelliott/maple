The authors assess the functional zzso of a mathematical model of transport of labeled zzso in the zzso Some additions to and modifications of the model were zzso They made it possible to get 4 zzso important zzso the rate of zzso zzso from the vascular bed, the rate zzso zzso volume, and the rate of zzso zzso by the zzso Besides, the authors presented the results of a computerized experiment for the determination of maintenance characteristics of a program developed for zzso The iteration zzso for zzso identification based on a method of zzso of minimized function, was used in the zzso They also formulated recommendations for a choice of arbitrary components of a calculation procedure and the use of a method of barrier functions, developed as a result of prolonged maintenance of the zzso
