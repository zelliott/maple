DNA error correcting codes over the edit metric consist of zzso markers for sequencing projects that are tolerant of sequencing zzso When a genetic library has multiple sources for its zzso use of embedded markers permit tracking of sequence zzso This study compares different methods for zzso DNA error correcting zzso A new zzso technique called the salmon zzso is introduced and used to improve the size of best known codes in five difficult cases of the problem, including the most studied zzso length six, distance three zzso An updated table of the best known code sizes with 36 improved values, resulting from three different zzso is zzso zzso background results for the problem from multiple sources are zzso A discussion of practical details that arise in application, including biological design and zzso is also given in this zzso
