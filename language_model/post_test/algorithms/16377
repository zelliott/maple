zzso recognition plays a fundamental role in all biological zzso and that is why great efforts have been made to understand and predict zzso zzso Finding a zzso that can potentially bind to a target protein is particularly essential in drug discovery and still remains an expensive and time-consuming zzso In zzso tools are frequently used to screen molecular libraries to identify new lead compounds, and if protein structure is known, various zzso zzso programs can be zzso The aim of zzso procedure is to predict correct poses of zzso in the binding site of the protein as well as to score them according to the strength of interaction in a reasonable time zzso The purpose of our studies was to present the novel consensus approach to predict both zzso complex structure and its corresponding binding zzso Our method used as the input the results from seven zzso programs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are widely used for zzso of zzso We evaluated it on the extensive benchmark zzso of zzso zzso pairs from refined zzso database for which the structural and affinity data was zzso We compared independently its ability of proper scoring and posing to the previously proposed zzso In most cases, our method is able to dock properly approximately zzso of pairs more than zzso methods on average, and over zzso of pairs more than the best single zzso The zzso value of the predicted complex zzso versus its native one is reduced by a factor of zzso zzso Finally, we were able to increase the zzso correlation of the predicted binding affinity in comparison with the experimental value up to zzso
