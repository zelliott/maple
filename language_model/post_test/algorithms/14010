An efficient method was developed for zzso drug screening in urine by liquid zzso coupled with zzso zzso zzso mass zzso The method relies on a large target database of exact zzso masses representing the zzso zzso of reference drugs and their zzso Mass spectral identification is based on matching measured accurate mass and zzso pattern zzso of a sample component with those in the zzso Data zzso software was developed for automated reporting of findings in an easily zzso zzso The mean and median of zzso for zzso findings were zzso and zzso zzso The mean and median of mass error absolute values for zzso findings were zzso and zzso zzso respectively, corresponding to zzso and zzso zzso For routine screening practice, a zzso tolerance of zzso and a mass tolerance of 10 zzso were zzso Ion abundance differences from urine extracts did not affect the accuracy of the automatically acquired zzso or mass zzso The results show that zzso pattern matching by zzso is a powerful means of identification in addition to accurate mass zzso
