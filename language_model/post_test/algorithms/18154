We present a novel approach for efficient path planning and navigation of multiple virtual agents in complex dynamic zzso We introduce a new data structure, zzso zzso zzso zzso which is constructed using zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso is used to perform route planning and proximity zzso for each agent in real zzso Moreover, we use the path information and proximity relationships for local dynamics zzso of each agent by extending a social force model zzso We zzso the zzso using graphics hardware and present zzso techniques to accelerate the zzso We also address zzso issues and present techniques to improve the accuracy of our zzso Our zzso is used for real-time zzso planning in zzso terrain exploration and crowd simulation scenarios consisting of hundreds of moving agents, each with a distinct zzso
