zzso which result from lens zzso are the leading cause of zzso zzso Current methods for determining the severity of zzso are based on manual assessments that may be weakened by zzso In this work, we propose a system to automatically grade the severity of nuclear zzso from zzso zzso We introduce a new feature for cataract grading together with a group zzso constraint for linear regression, which performs feature selection, zzso selection and zzso model training zzso In experiments on a large database of zzso images, our system zzso the state-of-the-art by yielding with respect to clinical grading a mean absolute error zzso of zzso a zzso exact integral agreement ratio zzso a zzso decimal grading error zzso or zzso zzso zzso and a zzso decimal grading error zzso or zzso zzso zzso Through a more objective grading of zzso using our proposed system, there is potential for better clinical management of the zzso
