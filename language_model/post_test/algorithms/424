A computer simulation has been performed to study the influence of the pulse pressure variation on the zzso compliance readings in regard to different calculation techniques and zzso wall elastic zzso We applied the zzso and zzso zzso calculation techniques to the model of the pressure zzso zzso zzso area relationship of different zzso The simulated pulse pressure increase resulted in an essential reduction of the zzso compliance in its near maximum region, and in an increase or no change outside this zzso In the case of the relationship of a lower zzso the zzso were zzso
