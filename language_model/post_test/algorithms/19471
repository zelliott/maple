Several zzso methods have been proposed recently, which use the information generated by recent zzso of populations from historically distinct geographic zzso These methods include both classic likelihood and zzso zzso In this study we directly maximize the likelihood function from the hidden zzso Model for zzso mapping using the zzso algorithm, allowing for uncertainty in model zzso such as the zzso zzso in the parental zzso We determined the zzso of the proposed method by examining the ancestral zzso frequency estimate and individual zzso specific ancestry when the data were generated by different population zzso models and no learning sample was zzso The proposed method zzso a widely used zzso zzso strategy for data generated from various population zzso zzso The zzso information content for ancestry was derived based on the map provided by Smith et zzso zzso and the associated statistical power was zzso We examined the distribution of zzso zzso across the zzso for both real and simulated data and established a threshold for zzso wide significance zzso to zzso mapping zzso The software zzso for performing zzso mapping is available from zzso
