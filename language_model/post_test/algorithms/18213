To integrate imaging performance zzso specifically sensitivity and zzso of magnetic resonance zzso zzso and digital zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso planning and zzso 

Images of 10 patients with zzso located in critical brain areas were analyzed in this retrospective planning zzso The image findings were first used to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of zzso and zzso Instead of accepting the imaging observation as a zzso zzso or zzso mapping of zzso location, our alternative is to translate the image into an zzso probability distribution map by incorporating zzso sensitivity and zzso and to use this map as a basis for planning and zzso Three sets of zzso plans, targeting the zzso and zzso positive zzso zzso positive, and zzso positive were zzso for best zzso The zzso obliteration rate zzso and brain complication rate served as zzso for plan zzso 

In our zzso study, the zzso and sensitivities of zzso and zzso were estimated to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The positive overlap of zzso and zzso accounted for zzso zzso zzso of the estimated true zzso zzso Compared with plans targeting zzso and zzso zzso plans targeting zzso or zzso improved zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso while also increasing the complication rate by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The impact of zzso quality should be zzso and incorporated in zzso zzso planning and evaluation to facilitate clinical decision zzso
