In this paper, we propose an zzso for disparity zzso from disparity energy zzso that seeks to maintain simplicity and biological zzso while also being based upon a zzso that enables us to interpret the model zzso zzso We use the zzso factor from statistical hypothesis testing to show that, in contradiction to the implicit assumption of many previously proposed biologically plausible models, a larger response from a disparity energy zzso does not imply more evidence for the hypothesis that the input disparity is close to the preferred disparity of the zzso However, we find that the zzso response can be interpreted as evidence, and that information from different orientation channels can be combined by pooling the zzso zzso Based on this insight, we propose an zzso for disparity zzso constructed out of biologically plausible zzso Our experimental results on real zzso show that the zzso zzso a previously proposed zzso zzso In addition, because its zzso can be interpreted zzso the model also enables us to identify zzso zzso or zzso with incorrect disparity zzso
