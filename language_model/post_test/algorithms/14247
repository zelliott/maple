zzso zzso zzso zzso has the potential to produce images during zzso zzso This might improve the accuracy of the zzso of zzso zzso in patients undergoing zzso assessment for zzso zzso It has already been shown that zzso increases by up to zzso during induced zzso zzso in animal models, using cortical or implanted zzso in controlled zzso The purpose of this study was to determine if zzso raw zzso changes and zzso images could be collected during zzso zzso in patients who were undergoing observation with zzso zzso zzso as part of evaluation prior to neurosurgery to zzso the region of brain causing the zzso A secondary purpose was to develop an objective method for processing and evaluating data, as zzso arose at unpredictable times from a noisy zzso zzso zzso zzso from 258 combinations were collected continuously using 32 zzso scalp zzso in 22 seizure episodes from 7 patients during their zzso assessment together with the standard zzso zzso A reliable method for defining the zzso baseline and recording zzso data and zzso images was developed, in which zzso and zzso could be acquired simultaneously after filtering of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso of several per cent over minutes were observed in the baseline between zzso During seizures, boundary zzso changes zzso with a standard zzso of zzso from the zzso No zzso changes with the expected time course of some tens of seconds and magnitude of about zzso could be reliably zzso This demonstrates that it is feasible to acquire zzso images in parallel with standard zzso during zzso assessment but, unfortunately, expected zzso changes on the scalp of about zzso are swamped by much larger movement and systematic zzso Nevertheless, zzso has the unique potential to provide invaluable zzso data for this purpose and may still become possible with improvements in zzso design and zzso
