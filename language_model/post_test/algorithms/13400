zzso zzso acids zzso contain a large number of zzso zzso elements that function in many types of zzso zzso These zzso elements are often characterized by zzso structures and/or zzso Although some classes are well known, given the wide range of zzso proteins in zzso it is likely that many new classes of zzso elements are yet to be zzso An approach to this is to use zzso methods that have the advantage of zzso zzso data, particularly comparative data on a large zzso In this study, a set of structural discovery zzso was applied followed by support zzso machine zzso zzso We trained a new zzso model zzso on a set of known structured zzso elements from zzso regions zzso and successfully distinguished these and groups of zzso elements not been strained on from control zzso and shuffled zzso The new method outperformed previous methods in zzso of zzso zzso zzso This model was then used to predict new elements from zzso zzso regions of human zzso zzso of these elements identified new classes of potential zzso zzso The model, training and testing sets and novel human predictions are available at: zzso
