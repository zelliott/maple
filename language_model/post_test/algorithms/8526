zzso was used to measure changes in length of muscle zzso in relaxed human zzso anterior and zzso during passively imposed changes in joint zzso Changes in the length of muscle zzso were compared to changes in the length of the whole zzso units calculated from joint angles and zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso underwent much smaller changes in length than their zzso zzso On average, muscle zzso in zzso anterior zzso 55 zzso 13 % zzso zzso zzso of the total change in zzso zzso This indicates nearly half of the total change in zzso length was taken up by stretch of zzso In zzso which has relatively long zzso only 27 zzso 9 % of the total change in zzso length was transmitted to muscle zzso Thus, the tendency for passive movement to be taken up by the zzso was greater for zzso than zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso For these muscles, the relatively large changes in zzso length across much of the zzso range of zzso lengths could not wholly be explained by zzso zzso changes in zzso zzso or stretch or contraction history of the zzso Our data confirm that when zzso are moved zzso length changes zzso by muscle zzso can be much less than changes in the distance between muscle origin and zzso This occurs because zzso undergo significant changes in zzso even at very low zzso
