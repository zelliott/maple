zzso patterns of genetic variation provide information central to many zzso zzso and conservation zzso This spatial zzso has traditionally been analyzed through summary statistics between pairs of zzso therefore missing the simultaneous influence of all zzso More recently, a network approach has been advocated to overcome these zzso This network approach has been applied to a few cases limited to a single species at a zzso The question remains whether similar patterns of spatial genetic variation and similar functional roles for specific patches are obtained for different zzso Here we study the networks of genetic variation of four Mediterranean woody plant species inhabiting the same habitat patches in a highly fragmented forest mosaic in Southern zzso Three of the four species show a similar pattern of genetic variation with zzso zzso or groups of patches holding genetically similar zzso These zzso can be thought of as the zzso zzso significant units or management zzso The importance of each patch for the cohesion of the entire network, though, is quite different across zzso This variation creates a tremendous challenge for the zzso of patches to conserve the genetic variation of zzso zzso
