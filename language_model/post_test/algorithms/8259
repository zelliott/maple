The aim of this paper is to present a novel fuzzy zzso framework for the automatic extraction of fuzzy rules from labeled zzso data, for the development of efficient medical diagnosis zzso 

The proposed methodology focuses on the accuracy and zzso of the generated knowledge that is produced by an zzso flexible and meaningful input zzso zzso The generated zzso fuzzy rule structure is composed by zzso multiple zzso fuzzy rules that considerably affect the model zzso 

The performance of the proposed method is tested on three medical pattern zzso problems and the obtained results are compared against other existing zzso It is shown that the proposed variable input zzso leads to a flexible decision making framework and fairly accurate results with a small number of rules and a simple, fast and robust training zzso
