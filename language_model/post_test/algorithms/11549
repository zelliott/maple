Application of a new method of zzso analysis to human, zzso recorded, zzso zzso zzso signals is zzso zzso zzso analysis involves zzso of zzso dimension (1 zzso zzso zzso 2) of zzso overlapping zzso epochs of zzso zzso zzso it is suggested that this technique offers significant operational advantages over use of zzso for zzso zzso requiring preliminary reconstruction of zzso data in phase zzso zzso analysis was found to reduce substantially the volume of zzso data, without loss of zzso important information concerning zzso propagation and evolution of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso events were correlated with relatively increased zzso rhythmic zzso events with relatively decreased zzso It is proposed that development of this method may lead to: zzso enhanced definition and zzso of initial zzso changes in the zzso presumed due to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of long periods of zzso zzso
