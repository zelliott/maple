zzso between fields of view zzso in a zzso scanner causes a zzso artifact when imaging extends beyond the CT zzso The purposes of this study were to evaluate the impact of this artifact on zzso of zzso activity zzso and to assess a zzso correction zzso 

Two zzso and five patients were used in this zzso In the first zzso three zzso zzso air, bone zzso were placed in a zzso cylinder containing zzso In the second phantom study, a chest phantom and a zzso bottle fitted with a bone insert were used to simulate a patient's torso and zzso Both zzso were zzso while positioned centrally zzso and at the edge of the CT zzso to induce zzso PET images were reconstructed using zzso maps from truncated and zzso CT zzso zzso of interest zzso drawn on the zzso simulated arm, and background water of the baseline truncated and zzso PET images were zzso In addition, zzso zzso of five patients truncated on CT images were reconstructed with and without correction and the maximum standard zzso values zzso of the zzso were zzso 

zzso artifact zzso as a rim of high activity concentration at the edge of the truncated CT image with an adjacent zzso region zzso The correction zzso zzso these zzso Phantom studies showed a maximum variation of zzso in the zzso background water image compared with the baseline zzso zzso concentration in the water insert was zzso higher while that of air and bone zzso was similar to zzso zzso zzso showed a consistent increase in the maximum zzso after zzso zzso
