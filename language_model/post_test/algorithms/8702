A computer program is presented which determines the secondary structure of linear zzso molecules by simulating a hypothetical process of zzso This process implies the concept of zzso zzso regions in zzso which locally trigger the zzso During the zzso the zzso is allowed to fold into zzso structures, unlike all other programs predicting zzso secondary zzso The simulation uses published, zzso determined free energy values for nearest zzso base pair zzso and loop regions, except for new zzso values for zzso larger than seven zzso The free energy value for a loop arising from zzso formation is set to a single, estimated value of zzso zzso Especially in the case of long zzso zzso our program appears superior to other secondary structure predicting programs described so far, as tests on zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and a number of plant viral zzso zzso In addition, zzso structures are often predicted zzso The program is written in mainframe zzso and is adapted to run on zzso compatible PCs, zzso ST and Macintosh personal zzso On an 8 zzso zzso standard PC without zzso using zzso zzso it folds a sequence of 700 zzso in one and a half zzso
