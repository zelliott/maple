Recent work has demonstrated the accuracy and operational viability of an zzso proposed by the authors that successfully registers 3-D ultrasound data with CT or zzso zzso The successful application of this method to zzso zzso however, depends critically on the quality of the acquired ultrasound zzso This gives rise to two questions concerning the zzso of the zzso in clinical zzso First, how can one guarantee zzso zzso ultrasound registration data with this zzso Second, can this approach work reliably in clinical practice, namely within the operating zzso To address both of these questions, we present an ultrasound data acquisition protocol that leads the user through the data acquisition process and also provides the criteria to adjust the relevant ultrasound zzso We also evaluated criteria for the visual inspection of the suitability of the ultrasound data for the registration zzso zzso for this evaluation show that these visual criteria can be used to decide preoperatively if an ultrasound registration will be successful in a zzso The zzso evaluation of the protocol showed that high-quality registrations can be achieved under realistic zzso This protocol and the visual inspection criteria, together with the ultrasound registration algorithm, provide a surgical team with a means of performing precise, cost-effective navigation in patients for whom a zzso intervention was previously zzso We evaluated the proposed procedure in clinical zzso
