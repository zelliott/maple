We introduce novel image zzso penalties to overcome the practical problems associated with the classical total variation zzso zzso zzso by novel zzso of the classical TV zzso we derive two families of zzso involving higher degree partial image derivatives; we term these families as zzso and zzso higher degree TV zzso penalties, zzso The zzso penalty is the zzso - zzso mixed norm of the directional image zzso while the zzso penalty is the zzso zzso norm of directional zzso These zzso inherit the desirable properties of standard TV schemes such as zzso to zzso and zzso preservation of zzso and zzso The use of mixed norms in zzso penalties encourages the joint zzso of the directional derivatives at each zzso thus encouraging zzso zzso In contrast, the fully zzso norm in the zzso penalty ensures the preservation of zzso while continuing to smooth along the zzso zzso this scheme thus enhances the zzso image characteristics analogous to standard zzso We also introduce efficient zzso zzso to solve the resulting zzso zzso The zzso comparison of the proposed scheme with classical TV penalty, current second-degree methods, and zzso zzso clearly demonstrate the performance zzso Specifically, the proposed zzso minimize the staircase and ringing artifacts that are common with TV and zzso schemes, while better preserving the zzso We also observe that zzso HDTV penalty provides consistently improved reconstructions compared with the zzso HDTV zzso
