New methods for zzso analysis accurately estimated zzso circuit zzso location and shape in a canine zzso It was hypothesized that these methods also would locate zzso circuits causing clinical zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso recordings, obtained with a zzso mapping system, were analyzed zzso from 14 patients with zzso VT who had undergone successful zzso zzso for prevention of VT zzso zzso zzso from 256 zzso distributed zzso sites were reconstructed by mathematical zzso zzso zzso were zzso 15 (in 11 zzso had a complete zzso zzso circuit with a zzso zzso zzso During zzso rhythm, the location and axis of the zzso and most uniform zzso in the region of latest zzso zzso (the primary zzso the limits of which were defined as boundaries with zzso zzso difference in zzso duration between zzso recordings, identified the location and shape of the zzso circuit zzso with a mean sensitivity compared with zzso mapping of zzso and a mean specificity of zzso The zzso of a theoretical zzso best zzso zzso drawn perpendicular to the primary axis of zzso spanning the estimated zzso location was within zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso distance zzso zzso of the actual zzso site that terminated zzso Analysis of VT zzso based on time shifts in the zzso component of the local zzso when cycle length changed zzso linear zzso template matching zzso zzso in 5 of the cases, accurately estimated the time zzso between zzso at the recording site and the circuit zzso slow zzso zone where the effective zzso zzso had been placed, which is zzso to the distance between the two locations zzso difference compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In selected patients with VT who have a complete zzso circuit, zzso location and shape can be discerned by analysis of zzso rhythm or zzso zzso and an effective zzso site can be predicted without the need to construct zzso maps of zzso zzso
