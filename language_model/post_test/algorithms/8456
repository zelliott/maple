Many of the current procedures for detecting coding regions on human DNA sequences combine a number of individual techniques such as zzso analysis and neural net zzso Recent papers have used techniques from zzso systems zzso in particular, parallel cascade identification zzso as one means for zzso protein sequences into their zzso zzso In the present paper, zzso is used in a pilot study to distinguish zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso within zzso human DNA zzso Only the first zzso and first zzso sequences with known boundaries in zzso DNA from the beta zzso zzso locus were used for zzso Then, the parallel cascade zzso were able to achieve zzso rates of about zzso on novel sequences in a test set, and averaged about zzso when results of a blind test were zzso In testing over a much wider range of human zzso zzso zzso zzso averaged zzso correct zzso These results indicate that parallel cascade zzso may be useful components in future coding region detection zzso
