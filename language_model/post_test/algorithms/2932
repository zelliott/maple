zzso A zzso zzso is the most common form of zzso and many patients are at risk of at least slow zzso However, prediction of the zzso outcome in individual patients remains zzso 

To develop a practical and zzso scheme for risk zzso of zzso patients, data were extracted from a prospective cohort study conducted in 97 clinical units in Japan from zzso Specifically, we examined deterioration in zzso function, defined as doubling of serum zzso within 10 years of follow-up in 790 adult zzso patients without substantial zzso dysfunction at baseline using a decision tree induction zzso 

zzso zzso indicated that the best single predictor of zzso deterioration was severe zzso on urine zzso testing, followed by zzso and the presence of mild zzso for patients with and without severe zzso zzso zzso total protein levels, zzso blood pressure and zzso grade were placed in the third tier of the decision tree zzso With these six zzso patients can be readily zzso into seven risk groups whose zzso of zzso deterioration within 10-year follow-up ranges from zzso to zzso zzso zzso also identified severe zzso zzso and mild zzso as significant zzso of zzso Areas under the zzso characteristic curve for the prediction were comparable between the decision tree model and the zzso zzso model zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso versus zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso 

zzso of substantial zzso deterioration in zzso patients can be zzso estimated using six zzso obtained from clinical zzso
