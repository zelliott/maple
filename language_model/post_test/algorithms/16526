We carried out a zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso across 190 elite cultivated zzso chosen to represent the available genetic variation in current elite North West European and North American barley zzso zzso zzso patterns of diversity and linkage zzso varied considerably across the seven barley zzso zzso and rarely zzso zzso blocks that may represent up to zzso of the physical length of barley zzso extended across the zzso zzso By positioning zzso zzso mapped zzso markers with minimum zzso zzso higher than zzso by association zzso zzso were located to within zzso of their original genetic map zzso We show that at this current marker density genetically diverse populations of relatively small size are sufficient to fine map simple traits, providing they are not strongly zzso within the sample, fall outside the genetic zzso and population zzso is effectively controlled in the zzso Our results have important implications for association zzso zzso zzso physical mapping and practical plant breeding in barley and other major world zzso including wheat and rye that exhibit comparable zzso and genetic zzso
