A zzso imaging system in line scanning mode was used for measuring the zzso and scattering properties of zzso food materials over the visible and zzso region of zzso zzso An instrumental zzso procedure was developed to compensate for the zzso instrument response of the imaging zzso A zzso zzso zzso for a zzso diffusion theory model was proposed to determine zzso zzso and reduced scattering zzso zzso from the zzso resolved zzso zzso zzso The zzso imaging system provided good measurement of zzso and zzso for the simulation samples made of zzso scattering material and three zzso zzso zzso green zzso and black zzso with average fitting errors of zzso and zzso zzso The optical properties of the fruit and vegetable juices and zzso were zzso zzso of the zzso and reduced scattering zzso at 600 zzso were highly correlated to the fat content of the milk samples with the correlation zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Compared to zzso and zzso techniques, the zzso imaging technique provides a faster and simpler means for measuring the optical properties of zzso food and agricultural zzso
