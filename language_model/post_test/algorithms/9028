This work evaluates the zzso dynamic changes in zzso patients before and during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Four zzso parameters were zzso in 51 zzso and 52 healthy subjects with the objective of assessing the zzso differences between both groups: maximum zzso magnitude zzso zzso area zzso maximum distance between zzso and loop zzso and perimeter zzso conventional zzso zzso magnitude zzso zzso difference zzso and spatial zzso zzso zzso were also zzso 

zzso zzso zzso comparison against a healthy population showed that zzso patients monitoring is greatly enhanced when all the zzso zzso in combination with the standard zzso zzso and zzso indexes, are used in the zzso zzso and zzso in turn, reached rather high values, zzso and zzso zzso 

These new zzso set of complementary zzso zzso when combined with the classics zzso zzso and zzso indexes, increase sensitivity and specificity for acute zzso zzso
