zzso connectivity between cortical regions of the human brain can be characterized zzso with diffusion zzso imaging zzso fiber zzso In this paper, a novel fiber zzso technique, globally zzso fiber tracking and zzso fiber zzso is zzso The proposed technique uses zzso zzso in conjunction with modified Hubert statistic to partition fiber zzso which are evaluated with simultaneous consideration of consistency with underlying zzso data and zzso of fiber courses in the sense of global zzso into individual zzso coherent fiber zzso In each resulting zzso fibers are zzso zzso and clustered zzso to approach the optimal zzso The global zzso allows the proposed technique to resist local image artifacts and to possess inherent capabilities of handling complex fiber structures and tracking fibers between gray matter zzso The embedded zzso zzso allows multiple fiber zzso between a pair of seed regions to be naturally reconstructed and zzso The integration of globally zzso tracking and zzso zzso greatly benefits applications of zzso fiber zzso to clinical studies, particularly to studies of zzso relations of the complex neural network of the zzso zzso with synthetic and in zzso human zzso data have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed technique in tracking complex fiber structures, thus proving its significant advantages over traditionally used streamline fiber zzso
