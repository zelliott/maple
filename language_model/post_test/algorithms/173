In this paper, polar and zzso zzso analysis are defined as the decomposition of a function in terms of zzso of the zzso with the zzso being zzso in the corresponding zzso The proposed zzso provide effective zzso of an image into basic patterns with simple zzso and angular zzso The theory is zzso presented with an emphasis on the zzso to the normal zzso zzso The relation between the polar or zzso zzso transform and the normal zzso transform is zzso As examples of applications, zzso zzso based on polar and zzso zzso zzso are tested on pattern zzso zzso
