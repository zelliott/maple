To investigate optical properties of human zzso and zzso in relationship to structural orientation of zzso prisms and zzso zzso by optical zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso thickness including zzso with zzso or zzso prisms and zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso were obtained from 28 zzso freshly extracted human third zzso zzso at different zzso Each disc was placed over a metal plate and zzso images were obtained by a zzso zzso at zzso zzso wavelength zzso zzso zzso 1, Panasonic Healthcare zzso zzso zzso zzso index zzso calculated from optical path length and real zzso and zzso signal slope zzso in relation to structural orientation were statistically compared among groups zzso The discs were zzso and observed under zzso to confirm zzso or zzso zzso 

No significant differences were found in zzso and zzso among zzso and zzso zzso groups zzso However, in zzso there was a significant difference in both variables among different zzso In zzso zzso orientation, the average zzso and zzso values were significantly lower compared to other two groups zzso and zzso zzso There was a significant difference in both variables between zzso and zzso zzso 

Unlike zzso zzso index and zzso signal patterns in zzso vary according to structural orientation, with zzso zzso playing the zzso zzso of zzso signal intensity was small in zzso The findings may contribute to a better understanding of the interactions of light with the dental zzso 

zzso records of zzso zzso and zzso signal patterns may be important for clinical diagnosis of zzso and measurement of structural depth for operative purposes using this zzso zzso of zzso structural orientation on zzso index and scattering pattern must be considered when observing human teeth by zzso zzso zzso
