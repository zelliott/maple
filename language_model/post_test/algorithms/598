The objective of this work is the modeling of a similarity function adapted to the medical environment using the zzso approach of pattern recognition theory, and its application to compare the zzso conditions of patients with zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso The variables in zzso with no a zzso zzso or zzso structure are objects whose similarity or difference is evaluated by comparison criteria zzso The range of these functions is an ordered set zzso into the unit zzso and they are designed to allow differentiation and zzso treatment of the zzso The zzso between objects is zzso as a similarity function that stresses the relations among the comparison criteria and evaluates the partial descriptions zzso zzso or total descriptions zzso zzso of the zzso For the zzso problem we defined a set of 12 variables featuring the zzso zzso the conditions of zzso zzso zzso and patient's zzso The comparison criteria zzso for zzso fuzzy for zzso collapse zzso and for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso were assigned a relevance factor based on the orthodontist accumulated knowledge and zzso The modeling of the similarity function and its effectiveness in comparing zzso conditions in patients are illustrated by the study of four clinical cases with different zzso The results through similarity are close to the expected zzso zzso evaluated at different moments it allows to assess the effect of treatment in a single patient, hence providing valuable auxiliary criteria for medical decision making as to the patient's zzso We include the potential extension of the methodology to other medical disciplines such as speech therapy and zzso zzso
