zzso directed zzso zzso technology recently moved into the center of scientific attention, particularly as a versatile tool for zzso zzso Its major advantages can be found in the striking simplicity of tuning wall properties and the complete control over layer thickness and zzso Yet, for the most commonly applied pair of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sodium salt zzso the mandatory control of the successful deposition on plane and zzso surfaces is currently only zzso by means of sophisticated and expensive zzso Here we describe an alternative zzso method based on a simple zzso zzso using the Bradford zzso a cost-effective commercially available zzso and standard laboratory technical zzso The binding of the dye to zzso causes a distinct shift of the zzso maximum from 465 to zzso zzso providing a method for spectral zzso of zzso amounts of dissolved zzso during zzso coating with significant accuracy and excellent zzso The method was successfully employed to zzso accurate zzso zzso on several particles that have a general importance as zzso zzso Thus, this method can be recommended as standard laboratory technique for control of zzso zzso and will considerably broaden the zzso of this promising technology in zzso
