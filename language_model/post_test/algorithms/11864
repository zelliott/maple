The authors designed a zzso technique that requires only minimal operator input at the initial and final supervision stages of zzso and has zzso zzso as the primary zzso of zzso zzso The technique was applied to zzso total zzso zzso volumes in patients with multiple sclerosis zzso A zzso zzso technique is presented and shown to have a zzso reliability of zzso 

The method used a single segmented section with zzso zzso A zzso neural net performed zzso into four tissue classes after supervised zzso This reference section was deconstructed into the entire set of possible 4 zzso zzso zzso which was used to segment zzso sections in steps of 4 zzso zzso adjacent image zzso zzso and zzso zzso were tested by using zzso zzso zzso zzso MR images from five patients, each of whom was zzso twice on the same zzso Five different reference sections and three temporally zzso training sessions involving the same reference section were used to test the zzso zzso 

The zzso of variation ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso standard zzso zzso zzso zzso for results from five different reference sections for each brain and from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for brains segmented with the same reference section on three temporally separated zzso zzso zzso reliability did not exceed zzso (except for a small zzso load of 1 zzso in one zzso zzso differences were approximately zzso 

The zzso technique yielded zzso zzso zzso except for very small zzso zzso zzso that compare favorably with previously published zzso New repositioning techniques that minimize zzso imaging zzso could make this approach attractive for resolving zzso zzso detection zzso
