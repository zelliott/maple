A model is a set of possible theories for describing a set of zzso When the data are used to select a zzso theory, an important question is how many effectively independent theories the model zzso the log of this number is called the zzso zzso The zzso model is the set of all zzso zzso which are probability zzso over the space of zzso A zzso distribution may be used to describe zzso data, consisting of zzso columns of letters, with c letters in each zzso We here zzso in the limit of large zzso and zzso a zzso expression for the complexity of the zzso model applied to such zzso For small zzso we derive as well a minor correction to this formula, which is easily calculated by zzso Carlo zzso Although our results are confined to the zzso model, they may cast light as well on the complexity of zzso mixture models, which have been applied fruitfully to the study of protein multiple sequence zzso
