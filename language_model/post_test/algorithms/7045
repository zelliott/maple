zzso zzso zzso surface is applied for zzso of the external surface and canal of tooth based on its zzso zzso data obtained by X-ray zzso For three-dimensional display of the fitted surfaces, a technique for fast removal of the hidden surfaces is also zzso The selection of the accumulated chord length or coordinate component as zzso make it possible to fit any kind of surface zzso For displaying or plotting a zzso surface, a method capable of discriminating the grades for sequential removal of the hidden surfaces is developed for substantial reduction of computing zzso
