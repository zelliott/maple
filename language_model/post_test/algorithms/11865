To study the influence of test length in automated zzso follow-up of zzso eyes and, particularly, to determine if it is possible to zzso interpret test results obtained using a testing zzso shorter than that used for baseline zzso 

zzso zzso findings were zzso evaluated in 31 patients with glaucoma for whom multiple zzso zzso tests were available on the Full zzso strategy and the zzso Standard zzso 

zzso around the mean zzso zzso lines was smaller with zzso than with the Full zzso zzso Mean zzso values with zzso averaged about 1 zzso less zzso Although localized zzso measured in zzso were deeper on the Full zzso strategy, number of significantly depressed points on total zzso and pattern zzso probability plot analyses did not differ significantly between the 2 zzso 

The zzso strategy showed zzso consistency that was at least as good as that of the Full zzso zzso The 2 strategies produced similar results when analyzed relative to their respective normal significance zzso Generally, it is appropriate to establish a new baseline when converting from one zzso zzso to zzso When necessary, however, results may be zzso compared if such comparisons are based on total and pattern zzso probability maps rather than on zzso zzso
