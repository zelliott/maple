We investigated artifacts due to zzso contrast medium zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso We scanned a phantom filled with water or with 100, 50, or zzso zzso zzso of CM and then virtually produced zzso projection data by partially replacing the projection zzso zzso as a function of zzso percentage of filling time, and size and position of the filling area were zzso In addition, we used an automatic power zzso with different injection delays to inject CM during the zzso A decrease in filling times caused by a lag in CM arrival during the scan resulted in a decrease in zzso values, distortion of the filling area, and appearance of streak zzso Even a delay of approximately zzso in CM arrival in the total scan time resulted in obvious distortion of the filling zzso The distortion and streak artifacts tended to zzso at higher CM zzso Use of a minimum CM concentration based on the purpose of the examination and constant filling at the target region are effective for avoiding these zzso
