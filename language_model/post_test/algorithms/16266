We present an experimental and modeling study of zzso transport in porous media in the presence of zzso zzso of a solid zzso Conservative and zzso transport experiments were performed in a zzso laboratory flow cell, filled with homogeneous and zzso porous zzso Conservative experiments were performed by injecting solutions containing sodium zzso and calcium zzso into the zzso In zzso transport experiments, inlet solutions of calcium zzso and sodium zzso were injected in zzso resulting in calcium zzso zzso where the solutions zzso Experimental results were used as a benchmark to examine the performance of a zzso transport zzso zzso Good agreement between model predictions and experimental results was obtained for the conservative transport zzso The zzso transport experiments featured the formation of a calcium zzso mineral phase within the mixing zone between the two solutions, which controlled the spatial evolution of calcium zzso in the zzso zzso simulations performed on high resolution zzso for both the homogeneous and zzso porous systems underestimated clogging of the zzso Although qualitative agreement between model results and experimental observations was zzso accurate model predictions of the spatial evolution of calcium zzso at sample points within the flow cell could not be zzso
