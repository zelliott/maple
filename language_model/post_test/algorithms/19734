zzso zzso in contrast to traditional zzso techniques, potentially can improve the scan time efficiency of zzso applications and provide seamless images of an extended field of view zzso zzso MR zzso zzso in particular requires high spatial resolution and at the same time has rigid scan time constraints due to the limited zzso contrast zzso In this study a reconstruction method for continuously acquired zzso data sets during table movement was combined with a zzso partial parallel imaging zzso zzso zzso partially parallel acquisitions zzso The method was applied to peripheral zzso and compared with a standard zzso zzso zzso The gain in scan time was used to increase the data acquisition zzso and decrease the slice zzso The method was evaluated in five healthy volunteers and applied to one patient with peripheral zzso zzso disease zzso The protocols were zzso compared with respect to the zzso ratio zzso and zzso ratio zzso in selected vessel zzso as well as overall vessel zzso The combination of the zzso technique with parallel imaging enabled the acquisition of seamless peripheral zzso zzso with increased resolution and an overall zzso zzso
