We measured the external moments and zzso force directions acting on a freely zzso object while it was zzso and manipulated by old zzso and young zzso zzso Participants performed a grasp and lift task and a precision orientation zzso task with a precision zzso zzso During the zzso task the zzso group zzso their thumb and finger contacts and produced greater grip force, greater external moments on the object around its roll zzso and oriented force zzso differently compared with the zzso zzso During the zzso task, the zzso group was more variable in zzso force directions and performed the zzso task more zzso With practice the zzso group aligned their digits, reduced their grip force, and minimized external moments on the object, clearly demonstrating that the nervous system monitored and actively manipulated one or more variables related to object zzso This was true even for the zzso task, a task for which no instructions regarding object orientation were given and which could tolerate modest amounts of object tilt without interfering with task zzso Although the zzso group performed the zzso task faster with experience, they remained slower than the zzso zzso We conclude that with old age comes a reduced ability to control the forces and moments applied to objects during precision grasp and zzso This may contribute to the ubiquitous slowing and deteriorating manual zzso in healthy zzso
