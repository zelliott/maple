We present the findings of a zzso zzso study to establish the appropriate duration of zzso therapy for zzso uncomplicated bone and joint infections in zzso Historically, patients have been treated with prolonged courses of intravenous and oral zzso Our hypothesis was that children could be safely treated with 3 days of high-dose intravenous therapy followed by 3 weeks of oral zzso 

We zzso collected data from children presenting to Birmingham Children's Hospital and The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne who fitted our diagnostic criteria for septic arthritis and zzso over a zzso zzso zzso criteria for entry into the database were children zzso years of age who had no underlying disease or medical therapy zzso to infection, and who had symptoms for less than 14 days before zzso They were all started on intravenous antibiotics and a predetermined treatment zzso was zzso All patients with septic arthritis also underwent joint zzso The patients were converted to oral antibiotics once they improved clinically and zzso Regular zzso follow-up continued for 1 year with blood tests and zzso 

Our database included 70 zzso eligible children aged 2 weeks to 14 zzso zzso were the only organisms isolated in cases of zzso whereas zzso infection was more prevalent in patients with septic zzso Using our treatment zzso we found that 59% of children could be converted to oral therapy after 3 days of intravenous therapy and zzso after 5 zzso The median duration of zzso stay was 5 zzso We established that 3 weeks of oral therapy was appropriate for those patients who received 5 days or less intravenous zzso We have identified temperature and zzso protein as the best quantitative means of monitoring response to zzso All patients were zzso zzso and zzso normal before discharge 1 year zzso 

We have found that a shortened course of intravenous and oral zzso therapy is effective in the management of acute uncomplicated bone and joint zzso in zzso
