zzso zzso is a deadly infectious disease and the presence of cavities in the upper lung zones is a strong indicator that the disease has developed into a highly infectious zzso Currently, the detection of zzso cavities is mainly conducted by clinicians observing chest zzso zzso performed by zzso are labor intensive and very often there is insufficient zzso personnel available, especially in remote zzso After assessing existing approaches, we propose an automated zzso technique which takes a hybrid zzso zzso zzso approach to detect zzso cavities zzso We apply zzso inverse zzso of variation zzso and zzso measures to zzso detected features and confirm true zzso zzso By comparing with non hybrid approaches and the classical active zzso techniques for feature extraction in medical images, experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high accuracy with a low false positive rate in detecting zzso zzso
