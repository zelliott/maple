The authors evaluated the zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso clearance of zzso of organic zzso zzso zzso or organic zzso zzso zzso using repeated drug application zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and 2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Each drug was administered orally twice to healthy subjects, with sample sizes ranging from 12 to 28 zzso zzso zzso of each zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso clearance were estimated based on analysis of zzso and the genetic contribution zzso was calculated as zzso - zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso averaged zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with mean zzso zzso of variation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These high zzso values suggest a potential significant genetic contribution by the zzso zzso and zzso in Chinese zzso Further studies in a larger population are needed to confirm the importance of these results as well as to identify specific genetic zzso in these zzso responsible for such zzso
