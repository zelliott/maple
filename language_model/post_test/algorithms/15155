zzso fatty liver disease zzso affects about zzso of the general population, and its clinical relevance arises from the fact that zzso of these subjects develop zzso zzso zzso a condition at risk of zzso zzso In addition zzso and in particular NASH patients, are also at high risk of cardiovascular zzso suffering overall from an increased liver and no zzso events of risk and zzso At the moment liver biopsy is the gold standard for a correct evaluation of NASH and zzso among zzso zzso However, the high and increasing prevalence of zzso has triggered an intensive search for alternative and zzso methods for evaluating disease zzso zzso we can distinguish two main groups of zzso zzso namely zzso zzso that use clinical and/or zzso zzso and zzso derived from zzso of parameters arising from liver imaging zzso All these tools showed encouraging results, even though their utility in clinical practice in the individual patients is still under zzso Therefore further efforts are needed in order to generate zzso zzso that correctly assess liver damage in zzso zzso In particular, it should be interesting to perform zzso analysis, by combining old and new tools, with the aim to generate more accurate zzso Finally we think that zzso scores should not only be able to correctly zzso the severity of liver disease in zzso patients, but also predict liver and zzso related morbidity and zzso further acting as zzso markers of liver and systemic disease zzso This review summarizes the present knowledge on zzso diagnosis in zzso patients, and suggest future directions for this complex research zzso
