This report describes a new methodology aimed at grouping zzso interaction energy zzso into regions of neighbor variables bearing the same chemical and statistical zzso These regions represent the structural zzso of the series better than individual zzso variables and can zzso replace them in the zzso zzso The zzso used to generate such regions is zzso together with their application for improving the quality of zzso variable zzso The method is illustrated on a series of 47 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and is shown to improve both the zzso ability and the zzso of the zzso models zzso comparing favorably with other methods previously zzso
