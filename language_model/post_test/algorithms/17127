A procedure for automatic identification of zzso of cerebral zzso in magnetic resonance images is zzso The zzso departs from information of the spatial location of a given feature zzso zzso zzso in one zzso and automatically defines its course in the other zzso The automatic tracing of zzso was successfully performed in the zzso aspect of both zzso in 18 normal zzso The zzso location in the target zzso was first zzso by assuming an zzso transformation between zzso and then refined by local edge zzso The method produced reliable results in comparing the zzso areas (the zzso zzso zzso their complexity, and the angle between the zzso and zzso zzso
