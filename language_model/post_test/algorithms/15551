To identify accurately thick zzso preoperatively by means of a combined approach based on zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso thickness zzso obtained by means of a zzso zzso and identification of clinical and zzso variables useful in distinguishing between thick and thin zzso were performed on a training set of 40 zzso An zzso based on zzso clinical, and zzso criteria was constructed to develop a method for zzso evaluation of melanoma thickness and was validated on a test set of 48 zzso 

University medical zzso 

zzso patients affected by primary zzso zzso 

zzso and specificity of the algorithm, with the use of zzso clinical, and zzso data, in thick melanoma zzso 

zzso thickness was calculated for each zzso On the training set, 2 clinical and 7 zzso features were identified for distinction between thick and thin zzso zzso central zzso network, central brown zzso and zzso were characteristic of thin zzso clinical regression, localized peripheral zzso network, zzso zzso zzso areas, and blood vessels were characteristic of thick zzso A zzso was attributed to each variable and a score was obtained for each zzso The algorithm, developed for zzso thickness zzso was validated on the test set, enabling the distinction of thick zzso with an zzso sensitivity and a zzso zzso 

The correct zzso of all thin zzso as such renders this approach suitable in clinical zzso
