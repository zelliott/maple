zzso zzso zzso zzso has proven relevance in zzso diagnosis, staging and zzso The standardized zzso value zzso is one of the most widely used zzso criteria in PET zzso However, factors such as noise and image resolution affect the measurement of the zzso We reported earlier that a zzso projector zzso zzso expectation zzso detector response zzso zzso based on zzso zzso introduces less noise than a geometrical model zzso 

The aim of this study was to investigate the zzso DR zzso impact on zzso zzso under clinical zzso 

We first performed a bias analysis to assess the accuracy of the zzso for the two reconstruction methods as a function of target size and the number of zzso with 14 acquisitions of the zzso zzso zzso We then used each method to calculate the maximum and average zzso respectively for 32 zzso 

For all spheres and all zzso the bias was significantly lower with zzso DR than with zzso zzso Moreover, a paired zzso zzso showed significant zzso differences for maximum zzso and average zzso (both zzso in cancer zzso zzso the two methods did not differ significantly in terms of the mean zzso and zzso ratio calculated in the liver for each patient zzso and zzso zzso 

Phantom and patient studies were performed to zzso the effects of zzso DR on PET zzso The phantom study highlighted the fact that our method produces more accurate images in terms of the zzso which is an essential quality for ensuring correct diagnosis, follow-up and treatment zzso
