The availability of different single zzso zzso zzso chips and the development of zzso zzso allow for zzso dairy cattle breeding schemes applying various zzso selection zzso These zzso zzso yield zzso estimated breeding values zzso with different zzso at different zzso Thus, the optimum allocation of investments to different selection paths and strategies to maximize the genetic gain per year zzso and its sensitivity to changes in cost and zzso of zzso is of great zzso This is even more relevant under the constraints of limited financial zzso With deterministic methods, optimum zzso breeding plans maximizing zzso were identified in which selection could take place on zzso derived from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso To account for the uncertainty of cost and zzso of zzso these parameters were varied in a zzso zzso zzso breeding costs were limited to the crucial expenses of a traditional breeding program with 50 zzso young bulls per zzso zzso clearly show that, in an optimal selection strategy, selection on zzso is predominantly used for the identification of future bull zzso but the main part of zzso is still generated from selection of zzso The low selection intensity in the path dam to zzso induced a higher sensitivity of zzso to changes in cost and zzso of zzso compared with the same changes of zzso On the contrary, the genetic gain generated from selection of males was only affected by changes in zzso of zzso but almost unaffected by any changes in zzso Thus, changes in cost and zzso of zzso put the most pressure on the breeding scheme structure to maintain a high zzso Furthermore, zzso selection of bull zzso produced by far the majority of breeding cost but the lowest genetic zzso
