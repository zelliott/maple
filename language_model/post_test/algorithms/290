zzso is the phenomenon where an zzso directs its movement toward its preferred zzso So far, the molecular origin for this zzso behavior remains a zzso We propose a model of zzso coli zzso and show that the zzso behavior in zzso coli zzso can be carried out by the zzso zzso zzso under two general zzso First, the zzso response to temperature is zzso by its internal adaptation zzso For zzso coli, zzso zzso changes from a warm sensor to a cold sensor on increase of its zzso zzso Second, temperature directly affects the adaptation zzso The adapted activity in zzso coli increases with temperature in contrast to the perfect adaptation to chemical zzso Given these two conditions, zzso coli zzso is achieved by the zzso and zzso responses for temperature above and below a critical temperature zzso which is zzso by internal zzso zzso Our model results are supported by both experiments with zzso zzso and the recent temperature impulse response zzso for zzso zzso zzso is predicted to decrease with the background zzso zzso This mechanism for precision sensing in an zzso zzso system may apply to other organisms, such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso
