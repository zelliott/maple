zzso imaging extends the capabilities of biological and clinical studies to simultaneously study multiple features such as zzso and proteins zzso and zzso zzso imaging combines two well-known scientific zzso namely zzso and imaging, to provide a new advantageous zzso The need to measure the spectrum at each point of the image requires combining zzso zzso with the more common imaging equipment, and introduces zzso as zzso 

The principles of spectral imaging and a few representative applications are zzso zzso imaging analysis is necessary because the complex data structure cannot be analyzed zzso A few of the zzso are discussed with emphasis on the usage for different experimental modes zzso and bright zzso Finally, spectral imaging, like any method, should be evaluated in light of its advantages to specific applications, a selection of which is zzso 

zzso imaging is a relatively new technique and its full potential is yet to be zzso Nevertheless, several applications have already shown its zzso
