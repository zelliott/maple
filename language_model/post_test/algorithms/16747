A new treatment planning system zzso was designed and developed for a new treatment system, which consisted of a zzso zzso with zzso and a real-time tracking zzso We also evaluated the effectiveness of the implemented zzso of zzso and dose calculations in the zzso for the new treatment zzso In the zzso the zzso procedure consisted of the zzso zzso method for finding the zzso beam directions and the zzso method for determination of beam zzso We used the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to calculate dose zzso using CT image data zzso In the zzso algorithm, dose density zzso was applied for the calculation of zzso zzso The zzso zzso was implemented with zzso zzso and a zzso approach using a zzso zzso From the evaluation of the zzso the system can zzso the direction and intensity of individual zzso The accuracy of the dose calculated by the zzso zzso was less than zzso on average with the calculation time of 15 s for one zzso However, the zzso zzso needed 72 zzso for one beam using the zzso approach, even though the zzso zzso with the parallel computing could decrease multiple beam calculations and had zzso times faster calculation speed using the parallel zzso The zzso zzso could be practically acceptable for the dose calculation in terms of the accuracy and zzso zzso Additionally, we have found a zzso advantage of zzso Bragg zzso dose distribution in zzso zzso
