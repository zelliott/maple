zzso lead zzso that zzso multiple biological zzso remains a challenge in the pursuit of viable drug zzso zzso of a given lead compound to one having a desired set of molecular attributes often involves a lengthy zzso process that zzso existing information, tests zzso and incorporates new zzso Within the context of a zzso corporate setting, zzso tools and zzso models have provided the chemists a means for zzso and streamlining this zzso design zzso This chapter zzso an actual library design scenario for following up a lead compound that zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso The application of zzso tools and zzso models in the targeted library design of zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso Specifically, the zzso profiling using our proprietary zzso zzso Global zzso zzso zzso is discussed in conjunction with the zzso component of the library design using our in-house zzso tool zzso The zzso simulations were based on a zzso linear potential energy function in combination with an efficient evolutionary programming search zzso The library production protocols and results are also zzso
