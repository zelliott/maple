By using the exact density functional theory, one demonstrates that the value of the local electronic zzso of a molecular zzso is directly related to the polarization charge zzso zzso induced by a test electron removed (or zzso from zzso the zzso Our finding zzso to a chemical group a formal relation between these molecular zzso recently obtained for an atom in a zzso using an approximate zzso model zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 411 zzso In addition, a practical zzso zzso zzso scheme of the zzso hole and related local zzso of zzso of a molecular family having in common a similar zzso is zzso As a blind test, the method is applied to the lateral chains of the 20 isolated zzso zzso One demonstrates that the local zzso of the lateral chain is a quantitative measure of the similarity of the zzso zzso It predicts the separation of zzso acids in different zzso groups zzso zzso zzso sulfur zzso and zzso The present approach may find applications in quantitative structure activity relationship zzso
