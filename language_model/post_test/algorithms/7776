To zzso the zzso profiles of the diffusion and zzso components of zzso functional zzso zzso during visual zzso we extracted the raw signal from an zzso defined volume of interest encompassing the visual zzso of 16 zzso Under the assumption of a zzso time zzso system we were able to define an intrinsic diffusion response function zzso from neural zzso as a counterpart to the zzso response function zzso commonly used in zzso The shape of the zzso response was found to be very similar to the time courses of optical imaging zzso signals, thought to originate from local geometric changes in brain tissue at the microscopic zzso The overall zzso signal response was modeled as the zzso of the stimulation paradigm time course with a zzso which is the sum of the zzso and a fractional zzso resulting from residual tissue zzso zzso The contribution of the zzso to the zzso signal was found to be zzso at peak zzso but the zzso component which has a much steeper onset contributed solely at beginning of the response zzso The suitability of this model over the zzso zzso to process zzso data was then demonstrated on zzso acquired in 5 other subjects using a rapid zzso zzso Some zzso in the responses were observed, mainly after the end of the zzso
