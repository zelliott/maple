The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of implant neck design and cortical bone thickness by means of 3-D zzso elastic finite element analysis and to analyze primary and secondary stability of clinical evidence based on zzso and principal zzso Four commercial dental zzso comparable in size, for a type IV bone and zzso segments were zzso Various parameters were considered, including the zzso condition zzso and full zzso force direction zzso and zzso and cortical bone thickness zzso zzso and zzso The force was considered a zzso load applied at the top of the zzso The zzso of the vertical and horizontal loading direction were 500 N and 250 zzso zzso and principal stresses were employed to evaluate the failure of zzso and bone zzso zzso The results show that zzso stress of the zzso bone decreased as cortical bone thickness zzso The stress concentration regions were located at the implant neck between the cortical bone and zzso zzso The zzso level in full zzso is less than that in zzso and it also decreases as a increasing of cortical bone zzso zzso cortical bone thickness is a key factor for primary zzso
