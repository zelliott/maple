The complex zzso zzso of freshly excised healthy breast tissue and breast zzso collected from 20 patients were measured in the range of zzso - zzso zzso using a portable zzso zzso transmission zzso zzso was performed to zzso the tissue samples as healthy zzso zzso healthy zzso breast zzso or breast zzso The average complex zzso index was determined for each group and it was found that samples containing cancer had a higher zzso index and zzso zzso The zzso properties of the zzso were also used to simulate the impulse response functions expected when imaging breast tissue in a reflection geometry as in zzso zzso imaging zzso Our results indicate that both zzso and zzso can be used to distinguish between healthy zzso breast zzso healthy zzso breast tissue and breast cancer due to the differences in the fundamental optical zzso
