Wireless sensor networks have attracted a lot of attention zzso In this paper, we develop a channel model based on the elliptical model for zzso components involving randomly placed zzso in the scattering region with sensors deployed on a zzso We verify that in a sensor network, the use of receive diversity techniques improves the performance of the zzso zzso performance analysis of the system is carried out for both single and multiple antennas with the applied receive diversity zzso Performance analyses based on variations in receiver zzso maximum zzso delay and transmit power have been performed considering different numbers of antenna elements present in the receiver zzso Our results show that increasing the number of antenna elements for a wireless sensor network does indeed improve the zzso rates that can be zzso
