This study aims to automatically detect and segment the zzso in portal zzso phase zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The institutional review board of the University of zzso approved this study and zzso the need for informed zzso zzso learning is used to build a zzso tissue zzso incorporating spatial relationships between the zzso and surrounding zzso and zzso Furthermore, discrete zzso and zzso zzso are used to build texture features to describe local tissue zzso zzso is used to guide a constrained statistical shape model to fit the zzso The zzso to detect and segment the zzso was evaluated on 40 consecutive CT data that were acquired in the portal zzso contrast agent zzso Manual zzso of the zzso was carried out by experienced zzso and served as reference zzso zzso cross validation was zzso The zzso detection and zzso yielded an average surface distance of zzso and an average overlap of zzso compared with the reference zzso The overall zzso of the system was zzso The presented novel approach enables automatic zzso zzso in portal zzso phase zzso CT images which are included in almost every clinical routine abdominal CT zzso Reliable pancreatic zzso is crucial for zzso detection systems and an zzso decision zzso
