The impact of the inherent optical properties zzso zzso on the zzso zzso retrieval from ocean color remote sensing zzso is analyzed from an in zzso data set covering a large dynamic zzso The effect of the zzso of the specific zzso zzso zzso zzso specific particulate zzso zzso zzso and colored zzso matter zzso to zzso zzso ratio, zzso on the performance of standard operational zzso is zzso This study confirms that empirical zzso are highly dependent on the specifics zzso values (especially zzso and zzso zzso is zzso in waters with specific zzso values higher than averaged values, and vice zzso These results clearly indicate the necessity to account for the influence of the specific zzso zzso in zzso retrieval zzso
