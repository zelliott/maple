zzso of the diffusion zzso from a sparse set of diffusion zzso zzso zzso is a field of active zzso zzso reconstruction methods propose to reduce scan time and are particularly suitable for scanning zzso zzso Recent work on reconstructing the diffusion signal from very few zzso using compressed sensing based techniques has zzso on zzso (or zzso zzso at each zzso zzso However, the goal of many zzso studies is to use zzso to study the pathology in white matter fiber zzso Thus, in this work, we propose a joint framework for robust zzso of the diffusion zzso from sparse zzso while simultaneously tracing the white matter zzso We propose to use a novel zzso model of diffusion which incorporates the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso Our preliminary results on zzso data show that the proposed method produces consistent and reliable fiber tracts from very few zzso directions while simultaneously zzso the zzso zzso of the diffusion zzso
