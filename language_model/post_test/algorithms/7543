In this paper, we present an zzso zzso automatic liver zzso algorithm, which combines zzso zzso and zzso techniques to segment liver from 3-D CT zzso Our zzso is a zzso method and can be divided into two zzso At the first stage, zzso the training stage, zzso is performed to learn a sequence of zzso in each zzso space (based on each zzso and other aligned zzso With the use of multiple zzso multiple sequences of zzso zzso are zzso At the second stage, zzso the zzso stage, the test image will be segmented in each zzso space by applying each sequence of zzso zzso The final zzso result will be obtained by fusing zzso results from all zzso spaces via a zzso fusion zzso zzso in order to speed up zzso given a test image, we first use an improved zzso zzso to perform zzso and then implement the zzso image labeling instead of the original inefficient zzso image zzso The proposed method is evaluated on the zzso of zzso 2007 liver zzso zzso The experimental results show that the average volume overlap error and the average surface distance achieved by our method are zzso and zzso zzso respectively, which are comparable to the results reported in the existing state-of-the-art work on liver zzso
