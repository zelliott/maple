A parallel volume holographic optical fingerprint recognition system robust to fingerprint translation, rotation and zzso distortion is zzso The optical fingerprint recognition measures the similarity by using the optical filters of zzso zzso recorded in the holographic zzso A fingerprint is zzso into multiple template data pages based on the local zzso structure coding method after it is adapted for the optical data zzso An improved filter recording time schedule and a zzso zzso technology are combined to suppress the calculating error from the large variations in data page filling zzso Experimental results tested on zzso zzso and a forensic database zzso zzso fingerprints demonstrate the zzso and feasibility of the zzso
