Since their introduction sixty years ago, cell zzso have proved to be a powerful paradigm for brain information zzso After their introduction in artificial intelligence, cell zzso became commonly used in zzso zzso as a neural zzso for content zzso zzso However, the mechanisms underlying their formation are poorly understood and, so far, there is no biologically plausible zzso which can explain how external stimuli can be online stored in cell zzso We addressed this question in a previous paper zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A model for the cognitive map zzso Application of the zzso zzso In zzso zzso international joint conference on neural zzso were, based on biologically plausible mechanisms, a novel zzso zzso for online cell zzso creation was zzso The procedure involved zzso a fast zzso learning of the network's zzso connections for the creation of new cell zzso and a slower feedback signal which stabilized the cell zzso by learning the zzso input zzso Here, we first zzso the role played by the zzso feedback zzso Then, we show how multiple cognitive zzso composed by a set of zzso input zzso can be zzso in the zzso As a result, when facing a previously learned zzso the system is able to retrieve the cognitive map it belongs zzso As a consequence, ambiguous zzso which could belong to multiple cognitive maps can be zzso by the knowledge of the context, zzso the cognitive zzso
