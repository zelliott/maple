In the design of zzso or next-generation sequencing experiments it is crucial to choose the appropriate number of biological zzso As often the number of zzso expressed genes and their effect sizes are small and too few replicates will lead to insufficient power to detect zzso On the other hand, too many replicates unnecessary leads to high experimental zzso Power and sample size analysis can guide zzso in choosing the appropriate number of biological zzso Several methods for power and sample size analysis have recently been proposed for zzso zzso However, most of these are restricted to two group comparisons and require zzso effect zzso Here we propose a zzso based method for power and sample size analysis which can handle more general experimental designs and uses zzso to obtain estimates of the effect zzso The method can also handle zzso distributed test statistics which enables power and sample size calculations for a much wider class of models, including zzso generalized linear models which are used, zzso for zzso data zzso The performance of the method is evaluated using simulated and experimental data from several zzso and next-generation sequencing zzso Furthermore, we compare our proposed method for zzso of the density of effect sizes from pilot data with a recent proposed method specific for two group zzso
