The zzso flexible molecular zzso method has been generalized and extended in two primary areas related to the search component of zzso First, incorporation of a zzso zzso extends the search into Cartesian coordinates constrained by internal zzso zzso Whereas previous versions searched only the alignment and zzso zzso space of the zzso the new approach supports dynamic ring flexibility and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Second, knowledge of well established molecular interactions between zzso fragments and a target protein can be directly exploited to guide the search zzso This offers advantages in some cases over the search strategy where zzso alignment is guided solely by a zzso (a zzso molecular representation of an idealized zzso zzso are presented on both zzso accuracy and screening utility using multiple publicly available benchmark data sets that place zzso performance in the context of other molecular zzso zzso In terms of zzso zzso zzso zzso performs as well as the best available zzso In the area of screening utility, zzso performance is extremely zzso and it is clearly superior to other methods within the set of cases for which comparative data are available, with roughly double the screening enrichment zzso
