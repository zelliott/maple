With the availability of whole zzso sequence in many species, linkage analysis, zzso cloning and zzso are gradually becoming powerful tools for investigating the links between zzso and zzso or zzso However, in these methods, zzso genes underlying a quantitative trait zzso or a disease, are usually located within a large zzso region or a large set of zzso zzso the function of every gene is very time consuming and needs to retrieve and integrate the information from multiple databases or zzso zzso zzso is a software tool for automatically matching zzso to genes from a defined zzso region or a group of given genes by combining the mapping information from the zzso database and gene function information from the zzso and zzso zzso zzso is currently available for candidate gene search of human, zzso zzso zzso and 12 other zzso
