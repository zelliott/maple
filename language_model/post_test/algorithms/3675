zzso significantly contributes to an zzso zzso zzso with zzso fat content have a zzso chance of developing primary zzso zzso The current practice of evaluating a zzso and zzso zzso stained donor biopsy by visual interpretation is zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso of frozen sections fails to accurately estimate the degree of zzso present within a given liver zzso To address this problem of evaluating zzso in prospective donor zzso we developed a fast, user friendly computer methodology to zzso assess fat content based on the differential zzso of color zzso in Oil Red O zzso stained liver zzso 

The accuracy of human visual zzso of fat content by zzso and zzso zzso was compared with computer-based zzso of the same slides from 25 frozen sections of donor zzso 

zzso with a fat content zzso showed marked variation between human interpretation and computer zzso There was also a significant difference in the human interpretation of fat based on the method of zzso This difference ranged from 3 to 37% with zzso 

Use of zzso resulted in a more consistent zzso of liver zzso compared with zzso but human interpretations failed to correlate with computer zzso Such differences in fat content zzso might result in the rejection of a potentially zzso organ or the acceptance of a marginal zzso zzso our protocol can rapidly be applied to clinical practice for accurate and consistent measurement of fat in liver sections for the ultimate purpose of increasing the number of successful zzso zzso
