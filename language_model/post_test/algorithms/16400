The accurate determination of zzso and zzso relationships is essential for comparative sequence analysis, functional gene zzso and evolutionary zzso Various methods have been developed based on either simple blast zzso zzso comparisons and/or time-consuming zzso tree zzso 

We have developed zzso a new software system incorporating an original zzso for the rapid detection of zzso and zzso relations between different zzso In comparisons with existing methods, zzso improves detection sensitivity, with a minimal loss of zzso In addition, several zzso tools have been developed to facilitate in-depth studies based on these zzso The software has been used to study the zzso relationships for a large set of zzso protein sequences from 59 different zzso zzso 

zzso is a new software system for zzso zzso It is made available as an independent software suite that can be downloaded and installed for local zzso Command line zzso zzso the integration of the software in high zzso processing pipelines and a zzso interface provides easy, intuitive access to results for the zzso
