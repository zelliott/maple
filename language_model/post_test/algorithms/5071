Global zzso based on zzso associations of zzso has not previously been used to define zzso blocks within zzso Here, we define an association index based on zzso between zzso zzso We use the zzso exact test to assess the statistical significance of the zzso zzso By this test, each zzso pair is characterized as zzso independent, or zzso We set limits on the maximum acceptable proportion of independent pairs within all blocks and search for the zzso with zzso proportion of associated zzso zzso Essentially, this model is reduced to a constrained zzso problem, the solution of which is obtained by zzso a dynamic programming zzso 

In comparison with other methods, our zzso reports blocks of larger average zzso Nevertheless, the zzso diversity within the blocks is captured by a small number of zzso zzso zzso zzso under a zzso model of zzso showed that our zzso is robust in zzso the same zzso for zzso zzso Our zzso performed better than previously reported models in a zzso association study aimed at mapping a single locus zzso based on simulation results that were evaluated by a zzso statistical zzso Compared to methods of zzso block zzso we performed best on detection of zzso zzso 

Our proposed method divides zzso into the regions within which zzso associations of zzso pairs are zzso This approach presents a native design for dimension reduction in zzso association zzso Our results show that the zzso zzso association of zzso can describe various features of zzso variation, in particular zzso zzso
