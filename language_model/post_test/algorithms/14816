zzso of accumulated data is a standard technique applied to processing data with low zzso ratios zzso such as image signals captured in zzso zzso The authors propose an architecture layout of an zzso image sensor capable of zzso signal zzso The very high frame rate is enabled by employing an image sensor structure with a zzso zzso in each zzso which serves as an in zzso image signal zzso The signal zzso function is achieved by direct connection of the first and the last storage elements of the in zzso storage zzso It has been thought that the zzso is achievable only by driving zzso with complicated and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the driving zzso to overcome the difficulty are presented for zzso and zzso transfer zzso zzso The in zzso storage image sensor with the signal zzso function is named Image Signal zzso Sensor zzso
