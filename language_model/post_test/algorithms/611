This study was aimed at investigating the correlation between zzso of exposure to zzso aromatic zzso and, more specifically, at examining the role of urinary zzso zzso as a reliable measure of internal dose linked to the zzso tissue burden zzso assessed as zzso binding of the ultimate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with cellular proteins in target zzso The protocol included experimental zzso of a previously proposed zzso for adjustment of reference values for urinary zzso with exposure to different zzso of zzso aromatic zzso in a rat zzso zzso the relationships between zzso in liver, zzso and heart as well as the zzso zzso level on the one hand, and zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso on the other hand have been zzso Male zzso rats received zzso once daily for 10 consecutive days, zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in three different exposure scenarios corresponding to zzso ratios of zzso 1 and 5, with three doses of zzso zzso 6 and 20 zzso for each zzso The zzso levels were measured as the ultimate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained after mild acid zzso of zzso zzso with zzso It was zzso confirmed that: zzso urinary zzso is a reliable zzso linked to the zzso in zzso that are targets for zzso such as zzso for the zzso ratios of zzso and 1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso urinary zzso is correlated with the zzso zzso for all three exposure scenarios ( zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso The experimental relationship between zzso and urinary zzso was used to zzso biological limit values for the urinary zzso assuming three arbitrary critical levels of zzso These were compared with the values calculated from the zzso using the zzso ratio 1 mixture as a zzso The ratios of calculated to observed values varied from zzso to zzso for the zzso zzso mixture, and from zzso to zzso for the zzso 5 zzso The results obtained in the present study indicate that the zzso mentioned above applies well for two of the three exposure scenarios corresponding to realistic occupational zzso ratios of zzso and zzso This suggests that, using zzso as an zzso the proposed zzso will reasonably predict the critical value of urinary zzso for zzso having different zzso zzso zzso linear relationships between zzso in all chosen zzso and zzso or zzso zzso were obtained with urinary zzso than with their zzso zzso Thus urinary zzso and zzso are more reliable zzso in biological monitoring zzso
