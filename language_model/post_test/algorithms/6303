A zzso zzso study of zzso zzso of cocaine with flexible 3 zzso is zzso A series of zzso models were generated based on three representative compounds zzso zzso and zzso using the zzso Algorithm zzso Program zzso zzso The flexible zzso of all studied compounds was performed for each zzso model using the zzso zzso and the three-dimensional structure of zzso as a zzso All sets of the zzso structures with the top-ranked zzso were used for zzso zzso Two best initial zzso models were selected and further zzso by identifying the zzso zzso of each zzso Compared with the initial models, the conventional correlation zzso zzso for the zzso models 1 and 2 were improved from zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso models 1 and 2 were improved from zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso zzso The results of the two zzso models suggest that both zzso and zzso interactions play important roles in the binding of the 3 zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso The contributions from zzso and zzso fields for model 1 were zzso and zzso zzso The contributions from zzso and zzso fields for model 2 were zzso and zzso zzso The two highly zzso zzso models indicate that the 3 zzso has two possible binding modes at the zzso The zzso zzso maps provide a visual representation of prospective binding modes of the 3 zzso of the zzso zzso of cocaine and can be used to design novel zzso zzso that may be useful for the treatment of cocaine abuse and certain neurological zzso
