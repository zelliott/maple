Image guidance in zzso and zzso zzso offers the potential for precise radiation dose delivery to a moving zzso Recent work has demonstrated how to locate and track the position of a zzso in real-time using diagnostic zzso imaging to find implanted zzso zzso However, the delivery of a treatment plan through gating or beam tracking requires adequate consideration of treatment system zzso including image zzso image processing, communication delays, control system processing, zzso within the zzso mechanical zzso zzso Furthermore, the imaging dose given over long zzso procedures or multiple zzso zzso may not be zzso which means that we must reduce the sampling rate of the imaging zzso This study evaluates various zzso models for reducing zzso zzso errors when a real-time zzso system targets a moving zzso at a slow imaging rate and with large system zzso We consider 14 lung zzso cases where the zzso motion is greater than 8 zzso and compare the zzso error using linear zzso neural network prediction and Kalman zzso against a system which uses no zzso To evaluate prediction accuracy for use in beam zzso we zzso the root mean squared error between predicted and actual zzso zzso We found that by using zzso root mean squared error is improved for all zzso and all imaging rates zzso To evaluate prediction accuracy for use in gated treatment, we present a new metric that compares a gating control signal based on predicted motion against the best possible gating control zzso We found that using prediction improves gated treatment accuracy for systems that have zzso of 200 zzso or greater, and for systems that have imaging rates of 10 zzso or zzso
