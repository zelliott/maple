Heart murmurs are pathological sounds produced by turbulent blood flow due to certain cardiac defects such as valves zzso zzso of murmurs via zzso is a task that depends on the proficiency of zzso There are many cases in which the accuracy of detection is zzso The purpose of this study is development of a new mathematical model of zzso murmurs to extract their crucial features for identifying the heart zzso A high resolution algorithm, zzso matching zzso was used to model the murmurs by zzso them into a series of zzso zzso zzso Then, a novel zzso feature extraction method which uses the model parameters was performed to identify the cardiac sound zzso The proposed framework was applied to a database of 70 heart sound signals containing 35 normal and 35 abnormal zzso We achieved zzso accuracy in distinguishing subjects with zzso diseases using a zzso zzso as compared to the matching zzso features with an accuracy of zzso
