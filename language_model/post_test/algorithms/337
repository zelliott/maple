A zzso model that makes it possible to consider the numerous biological and physical parameters of cellular zzso zzso by zzso zzso was zzso It allows for the calculation of zzso and zzso zzso of specific energy within a cell nucleus or a whole cell in any zzso zzso zzso are considered either to be isolated or to be packed in a zzso or a zzso The method of calculating energy deposits is zzso and is based on the zzso zzso A model of cell survival, calculated from the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso was also zzso The zzso of calculations was validated by comparison with two general zzso Carlo zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso determined by these three codes showed good agreement for numerous geometrical zzso The zzso method was far more efficient in terms of calculation time: A gain of more than 1000 was observed when using our model compared with zzso Carlo zzso Good agreements were also observed with previously published zzso
