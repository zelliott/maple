In this article, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso process problem is performed revealing the existence of multiple optimum zzso The globally optimum solution was determined using the zzso global zzso solver zzso A branch and bound strategy zzso and the global search and zzso zzso in the zzso global zzso zzso were successful in determining locally optimum solutions and these results are validated by plotting the objective function against the decision zzso While in some cases all the strategies were successful in obtaining the globally optimum solutions, an example is presented where the most beneficial product value, which is not a stationary point and lies on the feasible boundary, is obtained by the zzso global zzso solver (but not the other zzso as the globally optimum zzso The zzso model was used to model the zzso of the zzso zzso While several articles have been published demonstrating the existence of zzso and zzso in this model, the challenges posed by this model to zzso has never been investigated so far and this work attempts to do zzso Both dilution rate and the oxygen mass transfer zzso were used as the decision variables individually and zzso
