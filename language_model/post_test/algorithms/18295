We present two efficient zzso zzso Carlo zzso in the grand zzso ensemble with which the chemical zzso corresponding to prescribed zzso partial zzso can be zzso The first zzso works by always using the targeted zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso terms and updating the excess chemical zzso from the previous zzso The second zzso zzso the chemical zzso in the next iteration from the results of the previous iteration using a first order series expansion of the zzso The zzso of the series, the derivatives of the zzso with respect to the chemical zzso are obtained from the simulations by fluctuation zzso The convergence of this procedure is shown for the examples of a homogeneous zzso mixture and a zzso zzso mixture in the primitive zzso The methods are quite robust under the conditions zzso The first zzso is less sensitive to initial zzso
