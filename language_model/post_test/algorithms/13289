In order to understand the zzso zzso in reinforcement learning, previous theoretical and empirical accounts have suggested that increased uncertainty may zzso the decision to explore an alternative zzso To date, the neural mechanisms that support the strategic application of zzso exploration remain zzso In this study, zzso zzso was used to assess zzso dynamics relevant to exploration and zzso zzso activities over middle and lateral frontal areas have previously been implicated in zzso studies of reinforcement learning and strategic zzso It was hypothesized that these areas may interact during zzso strategic behavioral control involved in exploratory zzso Here, we used a dynamic zzso task and an associated mathematical model that predicted individual response zzso This zzso model generated zzso prediction errors and zzso estimates of exploration as a function of zzso zzso zzso power correlated with unsigned prediction error, although negative prediction errors had greater power zzso zzso variations in zzso frontal zzso were zzso related to relative uncertainty and were larger in individuals who used uncertainty to guide zzso This finding suggests that zzso activities reflect zzso strategic control during exploratory zzso
