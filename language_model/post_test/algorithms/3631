Differing arresting agents and protocols can be used to zzso cells in cultures to specific zzso of the cell when studying zzso gene zzso Often, data derived from individual experiments are analyzed zzso since no appropriate statistical methodology is available at the moment to analyze the data from all such experiments zzso The focus of this paper is to determine the association and zzso of the relative zzso times of zzso genes under different experimental zzso Using a zzso zzso model, we define two zzso a rotation zzso for the angular difference between zzso arresting times zzso in two zzso experiments, and an association zzso to describe the correspondence between the cycle times of zzso expression zzso zzso for a set of genes studied in two zzso Further, we propose a procedure to assess zzso across multiple experiments, zzso to what extent the circular ordering of the phase angles of genes is maintained across multiple zzso zzso of genes across experiments suggests that functionally these genes tend to respond in a zzso zzso way under different experimental zzso Our proposed methodology is illustrated by applying it to a zzso zzso zzso zzso
