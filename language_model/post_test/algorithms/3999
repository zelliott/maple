zzso zzso zzso zzso enables the acquisition of zzso zzso in a zzso In spite of its promising potential, the accessible spectral zzso is highly limited by the maximum zzso zzso which limits the general zzso of the zzso A number of solutions have been recently described to deal with this zzso among which stands the possibility to record several zzso zzso However, this alternative acquisition scheme leads to numerous ghost zzso characteristic of zzso zzso These zzso highly affect the zzso of zzso zzso for structural zzso as well as their quantitative zzso Here, we propose several zzso or zzso processing corrections to clean zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso Their performances are zzso and their zzso are illustrated in a small organic zzso zzso zzso processing corrections such as zzso zzso zzso or zzso appear to be the most efficient ones in terms of zzso zzso While not purely zzso these strategies open new perspectives towards the routine use of zzso zzso zzso for structural or quantitative zzso
