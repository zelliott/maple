zzso zzso during and following prostate zzso may have a negative impact on implant zzso The purpose of this study was to assess the magnitude of prostate zzso during the operative procedure and to develop a zzso of isotope activity required for compensation of such zzso prostate volume zzso 

Twenty-five consecutive patients with zzso localized zzso of the prostate underwent zzso zzso zzso permanent prostate zzso with either zzso 125 or palladium zzso zzso ultrasound volume studies of the prostate were performed before and during the implant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed zzso weeks after zzso 

A median zzso prostate volume increase after zzso of zzso needles of zzso zzso zzso was zzso A correlation of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso between the minimum dose covering zzso of the prostate volume zzso and the amount of zzso was zzso An zzso and zzso was developed to calculate the extra isotope activity necessary to compensate for zzso zzso 

zzso zzso occurs at the time of zzso needle zzso A negative correlation was found between the amount of zzso and dose coverage of the prostate zzso zzso to cover the prostate volume zzso additional isotope activity is required when zzso treatment planning is zzso This zzso can be used to compensate for such volume zzso
