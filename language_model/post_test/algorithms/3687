zzso applications of structured zzso zzso zzso often suffer from various zzso that result from imprecise instrumental hardware and certain zzso properties of the zzso These zzso can be observed as residual stripe patterns originating from the zzso zzso We investigated some significant causes of these zzso and developed a correction approach that can be applied to images after zzso Most of the zzso can be attributed to changes in zzso and detection zzso during zzso The proposed correction zzso has been shown to be functional on noisy image data, and produces zzso zzso results in everyday laboratory zzso
