The importance of zzso human zzso zzso zzso matching for the clinical outcome of unrelated zzso stem cell transplantation zzso is zzso We have previously described an zzso for zzso zzso disparities involving zzso based on zzso zzso zzso By revisiting the zzso of zzso a modified zzso was developed and zzso tested in zzso unrelated zzso facilitated through the Italian zzso for zzso adult zzso The modified zzso proved to be markedly more zzso of outcome than the original one, with significantly higher zzso probabilities of zzso survival in zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso This was the result of increased adjusted hazards of zzso mortality zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but not of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The increase in the hazards of overall mortality by zzso zzso disparity was similar in 10 of 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and 9 of 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso These data call for revisiting current zzso matching strategies for unrelated zzso suggesting that searches should be directed zzso toward identification of zzso zzso 10 of 10 or 9 of 10 matched zzso
