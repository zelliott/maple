A method called zzso Chemical zzso zzso has recently been introduced as a novel approach to zzso molecular zzso (for example, zzso versus zzso The underlying pattern recognition zzso was first introduced in computer science and then adopted for applications in medicinal chemistry and compound zzso A special feature is its ability to accurately zzso molecules on the basis of very small training sets containing only a few zzso This feature is highly relevant for virtual compound screening when only very few experimental hits are available as zzso Here we adopt zzso calculations to simulate sequential screening using an experimental zzso screening zzso data set containing zzso of zzso zzso In doing so, we focus on minimizing the number of database compounds that need to be evaluated in order to identify a substantial fraction of available zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso calculations recover on average between approximately zzso and approximately zzso of available hits in the data set while dramatically reducing the number of compounds that need to be tested to between approximately zzso and approximately zzso of the screening zzso
