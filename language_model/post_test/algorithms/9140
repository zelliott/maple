A new sensor system for measuring contraction and relaxation of muscles by using a zzso ring zzso is zzso The small scale optical device is designed and configured to perform the zzso effects between the changes in optical device phase shift and human facial muscle movement, which can be used to form the relationship between optical phase shift and muscle zzso By using the zzso and zzso programs, the results obtained have shown that the measurement of the contraction and relaxation of muscles can be obtained after the muscle movements, in which the unique pattern of individual muscle movement from facial expression can be zzso The obtained simulation results, that is, interference signal patterns, can be used to form the various pattern zzso which are useful for the human machine interface and the human computer interface application and discussed in zzso
