Despite important advances in zzso molecular zzso of tumors, its application in clinical settings remains zzso This is in part due to the limitation of current analysis programs in discovering robust zzso and developing zzso with a practical set of zzso zzso programming zzso is a type of machine learning technique that uses evolutionary zzso to simulate natural selection as well as population zzso hence leading to simple and comprehensible zzso Here we applied zzso to cancer expression profiling data to select feature genes and build molecular zzso by mathematical integration of these zzso Analysis of thousands of zzso zzso generated for a prostate cancer data set revealed repetitive use of a set of highly zzso feature zzso many of which are known to be disease zzso zzso zzso often comprise five or less genes and successfully predict cancer types and zzso More importantly, zzso zzso generated in one study are able to predict samples from an independent study, which may have used different zzso zzso In addition, zzso yielded zzso accuracy better than or similar to conventional zzso zzso Furthermore, the mathematical expression of zzso zzso provides insights into relationships between zzso zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that zzso may be valuable for generating effective zzso containing a practical set of genes for zzso cancer zzso
