We report molecular dynamics simulations for zzso molecules composed of two zzso zzso zzso zzso cages connected by one hydrocarbon backbone dissolved in liquid normal zzso zzso are novel hybrid zzso molecules that are useful as building blocks for the synthesis of zzso zzso By including zzso molecules within a zzso material it is possible to modify mechanical properties such as resistance to heat and glass transition zzso Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms responsible for these enhancements are at present not completely zzso In an effort to zzso the molecular phenomena responsible for these effects, we have studied the zzso of zzso zzso molecules in solution, as well as their zzso zzso as a function of the length of the hydrocarbon zzso We focus on molecules in which the radius of zzso of the zzso backbone is comparable to the size of the zzso zzso Our results indicate that the backbone has a significant influence on both the equilibrium and the transport properties of dissolved zzso hybrid zzso These observations are useful for developing strategies to direct the zzso of zzso zzso
