The present number of zzso zzso adopted in relationship testing is chiefly limited to zzso zzso in most cases residing on different zzso In order to solve more complex cases of zzso zzso deficient zzso and disputed zzso the number of core zzso can be zzso The inclusion of multiple zzso on the same zzso will, however, increase the risk of possible linkage between zzso We present a new software, zzso freely available from zzso that can perform statistical calculations based on pedigree structures and account for linkage between pairs of zzso In addition, zzso can simulate zzso data in order to study the effect of accounting for linkage or zzso We demonstrate the importance of taking linkage properly into account using examples and real zzso
