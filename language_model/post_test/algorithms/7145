A novel approach of zzso baseline wander correction based on zzso filter and empirical mode decomposition is presented in this zzso The low frequency parts of the original signals were removed by the mean median filter in a zzso way to obtain the baseline wander zzso then its series of zzso were sifted by zzso after empirical mode zzso The proposed method, tested by the zzso signals in zzso zzso database and European zzso database, is more effective compared with other baseline wander removal zzso
