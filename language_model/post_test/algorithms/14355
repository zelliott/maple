Single zzso zzso zzso serve as effective markers for zzso disease zzso zzso but current zzso technologies are inadequate for zzso all available zzso markers in a typical zzso zzso Much attention has recently been paid to methods for selecting the minimal zzso subset of zzso in identifying zzso but there has been little investigation of the effect of missing or erroneous zzso on the performance of these zzso selection zzso and subsequent association tests using the selected tagging zzso The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of missing zzso or zzso error on tagging zzso selection and subsequent single marker and zzso association tests using the selected tagging zzso 

Through two sets of simulations, we evaluated the performance of three tagging zzso selection programs in the presence of missing or erroneous zzso zzso diversity based program zzso zzso linkage zzso zzso based program zzso and zzso zzso of determination based program zzso 

When randomly selected known zzso were zzso as zzso we found that the average number of tagging zzso selected by all three zzso changed very little and the power of subsequent single marker and zzso association tests using the selected tagging zzso remained close to the power of these tests in the absence of missing zzso When random zzso errors were introduced, we found that the average number of tagging zzso selected by all three zzso zzso In data sets simulated according to the zzso zzso in the zzso region, zzso program had larger increase than zzso and zzso zzso In data sets simulated under the zzso model, zzso program had the largest increase and zzso program had the smallest zzso In both sets of simulations, with the presence of zzso zzso the power of the zzso tests from all three programs decreased quickly, but there was not much reduction in power of the single marker zzso 

Missing zzso do not seem to have much impact on tagging zzso selection and subsequent single marker and zzso association zzso In contrast, zzso errors could have severe impact on tagging zzso selection and zzso tests, but not on single marker zzso
