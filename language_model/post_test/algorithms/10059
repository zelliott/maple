zzso operator models zzso are a class of models for zzso processes that properly zzso the class that can be modeled by zzso hidden zzso models zzso One of the main advantages of zzso over zzso is that they admit zzso correct learning zzso A series of learning zzso has been developed, with increasing zzso and statistical efficiency, whose recent culmination was the zzso zzso zzso developed by the first zzso The zzso zzso is an zzso zzso correct zzso that yields (and zzso an assured upper bound on the modeling zzso The run time is faster by at least one order of magnitude than zzso zzso learning zzso and yields significantly more accurate models than the zzso Here we present a significant improvement of the zzso zzso the constructive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso the main idea of minimizing an upper bound on the modeling error but is constructive where zzso needs zzso As a consequence, we obtain further gains in learning speed without loss in modeling zzso
