Current zzso screens for zzso zzso zzso predict a large number of zzso regions containing potential structural zzso The analysis of these data requires highly accurate prediction of zzso boundaries and discrimination of promising candidate zzso from weak zzso zzso methods struggle with these goals because they rely on zzso multiple sequence zzso which regularly zzso zzso structure and therefore do not support identification of structural zzso To overcome this zzso we zzso zzso and global zzso of alignments based on sequence and structure zzso we refer to these zzso alignment zzso as zzso The zzso zzso of zzso or zzso profiles, provide a versatile tool for the manual and automatic analysis of zzso In particular, we improve the boundary prediction of the widely used zzso gene zzso zzso by a factor of 3 from a median zzso of 47 to 13 zzso zzso zzso predictions, zzso zzso score allows much stronger discrimination between zzso and zzso predictions than zzso own zzso The improved zzso in this scenario increased from zzso zzso to zzso zzso significantly reduces the cost of successive analysis zzso The zzso software tool zzso produces zzso multiple zzso alignments with associated zzso zzso and predicts zzso zzso We provide additional results, a web server for zzso and the software package, including documentation and a pipeline for refining screens for structural zzso at zzso
