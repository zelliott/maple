zzso zzso zzso control of heart rate zzso by poorly understood zzso The authors examined whether zzso central nervous system cardiovascular regulatory sites are required for zzso zzso 

The effects of zzso (1 and 2 rat minimum zzso concentration zzso on the zzso control of zzso were determined in sham intact and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were used to measure zzso responses to peak changes in mean zzso pressure zzso zzso zzso curve fits to zzso data assessed zzso sensitivity zzso zzso range, lower and upper zzso zzso and zzso at half the zzso range zzso Four groups zzso brain intact and two zzso were studied before, zzso and after zzso To assess sympathetic and zzso contributions to zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were administered zzso 

zzso did not alter resting zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso depressed zzso slope and zzso range in zzso and zzso zzso In both groups, 1 MAC reduced zzso range by depressing peak zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso during increases in blood pressure was relatively zzso zzso during 1 MAC did not alter maximum zzso zzso In contrast, zzso during 1 MAC fully blocked zzso zzso zzso 1 MAC predominantly zzso sympathetic components of zzso zzso zzso at 2 MAC depressed both zzso zzso and decreased zzso in both zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso control by actions that do not require zzso central nervous system zzso zzso actions seem to inhibit zzso zzso primarily by the sympathetic nervous zzso
