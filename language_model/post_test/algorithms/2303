The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of predicting zzso bench press zzso strength zzso from relative endurance performance in various groups of zzso The subjects included untrained students zzso zzso zzso resistance trained students zzso zzso zzso college wrestlers zzso zzso zzso soccer players zzso zzso zzso football players zzso zzso zzso high school students zzso zzso zzso and zzso middle-aged men zzso zzso zzso Each subject performed a zzso test according to the same standard zzso Within zzso days, the subject selected a weight to perform as many repetitions as possible to zzso Six relative endurance prediction equations produced zzso zzso of r zzso zzso to zzso in each group and r zzso zzso to zzso in the composite group zzso zzso zzso In subjects completing zzso or zzso 10 zzso three equations significantly zzso and two significantly zzso zzso zzso The zzso equation was the most zzso In subjects completing zzso 10 repetitions to failure, three equations significantly zzso and three significantly zzso zzso zzso While caution should be used when employing relative muscular endurance performance to estimate zzso strength in the bench press, the average of two equations may reduce the zzso
