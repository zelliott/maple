The study involved a total of 250 wild ducks representing 17 species of three ecologically different zzso the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso obtained mainly from fishermen and hunters, were examined for the presence of zzso using the generally accepted zzso zzso of zzso zzso structure were conducted with methods described in the zzso In addition, significance of differences in intensity of infestation was determined in relation to the zzso age and sex as grouping zzso zzso of differences in infestation prevalence was tested with the zzso zzso test or its modifications zzso test, zzso test with zzso zzso and the exact zzso zzso while the zzso U test was applied to infestation intensity and relative zzso zzso zzso were ordered using the cluster analysis module of the zzso zzso computer zzso Ward's zzso was used for zzso zzso distance being applied as the similarity zzso The ducks examined were found to host a highly diverse zzso zzso consisting of a total of 22 species representing the following 7 families: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the core of the zzso being formed by the following 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in the ducks examined was found to be characterized by a high organ zzso as the zzso selected mainly the gizzard and zzso as their zzso (10 and 8 typical species, zzso and firmly avoided the zzso and zzso Individual zzso species were observed to show a clear preference with respect to location in the zzso zzso zzso which means that, for a distinct majority of the zzso species, typical sites could be zzso No significant effects of zzso age and sex on zzso infestation parameters could be revealed, although - in certain species - those variables proved of a key importance for their zzso The zzso showing a distinct preference towards young birds include zzso zzso and zzso zzso a still higher specificity being displayed by T zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso young zzso and zzso zzso zzso with respect to young zzso The species which were more frequently recorded in the ducks aged two years and more, particularly in the adult zzso include zzso zzso and zzso zzso A clear relationship between the ecology of a host and the structure of its zzso zzso zzso was zzso Each of the tribes was distinct in the specific zzso of its members, each zzso possessing its own zzso zzso The zzso of swimming ducks zzso consisted of 11 species, the core being formed by zzso zzso zzso zzso T zzso and zzso zzso The diving ducks zzso were found to host 8 zzso species, the core being formed by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso was found to consist of as many as 17 species, although one of them zzso zzso was a distinct zzso The zzso zzso of those birds showed also a relatively high proportion of zzso zzso the most zzso zzso recorded in 10 host species of all the tribes zzso Although the problem of habitat zzso between various components of a zzso zzso could not be zzso zzso it was evident that cases of zzso involved mainly zzso at different sections of the zzso tract of the same host, the strongest relations being found for those species that formed the core of a zzso zzso zzso affecting a zzso organ concerned almost exclusively representatives of the families zzso and zzso in the gizzard and those of the zzso and zzso in the zzso The similarities between zzso of the ducks studied are only zzso related to the systematic position of the respective zzso much stronger relationships with ecological characteristics zzso food type and feeding zzso were zzso It seems that this is why the zzso of Common zzso is much more similar to that of the zzso than to that of the zzso to which the species is zzso zzso
