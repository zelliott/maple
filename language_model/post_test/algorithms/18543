The power of zzso comparison for biological discovery is well zzso The need for new capabilities to zzso and compare zzso alignment data is intensified by the growing number of zzso sequence zzso being generated for an ever-increasing number of zzso To be efficient these zzso zzso must support the ability to accommodate consistently a wide range of evolutionary distances in a comparison framework based upon zzso zzso 

We have developed zzso an interactive tool for analyzing multiple alignments by visualizing a similarity measure for multiple DNA zzso The complexity of visual presentation is effectively organized using a framework based upon zzso zzso zzso The zzso organization supports zzso zzso zzso zzso To aid in navigation through large sequence zzso zzso zzso concepts from zzso that provide a user with the ability to select and view data at varying zzso The combination of zzso data zzso and analysis, combined with the zzso framework for zzso comparison, produces a highly flexible and powerful tool for visual data analysis of multiple sequence zzso 

zzso is available at zzso It requires an Internet browser with zzso Plug-in zzso and it is integrated into the global alignment program zzso at zzso
