zzso health-care promises tailored health-care solutions to individual patients based on their genetic background and/or environmental exposure zzso To date, disease prediction has been based on a few environmental factors and/or single zzso zzso zzso while complex diseases are usually affected by many genetic and environmental factors with each factor contributing a small portion to the zzso We hypothesized that the use of random forests zzso to select zzso would result in an improved zzso model of asthma zzso We tested this hypothesis in a population of childhood zzso 

In this study, using emergency room visits or zzso as the definition of a severe asthma zzso we first identified a list of top Genome Wide Association Study zzso zzso ranked by Random zzso zzso importance score for the zzso zzso zzso Management zzso population of zzso zzso cases and 290 zzso zzso We predict severe asthma zzso using the top 10 to 320 zzso together with age, sex, zzso zzso percentage predicted, and treatment zzso 

Testing in an independent set of the zzso population shows that severe asthma zzso can be predicted with an Area Under the zzso zzso with zzso zzso in comparison to an zzso score of zzso with 10 zzso Using the clinical traits alone yielded zzso score of zzso suggesting the zzso is affected by genetic as well as environmental zzso 

Our study shows that a random forests zzso can effectively extract and use the information contained in a small number of zzso Random forests, and other machine learning tools, can be used with zzso studies to integrate large numbers of zzso zzso
