zzso analysis and zzso association (also referred to as linkage zzso studies are two major approaches for mapping genes that control simple or complex traits in plants, animals, and zzso But these two approaches have limited utility when used alone, because they use only part of the information that is available for a mapping zzso More recently, a new mapping strategy has been designed to integrate the advantages of linkage analysis and linkage zzso analysis for zzso mapping in zzso zzso The new strategy makes use of a random sample from a zzso population and the zzso progeny of the zzso In this article, we extend the new strategy to map quantitative trait zzso zzso using molecular markers within the zzso zzso zzso The most significant advantage of this extension is that both linkage and linkage zzso between a marker and zzso can be estimated zzso thus increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of zzso mapping for recalcitrant zzso zzso zzso studies are performed to test the statistical properties of the zzso of genetic and zzso parameters including zzso zzso frequency, zzso effects, zzso position, and the linkage zzso of the zzso and a zzso The potential utility of our mapping strategy is zzso
