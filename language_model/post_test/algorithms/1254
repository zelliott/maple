In most zzso cancer zzso finding a correspondence between various genetic zzso within a gene zzso and a patient's clinical cancer history zzso is zzso to date there are few clinically meaningful correlations between specific DNA zzso zzso and corresponding cancer zzso To define possible zzso and zzso zzso we evaluated the application of data mining methodology zzso the clinical cancer histories of zzso patients were used to define valid or zzso patterns for a specific DNA zzso zzso The clinical histories of patients with their corresponding detailed attributes without the same zzso zzso zzso were labeled incorrect or zzso zzso The results of data mining technology yielded characterizing rules for the true cases that constituted clinical features which predicted the zzso zzso Some of the initial results derived correlations already independently known in the literature, adding to the confidence of using this zzso zzso
