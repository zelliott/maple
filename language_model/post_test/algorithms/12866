Growth monitoring is the method of choice in many zzso measuring the presence or properties of zzso zzso in zzso and food zzso zzso methods, relying on zzso large numbers of bacteria, are rather zzso while in zzso time often is zzso Several new approaches have been published, mostly aiming at zzso growth or other properties of a small number of zzso However, no method so far readily achieves zzso resolution with a convenient and easy to handle setup that offers the possibility for automation and high zzso We demonstrate these benefits in this study by employing zzso capturing of bacteria in zzso zzso structures, optical detection and automated bacteria identification and counting with image analysis zzso For a zzso experiment we chose an zzso zzso test with zzso coli and zzso zzso Growth monitoring is demonstrated on single cells and the impact of the zzso on the growth rate is zzso The minimum zzso concentration as a standard diagnostic zzso is derived from a zzso zzso This report is the basis for further integration of image analysis code into device zzso Ultimately, an automated and zzso setup may be created, using an optical zzso and many of the zzso structures zzso zzso data for a sound statistical evaluation and a confirmation of the initial findings can then be generated in a single zzso
