Inspired by the successful description of the first steps of molecular evolution by the zzso theory and the successful application of zzso zzso to zzso problems, we propose a zzso organized zzso This new zzso is able to solve a spin glass and a travelling salesman problem using only point zzso Furthermore, it performs better under comparable circumstances than the ordinary zzso zzso Depending on the structure of the fitness landscape of the examined problem under consideration the zzso organized zzso proves to be much more suitable than a simple zzso algorithm, especially in clustered zzso zzso the error rates reveals the critical minimum copy zzso necessary to guarantee zzso We propose to incorporate zzso concepts into zzso zzso inspired by biological evolution, such a genetic zzso
