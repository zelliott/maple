zzso graph zzso is a hybrid zzso zzso model zzso capable of modeling zzso relationships among random zzso So far, however, its application in image and video analysis is very limited due to lack of zzso learning and zzso methods for a zzso of general zzso To overcome this zzso we introduce methods to extend the conventional zzso zzso model to zzso model with more general zzso and the associated methods for learning and zzso in such a general zzso zzso Specifically, we propose techniques to systematically construct a generally structured zzso to zzso this model, to derive its joint probability distribution, to perform joint zzso learning, and to perform zzso zzso in this zzso To demonstrate the utility of such an extended zzso we apply it to two challenging image and video analysis problems: human activity recognition and image zzso The experimental results show improved performance of the extended zzso model over the conventional directed or zzso zzso This study demonstrates the promise of the extended zzso for effective modeling and zzso of complex real-world zzso
