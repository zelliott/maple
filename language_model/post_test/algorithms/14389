To calculate the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the liver, right zzso left kidney and spinal cord, as well as the global Uncomplicated zzso Control zzso zzso in gastric cancer patients who underwent a treatment with zzso after radical surgery in our zzso 

In April 2000, a zzso chemotherapy zzso protocol started in the province of zzso for zzso zzso with zzso stage II or higher zzso and/or zzso This clinical protocol served as a base for our zzso and zzso retrospective zzso zzso A virtual simulation and a zzso planning were made in all zzso The differential zzso selected for each patient were obtained for the 4 zzso at risk zzso zzso reduction was made by the zzso and zzso zzso Volume zzso zzso calculations by zzso zzso The following variables were zzso zzso dose for each organ zzso zzso Volume zzso zzso zzso zzso for each organ of the zzso global zzso for each zzso zzso between the 2 treatment techniques were zzso zzso versus zzso zzso For the zzso calculations the computer application zzso zzso was zzso 

29 patients to assess with an average age of 54 zzso 10 years zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The technique used was the field technique zzso in the zzso zzso and with 4 fields in zzso zzso of the zzso The global damage is estimated in zzso with a range between 0 and zzso This goes up to zzso with the zzso technique, with a wide range between 2 and zzso and it remains reduced to zzso within a range between 0 and zzso when 4 fields are zzso There were significant differences concerning the estimated damage probability zzso on liver, spinal zzso and left zzso depending on the use of two or four zzso 

zzso and the global zzso values of the zzso at risk allow to compare a technique net benefit from another in each particular case, although in our theoretical study the comparison was done among the zzso It is important to stress that the calculations of the zzso and zzso have a limited quantitative signification but they are useful and beneficial in order to decide between treatment plans when they are supported by the clinical zzso
