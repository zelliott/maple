: To demonstrate the feasibility of developing a zzso zzso zzso liver phantom for dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging and to report initial results of use of the phantom for quantitative CT zzso zzso 

: zzso zzso were obtained from completed surgical studies and zzso with saline and zzso The phantom was placed in a zzso zzso acrylic container and connected to a zzso circuit fitted with a contrast injection zzso zzso zzso imaging experiments were performed using zzso and zzso zzso zzso CT zzso CT zzso protocols were used to obtain portal zzso and zzso zzso vascular enhancement, reproduced over a period of 4 to 6 zzso CT zzso protocols were used at different input flow rates to correlate input flow with calculated tissue zzso to test zzso and to determine the feasibility of simultaneous zzso liver zzso zzso analysis of the liver phantom was also zzso 

: CT zzso zzso reconstructions demonstrated zzso zzso and zzso branching of the portal zzso system to the periphery of all zzso of the liver as well as enhancement of the zzso zzso system to all zzso of the liver and gallbladder throughout the study zzso For zzso CT, the correlation between the calculated mean tissue zzso in a volume of interest and input pump flow rate was excellent (R zzso zzso and color blood flow maps demonstrated variations in regional zzso in a narrow zzso Repeat zzso CT experiments demonstrated zzso zzso curves, and zzso zzso CT experiments demonstrated that simultaneous dual input liver zzso is zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso zzso and architecture appeared intact and well preserved at the completion of 4 to 6 months of laboratory experiments and zzso zzso 

: We have demonstrated successful development of a zzso liver phantom using a zzso zzso zzso zzso This phantom exhibited zzso dynamic zzso CT of the zzso zzso and portal zzso system over a zzso to zzso zzso
