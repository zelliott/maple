Over the past 100 years, deterministic rate equations have been successfully used to zzso zzso reaction mechanisms and to estimate rate zzso from reaction zzso experiments conducted in zzso In recent years, sophisticated experimental techniques have been developed that begin to allow the measurement of zzso and other zzso reactions inside single cells at the zzso zzso zzso data obtained using these methods are considerably noisy because zzso numbers within cells are typically quite zzso As a consequence, the interpretation and analysis of zzso data requires zzso methods, rather than deterministic rate zzso Here, we concisely review both experimental and theoretical techniques that enable zzso analysis, with particular emphasis on the major developments in the field of theoretical zzso zzso zzso from its inception in the mid-20th century to its modern-day zzso We discuss the differences between zzso and deterministic rate equation models, how these depend on zzso zzso numbers and zzso inflow into the reaction zzso and how zzso of rate zzso from zzso data is possible using recently developed zzso zzso
