We have previously proposed an equation derived from zzso law and Lin's concept of effective blood concentration zzso to calculate the mixed zzso blood concentration zzso of zzso zzso has a lower zzso partition zzso than zzso and, as such, promotes a faster induction and recovery from zzso In this study, we investigated the application of the zzso equation to predict the zzso of zzso 

We maintained zzso with a fixed inspired concentration zzso of zzso zzso during cardiac zzso in 11 zzso In order to measure the real zzso of zzso in mixed zzso blood, pulmonary zzso blood samples were collected at different time points via a zzso zzso for gas zzso zzso zzso The relationship between the calculated zzso and the actual blood sample zzso of zzso in mixed zzso blood was zzso Lin's zzso method was also used and the results were compared with those of zzso 

The calculations from our derived zzso equation and the actual blood zzso showed a similar kinetic zzso the concentration levels were approximately the same and correlated well zzso zzso zzso during zzso However, the zzso method failed to accurately estimate the actual blood zzso 

The results demonstrate that our zzso but not the zzso method, may be useful for zzso pulmonary blood zzso of zzso The clinical significance and the importance of the method merit further zzso
