zzso zzso particularly kin zzso is a fundamental mechanism of cooperation in zzso zzso behavior is not favored by evolution in the circumstances where there are zzso zzso that cannot be effectively zzso Using evolutionary zzso zzso zzso we deduce the condition for discriminating strategies to be zzso stable and show that the competition between groups of different discriminating strategies zzso the percentage of kin zzso A discriminating strategy zzso manages to cooperate with kin members and zzso against zzso by using an identification mechanism that includes a predetermined sequence of cooperation and zzso The opponent is identified as a kin member if it plays the same zzso Otherwise, it is identified as zzso and defection will be zzso Once the zzso forms the majority of the population, any strategy that does not play the same sequence of moves will be zzso We find that the competition between a variety of discriminating strategies favors a stable rate of cooperation and a low frequency of kin zzso
