zzso zzso zzso activity has only been analyzed in the paralyzed zzso muscles of spinal zzso injured zzso subjects for several zzso It is unknown if this motor unit activity is zzso zzso duration zzso recordings can investigate the biological significance of this zzso Since no software is currently capable of zzso zzso of zzso data at a single motor unit level, the goal of this research was to devise an zzso that would automatically zzso motor unit zzso by tracking the firing behavior of motor units over zzso Two channels of zzso muscle surface zzso were recorded over zzso from seven zzso subjects with a chronic cervical level injury using a custom data logging device with custom zzso The automatic motor unit zzso zzso developed here employed multiple passes through these zzso zzso recordings to segment, zzso form global templates and zzso motor unit zzso including superimposed zzso The zzso zzso was able to track an average of 19 global classes in seven zzso recordings with a mean zzso accuracy of zzso zzso and zzso zzso from these individual motor units with a mean accuracy of zzso zzso The zzso could analyze zzso of data in 2-3 weeks with minimal input from a person, while a human operator was estimated to take more than 2 zzso This automatic method could be applied clinically to investigate the zzso zzso often found in zzso disorders such as zzso lateral zzso
