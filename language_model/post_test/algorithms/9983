zzso lattice zzso method zzso employs a class of collision operators aiming to stabilize zzso and remove certain modeling artifacts for simulation of fluid flow on lattice zzso with sizes arbitrarily larger than the smallest physical dissipation length scale zzso zzso zzso E 63, zzso zzso It achieves this and zzso from other collision operators, such as in the standard single or multiple zzso approaches, by performing relaxation process due to zzso in terms of moments shifted by the local zzso fluid zzso zzso central moments, in an ascending order by order at different relaxation zzso In this paper, we propose and derive source terms in the zzso to represent the effect of external or internal forces on the dynamics of fluid zzso This is essentially achieved by matching the continuous form of the central moments of the source or forcing terms with its discrete zzso Different forms of continuous central moments of sources, including one that is obtained from a local zzso are considered in this zzso As a result, the forcing terms obtained in this zzso are zzso zzso by zzso To alleviate lattice artifacts due to forcing terms in the emergent zzso fluid zzso they are proposed as temporally zzso and second order, and the zzso is subsequently effectively removed by means of a transformation to facilitate zzso It is shown that the impressed force field influences the zzso collision process in the evolution of the transformed distribution zzso The method of central moments along with the associated zzso properties of the moment basis completely determines the zzso expressions for the source terms as a function of the force and zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the existing forcing schemes, it is found that they involve zzso terms in zzso zzso It is shown that the proposed approach implies zzso of both local equilibrium and source terms in the usual lattice frame of reference, which depend on the ratio of the relaxation times of moments of different zzso An analysis by means of the zzso zzso expansion shows that the zzso with forcing terms is consistent with the zzso zzso zzso experiments with zzso problems involving different types of forces demonstrate its zzso
