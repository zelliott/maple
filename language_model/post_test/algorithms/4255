The effects of an increased disease mortality rate on the transient and zzso dynamics of zzso salmon zzso zzso were zzso zzso mortality of juvenile salmon has become a serious concern in recent zzso However, the overall effects of disease mortality on the zzso and transient dynamics of adult zzso abundance are still largely zzso We explored various scenarios with regard to the zzso process, the distribution of zzso over the juvenile phase, the disease mortality rate, and the infusion of stray zzso zzso Our results suggest that the sensitivity to the disease mortality rate of the equilibrium adult zzso abundance and resilience zzso return rate toward this equilibrium following a small zzso varied widely and differently depending on the zzso The resilience and zzso of variation of adult zzso abundance following a large zzso were consistent with each other under the scenarios zzso We conclude that the increase in disease mortality likely has an effect on zzso yield under a fluctuating environment, not only because the mean equilibrium adult zzso abundance has likely been reduced, but also because the resilience has likely decreased and the zzso in adult zzso abundance has likely zzso We also zzso the importance of incorporating zzso zzso information into population models and demonstrate a means for doing so within a zzso population modeling zzso
