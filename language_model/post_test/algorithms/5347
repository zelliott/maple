We investigate the key characteristics of zzso zzso in deterministic and zzso zzso that all incorporate the cellular zzso of zzso zzso channel zzso In the first step, we zzso study the zzso liberation in a three-dimensional representation of a cluster environment with zzso dynamics in both the zzso and the zzso These simulations reveal that zzso zzso at a releasing cluster range from 80 to 170 zzso and zzso almost zzso on the time scale of the release zzso These highly elevated zzso zzso eliminate zzso zzso in a deterministic model of an zzso channel cluster at zzso zzso values as revealed by a linear stability zzso The reason lies in the zzso of all feedback processes in the zzso gating zzso so that only fluctuations can restore zzso observed zzso zzso In this spirit, we derive master equations that allow us to zzso zzso the onset of zzso zzso and hence the zzso time scale of zzso zzso zzso Moving up the spatial scale, we suggest to formulate cellular dynamics in terms of waiting time distribution zzso This approach prevents the state space explosion that is typical for the description of cellular dynamics based on channel states and still contains information on molecular zzso We illustrate this method by studying global zzso zzso
