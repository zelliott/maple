We investigated whether a hybrid zzso reconstruction zzso zzso improves image quality at zzso coronary CT zzso zzso compared with filtered back projection zzso 

zzso patients zzso men, 11 zzso mean age, zzso zzso underwent zzso gated coronary zzso at 80 zzso with a volume CT dose index zzso of zzso zzso on a zzso zzso CT images were reconstructed using only zzso and only zzso For each patient, CT images subjected to the two different reconstructions were reviewed by two zzso zzso image quality zzso is, CT zzso zzso of the coronary zzso image noise, and zzso ratio zzso calculated and compared for the two reconstruction methods and the overall image quality for each reconstruction was visually scored on a zzso zzso 

The mean estimated effective radiation dose for zzso coronary zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The two reconstruction methods did not significantly differ with respect to the CT zzso of the coronary zzso The image noise was significantly lower with zzso than with zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and the zzso was significantly higher with zzso than with zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The visual scores for image quality were higher with zzso than with zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso can reduce image noise and improve image quality at zzso coronary zzso
