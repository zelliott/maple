This paper proposes an zzso to register zzso zzso images zzso with color zzso photographs zzso This makes it possible to correlate retinal features across the different imaging zzso Blood vessel zzso are taken as features for zzso A specially defined distance, incorporating information of normal direction of blood vessel zzso zzso is designed to calculate the distance between each pair of zzso to be matched in the pair zzso Based on this distance a similarity function between the pair image is zzso zzso force search is used for a coarse registration and then an zzso zzso Point zzso zzso for a more accurate zzso The registration zzso was tested on a sample set containing images of both normal eyes and eyes with zzso Three transformation models zzso zzso and zzso zzso were tested on all image pairs zzso The experimental results showed that the registration zzso worked zzso The average root mean square errors for the zzso model are 31 zzso zzso and 59 zzso zzso with zzso The proposed zzso can be easily adapted to registration for other zzso retinal zzso
