The concept of reaction similarity has been well studied in terms of the overall transformation associated with a reaction, but not in terms of zzso We present the first method to give a quantitative measure of the similarity of reactions based upon their explicit zzso Two approaches are presented to measure the similarity between individual steps of zzso a zzso approach that incorporates relevant information on each zzso zzso and an approach based only on bond formation, zzso and changes in zzso The overall similarity for two reaction mechanisms is then calculated using the zzso alignment zzso An analysis of zzso a database of zzso mechanisms, using our measure of similarity identifies some examples of zzso evolution of chemical zzso In many cases, mechanism similarity is not reflected by similarity according to the zzso system of zzso zzso In particular, little zzso information is conveyed by the class level of the zzso zzso
