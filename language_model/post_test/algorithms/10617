In the course of zzso we generated models for all targets using a new version of the zzso monster zzso Previously (in zzso we were able to build many very accurate zzso models by selection and zzso of zzso fragments obtained from crude fold recognition zzso results, followed by zzso of the zzso fit and assessment of alternative alignments on the structural zzso This procedure was however very zzso as most of the steps required extensive visual and manual input from the human zzso Now, we have automated the most tedious steps, such as zzso of alternative models, extraction of zzso fragments, and construction of a hybrid zzso structure, as well as generation of alternative alignments in the regions that remain poorly scored in the refined hybrid zzso We have also included the zzso method to construct those parts of the target for which no reasonable structures were generated by zzso methods (such as long insertions and terminal zzso The analysis of successes and failures of the current version of the zzso approach in modeling of zzso targets reveals that the considerably streamlined and automated method performs almost as well as the initial, mostly manual version, which suggests that it may be a useful tool for accurate protein structure prediction even in the hands of zzso
