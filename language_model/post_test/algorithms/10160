Comparative assessment of nine different scoring functions zzso and zzso zzso applied to zzso virtual screening based on rigid zzso of the zzso zzso library of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been carried zzso The functions studied belong to the following zzso zzso zzso zzso empirical zzso zzso zzso Linear zzso zzso force zzso zzso and zzso and potential of mean force zzso zzso enrichment of the large true zzso set against the set of true zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso Diversity Set was evaluated by means of zzso zzso operating zzso zzso According to this analysis, scoring function zzso leads to the best enrichment of the zzso whereas the best early enrichment of the zzso may be obtained with the help of zzso function as estimated by zzso zzso discrimination of zzso zzso
