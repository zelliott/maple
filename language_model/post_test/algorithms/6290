A zzso sensor was applied in zzso zzso imaging of artificial blood vessels as well as blood vessels in a rabbit zzso The zzso time zzso of the laser zzso zzso induced pressure transient was used to estimate the zzso vessel zzso zzso with the actual vessel diameter showed that the diameter could be zzso by zzso with c the speed of sound in zzso Using this zzso the lateral diameter could also precisely be zzso In zzso imaging and monitoring of changes in vessel diameters was zzso Finally, acoustic time traces were recorded while zzso a vessel in the rabbit ear with zzso which proved that the main contribution to the zzso pressure transient is caused by blood inside the vessel and that the vessel wall gives only a minor zzso
