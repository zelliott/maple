We propose a method for generating zzso ensembles based on feature zzso To create the training data for a base zzso the feature set is randomly split into K zzso (K is a zzso of the zzso and Principal zzso Analysis zzso is applied to each zzso All principal components are retained in order to preserve the zzso information in the zzso Thus, K axis zzso take place to form the new features for a base zzso The idea of the rotation approach is to encourage simultaneously individual accuracy and diversity within the zzso Diversity is promoted through the feature extraction for each base zzso zzso trees were chosen here because they are sensitive to rotation of the feature zzso hence the name zzso zzso is sought by keeping all principal components and also using the whole data set to train each base zzso Using zzso we examined the zzso Forest ensemble on a random selection of 33 benchmark data sets from the zzso zzso and compared it with zzso zzso and Random zzso The results were favorable to zzso Forest and prompted an investigation into zzso landscape of the ensemble zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso Forest ensembles construct individual zzso which are more accurate than these in zzso and Random Forest, and more diverse than these in zzso sometimes more accurate as zzso
