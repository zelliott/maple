One of the most common zzso to identify zzso sites in regulatory regions in the DNA is that of weight zzso as testified by several articles in this zzso An alternative to strengthen the zzso predictions in regulatory regions is to develop methods that incorporate more biological properties present in such DNA zzso The grammatical zzso presented in this paper provides a concrete example in this zzso 

On the basis of the analysis of an exhaustive collection of regulatory regions in zzso coli, a grammatical model for the regulatory regions of zzso 70 promoters has been zzso The terminal symbols of the grammar represent individual sites for the binding of zzso and zzso zzso and include the precise position of sites in relation to zzso zzso Combining these zzso the grammar generates a large number of different sentences, each of which can be searched for matching against a collection of regulatory regions by means of weight zzso specific for each set of sites for individual zzso On the basis of this grammatical model, a zzso zzso zzso is presented zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso were zzso When parsing a collection of 128 zzso 70 promoter regions, the zzso zzso produces a much lower number of zzso sites than the standard search using weight zzso
