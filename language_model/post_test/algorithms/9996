A zzso network of bonds with a fixed zzso can relax via a variety of zzso zzso These motions can be directly zzso from the zzso arrangement of constraints without any geometrical zzso We use the zzso game zzso of Jacobs and zzso zzso zzso Jacobs and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 75, zzso zzso to decompose the system into separate rigid clusters and identify the remaining degrees of zzso zzso motions can then be resolved in the form of translations and zzso of isolated groups of bonds and the internal motion within bond zzso We show that each motion can be assigned a characteristic zzso zzso and hence a relaxation time zzso We use this information to construct a relaxation function and also examine the spatial distribution of relaxation time zzso We investigate the sensitivity of the relaxation time scales and their spatial distribution when making individual bond changes in the system, and we consider the dependence of these time scales on the underlying zzso
