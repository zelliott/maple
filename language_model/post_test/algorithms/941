zzso zzso zzso gel zzso can detect thousands of zzso separating them by apparent molecular weight zzso and zzso point zzso Thus it provides a more realistic and global view of cellular genetic expression than any other zzso This technique has been useful for finding sets of key proteins of biological zzso However, a typical experiment with more than a few gels often results in an zzso data management zzso In this paper, the zzso system is discussed with respect to how data reduction and exploratory data analysis can be aided by computer data management and statistical search zzso By zzso the gel patterns in a zzso zzso database, an exploratory data analysis can be carried out in an environment that might be called a zzso sheet for zzso gel protein zzso From such databases, complex zzso network models of protein expression during events such as differentiation might be zzso For this, zzso gel databases must be able to include data from other zzso external to the gel zzso Because of the increasing complexity of such databases, new tools are required to help manage this zzso Two such tools, zzso databases and zzso zzso analysis, are discussed in this zzso Comparisons are made between zzso and other zzso gel database analysis systems to illustrate some of the analysis zzso common to these systems and where this technology may be zzso
