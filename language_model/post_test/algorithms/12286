A significant proportion of the variation between individuals in gene expression levels is zzso and it is likely that these differences correlate with zzso differences or with risk of zzso zzso zzso are important in determining zzso differences in gene expression that lead to zzso expression zzso which is the unequal expression of zzso zzso in individuals zzso for such a zzso This expression imbalance can be detected using a transcribed zzso and, once it is established, the next step is to identify the zzso that are responsible for or zzso of zzso expression zzso We present an zzso zzso for such zzso providing a formal statistical framework to test whether a candidate zzso is associated with zzso expression zzso
