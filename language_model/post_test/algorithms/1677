We show that zzso zzso zzso between a linear zzso and an eccentric rotator can lead to very interesting zzso between regular and chaotic zzso zzso Indeed, we show that this model demonstrates rather unusual behavior from the viewpoint of zzso zzso Specifically, at a discrete set of values of the total energy, the zzso system exhibits zzso zzso normal zzso whose shape is determined by phase zzso of zzso and zzso motions of the rotator at zzso ratios of characteristic zzso Considering the zzso zzso system, resonance capture of the dynamics into the vicinity of these modes brings about regular motion of the zzso For energy levels far from these discrete values, the motion of the system is zzso Thus, the succession of resonance captures and escapes by a discrete set of the normal modes causes a sequence of transitions between regular and chaotic behavior, provided that the zzso is sufficiently zzso We begin from the zzso system and present a series of zzso sections zzso the complex structure of the phase space of the considered system with zzso zzso zzso Then an approximate zzso description is presented for the zzso zzso normal zzso We confirm the zzso results by zzso simulation and demonstrate the alternate transitions between regular and chaotic dynamics mentioned zzso The origin of the chaotic behavior is also zzso
