Two zzso steps were used for production of biomass and zzso by zzso zzso zzso The zzso of some zzso parameters in each step was investigated by using response surface zzso Twenty and 12 experiments were performed to attain optimal conditions for biomass and zzso production, zzso The model predicted a maximum biomass concentration of zzso on zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso during the first zzso while a maximum zzso concentration of zzso was predicted on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the second zzso The experimental values obtained zzso zzso and zzso zzso were in good agreement with the predicted zzso The zzso conditions were also used for zzso zzso zzso zzso In the first step, biomass concentration of zzso was obtained while in the second step biomass concentration increased to zzso zzso concentration of zzso was zzso and the overall zzso productivity was zzso being among the highest reported so zzso
