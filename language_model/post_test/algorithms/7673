The zzso of zzso functional connectivity is greatly complicated by the small sample size and complex noise structure in functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso samples across subjects improves the conditioning of the zzso but loses zzso connectivity zzso In this paper, we propose a new sparse group zzso zzso model zzso that zzso joint zzso of zzso and zzso zzso This is achieved by casting functional connectivity zzso as a zzso consensus zzso problem, in which information across subjects is zzso in learning zzso connectivity and group information is zzso back in zzso zzso zzso On synthetic data, we show that incorporating group information using zzso significantly enhances zzso connectivity zzso over existing zzso More accurate zzso connectivity is also zzso On real data from a cohort of 60 subjects, we show that zzso zzso connectivity estimated with zzso significantly improves brain zzso detection over connectivity zzso derived from other zzso modeling zzso
