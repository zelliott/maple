zzso improvements in the synthesis of therapeutic agents and their zzso are often facilitated by identification of reaction zzso Analysis by liquid zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso is a powerful approach for obtaining molecular weight information for these zzso Such analyses are well suited for zzso mass zzso using generic zzso conditions, provided spectral interpretation for unknown compounds is zzso We have developed a software application zzso that zzso automated data processing and molecular weight assignment for zzso zzso detected by any standard zzso wavelength zzso The program assigns zzso + zzso zzso (and thus molecular zzso in the mass zzso using predetermined zzso This evaluation process zzso zzso + zzso zzso from other signals in a complex mass spectrum such as those resulting from zzso zzso or the presence of multiple species zzso zzso zzso zzso charged zzso doubly charged zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Once the program has evaluated all zzso in a mass spectrum that exceed a zzso abundance zzso zzso reports either a zzso zzso the zzso peak consists of a single component having the displayed molecular weight, zzso the peak consisted of multiple zzso or zzso a molecular weight could not be determined zzso The performance of the program was evaluated by comparing mass assignments made by zzso against manual interpretation for 55 samples analyzed by positive zzso zzso using a generic zzso zzso zzso molecular weight assignments were obtained in zzso of the zzso
