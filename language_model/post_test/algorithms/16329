zzso flow analysis methods require acquisition of ultrasound data at high zzso sampling zzso These rates represent a major technical challenge for ultrasound systems because a compromise between spatial and zzso resolution must be made in conventional zzso zzso ultrasound scanners can either provide full quantitative zzso information on a limited sample volume zzso zzso or averaged zzso zzso and/or power zzso on a large region of interest zzso flow zzso In this work, we investigate a different strategy for acquiring zzso information that can overcome the limitations of the existing zzso modes by significantly reducing the required acquisition zzso This technique is called zzso compound zzso imaging and is based on the following zzso instead of successively zzso the medium with focused beams, several zzso plane waves are sent into the medium and the zzso signals are zzso summed to produce high-resolution ultrasound zzso We demonstrate that this strategy allows reduction of the acquisition time by a factor of up to of 16 while keeping the same zzso zzso Depending on the application, different directions to increase performance of zzso analysis are proposed and the improvement is zzso the zzso compound zzso method allows faster acquisition frame rates for high-velocity flow imaging, or very high sensitivity for zzso zzso Full quantitative zzso flow analysis can be performed on a large region of interest, leading to much more information and improved functionality for the zzso By leveraging the recent emergence of zzso parallel zzso systems, this paper demonstrates that breakthrough performances in flow analysis can be reached using this concept of zzso compound zzso
