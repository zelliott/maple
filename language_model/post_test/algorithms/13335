To further improve the image quality, in particularly, to suppress the boundary artifacts, in the extended scan zzso zzso zzso 

To combat projection zzso artifacts and to restore truncated objects outside the zzso an zzso has previously been proposed based on fitting a partial water cylinder at the site of the zzso Previous studies have shown this zzso can simultaneously eliminate the zzso artifacts inside the zzso and preserve the total amount of zzso zzso to its emphasis on consistency conditions of the total zzso in the parallel sampling zzso Unfortunately, the water cylinder fitting parameters of this zzso zzso are inclined to high noise fluctuation in the projection samples from image to image, causing anatomy boundaries artifacts, especially during zzso scans with higher pitch zzso To suppress the boundary artifacts and further improve the image quality, the authors propose to use a zzso penalty function, based on the zzso zzso function, to reinforce the zzso boundary zzso zzso phantom and clinical tests have been conducted to test the accuracy and zzso of the enhanced zzso 

zzso reduction in the boundary artifacts is observed in both phantom and clinical cases with the enhanced zzso The proposed zzso also reduces the percent difference error between the horizontal and vertical diameters to well below zzso It is also noticeable that the zzso has improved CT number uniformity outside the zzso compared to the original zzso 

The proposed zzso is capable of suppressing boundary artifacts and improving the CT number uniformity outside the zzso
