With the evolution from zzso CT to cone beam zzso zzso CT, maintaining reconstruction accuracy becomes more zzso To combat the severe artifacts caused by a large cone angle in CB zzso CT, three-dimensional reconstruction zzso have to be zzso In practice, filtered zzso zzso reconstruction zzso are more desirable due to their zzso structure and image generation zzso One of the zzso reconstruction zzso is the well-known zzso zzso that was originally derived for a circular zzso source trajectory by zzso extending its two-dimensional zzso zzso Later on, a general zzso reconstruction zzso was derived for zzso such as zzso source zzso It has been recognized that a filtering operation in the projection data along the zzso direction of a zzso zzso source trajectory can significantly improve the reconstruction accuracy of zzso CB zzso zzso However, the zzso filtering encounters zzso data zzso resulting in zzso noise characteristics or data manipulation zzso A zzso reconstruction zzso using one-dimensional zzso filtering across detector rows zzso zzso is proposed in this zzso Although the proposed zzso reconstruction zzso is zzso it approaches the reconstruction accuracy that can be achieved by exact zzso zzso reconstruction zzso for moderate cone zzso Unlike most exact zzso reconstruction zzso in which the redundant data are usually discarded, the proposed zzso reconstruction zzso make use of all available projection data, resulting in significantly improved noise characteristics and dose zzso Moreover, the zzso filtering across detector rows not only survives the so-called long object problem, but also avoids zzso data zzso existing in other zzso zzso reconstruction zzso in which a zzso filtering is carried out, providing better noise zzso dose efficiency and data manipulation zzso
