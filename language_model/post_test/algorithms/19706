We previously described zzso zzso differences in adult mouse zzso zzso and zzso that collectively zzso zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso Here we use a novel application of established methods of two-dimensional geometric zzso to examine shape differences in the cortical area maps of these zzso zzso 

We used zzso zzso to align a reliable set of landmarks in the plane of the cortical sheet from zzso sections stained for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso translates landmark zzso to a common origin, scales them to a common size, and zzso them to minimize an estimate of zzso zzso variation represents shape zzso We compared the variation in shape between zzso and zzso relative to that within each strain using a zzso test of zzso F zzso zzso differences in shape in the zzso zzso barrel zzso zzso as well as differences in shape across primary sensory areas, characterize the cortical area maps of these common zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso have markedly different cortical area zzso in both size and zzso These differences suggest zzso in genetic factors underlying cortical zzso even between common zzso zzso Comparing cortical zzso between normally varying zzso mice or between genetically modified mice can identify genetic contributions to cortical zzso Geometric zzso analysis of shape represents an additional quantitative tool for the study of cortical development, regardless of whether it is studied from zzso to gene or gene to zzso
