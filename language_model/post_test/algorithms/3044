zzso in biology appeared quickly as an accurate way for zzso complex living systems by simple zzso zzso finding an appropriate relationship between zzso extracted from a biological graph and protein complexes remains a crucial zzso Recent studies successfully proposed various descriptions of protein interaction zzso These approaches succeed in showing zzso within the network and how the zzso zzso However, describing the interactions within the zzso zzso zzso zzso remains little analyzed despite its interest for understanding module zzso 

We overcome this weakness by adding a complementary description to the already successful zzso a zzso decomposition named homogeneous zzso This decomposition represents a natural refinement of previous analyses and details interactions within a zzso We propose to illustrate these improvements by three practical zzso Among them, we decompose the zzso protein interaction network and show reachable biological insights that might be extracted from a complex large-scale zzso
