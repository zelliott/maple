In this paper, we propose zzso zzso of zzso neural network zzso zzso to autonomous robot for generation of adoptive and zzso zzso First, we formulated a zzso model whose zzso and zzso were analog and the hidden unites are interconnected each zzso Next, we implemented it into a miniature mobile robot zzso In order to see whether or not a zzso for the given zzso exists with the zzso the robot was evolved with the genetic zzso in the zzso The robot acquired the obstacle avoidance and navigation task zzso exhibiting the presence of the zzso After that, a zzso zzso based on a zzso synaptic zzso and zzso at zzso of input layer to hidden layer and of hidden layer to output layer was formulated and implemented into the zzso In the environment, the robot zzso organized the network and the given tasks were successfully zzso The time needed to acquire the desired adoptive and zzso behavior using the proposed zzso method was much less than that with the genetic evolution, approximately one zzso
