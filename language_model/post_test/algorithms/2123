Noise is an unavoidable factor in real sensor zzso We study how additive and zzso noise can be reduced or even eliminated in the blind source separation zzso zzso zzso attention is paid to cases in which the number of sensors is larger than the number of zzso We propose various methods and associated zzso learning zzso for such an extended zzso zzso Performance and zzso of the proposed approaches are demonstrated by extensive computer zzso
