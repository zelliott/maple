In order to reduce the motion artifacts in zzso zzso image registration is commonly used before zzso the mask from the contrast zzso Since zzso registration requires a set of zzso zzso control points, a conventional zzso model is not very zzso In this paper, we introduce the concept of pivotal and zzso control points to address this, and propose a zzso zzso for zzso zzso We use zzso in a novel way to generate the zzso grid of control zzso Our zzso zzso produces a smooth displacement field and therefore results in better artifact reduction than that of registering the control points zzso We achieve improved zzso performance using pivotal control points without compromising on the artifact zzso We have tested our approach using several clinical data sets, and have presented the results of quantitative analysis, clinical assessment and performance improvement on a zzso
