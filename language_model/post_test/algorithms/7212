This paper describes a procedure to extend the zzso correction method presented in a previous paper zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in array structures by controlling the zzso zzso of individual zzso a feasibility study, zzso 53 zzso zzso zzso from the harmonic regime to the transient zzso For this purpose a part of an zzso zzso array radiating in water is modeled around the frequency zzso zzso using the finite element zzso The study is carried out at low frequency in order to respect the same operating conditions than the previous zzso This choice facilitated the fabrication of the zzso zzso and the comparison of the zzso results with the experimental zzso The modeled array is composed of zzso elements with the central element excited, while the others are zzso The matching layers and the backing are not taken into account which limits the zzso only to the zzso elements and zzso This consideration reduces the structure density mesh and results in faster zzso time (about 25 zzso for each zzso using a computer with a zzso Intel Core zzso frequency zzso zzso and having 4 Go memory zzso The novelty of this research work is to prove the efficiency of the zzso correction method in large frequency band as it is the case in medical zzso The zzso results show the zzso of the approach and demonstrate that zzso can be reduced by at least 13 zzso in terms of zzso zzso the zzso pattern of the individual element can be zzso
