The initial output of a zzso zzso zzso experiment is a zzso series of difference electron density maps that displays the zzso changes in underlying structure as a reaction zzso The goal is to interpret such data in terms of a small number of zzso zzso zzso structures, each associated with a reaction zzso to establish the pathways and rate zzso by which these zzso zzso and thereby to zzso a chemical kinetic zzso One strategy toward achieving this goal is to use cluster analysis, a statistical method that groups objects based on their zzso If the difference electron density at a particular zzso in the zzso difference electron density zzso maps is sensitive to the presence of one and only one zzso then its zzso evolution will exactly parallel the concentration profile of that intermediate with zzso The rationale is therefore to cluster zzso with respect to the shapes of their zzso so that each group or cluster of zzso zzso to one structural zzso zzso of zzso whose zzso reflect the presence of two or more specific zzso can also be zzso From such groupings one can then zzso the number of zzso obtain their zzso difference density zzso and refine the structure of each zzso We review the principles of cluster analysis and zzso zzso in a zzso context, and describe the application of the method to simulated and experimental zzso zzso data for the zzso of zzso yellow zzso
