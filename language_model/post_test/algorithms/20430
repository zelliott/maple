Based on simultaneous power spectral analysis of systemic zzso pressure zzso and central zzso pressure zzso signals in rats zzso with zzso zzso we assessed the hypotheses that subtle changes in the zzso spectrum exist during zzso zzso and that the zzso spectrum is a feasible index for central blood volume during acute graded blood zzso During Stage I zzso shock seen after reduction in zzso of total blood volume zzso there was a significant increase in the power of both the very low frequency zzso zzso zzso and low frequency zzso zzso zzso zzso along with a moderate decrease in the very high frequency zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso reduction in zzso zzso and zzso components in the zzso spectrum occurred after a blood loss of zzso of zzso zzso zzso which persisted during Stage III zzso shock when the withdrawn blood reached 50% of zzso and the mean zzso maintained at 40 zzso zzso The depressed zzso and zzso components sustained the period of spontaneous recovery and subsequent zzso of shed blood, although the power of zzso component gradually elevated during these two zzso The power of the zzso zzso zzso zzso component of zzso signals increased zzso only during Stage III, became significant on spontaneous recovery, and declined during zzso Although zzso and zzso component progressively declined, the power of the zzso component zzso a gradual increase that was significantly and zzso correlated with the reduction in zzso We conclude that differential changes in individual components of the zzso spectrum occur during zzso zzso and that the zzso component may be a reliable indicator for central blood volume during acute graded blood zzso
