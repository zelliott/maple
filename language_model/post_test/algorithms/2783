zzso evidence is provided that the areas of zzso having a relative uncertainty in excess of zzso are zzso This systematic influence is of a statistical nature and originates in way the zzso routine recognizes the small zzso It is not easy to detect this influence since it is smaller than the zzso zzso However, the systematic influence can be revealed in repeated zzso under the same experimental conditions, zzso in background zzso To evaluate the systematic influence, background zzso were analyzed with the zzso procedure described by zzso et zzso zzso The magnitude of the influence depends on the relative uncertainty of the peak area and may amount, in the conditions used in the peak analysis, to a factor of 5 at relative uncertainties exceeding zzso From the zzso the probability for zzso zzso as a function of the relative uncertainty of the peak area, was zzso This probability is near zero below an uncertainty of zzso and rises to zzso at uncertainties exceeding zzso
