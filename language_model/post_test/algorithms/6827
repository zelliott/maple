In this study, a technique was developed for the zzso zzso measurement of bovine milk zzso zzso zzso In the first study, the effects of cell number and the concentration of zzso zzso zzso latex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and gelatin on the zzso cellular zzso zzso response were assessed with healthy cows in different stages of zzso In the second study, the zzso and in zzso zzso activity of blood and milk zzso towards zzso zzso was zzso In general, the zzso activity of blood zzso was consistently higher than that of milk zzso We found that zzso the optimal cell density in blood and milk cells for zzso zzso response ranged from zzso zzso zzso to 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso the optimal zzso of zzso latex beads and zzso for zzso zzso response were zzso zzso 500 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso of zzso zzso did not significantly affect the zzso zzso response of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso had no effect on the zzso of zzso In addition, the zzso of zzso was significantly correlated with zzso activity towards zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso for blood zzso and r zzso zzso p zzso zzso for milk zzso Under the optimal experimental conditions for measurement of zzso produced by bovine blood and milk zzso defined in this study, zzso zzso is an accurate and zzso technique for the rapid zzso of zzso zzso activity in zzso and pathological conditions of high-yielding dairy zzso
