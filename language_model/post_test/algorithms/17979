zzso the zzso of the zzso in human brain research is zzso The effect of age on the zzso has been explored in several studies that have been focused on either normal aging or neural zzso Shape analysis of magnetic resonance imaging zzso provides zzso measures for brain zzso This study further investigates the age effects on zzso zzso in three groups (104 normal controls, 24 Alzheimer's disease zzso and 14 vascular zzso zzso zzso By utilizing a zzso shape analysis of zzso zzso scans, each individual distance map is generated and analyzed zzso Specifically, after eliminating similarity parameters zzso translation, and zzso effects for each zzso an individual distance map is generated from zzso zzso surfaces and zzso zzso Then statistical methods, including regression, and zzso tests, are applied to detect the differences in zzso distance maps and volumes under the effect of age in each zzso zzso analyses reveal that the loss of zzso volume and changes in shape are more significantly related to aging in the control group than in zzso The results also show that the asymmetry of zzso in healthy subjects is greater than that in either of the disease zzso Our study shows that zzso statistical shape analysis could enhance the understanding of age effects on local areas of zzso However, the sample sizes of disease groups are relatively zzso further studies with more zzso data are zzso
