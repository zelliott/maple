This paper presents the zzso dynamics and zzso of zzso injected semiconductor zzso in the frame of relative high injection zzso The behavior of the system is explored by means of zzso zzso however, the exact nature of the involved dynamics is well described by a detailed study of the dynamics evolutions as a function of the effective gain zzso As results, we notice the different types of symmetry chaotic zzso with the riddled zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso crisis of zzso instability of chaos, symmetry breaking and restoring zzso and the phenomena of the bursting behavior as well as two connected parts of the same chaotic zzso which merge in a periodic zzso
