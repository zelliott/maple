This paper presents a secure decentralized zzso zzso for wireless ad-hoc sensor zzso The zzso operates without a zzso zzso operates zzso and does not require that the location of the sensors be known a zzso Based on the zzso zzso secure zzso communication protocols and dynamic zzso strategies are introduced to defend against spam attacks, since this type of attacks can exhaust the energy of sensor zzso and will shorten the lifetime of a sensor network zzso By adjusting the threshold of infected percentage of the cluster coverage, our scheme can zzso coordinate the proportion of the zzso region and zzso achieve the cluster control and the neighborhood control of zzso zzso results show that the proposed approach is feasible and cost effective for wireless sensor zzso
