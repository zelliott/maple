The objective is to develop an automated image analysis protocol to zzso the cell volume fraction of zzso zzso zzso zzso and estimate the biomass zzso 

Both dry weight and image analyses were performed on samples collected periodically from zzso stirred tank zzso Using the projected area of zzso zzso zzso the fraction occupied by the cells in a given volume was zzso Combined with the biomass dry weight obtained by zzso the method was used to estimate the density of zzso zzso Knowing the density of zzso the zzso was employed to zzso assess the biomass evolution during the course of zzso even in the presence of solid zzso 

A density of zzso g dry weight zzso was found for zzso zzso zzso zzso The image analysis protocol allowed successful zzso of biomass concentration in the presence or absence of solid zzso 

zzso to zzso biomass during the industrial production of zzso with zzso zzso are often limited due to the presence of solid zzso The image analysis protocol presented here offers a quick and easy way to estimate biomass concentration of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
