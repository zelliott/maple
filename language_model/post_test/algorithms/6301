The safety of a potential AIDS vaccine is an issue that will become critical at later stages of product development and needs to be addressed before it is too zzso 

In order to design safer zzso the zzso zzso to be deployed in it, should be free of regions that are either present in human proteins or exhibit pronounced structural similarity to proteins responsible for important zzso zzso 

The approach is based on the use of an original zzso predicting the zzso similarity of zzso zzso This mathematical approach developed by us was applied for identification of fragments with similarity to human proteins within potentially zzso regions of zzso zzso A potential zzso by viral zzso with zzso of zzso zzso region, generated as a result of immune pressure on the zzso region of zzso was considered in zzso 

zzso fragments occurring in normal human proteins as well as regions exhibiting high similarity to proteins responsible for zzso zzso were identified in every zzso protein at a frequency higher than zzso Most such regions contained either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso or both of them zzso The gained knowledge was applied in designing a synthetic zzso containing multiple zzso zzso The synthesis of series of zzso peptides representing zzso region of zzso loop of zzso zzso to be used as a zzso or zzso vaccine candidate, has been zzso Such a vaccine could theoretically pre-empt any escape zzso borrowing from zzso diversity of zzso region of zzso loop of zzso zzso 

The zzso shared by zzso and its host are likely to be implicated in the zzso of AIDS through induction of zzso zzso of the immune zzso The prospect that zzso immune mechanism can be zzso by molecular mimicry of zzso with zzso important human proteins should be taken into consideration in safer vaccine zzso
