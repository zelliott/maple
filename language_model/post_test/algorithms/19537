zzso zzso is a major challenge for mathematical zzso of biological zzso Given the uncertainties associated with model zzso it is important to understand how sensitive the model output is to variations in zzso zzso A local sensitivity analysis determines the model sensitivity to zzso variations over a zzso region around the nominal zzso values, whereas a global sensitivity analysis zzso investigates the sensitivity over the entire zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso model as an example, the authors present a comparative study of a variety of different sensitivity analysis zzso These techniques include: local sensitivity analysis, existing zzso methods of partial rank correlation zzso zzso extended zzso zzso sensitivity test, as well as a weighted average of local sensitivities and a new zzso method to extract global zzso sensitivities from a zzso identification zzso zzso of this study revealed critical reactions in the zzso zzso and their impact on the zzso dynamics and provided insights into embedded regulatory mechanisms such as feedback zzso in the zzso From this study, a recommendation emerges for a general sensitivity analysis strategy to efficiently and reliably zzso zzso dynamic as well as zzso properties from systems biology zzso
