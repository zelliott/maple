Level of artifacts in zzso obtained by zzso zzso zzso has been zzso considering randomly sampled signals of high zzso and long evolution zzso It has been shown theoretically and zzso that this level is dependent on the number of time domain samples, but not on its relation to the number of points required in appropriate conventional zzso Independence of the evolution time domain size (in the terms of both: zzso and evolution time zzso suggests that random sampling should be used rather to design new techniques with large time domain than to accelerate standard zzso zzso zzso has been presented as the example of such zzso The feature of zzso zzso zzso namely the possibility of calculating spectral values at arbitrary chosen frequency points, allowed easy examination of resulting zzso We present the example of such approach, referred to as zzso zzso zzso zzso
