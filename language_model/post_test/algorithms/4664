zzso or heated processes create potentially unsafe work environments for an estimated zzso million American workers each zzso zzso heat and process zzso have the potential to cause acute health effects such as heat stroke, and chronic effects such as zzso in zzso Although millions of workers are exposed to zzso zzso insufficient attention has been given to continuously improving engineering technologies for these processes to provide effective and efficient zzso Currently there is no specific occupational standard established by OSHA regarding exposure to heat from zzso zzso therefore it is important to investigate techniques that can mitigate known and potential adverse occupational health zzso The current understanding of engineering controls for zzso processes is primarily based on a book chapter written by zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso in heat transfer and meteorological theory necessary to design improved process controls have occurred since this zzso The research presented involved a review of the physical properties, heat transfer and meteorological theories governing buoyant air flow created by zzso zzso These properties and theories were used to identify parameters and develop equations required for the determination of buoyant zzso flow to assist in improving ventilation zzso zzso of this research were to develop and describe a new zzso zzso flow zzso and compare it to currently accepted ones by zzso and the American Conference of zzso Industrial zzso zzso zzso assessments were conducted to compare solutions from the proposed equations for plume area, mean zzso and flow to those from the zzso and zzso zzso were varied for the dependent variables and solutions from the proposed, zzso and zzso equations for plume area, mean zzso and flow were analyzed using a zzso complete block statistical design zzso zzso indicate that the proposed plume mean zzso equation provides significantly greater means than either the zzso or zzso equations throughout the range of parameters zzso The proposed equations for plume area and flow also provide significantly greater means than either the zzso or zzso equations at distances zzso m above zzso zzso With an accurate solution for the total zzso flow, ventilation engineers and practicing industrial zzso are equipped with the necessary information to design and size zzso as well as place them at an optimal distance from the source to provide adequate control of the rising zzso The equations developed will allow researchers and practitioners to determine the critical control parameters for zzso zzso such as the exhaust flow necessary to improve efficacy and efficiency, while ensuring adequate worker zzso
