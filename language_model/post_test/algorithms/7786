We describe the use of the three zzso characteristics of the functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso blood zzso level dependent zzso and cerebral blood volume zzso zzso signal changes to refine a two zzso optical imaging zzso zzso zzso The cortical depth profiles of the zzso and zzso changes following neural zzso were used to zzso a zzso zzso tissue model used in the zzso Carlo simulations zzso of light transport through tissue in the zzso analysis zzso To transform the zzso zzso and zzso zzso into zzso zzso profiles we zzso an zzso of zzso MR signal zzso under the assumption that the zzso ratio is zzso at a magnetic field strength of 3 zzso The significant improvement in the quantitative accuracy of zzso zzso using the new zzso tissue model over the original homogeneous tissue model zzso zzso was demonstrated on new concurrent zzso and zzso data covering a range of stimulus zzso
