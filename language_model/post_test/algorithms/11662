The comet or zzso gel zzso zzso is a sensitive method for the detection of DNA zzso The main drawback of comet sampling is the low cell density necessary to prevent nucleus overlap after zzso which limits large-scale high zzso zzso Another problem may be inconsistent comet zzso We investigated whether an approach based on three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso might be beneficial for these zzso 

A vertical comet zzso enabling three-dimensional zzso comet imaging of zzso seeded at very high density was developed together with dedicated software zzso to retrieve quantitative data at the single cell zzso 

zzso zzso comet imaging greatly relieved the user interactions of our zzso two-dimensional comet sampling zzso zzso of zzso were blindly zzso and zzso zzso improved the clarity of the images and the accuracy of comet zzso A zzso dose response was readily zzso The sampling speed was competitive with that of commercial zzso 

zzso comet imaging is a new concept for fast and zzso comet sampling that allows zzso of the zzso It may become an essential step toward high zzso screening and exploit the benefits of zzso zzso
