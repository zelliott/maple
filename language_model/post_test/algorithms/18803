We present a new model and learning algorithm, zzso which takes into account zzso sequence features in addition to paired zzso and zzso expression profiles when scoring candidate zzso zzso We evaluate three candidate sequence features for predicting zzso targets by assessing the expression support for the predictions of each feature and the consistency of Gene zzso Biological zzso zzso of their target zzso We consider as sequence features the total energy of zzso between the zzso and target, conservation of the target site and the context score which is a composite of five individual sequence zzso We demonstrate that only the total energy of zzso is zzso of paired zzso and zzso expression data and Gene zzso enrichment but this feature adds little to the total accuracy of zzso predictions using for expression features zzso
