This paper makes an outline case for the need for a low-cost, easy to administer method for detecting zzso within the growing at risk zzso It proposes two methods for electroencephalogram zzso analysis for detecting zzso that could zzso such a zzso The paper describes a zzso zzso method for analyzing the zzso zzso of subjects with zzso and reports on an assessment which demonstrates that an appropriate zzso dimension measure could achieve zzso sensitivity to probable Alzheimer's disease (as suggested by clinical zzso testing and zzso zzso with a specificity of zzso An alternative method based on the probability density function of the zzso intervals is shown to achieve zzso sensitivity to probable Alzheimer's disease and an estimated sensitivity to probable zzso (or zzso zzso of zzso (as suggested by clinical zzso testing and zzso zzso with a specificity of zzso This compares well with other studies, reported by the American Academy of zzso which typically provide a sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso The zzso recordings used to assess these methods included zzso and had no a zzso selection of elements zzso for zzso This approach gives a good prediction of the usefulness of the methods, as they would be used in zzso A total of 39 patients (30 probable Alzheimer's zzso six zzso zzso and three mixed zzso and 42 healthy volunteers were involved in the zzso However, although results from the preliminary evaluation of the methods are promising, there is a need for a more extensive study to validate the methods using zzso from a larger and more varied patient zzso with zzso results, to exclude other causes and cognitive scores to correlate results with severity of cognitive zzso
