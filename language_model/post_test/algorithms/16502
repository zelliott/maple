A recently introduced zzso zzso zzso method, zzso a response method based on zzso zzso theory that treats the zzso exchange kernel exactly, is zzso In the reformulated version of the zzso method electronic zzso energies can be calculated by solving a linear generalized zzso problem while in the original version of the zzso method a zzso frequency iteration is required in the calculation of each zzso zzso The lowest zzso of the new zzso zzso equation corresponding to the lowest zzso energies can be efficiently obtained by, zzso a version of the Davidson zzso appropriate for generalized zzso zzso zzso with the help of a series expansion of the new zzso zzso zzso standard zzso for large regular zzso problems, zzso the standard Davidson algorithm, can be used to efficiently calculate the lowest zzso zzso With the help of the series expansion as well, the relation between the zzso method and zzso zzso is zzso Several ways to take into account correlation in addition to the exact treatment of exchange in the zzso method are discussed, zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso the inclusion of zzso approximate correlation zzso or hybrids of the zzso kernel with kernels within the zzso local density zzso The lowest lying zzso of the molecules zzso zzso and zzso are considered as zzso
