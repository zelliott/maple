If the jaws of a linear accelerator are moved under computer control during zzso dose zzso similar to those with wedge filters can be zzso zzso linear zzso zzso this effect to give a zzso zzso using segmented treatment tables zzso An zzso is described to generate the dose per monitor unit at any point in a zzso using the zzso zzso zzso wedged beams are zzso as the zzso of zzso zzso beams, using an zzso based on beam data measured for zzso zzso zzso of wedge factors, depth doses and profiles generated using the zzso are compared with zzso Good agreement is found between predictions and zzso The calculation time is typically 5 zzso point on a PC with a zzso zzso
