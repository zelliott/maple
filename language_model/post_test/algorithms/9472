The electronic structures of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes and their zzso generated oxidized and reduced forms have been investigated by using sulfur zzso as well as metal zzso and zzso X-ray zzso zzso The electronic structure content of the sulfur zzso zzso was determined through detailed comparison of experimental and theoretically calculated zzso The calculations were based on a new simplified scheme based on zzso zzso density functional theory zzso and proved to be successful in the interpretation of the experimental zzso It is shown that zzso zzso act as zzso zzso that are readily oxidized to the zzso zzso The extent of electron transfer strongly depends on the effective nuclear charge of the central metal, which in turn is influenced by its formal zzso state, its position in the periodic table, and zzso zzso effects for the heavier zzso Thus, the complexes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are best described as zzso class III zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso central metal zzso while zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso contain completely reduced zzso zzso The case of zzso remains zzso On the zzso side, the calculation led to the new result that the transition zzso moment integral is noticeably different for zzso versus zzso zzso which is explained on the basis of the differences in zzso distortion that accompany chemical bond zzso This is of importance in determining experimental zzso for complexes with highly zzso zzso bonds from zzso zzso zzso zzso
