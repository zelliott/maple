A method for designing a zzso zzso Bragg zzso zzso filter has been zzso First, zzso filter parameters are determined by using a zzso Carlo calculation followed by a fast zzso zzso zzso Then, tilting the zzso filter results in continuous variation of the zzso zzso zzso Carlo calculations show that depth dose uniformity changes from zzso zzso to zzso zzso for zzso zzso ranging from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso of the proposed tilting zzso filter include a capability of continuous zzso variation and cost-effective installation for a given zzso zzso zzso
