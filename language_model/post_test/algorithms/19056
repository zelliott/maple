zzso zzso Imaging zzso data is characterized by a high noise zzso Thus, zzso errors of quantities like zzso zzso or the main diffusion direction used for fiber tracking are relatively large and may significantly confound the accuracy of zzso in clinical or zzso zzso Besides pulse sequence zzso noise reduction by smoothing the data can be pursued as a complementary approach to increase the accuracy of zzso Here, we suggest an zzso structural zzso smoothing zzso which is based on the zzso method and preserves the structures seen in zzso and their different sizes and zzso It is applied to artificial phantom data and a brain zzso We show that this method significantly improves the quality of the estimate of the diffusion zzso by means of both bias and zzso reduction, and hence enables one either to reduce the number of scans or to enhance the input for subsequent analysis such as fiber zzso
