We present a zzso based method for predicting loop zzso in protein zzso A zzso and zzso database has been set up that currently zzso zzso loop fragments and loop zzso secondary zzso Besides the length of the zzso and types of bracing secondary structures the database is organized along four internal zzso a distance and three types of angles characterizing the geometry of stem zzso zzso fragments are selected from this library by matching the zzso the types of bracing secondary structures of the query and satisfying the geometrical restraints of the stems and subsequently inserted in the query protein framework where their fit is assessed by the root mean square zzso zzso of stem regions and by the number of rigid body clashes with the zzso In the final step remaining candidate zzso are ranked by a zzso that combines information on sequence similarity and fit of predicted and observed zzso main chain zzso angle zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined for each loop length that identify those predicted fragments that outperform a competitive zzso zzso zzso A web server zzso the method, regularly updates the zzso library and performs zzso zzso segments are returned, or zzso these can be completed with side chain reconstruction and subsequently zzso in the environment of the query protein by zzso zzso zzso The prediction method was tested on artificially prepared search zzso where all trivial sequence similarities on the zzso zzso level were zzso Under these conditions it is possible to predict zzso of length 4, 8 and 12 with coverage of 98, 78 and zzso with at least of zzso zzso and zzso A of zzso zzso zzso In a head-to-head comparison on zzso extracted from freshly deposited new protein folds the current method outperformed in a approximately zzso ratio an earlier developed database search zzso
