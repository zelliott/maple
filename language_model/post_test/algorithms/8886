We have developed a zzso capability of the zzso platform, an zzso pediatric zzso zzso for the purpose of measuring zzso zzso levels as well as their spatial zzso in infants and zzso Our modifications include zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso selective zzso zzso of the reflection signals received by the zzso zzso detector zzso Furthermore, an zzso is developed that allows the zzso of optical density maps for the zzso zzso relative to peripheral retinal zzso This made it possible for the first time to directly measure zzso zzso levels and their spatial features in the developing human zzso In contrast to adults, infants with measurable zzso levels had almost exclusively a narrow, zzso zzso zzso zzso The described methodology holds promise for future investigations into the role of zzso zzso in the developing human zzso and the effect of dietary interventions in diseases resulting from a lack of normal zzso zzso
