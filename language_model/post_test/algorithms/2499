Since zzso development and many critical cell biology processes are organized in modular patterns, many zzso have been proposed to detect zzso In this study, a new method, zzso was developed to detect overlapping zzso in a zzso interaction zzso zzso We demonstrate that our method is more accurate than other 5 zzso Then, we applied zzso to zzso and human zzso network and explored the overlapping zzso Using the overlapping zzso of human zzso network, we constructed the zzso communication zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso and zzso proteins were always together and present in the same zzso which offer some clues for immune therapy for zzso Our study around overlapping zzso suggests a new perspective on the analysis of zzso network and improves our understanding of zzso
