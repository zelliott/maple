zzso zzso assessment of zzso implants has motivated work towards variable angle reconstruction zzso that are fast and accurate within a surgical zzso zzso reconstructions are a flexible and cost-effective option but are often limited by mechanical zzso The use of a forward projection step in a zzso reconstruction zzso is shown to reduce reconstruction uncertainty by zzso the imaging geometry for data set zzso The benefits are demonstrated for zzso over small zzso of seeds and may be used to simplify the matching of remaining seeds between the variable angle images as well as improving reconstruction zzso
