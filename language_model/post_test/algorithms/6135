Critical to biological processes such as membrane fusion and zzso zzso interactions at the zzso interface still raise many unanswered zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we confirm here that zzso zzso swell in salt solutions, a direct indication that salt zzso the interactions between neighboring zzso By varying sample zzso and by comparing with data from zzso zzso zzso we eliminate the possibility that swelling is an zzso zzso Although both attractive and repulsive forces could be modified by salt, we show zzso that swelling is driven primarily by weakening of the van der zzso zzso To isolate the effect of salt on van der zzso zzso we focus on high salt zzso at which any possible zzso interactions are zzso By analysis of X-ray zzso data, we show that salt does not alter membrane structure or zzso zzso eliminating the possibility that repulsive fluctuation forces change with zzso By measuring changes in zzso separation with applied zzso stress, we have determined, using the standard paradigm for zzso zzso that 1 M zzso of zzso or zzso decrease the van der zzso strength by zzso By weakening van der zzso zzso salt increases energy barriers to membrane zzso possibly affecting cellular communication and biological zzso
