Renal function is known to be a strong predictor of cardiovascular zzso and zzso disease is increasingly investigated in medical zzso In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a single combined zzso zzso examination with the zzso zzso zzso is feasible and may allow the simultaneous investigation of cardiac and zzso pathology in cardiovascular zzso 

Thirty patients scheduled for zzso gated zzso also gave their informed consent for a zzso acquisition after a single injection of 370 zzso of zzso at rest (30 zzso or with zzso (21 zzso and to undergo an additional standard zzso study with the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso after 1 zzso (24 zzso zzso images and zzso were zzso Renal zzso index, expressed as the percentage ratio of kidney counts zzso over the second minute after injection to the administered dose, was calculated as a functional zzso zzso Time to peak activity and separate kidney percentage zzso (as the percentage contribution of each kidney to total zzso zzso were also zzso 

Compared with zzso zzso provided zzso kidney images, with a higher zzso index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and with comparable separate kidney percentage zzso and times to peak zzso zzso zzso index was significantly lower in the patients who were more compromised according to zzso and cardiovascular functional zzso and correlated with zzso zzso index zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso serum zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso log brain zzso zzso zzso levels zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso and carotid zzso wall thickness (for both, r zzso zzso P zzso zzso and the zzso index of zzso vascular resistance zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In the 21 patients who underwent the provocative test, zzso induced a significant decrease in zzso zzso zzso index (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso suggesting a zzso in zzso zzso or zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is feasible at low cost as a zzso study and may allow both the evaluation of zzso zzso and zzso during a cardiac study and the calculation of zzso functional zzso
