A neural mechanism for control of zzso dynamics underlying the generation of meaning in cognitive processes is zzso Meaning derives from recognition of connections between items in related conceptual classes of the neural representation in the zzso It is generated from a zzso item in one conceptual class by an zzso process in which linked items in related conceptual classes are activated in zzso The complexity of the dynamics of this process varies between exploratory and direct retrieval zzso It is shown that the dynamics mode of the generation of meaning can be controlled by the zzso zzso zzso the zzso strength between zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso in turn is controlled by zzso in the zzso An autonomous regulation of the dynamics can be accomplished by an zzso release of zzso The generation of a sequence of zzso from an initial exploratory phase to a final retrieval of appropriate item in each conceptual class is zzso The time required for retrieval is shown also to depend on synaptic zzso zzso The involvement of zzso systems in cognitive processes has long been observed but the underlying mechanisms not zzso The present model describes a mechanism based on the primary effect observed of zzso zzso that on zzso zzso and is shown to be consistent with many zzso zzso and zzso zzso
