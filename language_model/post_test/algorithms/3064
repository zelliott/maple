Analysis of zzso and other zzso data on the basis of gene sets, rather than individual zzso is becoming more important in zzso zzso zzso a large number of statistical approaches for detecting gene set enrichment have been proposed, but both the zzso and the relative performance of the various methods are still very much zzso 

We conduct an extensive survey of statistical approaches for gene set analysis and identify a common modular structure underlying most published zzso Based on this finding we propose a general framework for detecting gene set zzso This framework provides a zzso of gene set analysis that not only helps to gain a better understanding of the relative merits of each embedded approach but also zzso a zzso comparison and offers insights into the relative interplay of the zzso 

We use this framework to conduct a computer simulation comparing 261 different zzso of gene set enrichment procedures and to analyze two experimental data zzso Based on the results we offer recommendations for best practices regarding the choice of effective procedures for gene set enrichment zzso
