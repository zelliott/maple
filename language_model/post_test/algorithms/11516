In the in zzso administration of zzso for zzso including zzso an zzso is proposed for the purpose of calculating three-dimensional absorbed dose zzso of tumors and adjacent zzso and neighboring zzso The absorbed dose distribution due to the zzso is given by zzso of the three-dimensional dose zzso for a unit cubic zzso containing unit zzso activity, with the three-dimensional zzso of the zzso activity distribution given by the same zzso size zzso The dose calculation zzso does not depend upon the source size, the source shape, and the zzso and irregular activity zzso In addition, it can zzso decrease zzso time compared to other calculation zzso Computer simulations were performed using the zzso zzso phantom for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that appear promising for zzso and their results verified the zzso of the proposed calculation zzso and high accuracy of the zzso
