zzso a potent novel zzso zzso zzso remains active against a broad spectrum of zzso zzso In order to bind to a variety of zzso the compound needs to make strong, preferably zzso interactions and have enough zzso flexibility to adapt to the changing geometry of the active zzso The zzso analysis of zzso in the gas phase yielded 43 zzso in which five types of zzso zzso interactions could be zzso All 43 zzso were subject to both rigid and flexible zzso zzso in the zzso and a triple zzso zzso of zzso zzso The largest binding energy was calculated for the zzso that are close to the zzso observed in the X-ray complexes of zzso and zzso zzso
