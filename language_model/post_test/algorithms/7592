In this paper, we present a receding horizon solution to the optimal sensor scheduling zzso The optimal sensor scheduling problem can be posed as a partially observed zzso decision problem whose solution is given by an information space zzso dynamic programming zzso zzso We present a zzso zzso zzso technique that, combined with a receding horizon approach, zzso the need to solve the zzso intractable zzso zzso zzso The technique is tested on a sensor scheduling problem, in which a sensor must choose among the zzso of N zzso systems in a manner that zzso information regarding the zzso system over an infinite zzso While simple, such problems nonetheless lead to very high zzso zzso problems to which the receding horizon approach is well zzso
