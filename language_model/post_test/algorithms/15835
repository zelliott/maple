This zzso computer model is designed to simulate complex zzso events in bacterial zzso It is zzso each module mirroring closely a particular physical, chemical or zzso zzso It is capable of handling zzso 20 zzso species, but can be easily expanded or simplified to match particular zzso It was originally designed for zzso the events in dental plaque leading to tooth zzso but should find application in other zzso It allows for zzso interactions with, for example, fixed charges on bacterial surfaces, which can act as pH and zzso buffer zzso zzso zzso of zzso is zzso zzso combining zzso zzso with diffusion in a single zzso zzso zzso are given for computing diffusion of all other species explicitly using zzso diffusion zzso with zzso by means of the zzso zzso zzso corrections and zzso zzso are zzso Chemical zzso and mineral zzso are zzso zzso zzso by zzso The program is tested against some problems having zzso solutions, and an example is given of its application to zzso of teeth as a result of bacterial action in dental zzso
