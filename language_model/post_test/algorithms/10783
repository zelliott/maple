zzso effort has been directed at zzso the properties of the tissue zzso zzso zzso correlation zzso to diagnose disease and monitor zzso In zzso assessments have had limited success due to zzso zzso along the propagation path zzso total zzso masking the frequency dependence of the scattering from the tissue zzso Previously, both total zzso and zzso correlation zzso given by the effective zzso were solved simultaneously by a zzso zzso of the mean squared error between a reference spectrum, modified by the zzso and zzso effective zzso and the zzso zzso using an zzso termed the spectral fit zzso zzso the impact of frequency range zzso frequency minus smallest zzso and zzso zzso zzso value minus smallest zzso value; k is wave number and zzso is zzso effective zzso used by the spectral fit zzso on zzso the zzso effective zzso and total zzso was assessed by computer simulations while excluding zzso of the zzso power spectrum dominated by electronic zzso The simulations varied the effective radius of the zzso (5 zzso to 150 zzso the zzso of the region zzso to 1 zzso the bandwidth of the source, and the amount of electronic noise added to the radio frequency zzso zzso The center frequency of the source was maintained at 8 zzso zzso accuracy and precision of the zzso effective radius were obtained for all the simulations whenever the same zzso was used to obtain the zzso A zzso of 1 gave an accuracy and precision of approximately zzso zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso gave an accuracy and precision of approximately zzso zzso zzso consistently for all of the zzso Similarly, the accuracy and precision of the total zzso estimate were improved by increasing the frequency range used by the spectral fit zzso
