We develop and validate an efficient lattice kinetic zzso Carlo zzso method for simulating particle zzso in zzso flows with zzso varying zzso rate, such as zzso flow or flows with standing zzso A contact time model was developed to describe the zzso collision efficiency as a function of the local zzso rate, G, and approach angle, zzso This model effectively accounts for the zzso interactions between approaching zzso which is not explicitly considered in the zzso zzso For imperfect collisions, the derived collision efficiency zzso - zzso zzso zzso was found to depend only on zzso where zzso is the specified zzso zzso For zzso zzso in tube flow, zzso zzso predicts the zzso measured zzso across a zzso range zzso zzso zzso zzso and is consistent with zzso bond zzso zzso in zzso flow resulted in the largest zzso forming near the wall where zzso rate and residence time were zzso however intermediate regions between the wall and the center exhibited the highest zzso rate due to depletion of zzso nearest the zzso Then, motivated by zzso or zzso flows, we employed the zzso simulation developed here for baffled zzso that exhibit regions of squeezing flow and standing zzso zzso In these calculations, the largest zzso were formed within the zzso zzso residence time), while squeezing flow regions corresponded to zones of highest zzso zzso
