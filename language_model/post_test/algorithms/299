In recent years, a flurry of new DNA sequencing technologies have altered the landscape of zzso providing a vast amount of sequence information at a fraction of the costs that were previously zzso The task of assembling these sequences into a zzso has, however, still remained an zzso challenge that is in practice answered by zzso zzso In order to design better assembly zzso and exploit the characteristics of sequence data from new technologies, we need an improved understanding of the zzso complexity of the assembly zzso In this article, we provide a first theoretical study in this direction, exploring the connections between repeat complexity, read zzso overlap lengths and coverage in determining the zzso instances of the assembly zzso Our work suggests at least two ways in which existing zzso can be extended in a rigorous fashion, in addition to zzso directions for future theoretical zzso
