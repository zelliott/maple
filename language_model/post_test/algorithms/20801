For the first time, we study the sorting of permutations by zzso zzso under a wide class of cost functions, namely zzso where zzso is the length of the zzso For different zzso we give corresponding upper and lower bounds of the cost of sorting any zzso sequences or any zzso Furthermore, an zzso zzso zzso and an exact zzso are given to determine the optimal zzso series of sorting a zzso of length zzso when zzso alpha zzso 2 and alpha zzso or zzso zzso Our work poses some interesting questions to both biologists and computer scientists and suggests some new zzso insights that are currently being zzso
