zzso three-dimensional zzso reconstruction zzso have the potential to better zzso PET data acquired in true 3-D acquisition zzso as compared to zzso approaches involving data reduction through zzso procedures followed by a zzso or zzso zzso Our previous studies, involving simulated and real phantom data from PET scanners working purely in 3-D acquisition mode, showed that the fully 3-D reconstruction approaches bring appreciable improvement on physical measures and visual image quality as zzso Reconstruction procedures zzso in those studies were based upon the row action maximum likelihood zzso zzso implemented on our clinical zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate if the fully 3-D zzso reconstruction software brings an appreciable improvement in clinical image quality and reader zzso 

zzso patient scans acquired on the Philips zzso scanner at our institution were reconstructed using zzso zzso and 3-D zzso with differing reconstruction zzso These scans were blindly presented to four experienced PET scan readers who graded various aspects of image zzso 

Our study concluded that 3-D zzso on the zzso scanner reduces artifacts and image noise and improves clinical confidence in interpreting PET zzso 

This study led to the routine use of 3-D zzso reconstruction on the zzso scanner at our zzso
