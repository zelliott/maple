The internal pressures of medication reservoirs of zzso zzso medication infusion pumps decrease when medication is zzso and these zzso pressure drops can decrease the volume of medication zzso To prevent these zzso the volumes discharged must be adjusted to maintain the required dosage zzso In this study, the authors developed an automatic control zzso for an zzso infusion pump developed by the Korean National Cancer Center that regulates zzso zzso The proposed zzso estimates the amount of medication remaining and adjusts control parameters automatically to maintain zzso volumes at predetermined zzso Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed zzso can regulate mean zzso volumes with a variation of zzso and estimate the remaining medication volume with an accuracy of zzso
