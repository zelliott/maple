zzso of subjects into zzso groups, such as patient zzso control, based on their functional zzso data is a potentially useful procedure for clinical diagnostic zzso This paper presents an automated method for zzso subjects into groups based on their functional zzso zzso The proposed methodology provides general framework using zzso time series for the whole brain zzso Using a training set of two groups of subjects, the new methodology identifies zzso features that distinguish the groups and uses these features to categorize new zzso We demonstrate the method using simulations and a clinical application that zzso individuals into zzso and control zzso
