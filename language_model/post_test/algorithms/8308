The zzso acoustic interaction between a reflected zzso zzso and a broadband pump zzso zzso in the opposite direction produces phase changes in the probe zzso to the zzso zzso zzso in the spatial region of zzso The instantaneous phase change along the received probe can be expressed as the zzso of the pump zzso with the spatial distribution of zzso along the propagation path over which the pump and reflected probe zzso In theory, the phase modulated zzso probe can be processed zzso detection and zzso to produce an zzso representation of zzso If the pump is an intense zzso impulse and the probe a zzso zzso then the pump interacts with the probe at each point along the propagation path at a unique zzso Thus the phase zzso that carries information about the spatial distribution of zzso can be extracted from the phase spectrum by a simple zzso transformation analogous to the space to frequency mapping so basic to magnetic resonance zzso If the impulsive pump is replaced by another zzso zzso then the phase change in the probe due to zzso at a particular point along the propagation path will be spread out for the duration of the pump along the zzso zzso of the received signal through an appropriate matched filter restores spatial zzso to the phase information in the probe so that it can be processed as if the pump were a zzso zzso This approach suggests a means of approaching the design of effective pump zzso that can resolve a wide range of spatial zzso in zzso
