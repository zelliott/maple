A new horn for high displacement amplification is zzso The profile of the horn is a cubic zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the horn exploits the first zzso displacement mode of the zzso A design method of the horn using an zzso scheme and finite element analyses is zzso zzso of the horns are manufactured by a zzso control zzso zzso Performances of the proposed horn have been evaluated by zzso Experimental results of the harmonic response of the zzso horn confirm the effectiveness of the design zzso The displacement amplification of the proposed horn is zzso higher than that of the traditional zzso horn with the same length and end surface zzso
