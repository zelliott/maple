It has been demonstrated that zzso spatial zzso zzso ultrasound imaging can provide improved zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared with conventional zzso images, especially in the presence of noise and zzso Application of the van zzso zzso predicts that zzso among the ultrasound echoes received across an array is reduced significantly away from the transmit focal depth, leading to a limited zzso depth of field in zzso zzso zzso focus throughout the field of view can be achieved using synthetic zzso methods to combine multiple transmit events into a single final zzso A synthetic zzso can be formed with either focused or zzso transmit zzso We explore the application of these methods to form zzso focused channel data to create zzso images with an extended zzso depth of zzso An zzso expression of zzso image brightness through depth is derived for the dynamic receive focus zzso Experimental results in a phantom and in zzso are presented and compared with dynamic receive focused zzso images, demonstrating improved zzso and zzso away from the transmit focus and an zzso depth of field four to five times zzso
