The region of zzso zzso harbors quantitative trait zzso zzso for zzso strength in zzso and zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this study is to identify the genes within this zzso region that contribute to the variation in zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed using zzso extracted from zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Genes zzso expressed in the zzso region among these rat strains were then ranked based on the strength of correlation with zzso strength in zzso animals derived from these zzso A total of 214 genes in this zzso region were zzso expressed among all rat zzso and 81 genes were found to be strongly correlated zzso with zzso zzso Of these, 12 candidate genes were zzso for further zzso and 8 of these genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were confirmed by quantitative zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis suggested that these genes were involved in zzso zzso nuclear zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear factor 4 alpha zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso
