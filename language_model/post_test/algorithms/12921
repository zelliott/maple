In lens system design, zzso zzso zzso method is a traditionally used local search zzso In this paper we apply zzso operators to control zzso factor in zzso zzso zzso We study the zzso behavior in this method when the zzso confronts with local zzso The proposed method can go beyond local zzso by taking zzso operators to control zzso zzso The proposed method was successfully applied to design zzso The result indicates that the zzso operators provide an effective and rapid way to jump out of poor local zzso
