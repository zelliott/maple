An automatic procedure is proposed for reconstruction of a protein backbone from its zzso it is based on zzso of a simplified energy function of a zzso zzso given its zzso zzso The energy is expressed as a sum of the energies of interaction between backbone zzso groups that are not neighbors in the zzso the energies of local interactions within all zzso acid zzso and a harmonic penalty function accounting for the conservation of standard bond zzso The energy of zzso group interactions is calculated using the assumption that each zzso group acts as a point zzso For local interaction energy, use is made of a two-dimensional zzso series expansion of the energies of model terminally blocked zzso acid zzso calculated with the zzso zzso Energy Program for zzso zzso force field in the angles zzso and zzso defining the rotation of zzso groups adjacent to a zzso carbon atom about the corresponding zzso zzso leader zzso zzso zzso To explore all possible zzso of zzso groups within a fixed zzso a zzso Carlo search is carried zzso The initial zzso angles are calculated by aligning the zzso of the zzso groups that are close in space, subject to the condition of favorable local zzso After the zzso Carlo search is accomplished with the simplified energy function, the energy of the structure is minimized with the zzso force field, with imposition of distance constraints corresponding to the initial zzso zzso The procedure was tested on model zzso and zzso as well as on the crystal structure of the zzso binding protein zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso In all cases, complete backbone geometry was reconstructed with a zzso zzso zzso of zzso A from the zzso target zzso
