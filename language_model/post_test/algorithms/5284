In a variety of biomedical applications, particularly those involving screening for infectious diseases, testing individuals zzso zzso samples, zzso in pools has become a standard method of data zzso This experimental design, known as group testing (or pooled zzso can provide a large reduction in testing costs and can offer nearly the same precision as individual zzso To account for zzso information on individual subjects, zzso models for group testing data have been proposed zzso However, there are currently no tools available to check the zzso of these zzso In this paper, we present various global zzso tests for zzso models with group testing zzso We use simulation to examine the zzso size and power properties of the tests for different pool composition zzso We illustrate our methods using two infectious disease data sets, one from an zzso study in Kenya and one from the zzso Prevention zzso
