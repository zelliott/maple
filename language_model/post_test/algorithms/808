This study presents an evolutionary algorithm, called a zzso selection genetic zzso zzso for analyzing the patterns of gene expression on zzso zzso zzso technologies have provided the means to monitor the expression levels of a large number of genes zzso Gene zzso and gene ordering are important in analyzing a large body of zzso expression zzso The proposed method simultaneously zzso gene zzso and zzso problems by zzso global and local search zzso zzso and ordering information is used to identify functionally related genes and to zzso genetic networks from immense zzso expression zzso zzso was tested on eight test zzso zzso ranging in size from 147 to zzso zzso The experimental zzso and visual results indicate that zzso not only ordered genes smoothly but also grouped genes with similar gene zzso zzso results and a new scoring function that references zzso functional categories were employed to confirm the biological interpretations of results yielded using zzso and other zzso These results indicate that zzso has potential in analyzing gene expression zzso
