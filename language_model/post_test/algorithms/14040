One of the general zzso for zzso zzso protein structure prediction involves sampling the zzso space such that a large set of decoy zzso structures are generated and then selecting zzso zzso from those zzso using various scoring zzso In this study, based on a zzso approach first suggested by zzso and colleagues, we formulate a zzso scoring function, which uses the zzso of zzso formed among triplets of zzso in a protein zzso By analyzing its performance on various decoy sets, we determine a good set of zzso distance zzso and the number of distance zzso use for zzso such a zzso Furthermore, we investigate the effect of using various approaches for compiling the prior distribution on the performance of the zzso zzso zzso extensions to the current form of the zzso zzso scoring function are zzso
