zzso technologies have proven to be very successful in the area of zzso and zzso in particular, because they allow to easily combine proven solutions for data zzso integration, and analysis into a zzso zzso zzso In order to integrate the services that implement these solutions into a given zzso architecture, some zzso is required, for example information about the low-level access to these services, security information, and some documentation for the zzso In this paper, we investigate how relevant zzso can be extracted from a zzso zzso documentation of the zzso that is underlying the service, by the use of text mining zzso In particular, we investigate the zzso conversion of functions of the statistical environment R into zzso services as implemented by the zzso tool by the generation of appropriate zzso
