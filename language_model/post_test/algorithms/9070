The relationship between synthetic factors and the resulting structures is critical for rational synthesis of zzso and related zzso zzso In this paper, we develop a new feature selection method for synthetic factor analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso The proposed method is based on a maximum weight and minimum zzso zzso With the proposed method, we can select the feature subset in which the features are most relevant to the synthetic structure while the zzso among these selected features is zzso Based on the database of zzso zzso we use zzso zzso as the target class and incorporate 21 synthetic factors including gel zzso zzso and organic template to predict the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso From these 21 features, 12 selected features are deemed as the zzso features to distinguish zzso zzso from other zzso without such zzso The prediction model achieves a zzso accuracy rate of zzso using the optimal feature zzso Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, and deep analysis is given for the synthetic factors selected by the proposed zzso
