zzso ultrasound zzso with the recent development of both zzso imaging zzso and zzso contrast agents, allows zzso zzso of zzso in zzso Nevertheless, functional parameters obtained by modeling contrast zzso zzso could be impaired by respiratory zzso zzso we developed an automatic respiratory gating method and tested it on 35 zzso zzso zzso with focal zzso Each zzso included fundamental mode and cadence contrast pulse sequencing zzso mode sequences acquired zzso The developed method consisted in zzso the zzso of the respiratory zzso as a linear combination of the first components provided by a principal components analysis constrained by a prior knowledge on the respiratory rate in the frequency domain, zzso the automated generation of two zzso zzso from the zzso mode sequence by detecting zzso and zzso zzso from the respiratory zzso The fundamental mode enabled a more reliable zzso of the respiratory zzso than the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was applied on both the original zzso mode sequences and the zzso zzso resulting in zzso maps and associated mean zzso Our respiratory gating process allowed better zzso of manually drawn zzso contours on zzso zzso maps as well as substantial improvement of the quality of contrast zzso zzso While the quality of maps and zzso was satisfactory in only zzso zzso before zzso it was satisfactory in zzso zzso after zzso Moreover, noise zzso estimated within the delineated zzso was reduced from 62 zzso 21 to 40 zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso after zzso These findings were supported by the low residual horizontal zzso zzso zzso zzso and vertical zzso zzso zzso zzso shifts found during manual motion correction of each zzso zzso The developed technique could be used as a basis for accurate zzso of zzso parameters for the evaluation and follow-up of patients under zzso zzso
