Digital models for zzso pressure pulse zzso and respiratory volume zzso zzso are proposed for efficient representation of these zzso When these signals are discrete zzso transformed zzso the zzso technique of zzso zzso gave system functions of much lower order than those obtained directly from the zzso The zzso of a zzso zzso wave needed two poles and two zzso Based on this, the model order is fixed by the number of distinct zzso in the magnitude spectrum of the transformed zzso zzso The partial fraction expansion zzso of the system function allowed zzso of component waves present in the time zzso The angles of model poles and zeros enabled easy determination of several important features from both of these zzso The model performance is evaluated using the zzso root zzso error zzso A zzso zzso using the pole angles as the feature zzso performed zzso when a limited number of zzso recorded under deep and rapid maneuver are classified into normal zzso and abnormal zzso categories of respiratory zzso
