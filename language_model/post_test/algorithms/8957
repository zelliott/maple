Despite significant zzso advances in protein structure determination high-resolution structures of membrane proteins are still rare, leaving zzso predictions as the only option for exploring the structural zzso of membrane proteins at large zzso Here, a new structural zzso approach for zzso membrane proteins is introduced based on the similarity of predicted zzso interaction zzso Its application to proteins with known zzso structure showed that it is able to reliably detect structurally similar proteins even in the absence of any sequence zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso with a sensitivity of zzso at a specificity of zzso We applied the new approach to enhance our comprehensive structural zzso of zzso membrane proteins zzso which is primarily based on sequence and zzso zzso in order to find protein clusters that describe the same fold in the absence of sequence zzso The total of 151 zzso zzso were delineated for proteins with more than four zzso zzso Interestingly, we observed that proteins with 8 and more zzso zzso zzso to fewer different zzso than proteins with up to 7 zzso suggesting that in large membrane proteins the evolutionary tendency to zzso already available folds is more zzso
