A new equation is derived for zzso the sensitivity when the zzso curve zzso zzso zzso method is applied to zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the expression is substantiated by extensive zzso Carlo noise addition zzso The zzso selectivity can be derived from the new sensitivity zzso Other important figures of merit, such as limit of zzso limit of zzso and concentration uncertainty of zzso quantitative zzso can be easily estimated from the proposed sensitivity expression and the instrumental zzso An experimental example involving the determination of an zzso in the presence of zzso interfering agents is described in detail, involving zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The estimated figures of merit are reasonably correlated with the zzso features of the analyzed experimental zzso
