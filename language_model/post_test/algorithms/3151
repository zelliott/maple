The resiliency and elasticity of zzso zzso are traced to zzso a zzso protein with extensive zzso zzso There is little discussion in the literature on the structure and dynamics of the zzso zzso regions of zzso that comprise a significant part of the native zzso In particular, the region zzso by zzso 21 and 23, a zzso zzso form found in all types of human zzso is believed to be zzso positioned for proper function of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and contraction of zzso zzso molecular dynamics zzso calculations on the zzso domain are reported zzso This zzso domain has been assumed to adopt an architecture in which the putative hinge region links two zzso In this paper, we use a zzso approach to obtain starting structures in the hinge zzso The subsequent MD brings new insights into the possibility of fluctuations between zzso and zzso states, as well as distinguishing structural features of the zzso The significance of these findings towards an enhanced understanding of zzso relationships in zzso and the elastic fiber is zzso
