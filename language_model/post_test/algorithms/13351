zzso membrane zzso operation requires frequent evaluation of the membrane zzso A zzso approach based on principal component analysis zzso and fuzzy zzso zzso the necessary monitoring information solely out of zzso pressure data was investigated for this zzso Out of three tested zzso techniques the two functional methods proved useful to cope with noise and zzso as opposed to the common standard zzso while all of them presented similar capabilities for revealing data trends and zzso The expert functional zzso approach enabled linking the two major trends in the data to zzso zzso and irreversible zzso The zzso approach provided a more objective way for functional representation of the data set but its complexity did not appear justified by better zzso The fuzzy zzso algorithm, applied after zzso was successful in recognizing the data trends and placing the cluster zzso in meaningful positions, as such supporting data zzso However, the zzso did not allow a correct zzso of all zzso Factor analysis was used instead, exploiting the zzso of the observed two zzso trends, to completely split the zzso and irreversible zzso effects and zzso the data in a more pragmatic zzso Overall, the tested techniques appeared useful and can serve as the basis for automatic membrane zzso monitoring and zzso
