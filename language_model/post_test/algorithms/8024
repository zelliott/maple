We previously studied dose zzso of zzso zzso zzso for lung zzso Our aim is to compare in combination pencil beam zzso with the zzso correction zzso of zzso power low zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso by using the dose evaluation zzso There were significant differences in zzso zzso mean dose, zzso index, and conformity index, zzso and zzso The dose zzso inside the zzso calculated by zzso zzso were more uniform than those of zzso There were no significant differences in zzso and mean dose of total zzso There was no large difference for the whole zzso However, the surrounding high-dose region of zzso became smaller in zzso The difference in dose evaluation indexes extended between zzso zzso and AAA that as many as low CT value of zzso When the dose calculation zzso is changed, it is necessary to consider difference dose zzso compared with those of established zzso
