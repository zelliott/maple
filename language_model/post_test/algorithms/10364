zzso assignment of copy number at known copy number zzso zzso zzso is important for both increasing understanding of the structural evolution of zzso as well as for carrying out association studies of copy number with zzso As with calling zzso zzso the task can be framed as a zzso problem but for a number of reasons assigning copy number is much more zzso zzso zzso have lower zzso ratios than zzso zzso often display heavy zzso and zzso intensity zzso contain outlying observations and may exhibit systematic technical differences among different zzso In addition, the number of zzso classes at a zzso in the population may be unknown a zzso Due to these zzso automatic and robust assignment of copy number from array data remains a challenging zzso We have developed a copy number assignment algorithm, zzso for a targeted zzso zzso such as that used by the zzso Trust Case Control Consortium's recent zzso association zzso We use a zzso zzso mixture model that robustly identifies both the number of different copy number classes at a specific locus as well as relative copy number for each individual in the zzso This approach is fully automated which is a critical requirement when analyzing large numbers of zzso We illustrate the methods performance using real data from the zzso Trust Case Control Consortium's zzso association study and using simulated zzso
