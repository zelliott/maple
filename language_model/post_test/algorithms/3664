Scientists usually want to verify the zzso matching process of zzso that look up zzso sequences in DNA or protein zzso The zzso step is often done zzso or zzso Not all search zzso present the appropriate theoretical spectrum information within their zzso Thus, the theoretical spectrum for each result should be calculated from the sequence of the matched zzso We present an zzso command line tool for this purpose that can be integrated easily into complex as well as existing zzso and can be used to present the theoretical spectrum to the user in either zzso or tabular format by third party zzso 

The code is available via the zzso zzso
