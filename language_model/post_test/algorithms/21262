The zzso hybrids of zzso A, alpha zzso beta zzso and alpha zzso beta zzso have been prepared by a new high pressure liquid zzso method, and the zzso of their zzso and zzso reactions have been studied by double mixing and zzso zzso Both reactions are zzso The slow phase in zzso and the fast phase in zzso are due to the reactions of alpha CO2 beta zzso or alpha 2 beta zzso The fast phase in zzso reaction has two zzso one due to the zzso of the hybrid and the other due to the zzso zzso Immediately after the reduction of the zzso hybrids, the overall system is represented by the zzso 2 alpha CO beta in equilibrium alpha zzso beta zzso in equilibrium alpha zzso beta zzso or zzso see zzso If the solutions are aged for zzso zzso the zzso population is reduced gradually to a very small size, and the main species after 11 s of aging are zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of the kinetic data indicates slow R in equilibrium T zzso in the absence of zzso and significant zzso of the zzso zzso It is concluded that the zzso contacts alpha zzso 2 (or alpha zzso 1) are impaired seriously in the zzso Very slow R in equilibrium T relaxation makes these hybrids unlikely zzso in the sequential binding of CO to zzso zzso
