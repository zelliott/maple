zzso zzso zzso has been widely used to explore zzso states of large zzso zzso The detailed interpretation of zzso data requires the flexible fitting of a known high-resolution protein structure into a zzso zzso zzso To this end, we have developed what we believe is a new method based on a zzso protein zzso and a modified form of the elastic network model that allows large-scale zzso changes while maintaining zzso and secondary zzso Our method zzso a zzso which zzso combines various terms of the modified elastic network model energy with a zzso score and a collision energy that penalizes zzso zzso Unlike previous flexible fitting efforts using the lowest few normal zzso our method effectively zzso all normal modes so that both global and local structural changes can be fully zzso We have validated our method for a diverse set of 10 pairs of protein structures using simulated zzso maps with a range of resolutions and in the zzso of random zzso We have shown that our method is both accurate and efficient compared with alternative techniques, and its performance is robust to the addition of random zzso Our method is also shown to be useful for the flexible fitting of three experimental zzso zzso
