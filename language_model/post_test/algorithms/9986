A class of zzso in discrete space and continuous time for zzso zzso zzso is zzso A simple zzso is derived that yields exact mean zzso times zzso for linear zzso in one dimension, regardless of the lattice zzso When applied to zzso zzso and/or higher spatial dimensions, zzso evidence suggests that this zzso yields zzso estimates that either outperform or rival zzso zzso time and continuous zzso zzso
