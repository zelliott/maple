zzso zzso in zzso remains a persistent challenge in the development of inexpensive and portable zzso diagnostic zzso zzso in zzso chips can be controlled via frequency zzso wherein the zzso frequency of a pressure source is matched with the characteristic zzso of network zzso The characteristic zzso of each branch arise from zzso between fluid in the channels and passive zzso features, and can be programmed by adjusting the dimensions and zzso of the zzso In contrast to zzso zzso valves, such networks require only a single active element and relatively small dynamic zzso To achieve effective flow switching between different pathways in the zzso zzso peak zzso and narrow zzso are required (such that branches are independently zzso This paper illustrates that high selectivity can be achieved in zzso networks that exploit zzso inertia, with flow driven selectively at peak zzso between zzso zzso with zzso less than zzso of the peak zzso zzso zzso flow switching between two zzso zzso is zzso A simple theoretical framework is presented that predicts the characteristic zzso in terms of feature properties, thus zzso the design of networks with specific zzso zzso The approach provides a clear zzso to zzso and zzso of zzso hardware for zzso with several zzso zzso
