A noise reduction method for zzso zzso data is zzso The method is a combination of Kalman filtering and factor zzso A zzso model for a Kalman filter was constructed using the forward problem in zzso zzso Factor analysis provide zzso of noise zzso required by the Kalman filter to eliminate independent additive sensor zzso The proposed method supports independent component analysis zzso which is difficult to use in zzso analysis zzso to the sensor zzso zzso experiments were conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed zzso In a single zzso case where the maximum zzso ratio zzso was zzso zzso approximately equivalent to raw zzso data, zzso signals were successfully estimated from noisy zzso a zzso s delay of the peak zzso and zzso of zzso of the peak zzso were zzso Moreover, in a multiple zzso case, independent components zzso with the proposed method had high zzso zzso at the zzso with correlation of zzso and zzso for those zzso with conventional zzso zzso The results show that the noise reduction method reduces sensor noise zzso High zzso components are obtained by the proposed zzso Real zzso data analysis was also zzso The proposed method extracted auditory evoked responses from zzso zzso zzso
