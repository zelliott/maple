X-ray photons which are scattered inside the object slice and reach the detector array increase the detected signal and produce image artifacts as zzso effects in large objects and dark bands between regions of high zzso The artifact zzso increase with scanned volume or slice zzso Object scatter can be reduced in third generation zzso zzso zzso geometry by zzso the detector zzso However, a correction can still improve image zzso For fourth generation CT zzso only poor zzso zzso is possible and a zzso correction is zzso This paper presents a correction zzso which can be zzso for third and fourth generation CT zzso The method requires low zzso effort and allows flexible application to different body regions by simple zzso zzso The object scatter intensity which is zzso from the measured signal is calculated with zzso of the weighted and windowed projection data with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The scatter zzso function is zzso for the desired scanner geometry from pencil beam simulations and zzso using coherent and incoherent differential scatter cross section zzso Several examples of phantom and medical objects scanned with third and fourth generation CT systems are zzso In third generation zzso scatter artifacts are effectively zzso For fourth generation geometry with poor zzso zzso object scatter artifacts are strongly zzso
