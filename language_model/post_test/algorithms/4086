The time evolution and complex interactions of many zzso systems, such as in the human body, result in zzso types of zzso outcomes that exhibit self similarity over long time scales by a power law in the frequency spectrum zzso The zzso zzso zzso is thus often interpreted as a zzso of relative health and zzso 

This paper presents a thorough comparative zzso analysis of zzso characterization techniques with specific consideration given to zzso measured gait stride zzso time zzso The ideal zzso signals generated in the zzso analysis are constrained under varying lengths and biases indicative of a range of zzso conceivable zzso zzso This analysis is to complement previous investigations of zzso characteristics in healthy and pathological gait stride zzso time series, with which this study is zzso 

The results of our analysis showed that the averaged zzso zzso method consistently yielded the most accurate zzso 

Class dependent methods proved to be zzso for zzso time zzso zzso fluctuation analysis as most prevailing method in the literature exhibited large zzso zzso 

The comparative zzso analysis and experimental applications provide a thorough basis for determining an appropriate and robust method for measuring and comparing a zzso meaningful zzso the spectral index zzso In consideration of the constraints of application, we note the significant drawbacks of zzso fluctuation analysis and conclude that the averaged zzso zzso method can provide reasonable consistency and accuracy for characterizing these zzso time zzso
