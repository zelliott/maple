zzso zzso can be used to reconstruct zzso activity with high spatial and zzso zzso However, this reconstruction problem is zzso and requires the use of prior constraints in order to produce a unique zzso At present there are a multitude of inversion zzso each employing different zzso but one major problem when comparing the accuracy of these different approaches is that often the true underlying electrical state of the brain is zzso In this study, we explore one zzso zzso mapping in the primary visual zzso zzso for which the ground truth is known to a reasonable degree of zzso enabling the comparison of zzso source reconstructions with the true electrical state of the zzso Specifically, we attempted to zzso using a zzso method, the induced responses in the visual zzso generated by a high contrast, zzso varying zzso Although well described in zzso studies, it has been an open question whether the induced gamma power in humans due to high contrast zzso derives from zzso rather than the zzso zzso zzso We show that the zzso source estimate in the gamma and zzso bands does vary in a manner consistent with the known zzso of zzso However, these peak locations, although zzso zzso did not accurately zzso to the cortical zzso We considered possible causes for this zzso and suggest that improved zzso resonance imaging zzso and the use of more accurate source models that take into account the spatial extent and shape of the active zzso may, in future, improve the accuracy of the source zzso
