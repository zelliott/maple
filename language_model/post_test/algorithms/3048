To compare the Swedish interactive zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso strategy for zzso automated zzso zzso 

One eye of zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso participants without zzso from the zzso zzso in zzso Study zzso and the African zzso and zzso zzso Study zzso were classified with zzso disc zzso taken within 6 months of visual field testing, conducted within a zzso zzso Six parameters were derived per test, including pattern standard zzso zzso and the number of pattern zzso plot zzso points triggered at zzso zzso characteristic zzso analysis zzso the tests for specificity zzso zzso and zzso zzso of parameters with the highest area under the curve zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Dublin, zzso zzso were zzso zzso severity, and test duration between zzso were zzso 

zzso were not different between zzso using zzso With zzso zzso zzso was more sensitive zzso than zzso zzso at zzso specificity zzso zzso and specificity using the zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso was similar between zzso zzso correlated significantly between zzso zzso although there was bias for zzso to suggest more severe zzso zzso required significantly less test time than did zzso zzso Mean differences in zzso zzso zzso and MD between zzso were not clinically zzso 

Both zzso performed similarly when zzso for zzso The reduced test duration makes zzso the better zzso Testing with both zzso within a short period is recommended for confirmation of results when switching from zzso to zzso
