Despite zzso mother to child transmission zzso of zzso B virus zzso still occurs in infants born to zzso B surface zzso zzso zzso We analyzed methods of risk assessment and interventions for zzso 

We reviewed 63 articles and abstracts published from zzso that were relevant to zzso articles were identified using the zzso zzso zzso 

Administration of HB zzso and HB vaccine to infants at birth zzso 12 hours), followed by 2 additional doses of vaccines within zzso months, prevented approximately zzso of zzso transmission from zzso mothers to their zzso However, zzso was still transmitted from zzso of mothers with high levels of zzso It is important to assess the risk for zzso and identify mothers who are the best candidates for zzso The most important risk factor is maternal level of zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso other factors include a positive test result for the HB e zzso pregnancy complications such as threatened zzso labor or prolonged labor, and failure of zzso in prior zzso zzso therapy during late stages of pregnancy is the most effective method to reduce transmission from mothers with high levels of zzso but zzso zzso section might also be zzso zzso administration of HB zzso giving infants a double dose of HB zzso or avoiding zzso had no impact on zzso 

zzso mothers should be assessed for risk of zzso and infants should receive zzso zzso women with levels of zzso DNA zzso zzso should be considered for strategies to reduce the risk for zzso We propose an zzso for risk assessment and patient management that is based on a review of the literature and the opinion of a panel of physicians with expertise in preventing zzso
