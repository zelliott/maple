zzso sickness zzso is a disease known to be related to zzso gas bubble formation originating from gases dissolved in body zzso zzso zzso models, which employ survival and hazard functions, are zzso by fitting model parameters to experimental dive zzso In the work reported here, I develop methods to find the survival function gain zzso zzso thus removing it from the fitting zzso I show that the number of zzso required for model zzso is significantly zzso The zzso gain method substantially improves the condition number of the zzso zzso which reduces the model confidence intervals by more than an order of zzso
