zzso lag, or residual zzso in zzso flat-panel zzso detectors can cause significant zzso artifacts in zzso zzso zzso zzso To date, most correction models have assumed a zzso zzso zzso model and correct lag by zzso with an impulse response function zzso However, the lag correction is sensitive to both the exposure intensity and the technique used for determining the zzso Even when the zzso correction that produces the minimum error is found, residual artifact zzso A new zzso method was developed to take into account the zzso measurement technique and exposure zzso 

First, a zzso (N zzso 4) zzso model was implemented for lag zzso Next, a zzso lag zzso known as the zzso consistent stored charge zzso method, was developed based on the zzso zzso zzso It differs from other zzso lag correction zzso in that it maintains a consistent estimate of the amount of charge stored in the zzso and it does not require intimate knowledge of the semiconductor parameters specific to the zzso For the zzso method, all zzso of the zzso are functions of exposure zzso Another zzso lag correction method that only used an intensity weighting of the zzso was also zzso The correction zzso were applied to zzso projection data and CT acquisitions of a large pelvic phantom and an acrylic head zzso The authors collected rising and falling edge zzso data on a zzso zzso zzso zzso detector operating in dynamic gain mode at 15 zzso at nine incident zzso zzso of the detector zzso zzso For projection data, 1st and 50th frame lag were measured before and after zzso For the CT zzso five pairs of zzso were defined and the maximum and mean signal differences within a pair were calculated for the different zzso and zzso edge zzso 

The zzso corrections left residual 1st and 50th frame lag up to zzso and zzso while the zzso lag correction reduced 1st and 50th frame residual lags to less than zzso and zzso For CT zzso the zzso lag correction gave an average error of 11 zzso for the pelvic phantom and 3 zzso for the head zzso compared to zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso corrections and 15 zzso and 9 zzso for the intensity weighted zzso zzso The maximum zzso error was always smallest for the zzso zzso The zzso correction was also superior to the intensity weighting zzso 

The zzso lag zzso corrected for the exposure dependence of lag, provided superior image improvement for the pelvic phantom zzso and gave similar results to the best case zzso results for the head zzso The blurred ring artifact that is left over in the zzso corrections was better removed by the zzso correction in all zzso
