We develop a model of cortical coding of stimuli by the sequences of zzso patterns that they ignite in an initially random zzso zzso learning then zzso these zzso making them zzso of the zzso There is a competition between the capacity of the network and the stability of the zzso for small stability zzso zzso (the strength of the mean stabilizing zzso in the zzso in a learned zzso the capacity is zzso to zzso zzso For zzso of the order of or less than the zzso of the untrained network, the capacity exceeds that for sequences learned from zzso zzso
