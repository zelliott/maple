zzso zzso is one of the zzso physical methods for determining the size and shape of zzso substances or their complexes in the range from 1 to several thousand zzso The moving boundary in zzso zzso runs can be described by the zzso differential zzso Fitting of suitable model functions or solutions of the zzso equation to the moving boundary is used to obtain directly zzso and diffusion zzso thus allowing quick determination of size, shape and other parameters of zzso Here we present a new approximate whole boundary solution of the zzso equation that simultaneously allows the zzso of zzso and diffusion zzso with zzso smaller than zzso from the expected zzso
