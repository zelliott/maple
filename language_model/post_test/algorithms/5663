To investigate how using different sets of decision criteria impacts the quality of intensity modulated radiation therapy zzso plans obtained by zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso evolutionary zzso zzso was used to produce sets of zzso zzso The zzso consisted of two interacting zzso zzso a deterministic inverse planning zzso of zzso zzso that zzso a weighted sum of zzso penalty objectives to generate zzso plans and zzso an evolutionary zzso that selects the superior zzso plans using decision criteria and uses those plans to determine the new weights and penalty objectives of each new zzso Plans resulting from the deterministic zzso were evaluated by the evolutionary zzso using a set of decision criteria for both targets and zzso at risk zzso zzso criteria used included variation in the target dose distribution, mean dose, maximum dose, generalized equivalent uniform dose zzso an equivalent uniform dose zzso formula derived from the zzso survival model, and points on dose volume zzso zzso In order to zzso compare results from trials using different decision criteria, a neutral set of comparison metrics was zzso For each set of decision criteria investigated, zzso plans were calculated for four different zzso two simple prostate cases, one complex prostate zzso and one complex head and neck zzso 

When smaller numbers of decision criteria, more descriptive decision criteria, or less zzso decision criteria were used to characterize plan quality during zzso zzso dose to zzso and target dose variation were reduced in the final population of zzso Mean zzso dose and zzso (a zzso 4) decision criteria were zzso Using maximum dose decision criteria for zzso near targets resulted in inferior populations that focused solely on low target zzso at the expense of high zzso zzso Target dose range, zzso - zzso decision criteria were found to be most effective for keeping targets zzso Using target zzso decision criteria resulted in much lower zzso doses but much higher target dose zzso zzso based decision criteria focused on a region of plan space that was a compromise between target and zzso zzso None of these target decision criteria dominated plans using other criteria, but only focused on approaching a different area of the zzso zzso 

The choice of decision criteria implemented in the zzso had a significant impact on the region explored and the rate of convergence toward the zzso zzso When more decision criteria, zzso decision criteria, or decision criteria with insufficient information were zzso inferior populations are zzso When more zzso decision criteria were used, such as zzso zzso target dose range, and mean dose, zzso zzso focused on approaching different regions of the zzso front, but did not dominate each zzso Using simple zzso decision criteria and target zzso decision criteria demonstrated the potential to generate zzso plans that significantly reduce dose to zzso while achieving the same or better tumor control when clinical requirements on target dose zzso can be met or zzso
