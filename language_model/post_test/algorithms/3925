Image zzso in zzso zzso implies the use of accurate forward models of zzso zzso and detection of zzso signals while zzso with high spatial resolution usually involve very large zzso leading to zzso long zzso zzso The development of fast and memory efficient zzso approaches represents then an important challenge to advance on the quantitative and dynamic imaging capabilities of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso a method for zzso and acceleration of zzso zzso relying on inherent zzso present in common zzso acquisition zzso has been zzso The method is showcased for the case of zzso zzso by using polar image zzso of the zzso zzso forward model combined with efficient storage and inversion zzso 

The suggested methodology is shown to render fast and accurate zzso zzso in both zzso simulations and post zzso small animal zzso In case of a zzso detection zzso the memory requirements are reduced by one order of magnitude while high-resolution reconstructions are achieved at video zzso 

By considering the zzso symmetry present in many zzso zzso imaging systems, the proposed methodology allows exploiting the advantages of zzso zzso with feasible zzso requirements and fast reconstruction times, so that its convenience and general zzso in zzso imaging systems with zzso zzso is zzso
