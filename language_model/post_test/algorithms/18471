The zzso effects of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso channels were investigated with zzso zzso in pig zzso zzso Application of 10 zzso zzso zzso inhibited the activity of the 100 zzso zzso zzso channel, decreasing not only the channel open probability but also the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso curve of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso channel was shifted to the right zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso channel (full zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the first reported zzso to selectively block zzso channel, not only by decreasing the channel activity but also by reducing the zzso zzso in smooth zzso
