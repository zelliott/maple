In the protein folding problem, conventional simulations in physical statistical mechanical zzso such as the zzso ensemble with fixed temperature, face a great zzso This is because there exist a huge number of zzso states in the system and the conventional simulations tend to get trapped in these states, giving wrong zzso zzso zzso are based on artificial zzso ensembles and overcome the above difficulty by performing random walks in potential energy, volume, and other physical quantities or their corresponding zzso parameters such as temperature, pressure, zzso The advantage of zzso simulations lies in the fact that they not only avoid getting trapped in states of energy local zzso but also allows the calculations of physical quantities as functions of temperature or other parameters from a single simulation zzso In this article we review the zzso zzso Four examples, zzso algorithm, zzso method, zzso zzso algorithm, and zzso zzso method, are described in zzso Examples of their applications to the protein folding problem are zzso
