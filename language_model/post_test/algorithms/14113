We have proposed a method to recognize partially zzso three-dimensional zzso objects by using zzso zzso reconstruction integral imaging zzso An II system captures multiple perspectives of zzso objects by using a zzso zzso The reconstruction of the zzso zzso scene and target recognition are done digitally to reduce the effects of the zzso To verify system performance, we have implemented an optimum filter for object zzso Both two-dimensional zzso images and zzso II zzso reconstructed images are zzso The correlation results of zzso zzso images for zzso reconstruction show substantial improvements compared with those for conventional zzso imaging of zzso zzso
