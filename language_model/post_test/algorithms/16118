zzso zzso for image motion zzso are important for computer vision applications and the zzso of biological vision zzso zzso image motion zzso proceeds in two zzso the zzso of linear zzso filter kernels with the image zzso followed by the zzso combination of the filter zzso If the zzso extent of the filter kernels is large, then the zzso stage can be very intensive zzso One effective means of reducing the storage required and zzso involved in implementing the zzso zzso is the introduction of zzso zzso zzso methods require the number of frames of the image sequence stored at any given time to be equal to the zzso extent of the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso methods zzso recent stimulus history implicitly in the values of a small number of variables updated through a series of feedback zzso zzso filtering reduces the number of values stored in memory during zzso and the number of mathematical operations involved in computing the zzso zzso This paper extends previous zzso zzso of zzso and zzso motion analysis zzso zzso zzso zzso K zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Clifford zzso zzso zzso zzso K (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso describing a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso filters suitable for use in zzso and zzso zzso for image motion zzso It is shown that the zzso zzso frequency tuning zzso fit zzso estimates of the zzso properties of human visual zzso
