Long zzso zzso zzso zzso are a new type of zzso zzso and are closely related with the occurrence and development of zzso In previous studies, most zzso have been identified through next-generation zzso Because zzso exhibit zzso zzso the zzso of zzso discovery in different studies is very zzso In this study, not including zzso zzso we used the zzso structural and zzso potential features as potential features to construct a zzso that can be used to distinguish zzso from zzso The zzso zzso was performed to extract the zzso feature zzso Compared with several feature subsets, the zzso cross validation results showed that this zzso feature subset exhibited the best performance for the identification of human zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso based on zzso Features zzso was constructed by support zzso machine zzso based on the zzso feature zzso The performance of this zzso was further evaluated by predicting zzso from two independent zzso zzso Because the recognition rates for the two zzso sets were zzso and zzso the zzso was found to be effective for the prediction of human zzso
