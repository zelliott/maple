In this paper we propose a new approach to operate two-dimensional sensitivity studies on the observations of zzso an experiment on board the zzso zzso The proposed analysis system is intended to evaluate the amount and the spatial distribution of the information that is carried by zzso observations with respect to the target atmospheric zzso The new approach enables the definition and assessment of the zzso atmospheric sampling of the zzso The amount of information is evaluated by merging zzso zzso relative to different zzso in a two-dimensional analysis that models the sensitivity of the spectral signals combined with the geometrical zzso introduced by different observation zzso The spatial distribution of the information that is obtained with our analysis highlights the advantage of using a two-dimensional retrieval zzso Furthermore, within the two-dimensional context, this analysis provides crucial indications for the definition of the optimal retrieval grid and, therefore, for the best exploitation of existing zzso The proposed analysis is also suited for the design of zzso observation zzso The sensitivity analysis, applied in this paper to zzso zzso can be extended to other orbiting limb zzso that, like zzso continuously measure the atmospheric zzso along the orbit zzso
