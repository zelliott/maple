A set of sensitive zzso zzso zzso experiments for simultaneous assignments of zzso and zzso zzso positions in large proteins is zzso The developed methodology is applied to an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Complete zzso beta and zzso zzso zzso zzso chemical shift assignments could be obtained from the set of new zzso zzso zzso zzso The described methodology for zzso assignments should be zzso to protein molecules within approximately zzso molecular weight range irrespective of the labeling strategy chosen to produce selectively zzso zzso and zzso zzso sites on a zzso zzso
