We developed zzso a fast zzso to locate zzso of structural zzso zzso from zzso reads produced by next-generation zzso By taking advantage of local zzso read distribution and zzso created by zzso zzso scans the alignment of zzso reads to identify regions containing potential zzso The detection of such zzso can indicate insertions longer than the read length and zzso located in zzso regions which might be zzso by other zzso Thus, zzso zzso existing methods to locate zzso from zzso zzso
