One common and challenging problem faced by many zzso applications, such as promoter recognition, zzso site zzso zzso gene zzso drug discovery and protein zzso is the imbalance of the available zzso In most of these applications, the positive data examples are largely outnumbered by the negative data examples, which often leads to the development of zzso prediction models having high negative recognition rate zzso zzso zzso and low positive recognition rate zzso zzso zzso When class imbalance learning methods are applied, usually, the zzso is increased at the expense of reducing some amount of the zzso In this paper, we point out that in these zzso zzso applications, the goal of applying class imbalance learning methods would be to increase the zzso as high as possible by keeping the reduction of SP as low as zzso We explain that the existing performance measures used in class imbalance learning can still produce zzso models with respect to this zzso zzso In order to overcome these problems, we introduce a new performance measure called zzso zzso zzso The experimental results obtained on ten real-world zzso zzso zzso demonstrates that the zzso metric can achieve a lower rate of reduction of SP than the existing performance zzso when increasing the zzso through class imbalance learning zzso This characteristic of zzso metric makes it more suitable for achieving the proposed zzso goal in zzso zzso zzso zzso
