Biological networks are highly dynamic in response to environmental and zzso zzso This zzso is in contrast to conventional analyses of biological networks, which have overwhelmingly employed zzso graph models which stay constant over time to describe biological systems and their underlying molecular zzso 

To overcome these limitations, we propose here a new statistical zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an associated zzso procedure that allows us to learn temporally varying zzso networks from biological zzso expression zzso zzso simultaneously zzso the zzso of a regulatory network and how it changes over zzso It allows us to recover the zzso of regulatory associations for individual genes involved in a specific biological process zzso stress response, zzso 

We demonstrate that the zzso approach generates detailed insights into the function and dynamics of complex biological systems and exploits efficiently zzso data in systems zzso In particular, two biological scenarios are zzso the zzso stages of zzso zzso and the response of zzso zzso to zzso zzso 

zzso does recover essential zzso zzso in biological systems from zzso data, and provide a natural starting point to learn and investigate their dynamics in greater zzso
