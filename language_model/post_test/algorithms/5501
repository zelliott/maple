The objective of this study is to find the best set of characteristics of zzso signals for the automatic zzso of sleep zzso 

A selection was made from 74 measures, including linear spectral measures, zzso measures, and zzso measures of complexity that were zzso for the all-night zzso recordings of 20 healthy zzso The adopted zzso analysis involved zzso zzso analysis, forward selection zzso and selection by the best subset zzso Two situations were zzso the use of four zzso signals zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the use of the zzso zzso 

For the given database, the best automatic sleep zzso achieved approximately an zzso agreement with the zzso of zzso The zzso was based on the next 14 features of zzso zzso the ratio of powers in the beta and delta frequency range zzso channel zzso the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso the absolute power in the zzso 1 band zzso zzso the relative power in the delta 2 band zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso in the delta 1 band zzso zzso the zzso zzso the absolute zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso and the zzso rate zzso however, even with only four features, we could perform sleep scoring with a zzso zzso which is comparable to the zzso agreement between two independent zzso 

We have shown that zzso carefully selected zzso features were sufficient for successful sleep zzso The efficiency of the corresponding automatic zzso was verified and zzso demonstrated on all-night recordings from healthy zzso
