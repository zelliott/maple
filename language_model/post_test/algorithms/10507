Recent research efforts reveal that color may provide useful information for face zzso For different visual tasks, the choice of a color space is generally zzso How can a color space be sought for the specific face recognition problem? To address this problem, this paper represents a color image as a zzso zzso and presents the zzso zzso color space zzso zzso The model can keep the underlying spatial structure of color zzso With the definition of zzso zzso scatter zzso and zzso scatter zzso zzso zzso an zzso procedure to obtain one color space transformation zzso and two zzso projection zzso by maximizing the ratio of these two scatter zzso The experiments are conducted on two color face databases, zzso and Georgia Tech face databases, and the results show that both the performance and the efficiency of the proposed method are better than those of the state-of-the-art color image zzso model, which involve one color space transformation zzso and one zzso projection zzso specifically in a complicated face database with various pose zzso
