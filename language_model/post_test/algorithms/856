Secondary structures in zzso chain reaction zzso target sequences have a negative impact on amplification success rates and on downstream uses of zzso zzso For example, signal strength and zzso discrimination in single zzso zzso zzso zzso methods can be compromised by zzso amplification and/or by zzso product folding that limits access of interrogating zzso To increase the zzso and zzso of zzso and to aid zzso applications, we have developed zzso zzso generalized software solution that creates zzso zzso primer designs devoid of stable secondary zzso We demonstrate the effectiveness of the tool by applying it to a range of dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso designs, many of which we evaluate in the zzso We further consider how the system zzso may be made sufficiently high for use upon millions of target sequences in order to support zzso zzso
