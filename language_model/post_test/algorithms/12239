A zzso zzso model is employed to represent a networked control system zzso with different zzso zzso Comparing with existing zzso modeling methods, this approach does not require the knowledge of exact values of zzso zzso Instead, it addresses situations involving all possible zzso zzso Moreover, this approach also handles zzso zzso As an application of the zzso modeling method, a zzso approach and a zzso approach for fault detection of an zzso were zzso An example of a zzso zzso zzso is used to illustrate the utility and viability of the proposed zzso
