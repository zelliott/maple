To assess the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso twist using zzso Assessing the zzso of the measurement of new zzso zzso is an important part of zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso is a new zzso tissue tagging method that has recently been shown to compare favorably with conventional estimates of left zzso zzso twist from cardiac zzso images, but with significantly reduced user interaction zzso 

Healthy volunteers zzso were scanned twice using zzso over 1 zzso On day 1, two zzso of zzso twist were collected for zzso zzso zzso for zzso twist were again collected on day 8 for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images were acquired on a 3 zzso zzso scanner to ensure zzso of tags during early and zzso Peak zzso twist is reported as zzso zzso was assessed using the zzso correlation zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso 

Mean peak twist zzso were zzso zzso 1, scan 1), zzso zzso 1, scan zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis resulted in zzso and zzso bias and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso for peak zzso twist was zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso The CCC was zzso and zzso for peak zzso twist for zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso is a zzso method that provides a quick and quantitative assessment of zzso zzso and zzso twist that demonstrates high zzso and moderate zzso zzso in preliminary zzso
