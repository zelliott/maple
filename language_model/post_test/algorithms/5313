We investigate synchronization between the zzso zzso of heart rate and blood pressure having in humans a basic frequency close to zzso zzso A method is proposed for quantitative zzso of synchronization between these zzso processes based on calculation of relative time of phase synchronization of zzso It is shown that healthy subjects exhibit on average substantially longer epochs of internal synchronization between the zzso zzso in heart rate and blood pressure than patients after acute zzso zzso
