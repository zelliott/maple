The zzso principle states that a history of a set of sequences that zzso the amount of evolution is a good approximation to the real evolutionary history of the zzso This principle is applied to the reconstruction of the evolution of zzso sequences where zzso or horizontal transfer can zzso First it is demonstrated that the appropriate structure to represent the evolution of sequences with zzso is a family of trees each describing the evolution of a segment of the zzso Two trees for neighboring segments will differ by exactly the transfer of a zzso within the whole zzso This leads to a metric between trees based on the smallest number of such operations needed to convert one tree into the zzso An zzso is presented that zzso this zzso This metric is used to formulate a dynamic programming zzso that finds the most zzso history that fits a given set of zzso The zzso is potentially very practical, since many groups of sequences defy analysis by methods that ignore zzso These methods give ambiguous or contradictory results because the sequence history cannot be described by one zzso but only a family of zzso that each describe the history of a segment of the zzso The zzso of the zzso to reconstruct gene zzso and the possibility for zzso versions of the zzso for larger data sets are zzso
