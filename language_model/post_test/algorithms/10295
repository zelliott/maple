This study examines the genetic variation in zzso Y zzso lineages using data on 12 zzso tandem repeat zzso zzso in a sample of 158 males from four zzso provinces of Spain zzso zzso zzso and zzso As reported in previous studies, the zzso are characterized by high zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrates genetic zzso with a small but significant amount of genetic structure between provinces zzso tandem repeat zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Gene and zzso diversity levels in the zzso population are on the low end of the European distribution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contribution to the paternal zzso gene pool was estimated by measuring the proportion of those zzso with a Time to Most Recent Common zzso zzso previously dated either prior zzso zzso or subsequent to zzso zzso zzso the zzso Based on these estimates, the zzso provinces show varying degrees of zzso contribution in the paternal lineages zzso in the combined zzso
