zzso zzso factor binding sites zzso is one of primary challenges to decipher complex gene regulatory networks encrypted in a zzso A set of short DNA sequences identified by a zzso factor zzso is known as a zzso which can be expressed accurately in zzso form such as a zzso scoring zzso zzso and a position frequency zzso Very zzso we need to query a motif in a database of motifs by seeking its similar zzso merge similar zzso motifs possibly identified by the same zzso separate irrelevant zzso or filter out zzso zzso zzso a novel metric is required to seize slight differences between irrelevant motifs and highlight the similarity between motifs of the same group in all these zzso While there are already several metrics for motif similarity proposed before, their performance is still far from satisfactory for these zzso 

A novel metric has been proposed in this paper with name as zzso zzso with zzso Information zzso for measuring the similarity between a column of a motif and a column of another zzso When defining this similarity score, we consider the likelihood that the column of the first zzso zzso can be produced by the column of the second zzso zzso and multiply the likelihood by the information content of the column of the second zzso zzso and zzso zzso We evaluated the performance of zzso combined with a local or a global alignment method having a function for zzso gap penalty, for computing the similarity between two zzso We also compared zzso with seven existing zzso metrics for their capability of zzso motifs from the same group and retrieving motifs from a database on three zzso 

When used jointly with the zzso local alignment method with an zzso gap penalty function zzso open penalty is equal to 1, gap extension penalty is equal to zzso zzso zzso the seven existing state-of-the-art motif similarity metrics combined with their best alignments for matching motifs in database searches, and zzso the same zzso zzso or distinguishing relevant ones from a zzso group of zzso 

We have developed a novel motif similarity metric that can more accurately match motifs in database searches, and more effectively cluster similar motifs and differentiate irrelevant motifs than do the other seven metrics we are aware zzso
