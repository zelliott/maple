We have developed a computer program, called zzso for the automatic generation of candidate structures zzso to the requirements of a given zzso The treatment consists in connecting the zzso pieces with zzso assembled from small chemical entities zzso zzso or ring zzso We have tested the program on several sets of input fragments, each zzso selected functional groups obtained from the zzso zzso of reference zzso In addition to the expected solutions, the program can generate new structures that are chemically unrelated to the reference zzso This provides an unbiased starting point for the design of new generations of lead zzso The concept used in this approach is presented and zzso The present possibilities of the program are illustrated by some zzso The treatment is very fast, because only a few bonds are created between building blocks already having ideal zzso The ability to generate rapidly a variety of molecules zzso to a three-dimensional zzso model makes zzso a useful tool with wide zzso in rational drug design, including the areas of molecular mimicry and zzso
