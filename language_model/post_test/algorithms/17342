zzso zzso zzso the activity of inwardly zzso zzso channels zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso channel zzso currents was investigated using the zzso patch clamp technique in cardiac zzso and in zzso cells in which the cardiac zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso with the inwardly zzso channel zzso zzso (1 zzso increased the open probability of zzso in low zzso (1 zzso within 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a longer onset period zzso zzso zzso channels inhibited by zzso (1 zzso zzso treatment for 10 zzso shifted the zzso zzso zzso from 35 zzso to 16 zzso At the single-channel level, increased zzso caused a shorter mean open time and a longer mean closed zzso zzso prolonged the mean open time, shortened the mean closed time, and weakened the zzso dependence of these parameters resulting in a higher open probability at any given zzso The apparent rate zzso for zzso binding were estimated to be zzso and zzso zzso zzso before and after zzso treatment with zzso which zzso to a zzso of 35 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to zzso zzso zzso of zzso In the presence of zzso zzso attenuated zzso antagonism of zzso zzso zzso a truncated zzso that functions without zzso also exhibited zzso zzso of zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso strongly compete with zzso at a binding site residing on zzso zzso zzso interaction is a characteristic property of this zzso and zzso in conjunction with zzso zzso render zzso complex effects on zzso zzso We propose a model of the zzso binding site involving positively charged zzso on the zzso of zzso with which zzso interact to zzso zzso zzso
