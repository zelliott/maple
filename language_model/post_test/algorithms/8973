Estimates of the ancestry of specific zzso regions in zzso individuals are useful for studies of human evolutionary history and for genetic association zzso Previously, this ancestry zzso relied on high-quality zzso from zzso association study zzso zzso These high-quality zzso are not always available when samples are zzso zzso and zzso sequencing is the strategy of choice for many ongoing genetic zzso Here we show that zzso reads generated during zzso experiments can be combined with zzso reads to accurately estimate the ancestry of each zzso segment in an zzso zzso To reconstruct local zzso our method zzso models aligned bases directly instead of relying on hard zzso zzso We evaluate the accuracy of our method through simulations and analysis of samples zzso by the 1000 zzso Project and the zzso Grand zzso zzso zzso zzso In African Americans, we show that zzso estimates derived by our method are very similar to those derived with zzso zzso zzso zzso array and much improved in relation to estimates that use only zzso zzso and ignore zzso sequencing zzso Software implementing this method, zzso can be applied to analysis of human population history or used for genetic association studies in zzso zzso
