In diffusion magnetic resonance imaging with zzso diffusion imaging, a set of techniques has become available that allows better acquisition and representation of zzso diffusion profiles, zzso in zzso with zzso branching and kissing zzso The poor spatial resolution and low zzso ratio of the data, particularly when acquired under clinical conditions, prevent zzso zzso from reliably reconstructing complex white matter zzso With zzso zzso an zzso smoothing approach has been zzso which, in this article, is refined and adapted to fibers with zzso zzso By introducing the concept of zzso orientation distribution functions zzso we are able to sharpen diffusion profiles of zzso fibers and estimate zzso zzso We also propose a deterministic zzso zzso that exploits the enhanced resolution of zzso The approach is evaluated zzso and compared with state-of-the-art zzso techniques in a study with a biological diffusion zzso Moreover, we present results from an in zzso study in which we demonstrate the zzso ability to zzso zzso of zzso fiber pathways of zzso zzso
