Species diversity and seasonal abundance of zzso flies zzso zzso developing in zzso cake zzso zzso stored at a wastewater treatment facility in northeastern Kansas were zzso zzso traps were deployed 19 May through 20 October 2009 zzso zzso and 27 May through 18 November 2010 zzso zzso In total, zzso zzso flies were collected emerging from the zzso zzso zzso flies zzso zzso zzso and house flies zzso zzso zzso represented 80 and zzso of the zzso flies, zzso An estimated 550 stable flies and 220 house flies per zzso of surface area developed in the zzso cake annually producing 450,000 stable flies and zzso house zzso zzso fly emergence was seasonally zzso with a primary peak in zzso and a secondary peak in late zzso House fly emergence peaked with the first stable fly emergence peak and then declined gradually for the remainder of the zzso House flies tended to emerge from the zzso cake sooner after its deposition than did stable zzso In addition, house fly emergence was concentrated around zzso whereas stable fly emergence began earlier in the spring and continued later into the zzso zzso age and temperature were the most important parameters affecting emergence for house flies and stable flies, whereas zzso was not important for either zzso This study highlights the importance of zzso cake as a zzso zzso habitat for stable flies and house zzso
