This paper investigates the use of inverse zzso modeling zzso methods for tissue zzso identification using a rolling zzso probe for surgical zzso An zzso zzso is proposed for tissue zzso identification through zzso zzso zzso zzso are also created for locating and identifying the properties of an embedded tumor through rolling zzso of the soft zzso Two types of zzso identification for the tissue tumor are investigated zzso identifying the zzso zzso of a tumor at a known depth and zzso zzso the depth of the tumor zzso with known mechanical zzso The efficiency of proposed methods has been evaluated through silicone and zzso kidney experiments for both zzso zzso and rolling zzso The results show that both of the proposed zzso methods for zzso zzso and rolling zzso have good zzso and can rapidly zzso to the correct zzso The tissue properties estimated using the developed method are generic and in good agreement with results obtained from standard material zzso The zzso error of zzso through zzso zzso is below 3 % for both silicone and zzso the zzso error of zzso for the tumor through rolling zzso is 7-9 zzso The zzso error of D through rolling zzso is 1-2 zzso
