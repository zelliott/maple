In this work computer simulations and phantom zzso are presented that show the effect of flow on zzso balanced zzso free zzso zzso The images were studied for various flow zzso zzso regions, relaxation times, zzso angles, and zzso zzso The work shows that zzso disturbances are present in the images, but can be reduced by the application of zzso zzso zzso Also, a zzso zzso method that zzso the disturbances was developed and proved to zzso flow zzso zzso The work concluded that the zzso disturbances can be reduced to improve image quality, but can also be exploited to zzso the flow zzso
