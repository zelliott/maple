To assess the performance of a recently developed zzso zzso zzso technique, Cartesian Acquisition with zzso sampling zzso for accurate characterization and treatment planning of vascular zzso of the zzso 

Twelve patient studies were performed zzso female, four zzso average age, 33 zzso The protocol consisted of three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso followed by a single late phase zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso in the zzso hand, zzso and zzso Imaging evaluation was performed for accurate characterization of zzso type, identification of feeding and draining vessels, involvement with surrounding zzso overall quality for diagnosis and treatment planning, and correlation with conventional zzso 

zzso zzso allowed for characterization of zzso flow and zzso Feeding and draining vessels were identified in all zzso zzso quality for diagnosis and treatment planning was zzso and correlation with conventional zzso was scored as zzso 

The zzso time series has been shown to portray the zzso dynamics and structure of vascular zzso as well as the normal zzso with high zzso zzso zzso imaging is able to accurately characterize high and low flow zzso allowing for zzso zzso assessment and treatment zzso Delayed imaging is important to capture complete filling of very slow flow vascular zzso
