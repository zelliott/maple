Recently, a framework for analyzing time series by constructing an associated complex network has attracted significant research zzso One of the advantages of the complex network method for studying time series is that complex network theory provides a tool to describe either important zzso or structures that exist in the networks, at different zzso zzso This can then provide distinct information for time series of different zzso zzso In this paper, we systematically investigate the zzso phase space network of order k that has previously been used to specify different types of dynamics in terms of the motif ranking from a different zzso Globally, we find that the network size scales with different scale zzso and the degree distribution follows a zzso bell shape around the value of zzso with different values of degree zzso from periodic to chaotic zzso zzso Local network properties such as the zzso degree, the zzso zzso and zzso zzso are found to be sensitive to the local stability of the orbits and hence contain complementary zzso
