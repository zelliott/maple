zzso is a zzso zzso refinement zzso zzso assembles the structural model, scales observed and calculated zzso zzso and zzso the model likelihood, whilst TNT handles the zzso and zzso zzso and shifts the atomic zzso B factors and zzso In real space, in addition to the traditional atomic and zzso models, zzso models the parts of the structure for which an atomic model is not yet available zzso zzso as zzso probability zzso for the random positions of the missing zzso In zzso space, the zzso zzso distribution in the complex plane is a two-dimensional zzso zzso around the structure factor calculated from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The errors associated with these three structural components are added to zzso the overall spread of the zzso When the atomic model is very incomplete, zzso of the missing structure and the consistency of the zzso statistical model help structure building and completion because zzso the accuracy of the overall scale factors is increased, zzso the bias affecting atomic model refinement is reduced by accounting for some of the scattering from the missing structure, zzso the addition of a spatial definition to the source of incompleteness improves on traditional zzso and zzso error models and zzso the program can perform selective density modification in the regions of zzso structure zzso
