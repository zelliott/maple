Pulmonary zzso tree structures related to blood flow zzso were simulated by using a symmetrical, zzso model in three-dimensional zzso The branch angle zzso zzso length ratio zzso branch rotation angle zzso and branch fraction of parent flow zzso for a single zzso were defined and repeated zzso through 11 zzso With zzso fixed at 90 degrees , tree structures were generated with zzso between 60 and 90 degrees , zzso between zzso and zzso and an initial segment length of zzso zzso and zzso into zzso samples for zzso Blood flow relative zzso zzso between 52 and zzso and zzso dimensions zzso between zzso and zzso in zzso samples were observed even with equal branch zzso When gamma not equal zzso zzso increased, but Ds either decreased with gravity bias of higher branch flows or increased with random assignment of higher zzso Blood flow zzso along gravity and zzso zzso increased with biased flow assignment of higher flows, and blood flows correlated zzso with distance only when gamma not equal zzso Thus a zzso branching vascular tree structure simulated Ds and zzso values for blood flow zzso similar to those observed zzso in the pulmonary circulation due to differences in the number of terminal zzso per zzso sample, but blood flow zzso and a negative correlation of flows with distance required unequal zzso of blood flows at branch zzso
