Nuclear zzso signals zzso are stretches of zzso in proteins zzso their importing into the zzso zzso are known to have diverse patterns, of which only a limited number are covered by currently known zzso zzso Here we propose a sequential pattern mining zzso zzso to effectively identify potential zzso patterns without being constrained by the limitation of current knowledge of zzso The extracted frequent sequential patterns are used to predict zzso candidates which are then filtered by a linear zzso scheme based on predicted sequence disorder and by the relatively local conservation zzso based zzso The experiment results on the newly curated zzso and zzso zzso show that zzso is effective in detecting potential zzso The performance comparison between zzso with and without the linear motif scoring shows that linear motif features are highly complementary to sequence features in discerning zzso For the two independent zzso our zzso not only can consistently find over 50% of zzso with prediction precision of at least zzso but also zzso other state-of-the-art zzso prediction methods in terms of F1 score or prediction precision with similar or higher recall zzso The web server of the zzso zzso is available at zzso
