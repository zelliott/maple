Small interfering zzso zzso are widely used to zzso gene zzso Here, insights in the equilibrium of zzso zzso are used for selection of efficient zzso The zzso of zzso and target zzso for zzso as measured by folding free energy change, are shown to be significantly correlated with zzso For this study, a partition function calculation that considers all possible secondary structures is used to predict target site zzso a significant improvement over calculations that consider only the predicted lowest free energy structure or a set of low free energy zzso The predicted zzso features, in addition to zzso sequence features, are used as input for a support zzso machine that selects functional zzso The method works well for predicting efficient zzso zzso zzso in a large zzso data set from zzso The positive zzso value zzso of sites predicted to be efficient for zzso that zzso is as high as zzso The sensitivity and specificity are zzso and zzso zzso When tested on data from different sources, the positive zzso value increased zzso by adding equilibrium terms to 25 local sequence zzso zzso of zzso affinity using partition functions is now available in the zzso software zzso
