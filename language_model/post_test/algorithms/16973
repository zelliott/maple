We propose and compare methods of analysis for detecting associations between zzso of a single zzso zzso zzso and a zzso secondary zzso zzso when the data arise from a zzso study of a primary zzso zzso zzso which is not zzso We considered both a zzso zzso zzso as in zzso or dominant models and an additive genetic model based on the number of minor zzso zzso To estimate the log odds ratio zzso relating X to G in the general population, one needs to understand the conditional distribution zzso zzso X, zzso in the general zzso For the most general model, zzso zzso X, zzso one needs external data on zzso zzso 1) to estimate zzso We show that for this zzso zzso the maximum likelihood zzso zzso to a previously proposed weighted zzso zzso zzso approach if G is zzso For the additive model, zzso yields results zzso close, but not zzso to those of the maximum likelihood zzso Efficiency can be gained by assuming that zzso zzso X, zzso is a zzso model with no interaction between X and G (the zzso zzso However, the resulting maximum likelihood zzso can be misleading in the presence of zzso We therefore propose an zzso weighted approach zzso that captures the efficiency of zzso but is robust to the occasional zzso that might interact with the secondary zzso to affect the risk of the primary zzso We study the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso of zzso zzso zzso In principle, one should be able to estimate zzso without external information on zzso zzso 1) under the reduced zzso However, our simulations show that the resulting zzso is zzso zzso in practice one needs to introduce external information on zzso zzso 1), even in the absence of interactions between X and zzso
