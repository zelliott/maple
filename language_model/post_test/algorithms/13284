zzso cell disease zzso leads to tissue zzso resulting in chronic organ dysfunction including zzso associated zzso The goal of our study was to determine the best equation to estimate zzso zzso rate zzso in zzso adult zzso 

We conducted a prospective zzso cohort zzso Since 2007, all adult zzso patients in steady state, followed in two medical departments, have had their zzso measured using zzso plasma clearance zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and finally, zzso and zzso equations without adjustment for ethnicity were tested to estimate zzso from serum zzso zzso zzso were compared to measured zzso according to the zzso zzso and Altman zzso 

zzso zzso patients (16 men, median age zzso years zzso zzso 41 with zzso were zzso They were zzso Africa and French West zzso natives and predominantly lean zzso body mass zzso 22 zzso zzso zzso zzso as measured zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso of zzso zzso zzso ratio was higher in patients with zzso than in patients with normal zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The zzso equation without adjustment for ethnicity had both the lowest bias and the greatest zzso zzso between estimated zzso using the zzso equation and measured zzso decreased with increasing zzso values, whereas it increased with the zzso and zzso zzso 

We confirm that zzso patients have a high rate of zzso zzso which is frequently associated with zzso or zzso In zzso zzso patients, the best method for zzso zzso from serum zzso is the zzso equation without adjustment for zzso This equation is particularly accurate to estimate high zzso values, including zzso zzso and thus should be recommended to screen zzso adult patients at high risk for zzso zzso
