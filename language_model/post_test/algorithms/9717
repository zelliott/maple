In this paper, the main results related to a fall detection system are shown by means of a personal server for the control and processing of the data acquired from multiple intelligent biomedical zzso This server is designed in the context of a zzso system for the elderly, to whom falls represent a high-risk cause of serious injuries, and its architecture can be extended to patients suffering from chronic zzso The main design issues and developments in terms of the server hardware and software are presented with the aim of providing a real-time analysis of the processed zzso As a result, the evaluation study of the implemented zzso for fall detection through a set of laboratory experiments is zzso together with some important issues in terms of the zzso zzso The proposed zzso exhibits excellent outcomes in fall zzso
