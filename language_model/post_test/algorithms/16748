Several equations for the zzso of zzso zzso rate zzso from serum zzso C have been zzso We compared the results obtained using these equations to test the zzso of their results as well as their usefulness in clinical zzso 

Seven hundred and zzso zzso were zzso Of these, zzso were male and 288 were female, and their mean age was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was estimated from serum zzso using the zzso zzso of Diet in Renal Disease zzso zzso zzso was estimated from serum zzso C levels using five different zzso 

The simplest zzso zzso formula rendered the highest estimated zzso and the zzso equation rendered the lowest zzso even significantly lower than the zzso equation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso From the simplest formula to the zzso equation the mean difference calculated was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No differences by gender were found among the results of different zzso All zzso zzso equations reduced the number of patients diagnosed of chronic zzso failure when compared with zzso zzso No patient with normal zzso function was shifted to the zzso disease zzso 

A higher value could be expected when zzso is estimated from zzso zzso Nevertheless, vast differences were found in the results when tested using several zzso Physicians should be aware of this problem to avoid a wrong clinical diagnosis of zzso zzso
