A solution to manage cumbersome data sets associated with large zzso projects is zzso A kinetic model of zzso zzso in zzso is used to predict changes in zzso metabolism with zzso zzso zzso This results in large amounts of output data to be zzso Growth is simulated by zzso zzso activity values, specific to each zzso of the zzso plant, to zzso attributes of a model zzso From a programming perspective, only one model definition file is required for the simulation software zzso however, the amount of input data increases with each extra zzso that is zzso and likewise the amount of output data that is generated also zzso To store, manipulate and zzso these data, the zzso was performed from within a zzso This was made possible by the zzso language Python and the zzso software zzso through an embedded Python interpreter available in the zzso spreadsheet zzso
