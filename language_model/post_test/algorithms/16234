zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso fields can be achieved by the use of zzso zzso zzso and zzso reconstruction of zzso zzso However, the long acquisition time of zzso spectral data is generally unbearable for in zzso zzso To overcome this problem, two pulse sequences dubbed as zzso and zzso were proposed in this zzso Although zzso acquisition is still required for the new zzso the high-resolution zzso zzso can be obtained with a relatively short scanning time utilizing the manipulation of indirect evolution period and sparse zzso The zzso zzso zzso treatment combined with the raising and lowering operators was applied to derive zzso signal expressions for the new zzso And the experimental observations agree with the theoretical zzso Our results show that the new sequences possess bright perspective in the applications on in zzso localized zzso zzso
