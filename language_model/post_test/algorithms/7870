Reliable quantitative analysis of white matter connectivity in the brain is an open problem in zzso with common solutions requiring tools for fiber zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso This paper proposes a novel, template matching approach to the zzso In the proposed method, a zzso zzso model is aligned directly with the subject zzso field, skipping the fiber tracking zzso Furthermore, the use of a common template eliminates the need for zzso zzso and defines zzso shape zzso The method is validated using phantom zzso data and applications are zzso including automatic zzso reconstruction and zzso zzso
