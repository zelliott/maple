zzso identification is a key and essential step in mass zzso zzso based zzso zzso To date, there are many protein identification strategies that employ either zzso data or zzso data for database zzso While zzso methods provide wider coverage than zzso methods, their identification accuracy is lower since zzso data have less information than zzso zzso Thus, it is desired to design more sophisticated zzso that achieve higher identification accuracy using zzso zzso zzso Mass zzso zzso has been widely used to identify single zzso proteins from zzso data for many zzso In this paper, we extend this technology to protein mixture zzso First, we formulate the problem of protein mixture identification as a zzso Set Covering zzso zzso Then, we present several zzso that can solve the zzso problem zzso Finally, we extend the partial set covering model to both zzso data and the combination of zzso data and zzso zzso The experimental results on simulated data and real data demonstrate the advantages of our method: 1) it zzso previous zzso approaches zzso 2) it is useful in the zzso protein zzso and 3) it combines zzso data and zzso data in a unified model such that the identification performance is further zzso
