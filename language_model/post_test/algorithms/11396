zzso complex zzso index zzso has attracted intensive attentions due to its significance in modeling zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso from surface zzso of zzso scattering and zzso zzso as well as number size zzso during June, 2008 based on an zzso zzso zzso were zzso The aim of our study was to introduce an inversion approach with the merits of high zzso to retrieve the zzso effective zzso especially its imaginary zzso Based on simultaneous zzso of zzso zzso mean zzso value of zzso ( zzso zzso ( zzso zzso at 550 zzso in zzso in summer was zzso The lower imaginary parts with higher single scattering zzso and lower scattering zzso zzso were obtained for zzso periods compared with zzso conditions with similar zzso zzso indicating more large and scattering particles contributing to the formation of zzso zzso The derived imaginary parts of zzso related to agricultural biomass burning were in the range from zzso to zzso at 550 zzso zzso negative correlations between retrieved imaginary parts of zzso and measured single scattering zzso indicate that our retrieval approach is a reasonable method for determining the imaginary parts of complex zzso zzso of zzso zzso
