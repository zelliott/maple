In this report, we propose the use of structural equations as a tool for identifying and modeling genetic networks and genetic zzso for searching the most likely genetic networks that best fit the zzso After genetic networks are identified, it is fundamental to identify those networks influencing cell zzso To accomplish this task we extend the concept of differential expression of the zzso widely used in gene expression data analysis, to genetic zzso We propose a definition for the differential expression of a genetic network and use the generalized zzso statistic to measure the ability of genetic networks to distinguish different zzso However, describing the differential expression of genetic networks is not enough for understanding biological systems because differences in the expression of genetic networks do not directly reflect regulatory strength between gene zzso zzso in this report we also introduce the concept of zzso regulated genetic networks, which has the potential to assess changes of gene regulation in response to zzso in the environment and may provide new insights into the mechanism of diseases and biological zzso We propose five novel statistics to measure the differences in regulation of genetic zzso To illustrate the concepts and methods for reconstruction of genetic networks and identification of association of genetic networks with function, we applied the proposed models and zzso to three data zzso
