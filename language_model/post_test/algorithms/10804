Different classes of zzso block zzso exist and the ideal zzso to assess their performance would be to zzso zzso a large zzso region in a large zzso Such data sets are expensive to zzso zzso we performed zzso simulations to generate zzso with a high marker density and compared block zzso results from diversity based, zzso based, and information zzso zzso under different values of zzso density and zzso zzso 

We simulated 1000 zzso using the standard zzso for three world zzso African American, and East zzso applied three classes of block zzso zzso based, zzso based, and information zzso We assessed zzso differences in number, size, and coverage of blocks zzso under different conditions of zzso density, zzso frequency, and sample zzso Each zzso zzso blocks differing in number, size, and coverage under different density and zzso frequency zzso Different partitions had few if any matching block zzso However they still overlapped and a high percentage of total zzso region was common to all zzso This percentage was generally higher with a higher density of zzso and when rarer markers were zzso 

A gold standard definition of a zzso block is difficult to zzso but collecting zzso covered with a high density of zzso zzso them with a variety of block zzso and identifying regions common to all methods may be the best way to identify zzso regions that harbor zzso zzso that cause zzso
