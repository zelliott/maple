The binding of zzso fragments of zzso to class II zzso is a crucial step in initiating a helper T cell immune zzso The identification of such zzso zzso has potential applications in vaccine design and in better understanding zzso diseases and zzso However, comprehensive experimental determination of zzso binding affinities is zzso due to zzso diversity and the large number of possible zzso zzso zzso methods trained on the limited experimental binding data can address this zzso We present the zzso method, an extension of our previous zzso zzso prediction method, which allows the prediction of zzso binding affinities for multiple zzso zzso not used to train the zzso Thus predictions can be made for many zzso zzso for which experimental binding data is zzso 

We fit zzso models for both zzso and zzso using large experimental binding data zzso The performance in predicting binding affinities for novel zzso zzso not in the training set, was tested in two different zzso First, we performed zzso zzso in which predictions are made for one zzso using a model fit to binding data for the remaining zzso zzso zzso of the zzso results with those of two other prediction methods applied to the same data sets showed that zzso achieved performance comparable to zzso and better than the earlier zzso zzso We also directly tested model zzso by making zzso predictions for additional zzso characterized sets of overlapping zzso zzso binding to multiple zzso zzso In addition, we determined the zzso of prediction methods like zzso to other zzso zzso by examining the degree of zzso variation accounted for in the training zzso An examination of predictions for the zzso binding zzso zzso revealed variations in binding affinity among zzso as well as potentially distinct binding registers for zzso and zzso Finally, we analyzed the optimal zzso parameters to discover the most important zzso zzso for zzso and zzso binding to zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso method yields competitive performance but with a significantly simpler and physically zzso model compared with previous prediction zzso A zzso prediction zzso is available at zzso
