zzso control is one of the most effective methods for controlling the interaction between a zzso and a task zzso In conventional zzso control methods, however, the zzso cannot be controlled until the zzso contacts task zzso A zzso zzso control method has been proposed to resolve such a zzso This method on only can regulate the zzso zzso but also the virtual zzso that works between the zzso and the environment by using visual zzso This paper proposes a learning method using neural networks to regulate the virtual zzso parameters according to a given zzso The zzso of the proposed method was verified through computer simulations and experiments with a zzso robotic zzso
