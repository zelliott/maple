zzso zzso of zzso are most clearly perceived in the en face projection and may be assessed by inspection of zzso power zzso calculated from electron zzso of individual zzso However, if the symmetry is not contrasted zzso this procedure may be zzso since the relevant peak may not be convincingly higher than other spectral zzso To some extent, this is a sampling problem since the number of repeating elements involved is usually zzso We have devised more sensitive statistical tests for zzso symmetry that pool the information contents of entire populations of zzso Both tests involve combining the zzso zzso of many particles and comparing them with the zzso of surrounding background zzso One method is based on the well known zzso which estimates whether two populations differ at a given significance zzso In the second test, the ratio between the intensity of each component of the zzso spectrum and the average corresponding intensity for background areas is zzso and zzso the cumulative product of these ratios over all particles in the data zzso If a symmetry is present, this product gradually zzso otherwise, it zzso to zzso As a practical trial, the tests were applied to zzso of zzso stained zzso of zzso zzso virus and confirmed their zzso zzso zzso to zzso stained zzso proteins of zzso zzso zzso from a zzso expression system, both zzso detected zzso with distinct zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso
