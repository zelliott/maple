The development of statistical models linking the molecular state of a cell to its physiology is one of the most important tasks in the analysis of zzso zzso zzso Because of the large number of variables measured a comprehensive evaluation of variable zzso cannot be performed with available zzso zzso It follows that an efficient variable selection strategy is zzso However, although software packages for performing zzso variable selection are available, a comprehensive software environment to develop and evaluate zzso statistical models using a zzso variable selection strategy is still zzso In order to address this issue, we developed zzso an R package based on a genetic zzso variable selection strategy, primarily designed to develop statistical models from large-scale zzso
