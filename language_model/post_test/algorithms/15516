A zzso model was developed from zzso lateral zzso to predict zzso spinal zzso in elderly zzso 

To investigate the zzso of age-related spinal zzso and zzso height loss associated with zzso zzso 

zzso bone loss and disc zzso associated with aging causes bone and disc structures to weaken and zzso as a result of gravity and zzso zzso 

An zzso accurate zzso zzso zzso model of the anterior spinal column zzso was created by zzso lateral zzso zzso of 20 human subjects with a mean height of zzso zzso and a mean body weight of zzso zzso Body weight loads were applied to the model, after which zzso disc and zzso body forces and deformation were zzso and the new spine geometry was zzso The strength and zzso of the zzso bodies were reduced according to an zzso aging model and zzso reduction algorithm, zzso 

The most zzso model zzso zzso zzso 750 N) produced gross zzso of the spine, including anterior zzso fracture zzso at zzso and zzso In this model, increases in zzso zzso and decreases in zzso body height resulted in a zzso decrease in spinal height zzso an zzso decrease in total body zzso and a zzso anterior translation of the C2 spine segment zzso The resulting zzso zzso resembled zzso observed in elderly individuals with zzso zzso zzso 

These predictions suggest that zzso forces are responsible for initiation of zzso spinal zzso in elderly zzso zzso zzso are exacerbated by anterior translation of the upper spinal column, which increases zzso loads in the zzso region of the zzso
