zzso models of calcium release sites derived from zzso chain models of zzso calcium channels exhibit collective gating reminiscent of the zzso observed phenomenon of zzso calcium zzso zzso calcium zzso and zzso We present a zzso structured representation for calcium release site models and perform benchmark stationary distribution calculations using zzso zzso solution techniques that leverage this zzso In this context we find zzso methods and certain zzso projection methods superior to simple zzso type zzso Response measures such as the number of channels in a particular state zzso more quickly using these zzso zzso methods than occupation measures calculated via zzso Carlo zzso
