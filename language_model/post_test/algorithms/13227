We extend coherent zzso imaging zzso to a high zzso zzso reflection mode geometry for the first zzso We derive a coordinate transform that allows us to rewrite the recorded zzso scatter pattern from a zzso object as a zzso spaced zzso zzso Using this approach, zzso in standard zzso phase retrieval zzso can be used to significantly speed up the image reconstruction zzso Moreover, we avoid the isolated sample requirement by imaging a pinhole onto the zzso in a technique termed zzso zzso zzso By combining the new coordinate transformation with zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate rapid high zzso zzso imaging of samples illuminated by visible laser zzso Finally, we demonstrate future promise for this technique by using high harmonic beams for high zzso zzso reflection mode zzso
