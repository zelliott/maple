Since its release in September 2009, the zzso program zzso based on the combination of locating small model fragments such as zzso zzso with density modification with the program zzso in a zzso frame, has evolved to incorporate other sources of zzso or experimental zzso zzso that are more sophisticated than the ubiquitous zzso zzso can be proposed by zzso side chains onto the main chain or extracted from zzso models, as locally their structure may be similar enough to the unknown one even if the conventional zzso approach has been zzso In such cases, the program may test a set of alternative models in parallel against a specified figure of merit and proceed with the selected zzso Experimental information can be incorporated in three ways: searching within zzso for an anomalous zzso against anomalous differences or MAD data or finding model fragments when an anomalous zzso has been determined with another program such as zzso or is subsequently located in the anomalous zzso map calculated from the partial zzso zzso Both sources of information may be combined in the expansion zzso In all these cases the key is to control the zzso to maximize the chances of success whilst avoiding the creation of an intractable number of parallel zzso A zzso has been implemented to aid the setup of suitable strategies within the various typical zzso In the present work, the practical application of zzso within each of these scenarios is described through the distributed test zzso
