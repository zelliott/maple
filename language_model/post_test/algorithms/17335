zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso exchange is used to investigate residual zzso zzso in a series of zzso zzso zzso A new model for the zzso unit is used for the evaluation of the signal zzso in zzso exchange zzso It takes into account an extended residual zzso zzso network along the zzso zzso It is shown that in the regime of short mixing times, information about the residual zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso can be obtained which is not affected by other zzso and zzso zzso zzso The dynamic order zzso of zzso zzso is measured and correlated with zzso zzso This study zzso the quality of a filter for zzso from residual zzso zzso which exploit zzso zzso The filter can be used to generate contrast in zzso images of zzso zzso The first zzso zzso zzso image of a dynamic order zzso is presented for a phantom made from zzso samples with different zzso zzso
