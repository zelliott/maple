zzso operating characteristic zzso curve analysis is widely used in biomedical research to assess the performance of diagnostic zzso Much of the work has been directed at developing accurate zzso to describe zzso zzso and appropriate statistics to test differences between zzso The analysis, however, is largely built on the assumption that the test results are zzso We zzso the zzso curve analysis to allow for tests to have more than two zzso The generalized zzso curve constitutes a zzso We propose to use the volume under the surface to measure the accuracy of a diagnostic zzso
