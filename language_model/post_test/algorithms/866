zzso zzso and zzso zzso as a function of surface area were measured for zzso of zzso B zzso and cholesterol zzso at the zzso interface at 10, 20, and 30 degrees zzso When zzso was used as a spreading zzso the zzso zzso of the mixed zzso exhibited characteristic transitions from the gas to zzso then zzso and finally the solid zzso The expanding effect in zzso was accompanied by a large zzso zzso and a positive excess of free energy of mixing at high zzso At low zzso a condensing effect was observed with the most significant zzso from zzso occurring at a mole fraction of zzso zzso of zzso Free energy calculations revealed a condensing effect at low zzso and an expanding effect at high zzso except at 30 degrees C, where a condensing effect was observed for zzso around zzso In contrast, when zzso was used as spreading zzso the mixed zzso at 20 degrees C exhibited zzso zzso which obey van der zzso equation of state, with no visible zzso low zzso a condensing effect, and a negative free energy of zzso The most stable zzso were produced from zzso of zzso and cholesterol with a zzso zzso
