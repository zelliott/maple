A large health survey was combined with a simulation study to contrast the reduction in bias achieved by double sampling versus two weighting methods based on propensity zzso The survey used a census of one New York county and double sampling in six zzso zzso scores were modeled as a zzso function of demographic variables and were used in conjunction with a random uniform zzso to simulate response in the zzso These data were used to estimate the prevalence of chronic disease in a population whose parameters were defined as values from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso function included multiple zzso zzso occupancy zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso bank card ownership zzso zzso zzso gender zzso zzso zzso home ownership zzso zzso zzso head of household's age zzso zzso zzso and income zzso zzso zzso zzso The model likelihood ratio zzso was significant zzso zzso zzso with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso zzso zzso estimates were marginally closer to population values than those from either weighting zzso However, the zzso was also greater zzso zzso zzso The reduction in bias for point zzso from double sampling may be more than offset by the increased zzso associated with this zzso
