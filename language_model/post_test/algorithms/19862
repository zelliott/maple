The establishment of pregnancy requires zzso communication between the developing zzso and the zzso zzso The aim of this study was to establish an in zzso zzso system with bovine zzso cells and zzso zzso cells zzso that mimics the in zzso attachment zzso We previously reported that expression of zzso zzso zzso a major zzso product from the zzso decreases with changes in zzso structure when the zzso successfully zzso to the zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a good marker to assess whether attachment has successfully zzso In this study, bovine zzso zzso cells were cultured to generate zzso which were then placed on type I zzso plates zzso or bovine zzso zzso with or without zzso zzso collected from Day 15 zzso or Days 15, 17, or 19 pregnant zzso In the zzso but not the zzso addition of zzso zzso from Day 15 or 17 pregnant animals resulted in decreased zzso and zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso accompanied with changes in zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were minimally expressed but were induced in zzso zzso zzso with or without zzso zzso zzso of zzso another marker for bovine zzso attachment to the zzso zzso was also induced in the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that this in zzso zzso system could be used to isolate processes essential for zzso attachment to zzso zzso
