The aim of this work was to analyze genetic zzso in 18 populations of zzso zzso and representatives of zzso zzso and zzso zzso collected in the states of zzso zzso do zzso zzso Santa zzso and Rio Grande do zzso using zzso molecular zzso Considering total samples of the three species, 263 amplified fragments were identified, of which zzso showed to be zzso The index of similarity zzso zzso was on average zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso The analysis of groupings by the zzso zzso allowed to clearly separate the three analyzed zzso In determining the zzso in zzso zzso 222 bands were identified, on average zzso bands per zzso being zzso zzso The index of similarity zzso zzso in the zzso of each population in zzso zzso was, on average, zzso and the index of similarities among the populations was zzso The analysis of groupings with the zzso zzso and the analysis of the main coordination zzso allowed the separation of the analyzed populations into three groups, the populations from the south of Rio Grande do zzso and the population from zzso zzso do zzso standing zzso A relation between the groupings found and the zzso conditions of the collecting places was zzso
