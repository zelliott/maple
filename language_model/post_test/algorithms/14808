We have developed a simple way to generate zzso patterns based on spectral slopes in different frequency ranges at zzso zzso Such patterns can be considered as zzso zzso of zzso The method has zzso been demonstrated with a commercial zzso metal oxide zzso sensor exposed to bacterial zzso zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso and processing their zzso zzso With a single zzso zzso the situations of empty chamber, zzso soy zzso zzso zzso or zzso with bacteria could be distinguished with zzso zzso The zzso numbers were in the range of zzso zzso zzso To illustrate the relevance for zzso power consumption, we show that this new type of signal processing and pattern recognition task can be implemented by a simple analog zzso and a few logic gates with total power consumption in the zzso zzso
