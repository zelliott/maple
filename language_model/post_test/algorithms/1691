zzso zzso zzso zzso maps that violate the twist condition, arise in the study of zzso zzso systems for which the standard version of the zzso zzso zzso fails to zzso These maps have found applications in several areas including plasma physics, fluid mechanics, and condensed matter zzso Previous work has limited attention to maps in zzso phase zzso Going beyond these studies, in this paper, we study zzso maps with zzso We propose a model in which the different degrees of freedom are coupled through a zzso that zzso zzso Based on the linear stability of zzso and zzso orbits of the coupled zzso we construct coherent states in which the degrees of freedom are synchronized and the zzso stays nearly zzso zzso systems exhibit global zzso in phase space known as zzso zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso leads to zzso zzso zzso in which transport across zzso zzso can take place in the absence of chaos due to changes in the zzso of the zzso In the context of zzso chaotic zzso we study two novel problems: suppression of diffusion and breakup of the zzso zzso For both problems, we construct a zzso effective diffusion model with zzso zzso zzso transport near zzso is also zzso and it is shown that the threshold for global transport as function of time is a zzso zzso zzso
