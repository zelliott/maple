We reviewed three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso images of zzso spinal zzso and proposed a new zzso based on the information zzso 

The purposes of this article were to clearly illustrate the limitations of two-dimensional zzso to zzso the clinical significance of zzso analysis of zzso zzso anomalies, and to propose a new zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso zzso or zzso were based on zzso findings of plain zzso images of zzso zzso anomalies, it is sometimes difficult in zzso the large variety of anomalous zzso or severely twisted zzso zzso 

zzso CT images of more than 150 patients with zzso spinal zzso were analyzed and compared with plain zzso zzso By developing the zzso for the evaluation of zzso zzso in terms of numbers of abnormal zzso type of formation failure, and type of zzso failure in separate steps, we attempted to revise the zzso of zzso spinal zzso 

The images of plain zzso cannot demonstrate the spatial relationship of each structure of the zzso zzso findings in zzso zzso included several types of zzso and clearer definitions of each type of anomalous zzso By developing an zzso for the evaluation of zzso spinal zzso zzso spinal zzso could be mainly classified into 4 types of zzso zzso zzso Type 1: solitary simple, Type zzso multiple simple, Type zzso complex, Type zzso zzso zzso 

The large volume of information that can be obtained by evaluating zzso CT images of zzso zzso zzso can be a great help in developing a strategy for surgical zzso We need to develop a new zzso of zzso zzso based on the perspective of zzso imaging to understand the zzso and zzso as well as to determine an operative zzso
