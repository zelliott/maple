One avenue of research for partial restoration of function following spinal zzso injury is the use of neural zzso an example of which is functional electrical stimulation zzso devices for motor zzso zzso zzso may also be useful for the extraction of sensory information directly from the nervous zzso We suggest the spinal zzso as a possible site for the detection of peripheral sensory information from neural activity zzso Acute zzso zzso recordings were used to extract neural spike activity zzso from peripheral sensations from the spinal cords of zzso To test the recording method and zzso potential, eight classes of sensory events were recorded consisting of electrical stimulation of seven locations on rat zzso and another class of data during which no stimulus was zzso A zzso zzso scheme using principal component analysis and zzso zzso was devised to zzso the sensory events during single zzso The eight tasks were correctly identified at a mean accuracy of zzso Thus, we have shown the methodology to detect and zzso peripheral sensory information from zzso recordings of the spinal zzso These methods may be useful, for example, in a zzso zzso for restoration of hand zzso
