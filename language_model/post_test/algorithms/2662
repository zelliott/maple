We propose a method to zzso zzso features in zzso zzso We present a zzso based on the zzso geometry for the definition of differential operators on zzso zzso that adapt to the mirror and lens structures in zzso zzso These operators lead to a zzso analysis that preserves the geometry of the visual information in zzso zzso We then build a novel zzso feature detection framework for zzso images that can be mapped on the zzso We further present a new zzso and feature matching solution for these zzso zzso The zzso builds on the zzso zzso zzso and adapts the zzso zzso to the specific geometry and the zzso sampling density of zzso zzso We also propose a zzso matching method that eliminates the orientation zzso during the feature detection phase and thus decreases the zzso zzso Experimental results demonstrate that the new feature zzso method combined with the adapted zzso offers promising detection and matching performance, zzso it improves on the common zzso feature transform zzso features zzso on the zzso zzso images, as well as zzso zzso zzso Finally, we show that the proposed framework also permits to match features between images with different native zzso
