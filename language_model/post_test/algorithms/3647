zzso sequence zzso has been widely exploited to facilitate in-depth analysis of protein functions and zzso For some applications of protein sequence zzso it is highly desirable that a zzso structure, also referred to as zzso which shows how proteins are clustered at various levels, is zzso However, as the sizes of contemporary protein databases continue to grow at rapid rates, it is of great interest to develop some zzso mechanisms so that the users can browse the zzso and/or search for the desired information more zzso 

In this paper, the design of a novel incremental zzso zzso aimed at generating summarized zzso for analysis of protein databases is zzso The proposed incremental zzso zzso employs a zzso model to zzso the zzso of the similarity scores among the proteins in the database and to control formation of zzso Experimental results reveal that, due to the zzso mechanism zzso the proposed incremental zzso zzso offers the users highly concise zzso for analysis of protein clusters with biological zzso Another distinction of the proposed zzso is its incremental zzso As the sizes of the contemporary protein databases continue to grow at fast rates, due to the concern of efficiency, it is desirable that cluster analysis of a protein database can be carried out zzso when the protein database is zzso Experimental results with the zzso protein database reveal that the time complexity for carrying out incremental zzso with k new proteins added into the database containing zzso proteins is zzso where beta zzso with zzso provided that k zzso zzso
