Taste buds endure extreme changes in temperature, zzso zzso so zzso Even though taste bud cells are replaced in a short span, they contribute to consistent taste zzso Each taste bud consists of about 50 cells whose networks are assumed to process taste information, at least zzso In this article, we describe a neural network model inspired by the taste bud cells of zzso It consists of two zzso In the first layer, the chemical stimulus is zzso into an irregular spike zzso The synchronization of the output impulses is induced by the irregular spike train at the second zzso These results show that the intensity of the chemical stimulus is zzso as the degree of the synchronization of output zzso The present zzso for signal processing result in a robust zzso zzso
