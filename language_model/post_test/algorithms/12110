zzso DNA zzso zzso are a powerful tool for the characterization of complete zzso The two major zzso challenges are the zzso of the zzso signal along zzso coordinates to accurately determine transcript boundaries and the adjustment of the zzso response of the zzso zzso to achieve quantitative zzso of the signal between different zzso 

We describe a dynamic programming zzso for finding a globally optimal fit of a zzso constant expression profile along zzso zzso We developed a zzso background correction and zzso method that employs empirical probe response parameters determined from reference zzso with no need for paired mismatch zzso This combined analysis approach allows the accurate determination of zzso changes in zzso zzso from zzso data and will help to study the biological significance of complex zzso phenomena in zzso zzso
