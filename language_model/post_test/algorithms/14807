zzso analysis is a military application of zzso information system zzso zzso In order to find susceptible routes, zzso zzso are applied to minimize the cost function, which is the summed result of detection zzso The cost function was determined according to the zzso observation device zzso detection zzso the zzso analysis results, and two feature layers extracted from the zzso product interim terrain zzso The detection probability is zzso and recorded for an individual cell zzso m zzso 50 zzso and the optimal zzso routes are determined with zzso zzso by minimizing the summed costs on the routes from a start point to an end zzso In the present study, in order to simulate the dynamic nature of a real-world problem, one thousand cost surfaces in the zzso environment were generated with randomly located zzso and randomly selected zzso start zzso zzso one thousand sets of vulnerable routes for zzso purposes could be found, which could be accumulated and presented as an zzso vulnerability zzso This application can be further zzso for both optimal zzso zzso and surveillance network zzso Indeed, dynamic simulation in the zzso environment is considered to be a powerful and practical solution for zzso zzso A similar approach can be applied to the dynamic optimal zzso for civil infrastructure, which requires consideration of zzso constraints and cost zzso
