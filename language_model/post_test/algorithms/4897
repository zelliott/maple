We describe an improved automatic zzso to estimate the zzso zzso index from zzso blood pressure zzso zzso This enhanced zzso enables for zzso zzso during periods of abrupt zzso zzso Numerous studies have shown zzso to be one of most specific and sensitive zzso of fluid responsiveness in mechanically zzso zzso The zzso uses a beat detection zzso to perform beat zzso kernel zzso for envelope zzso and a zzso Kalman filter for zzso zzso and artifact zzso In this paper, we provide a detailed description of the zzso and assess its performance on over 40 h of zzso signals obtained from 18 mechanically zzso zzso zzso zzso The subjects underwent grade V liver injury after zzso while receiving mechanical zzso and general zzso with zzso All subjects in the database underwent a period of abrupt zzso change after an induced grade V liver injury involving severe blood loss resulting in zzso zzso followed by fluid resuscitation with either zzso normal saline or zzso ringers zzso Trained experts manually calculated zzso at five time instances during the period of abrupt zzso zzso We report validation results comparing the proposed zzso against a commercial system zzso zzso cardiac zzso zzso with continuous zzso monitoring zzso Both systems were assessed during periods of abrupt zzso changes against the zzso zzso calculated and manually zzso by zzso Our results indicate that the proposed zzso performs considerably better than the zzso system during regions of abrupt zzso zzso
