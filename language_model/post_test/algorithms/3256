This study suggests a method to zzso the material parameters for arteries in zzso from clinically registered zzso zzso The artery is zzso as a zzso zzso zzso cylinder and the membrane stresses are zzso using a strain zzso The material parameters are determined in a zzso process by tuning the membrane stress to the stress obtained by enforcing global zzso In addition to the mechanical model, the study also suggests a zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso an average zzso cycle from all consecutive cycles in the registration and zzso or zzso zzso zzso The effect is a robust zzso identification that gives a unique zzso The proposed method is tested on clinical data from three human abdominal zzso and the results show that the material parameters from the proposed method do not differ significantly zzso zzso zzso from the corresponding parameters obtained by averaging the result from consecutive zzso
