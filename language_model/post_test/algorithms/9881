zzso zzso has replaced zzso in many transplant centers, but data on hard outcomes such as graft and patient survival are zzso 

We analyzed graft and patient survival of the zzso first zzso zzso recipients at the Medical University of Vienna who were treated with zzso or zzso zzso over the past zzso Cox's zzso hazards models were used to zzso crude and zzso hazard ratio estimates of zzso versus zzso zzso Model building was performed by applying the purposeful selection algorithm, zzso by indication was addressed by propensity scores and marginal structural zzso 

Five years after zzso zzso of zzso zzso users experienced functional graft loss whereas zzso of the zzso users had lost their graft zzso The hazard ratio for functional graft loss was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso in zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso graft loss at five years had occurred in zzso of the zzso zzso patients and zzso of the zzso users zzso hazard ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso Patient survival was not different in any of the zzso 

The data from our zzso study suggest that zzso zzso use was associated with a lower risk of graft loss than zzso zzso
