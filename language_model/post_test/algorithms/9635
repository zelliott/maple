This paper proposes an zzso zzso principal component analysis zzso zzso for zzso zzso learning of zzso zzso It should be viewed as a zzso extension of the classical principal component analysis zzso zzso Through successive zzso zzso zzso seeks a zzso projection zzso that captures most of the variation in the original zzso input while producing zzso zzso The solution consists of sequential zzso steps based on the alternating projection zzso In addition to zzso the zzso zzso this work offers a way to systematically determine the maximum number of zzso zzso features that can be extracted by the zzso zzso is compared against the baseline zzso solution and its five state-of-the-art zzso zzso namely two-dimensional zzso zzso concurrent zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso decomposition zzso generalized zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso on the tasks of zzso face and gait zzso Experimental results included in this paper suggest that zzso is particularly effective in determining the zzso projection space needed in such recognition zzso
