Different kinds of zzso are available to perform zzso ventilation zzso in zzso Which type allows the best zzso zzso is zzso The objective was to compare zzso zzso during zzso between zzso zzso with and without the zzso zzso zzso dedicated zzso zzso 

First, a bench model simulating spontaneous breathing efforts was used to assess the respective impact of zzso and zzso leaks on cycling and triggering functions in 19 zzso Second, a clinical study evaluated the zzso of zzso zzso in 15 patients during three randomized, zzso zzso periods of zzso using an zzso zzso with and without its zzso zzso engaged and a dedicated zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed using flow, airway pressure, and respiratory muscles surface zzso zzso 

On the bench, frequent zzso and delayed cycling occurred in the presence of leaks using zzso and transport zzso zzso zzso zzso minimized these zzso whereas no zzso was observed with the dedicated zzso zzso in all except zzso These results were reproduced during the clinical zzso The zzso index was significantly lower with a dedicated zzso zzso than with zzso zzso without or with their zzso zzso engaged zzso zzso vs zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso especially because of less zzso 

Dedicated zzso zzso allow better zzso zzso than zzso and transport zzso even with their zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso at least slightly and with a wide variation among zzso triggering and/or cycling off zzso
