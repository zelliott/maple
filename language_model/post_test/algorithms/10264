In this study, we use the zzso zzso method zzso in which an zzso image is converted into a zzso of equivalent path lengths zzso and, therefore, exit doses, so as to model doses in zzso and enhanced dynamic wedge zzso zzso The QCM involves acquiring series of zzso images at a reference field size for different thicknesses of homogeneous solid water zzso From these, a set of zzso is established that is used to zzso the zzso of any other zzso zzso To determine the zzso the zzso area must be known in order to establish the appropriate scatter zzso A method was devised for the automatic calculation of areas from the zzso image that facilitated the calculation of zzso for any field and exit zzso For zzso fields, the fitting zzso were modified by utilizing the zzso zzso golden segmented treatment tables zzso methodology and zzso fraction zzso The zzso response of the zzso with lower monitor units zzso was investigated and slight modification of the zzso performed to account for zzso The method permits zzso dose zzso at the exit of phantom or patient to be generated by relating the zzso with an appropriate depth dose zzso The results indicate that the inclusion of zzso correction improved the zzso zzso The zzso field areas can be accurately determined from zzso images to within zzso zzso zzso zzso profiles and zzso dose zzso of zzso predicted doses were compared with those calculated with the Eclipse treatment planning system zzso and those measured directly with zzso 2 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso dose maps to those from zzso and zzso shows that more than zzso of all points passed the gamma index acceptance criteria of zzso dose difference and 3 zzso distance to agreement zzso for both zzso and zzso study zzso We conclude that the zzso QCM is an accurate and convenient method for in zzso zzso and may, therefore, complement existing zzso
