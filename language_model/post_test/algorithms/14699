Sensor data fusion technology can be used to best extract useful information from multiple sensor zzso It has been widely applied in various applications such as target zzso zzso robot zzso signal and image zzso This paper introduces a novel data fusion approach in a multiple radiation sensor environment using zzso evidence zzso The methodology is used to predict cloud presence based on the zzso of radiation zzso Different radiation data have been used for the cloud zzso The potential application areas of the zzso include renewable power for virtual power station where the prediction of cloud presence is the most challenging issue for its photovoltaic zzso The zzso is validated by comparing the predicted cloud presence with the corresponding sunshine occurrence data that were recorded as the zzso Our experiments have indicated that comparing to the approaches using individual sensors, the proposed data fusion approach can increase correct rate of cloud prediction by ten percent, and decrease unknown rate of cloud prediction by zzso three zzso
