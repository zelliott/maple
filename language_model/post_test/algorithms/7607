This paper presents the automation of a real activated sludge wastewater treatment plant, which is located at San Antonio zzso in zzso zzso The main objective is to create an zzso automatic supervision system, and to regulate the dissolved oxygen concentration in order to improve the performances of the process treating municipal zzso An approximate mathematical model is determined in order to evaluate via simulations different control zzso zzso integral zzso fuzzy zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The controlled variable is dissolved oxygen and the control input is the injected zzso Based on this zzso the zzso zzso controller is selected to be implemented in the real zzso After that, the zzso testing and fully operation of the plant automation are zzso With this system, the considered wastewater treatment plant save energy and improves the zzso zzso also, the process monitoring is done online and it is easily operated by the plant zzso
