zzso in delay tolerant mobile sensor networks zzso is challenging due to the zzso intermittent zzso Most existing zzso protocols for zzso use simplistic random mobility models for zzso design and performance zzso In the real world, however, due to the unique characteristics of human mobility, currently existing random mobility models may not work well in environments where mobile sensor units are carried (such as zzso Taking a person's social activities into consideration, in this paper, we seek to improve zzso zzso in terms of social structure and propose an agenda based zzso protocol zzso In zzso humans are classified based on their agendas and data transmission is made according to sensor zzso transmission zzso The effectiveness of zzso is demonstrated through comprehensive simulation zzso
