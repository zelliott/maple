A theoretical method is applied to describe protein structures in terms of zzso related zzso The approach is based on the location of local zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso established at various smoothing zzso zzso zzso zzso are generated using either the zzso zzso Shell zzso zzso representation or the zzso are calculated using the zzso zzso The analysis of the decomposition patterns of a protein structure in its native and hypothetical extended zzso showed that the zzso zzso have a similar decomposition pattern regardless of their position in the protein zzso the protein zzso and the influence of the crystal zzso A link is proposed with zzso tools in protein structure determination from zzso zzso
