The anatomy of the corpus zzso has been described in considerable zzso zzso studies in animals and human zzso experiments are currently zzso by zzso imaging, which enables zzso investigations of zzso connectivity to be zzso In contrast to the wealth of anatomical data, little is known about the principles by which zzso integration is zzso by zzso zzso Most importantly, we lack insights into the mechanisms that determine the functional role of zzso connections in a zzso zzso These mechanisms can now be disclosed by models of effective connectivity that explain zzso data from zzso that manipulate zzso zzso In this article, we demonstrate that dynamic zzso modeling zzso in conjunction with zzso model selection zzso is a powerful approach to zzso the various factors that determine the functional role of zzso zzso We first review the theoretical foundations of zzso and zzso before demonstrating the application of these techniques to empirical data from a single zzso
