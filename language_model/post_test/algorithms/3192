zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso with surface coils promises better zzso at 3 zzso zzso from improved zzso ratios and spectral resolution compared with zzso zzso However, Bloch equation and field analyses at zzso show that for efficient quantitative MRS protocols using zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso is limited by zzso zzso power requirements and power zzso When zzso pulse duration is increased to reduce power levels, zzso can introduce zzso dependent errors in the zzso zzso causing errors in zzso corrections for zzso zzso and in zzso measured by varying the zzso A new zzso zzso zzso method using zzso zzso zzso is introduced to alleviate power requirements, and avoid the problem related to zzso relaxation during the zzso zzso The zzso method is validated against zzso in zzso using a practical zzso zzso set designed for zzso MRS of the heart at depths of zzso zzso with 4 zzso of pulse zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso at 3 T are zzso s and zzso zzso zzso For heart zzso the values are zzso s zzso and zzso s zzso The zzso protocol zzso agreed with those obtained by conventional methods to within zzso
