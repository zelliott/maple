We have studied the use of a new zzso Carlo zzso chain generation algorithm, introduced by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Journal of Physics A, zzso 23, zzso zzso for examining the thermodynamics of protein folding transitions and for generating candidate zzso backbone structures as starting points for a de zzso protein structure zzso This algorithm, termed the guided replication zzso Carlo method, allows a rational approach to the introduction of known zzso folded characteristics as constraints in the chain generation process zzso We have shown this zzso to be zzso very efficient in generating large ensembles of candidate zzso chains on the face centered cubic zzso and illustrate its use by calculating a number of zzso quantities related to protein folding zzso In particular, we have used this zzso zzso zzso to compare such zzso quantities as the ensemble mean energy, ensemble mean free energy, the heat capacity, and the zzso radius of zzso We also demonstrate the use of several simple zzso zzso for introducing zzso constraints into the ensemble generation zzso Several extensions to our current model are suggested, and applications of the method to other folding related problems are zzso
