To develop and validate a new diabetes risk zzso (the zzso for zzso 10 year risk of acquiring diagnosed type 2 diabetes over a 10 year time period in an ethnically and zzso diverse zzso 

Prospective open cohort study using routinely collected data from zzso general practices in England and Wales to develop the score and from 176 separate practices to validate the zzso 

2 540 zzso patients aged zzso in the derivation zzso who contributed 16 zzso 135 person years of observation and of whom 78 zzso had an incident diagnosis of type 2 zzso 1 232 832 patients (7 zzso zzso person zzso in the validation zzso with 37 zzso incident cases of type 2 zzso 

A Cox zzso hazards model was used to estimate effects of risk factors in the derivation cohort and to derive a risk equation in men and zzso The zzso variables examined and included in the final model were self assigned ethnicity, age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, family history of diabetes, Townsend deprivation score, treated hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and current use of zzso the outcome of interest was incident diabetes recorded in general practice zzso zzso of zzso and discrimination were calculated in the validation zzso 

A fourfold to fivefold variation in risk of type 2 diabetes existed between different ethnic zzso Compared with the white reference group, the adjusted hazard ratio was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso for zzso women, zzso zzso to zzso for zzso men, zzso zzso to zzso for Pakistani women, and zzso zzso to zzso for Pakistani zzso Pakistani and zzso men had significantly higher hazard ratios than Indian zzso Black African men and Chinese women had an increased risk compared with the corresponding white reference zzso In the validation zzso the model explained zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso of the variation in women and zzso zzso to zzso of that in zzso The risk score showed good discrimination, with a D statistic of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso in women and zzso zzso to zzso in zzso The model was well zzso 

The zzso is the first risk prediction zzso to estimate the 10 year risk of diabetes on the basis of a prospective cohort study and including both social deprivation and zzso The zzso does not need laboratory tests and can be used in clinical settings and also by the public through a simple web calculator zzso
