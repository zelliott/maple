The main mode of zzso activity of zzso is shown to be zzso of zzso II zzso The zzso and in zzso activities have been measured and correlated with their zzso partition zzso zzso zzso The length of the zzso zzso for optimal activity differed between zzso and in zzso zzso The maximum in zzso activity was given by the zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso whereas zzso activity peaked with the zzso compound zzso zzso zzso zzso The effect of chain branching was also investigated using zzso zzso zzso zzso at position zzso All exhibited similar levels of in zzso activities but zzso activities zzso albeit zzso with the exception of one analogue that was much less zzso Other modes of action were also investigated using two representative zzso They did not show any activity on zzso I or zzso complex I, or generate toxic oxygen zzso by zzso cycling zzso Only moderate activity was found against zzso complex III from plants, in contrast to much higher corresponding activity using an insect zzso
