In accordance with cancer zzso zzso aberrations accumulate in cancer cells in a zzso zzso However, whether there are zzso changes linked with zzso progression remains zzso The purpose of this study is to zzso the relationship between zzso zzso and clinical stages in zzso zzso zzso A technology of zzso zzso using DNA chips spotted with zzso zzso clones was applied to 42 surgically removed zzso to examine the DNA copy number zzso A frequent copy number gain was detected on zzso regions zzso zzso and zzso In particular, gains of zzso zzso and zzso were detected in more than zzso of zzso A frequent copy number loss was detected on zzso regions zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were detected in more than zzso of zzso However, the DNA copy number gains of clones on zzso and zzso were more frequent in stage zzso zzso than in stage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In particular, the gain of the whole zzso was virtually limited to zzso zzso The gain of the whole zzso is suggested to be a zzso marker for the late stages in zzso These observations therefore support the concept of zzso staging in zzso
