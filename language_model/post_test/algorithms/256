We show that for observing high-resolution zzso zzso zzso of zzso mobile systems with order parameters less than zzso moderate zzso spinning zzso rates of approximately zzso combined with zzso decoupling at zzso are zzso zzso decoupling at this low zzso zzso frequency is achieved by composite pulse sequences such as zzso We demonstrate this moderate zzso zzso decoupling technique on hydrated zzso zzso zzso and show that zzso zzso decoupling yields zzso with the same resolution and sensitivity as zzso measured under zzso zzso decoupling when the same acquisition times zzso zzso are used, but the zzso zzso zzso give higher resolution and sensitivity when longer acquisition times zzso are used, which are not possible with zzso zzso The limits of zzso of this approach are explored for a range of spinning rates and molecular zzso using more rigid membrane systems such as zzso mixed zzso Finally, we show zzso and zzso zzso of a zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso the influenza A zzso zzso domain, under zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso at zzso decoupling are zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso it is possible to study zzso mobile lipids and membrane peptides using zzso zzso equipment, relatively large zzso and moderate zzso zzso
