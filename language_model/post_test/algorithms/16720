The singular value decomposition zzso of cerebral tissue zzso zzso with the zzso input function is commonly used in dynamic zzso contrast cerebral zzso MR zzso However, it is sensitive to the time zzso between the arrival of the zzso in the tissue zzso curve and the zzso input function zzso This normally causes inaccuracy in the quantitative zzso maps due to delay and zzso zzso A comprehensive correction zzso has been achieved through zzso zzso of the zzso input function, and a zzso zzso correction zzso The correction zzso was tested in 11 healthy subjects and three zzso stroke patients scanned with a quantitative zzso pulse sequence at zzso zzso A validation study was performed on five patients with confirmed cerebrovascular zzso disease scanned with zzso and zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso A significant effect zzso zzso zzso was reported on the quantitative cerebral blood flow and mean transit time zzso (up to zzso There was no statistically significant effect on the quantitative cerebral blood volume zzso The in zzso results were in agreement with the simulation results, as well as previous zzso This zzso the bias in patient diagnosis due to the existing errors and artifacts in dynamic zzso contrast zzso
