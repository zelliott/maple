zzso zzso of knee cartilage is required to obtain quantitative cartilage zzso which is crucial for the assessment of knee pathology caused by musculoskeletal diseases or sudden zzso This paper presents an automatic knee cartilage zzso technique which exploits a rich set of image features from zzso magnetic resonance zzso images and the spatial zzso between zzso zzso The image features and the spatial zzso are zzso into a support zzso machine zzso association potential and a zzso random field zzso interaction zzso zzso both zzso are incorporated into an zzso zzso model such that the knee cartilage zzso is cast into an optimal zzso problem which can be efficiently solved by zzso belief zzso The effectiveness of the proposed technique is validated on a database of zzso MR zzso The experimental results show that using diverse forms of image and anatomical structure information as the features are helpful in improving the zzso and the joint zzso model is superior to the zzso models based solely on zzso or zzso in terms of accuracy when the same features are zzso The developed zzso technique achieves good performance compared with gold standard zzso and obtained higher average zzso values than the state-of-the-art automatic cartilage zzso zzso
