A general master equation is derived to describe an zzso zzso transistor in the zzso blockade zzso In the zzso Fermi distribution functions in the two leads are taken into account, which allows one to study the system as a function of bias zzso and temperature of the zzso Furthermore, we treat the coherent interaction mechanism between electron zzso events and the dynamics of excited zzso zzso zzso solutions of the equation are zzso zzso We show that current through the zzso island at low temperature appears to have zzso characteristics as a function of the bias zzso and the steps depend on the mean zzso number of the zzso At higher temperatures the current steps would disappear and this event is accompanied by the emergence of zzso noise of the charge zzso When the system is mainly in the ground state, the zero frequency zzso factor of current zzso zzso noise and when the system is partially driven into its excited states it exhibits zzso zzso The difference in the current noise would almost be removed for the situation in which the dissipation rate of the zzso is much larger than the bare zzso rates of zzso
