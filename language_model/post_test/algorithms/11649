zzso experiments are inherently zzso zzso is the key to zzso realistic zzso despite such zzso In the analysis of the various sources of noise the dependency structure of the replication needs to be taken into zzso 

We analyzed replicate data sets from a zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso in order to identify zzso expressed genes and suggest new methods for filtering and zzso raw array data and for zzso missing zzso Mixed zzso models are applied to zzso the various sources of zzso Such analysis also allows us to determine the optimal number of samples and zzso zzso values for differential expression are obtained by a zzso zzso scheme on scaled zzso Four highly zzso zzso including zzso were analyzed zzso We observed an zzso where zzso zzso from these genes led to apparent zzso of adjacent zzso 

All methods and data discussed are available in the package zzso for the statistical data analysis system R zzso
