zzso cardiac death appears to be more prevalent during the normal sleeping hours in zzso sleep zzso zzso patients compared with the general population as well as to cardiovascular disease zzso The reasons for this remain zzso but there are three likely main contributors to nocturnal death in zzso zzso cardiac zzso zzso cerebral zzso and zzso zzso Particularly marked cardiovascular system zzso with zzso may play a role in initiating sudden adverse cardiovascular events in zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate cardiac zzso zzso and zzso zzso changes in the zzso zzso associated with spontaneous and zzso zzso in zzso zzso A detailed zzso study of zzso records obtained during conventional diagnostic sleep study with no further interventions was carried out in 20 patients (12 zzso age zzso zzso zzso years, body mass index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and respiratory zzso index zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso intervals showed significant zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be greater during respiratory zzso when compared to spontaneous zzso zzso zzso showed a trend toward a greater zzso during respiratory zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso correlated with zzso oxygen zzso levels preceding zzso In conclusion, these data suggest that despite greater cardiac acceleration following respiratory versus spontaneous zzso from sleep, zzso zzso and zzso zzso responses are similar independent of zzso zzso These data support that zzso produce quite marked and differential cardiac zzso system zzso in zzso and that the degree and pattern of zzso may be partly influenced by the presence and severity of preceding respiratory zzso
