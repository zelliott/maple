An zzso of fast spin echo at zzso T designed for versatile and zzso zzso imaging of the human brain is zzso zzso zzso angles zzso zzso 180 zzso were employed to overcome specific zzso rate zzso constraints and their effects on image quality zzso Image intensity and tissue contrast variations from zzso zzso transmit fields and incidental zzso transfer effects were investigated at reduced zzso zzso We found that zzso signal variations are minimized with zzso angles near 180 degrees, but apparent zzso matter contrast is independent of zzso zzso zzso zzso transfer effects from zzso acquisitions were shown to zzso white matter intensity by zzso and gray matter intensity by zzso at 180 zzso less than zzso zzso was seen in all zzso at flip angles below 60 zzso We present zzso images acquired without excess delay time for zzso zzso using a variety of zzso zzso half zzso acquisition zzso zzso spin echo zzso images were obtained with a novel variable zzso angle echo train (20 degrees zzso alpha zzso 58 zzso and high-resolution scans with a zzso volume of zzso zzso were acquired in zzso zzso with zzso angles of 100 zzso
