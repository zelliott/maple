To study the correlation between wall zzso stress and early zzso zzso in the abdominal zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso with in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were simulated in a realistic zzso flow zzso zzso zzso from 10 young adults with no signs of zzso disease were obtained during zzso 

zzso wall zzso stresses were measured at rest and exercise in one zzso and two zzso positions using laser zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were measured blindly at the corresponding locations using zzso methods, and compared to wall zzso stress variables using linear zzso zzso 

zzso thickness index increased significantly with zzso zzso thickness index was significantly lower in the zzso than the zzso zzso and higher at the zzso zzso vessel wall compared to the anterior zzso zzso thickness index correlated significantly with mean, minimum and zzso wall zzso stresses measured at zzso 

zzso thickness in the zzso abdominal zzso correlated significantly with mean, minimum and zzso wall zzso stresses at rest measured in a zzso flow zzso No correlations were found with maximum zzso stress zzso Exercise changed the local wall zzso stresses away from the characteristics associated with zzso thickness zzso
