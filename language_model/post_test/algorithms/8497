In a previous study, we determined the precision and the zzso zzso of a system that used implant zzso to transfer zzso between the oral cavity and the measuring zzso The objectives of the present study were to determine whether this testing procedure was suitable for clinical use, and to apply the procedure to the zzso assessment of the wear of three types of zzso zzso Ten patients received a total of 12 zzso The zzso were made either of ceramic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or of composite zzso The zzso were zzso at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 zzso For zzso the zzso were secured to the zzso table of the measuring device using the zzso zzso of the zzso implant zzso zzso analyzes were performed using a commercial zzso software zzso The ceramic and the composite wore at roughly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso wore at zzso 50 zzso zzso zzso and zzso 45 zzso zzso zzso zzso The error of the procedure was estimated at zzso zzso It was concluded that the procedure was zzso for clinical studies, and that the composite did not differ from the ceramic as to its wear zzso
