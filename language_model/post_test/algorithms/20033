This paper presents a zzso zzso approach to zzso fuzzy observer designs for three classes of zzso fuzzy zzso The proposed zzso framework provides a number of innovations and improvements over the existing linear zzso inequality zzso approaches to zzso zzso fuzzy controller and observer zzso First, we briefly zzso previous results with respect to a zzso fuzzy system that is a more general representation of the well-known zzso fuzzy zzso Next, we propose zzso fuzzy observers to estimate states in three classes of zzso fuzzy systems and derive zzso conditions to design zzso fuzzy controllers and zzso A remarkable feature of the zzso design conditions for the first two classes zzso I and zzso is that they realize the so-called separation principle, zzso the zzso fuzzy controller and observer for each class can be separately designed without lack of guaranteeing the stability of the overall control system in addition to zzso zzso error (via the zzso to zzso zzso for the last class zzso zzso the separation principle does not hold, we propose an zzso to design zzso fuzzy controller and observer satisfying the stability of the overall control system in addition to zzso zzso error (via the zzso to zzso All the design conditions in the proposed approach can be represented in terms of zzso and are symbolically and zzso solved via the recently developed zzso and a zzso zzso zzso To illustrate the zzso and zzso of the proposed approach, three design examples are zzso The examples demonstrate the advantages of the zzso approaches for the existing zzso approaches to zzso fuzzy observer zzso
