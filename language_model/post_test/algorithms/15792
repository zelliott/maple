Although a long zzso zzso zzso period zzso may prevent the occurrence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso tracking of zzso zzso in dual chamber zzso zzso the maximum upper rate will necessarily be zzso We tested the feasibility of using minute ventilation sensing in a dual chamber rate zzso zzso zzso to shorten the zzso during exercise in 13 patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso 463 zzso 29 zzso to avoid premature upper rate zzso zzso treadmill exercise tests in the zzso and zzso modes at this zzso resulted in maximum zzso rates of 98 zzso 8 and 142 zzso 3 zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso due to zzso incompetence and upper rate limitation in the zzso mode, both zzso with the use of zzso In order to stimulate zzso zzso chest wall stimulation was applied for 30 seconds at a rate of 250 zzso at a mean zzso zzso sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso zzso responses occurred in the zzso mode (the rates at a zzso of 280 and 463 zzso 29 zzso were, respectively 92 zzso 5 and 66 zzso 3 zzso P zzso zzso In the zzso mode at a zzso of 463 zzso 29 zzso regular zzso pacing at 53 zzso 2 zzso occurred due to mode switching to zzso mode in the presence of repetitive sensed zzso events within the zzso One patient developed spontaneous zzso zzso on zzso which was correctly identified by the zzso algorithm, resulting in mode switch from zzso to regular zzso pacing and preservation of rate zzso In conclusion, sensor controlled zzso allows a long zzso to be used at rest without limiting the maximum rate during zzso In addition, to offer protection against retrograde zzso a long zzso and mode switching also limit the rate during zzso zzso and allow regular zzso rate responses according to the zzso zzso
