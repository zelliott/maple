To validate the feasibility of the zzso transform zzso based zzso zzso zzso technique in respiratory events detection and zzso of the severity of zzso 

The zzso sleep zzso technique was applied to a total of 69 zzso zzso signals downloaded from the zzso Sleep zzso zzso Sleep zzso generated by both the original and the improved zzso method were compared on the structure distribution and zzso zzso The performance of respiratory events detection by using the power of low frequency zzso zzso in the new method was estimated by receiver operating characteristic zzso Furthermore, correlation between zzso index zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and conventional zzso scoring was zzso 

The zzso spectrum provides much finer zzso resolution and frequency resolution (8 s and zzso zzso compared with the original zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The area under the zzso curve of zzso was zzso in distinguishing respiratory events from normal zzso zzso differences were found in zzso among groups with different zzso of zzso zzso mild, moderate, and zzso zzso zzso has a strong negative correlation with the zzso index zzso correlation zzso zzso 

The zzso spectrum could exhibit more detailed zzso information about zzso zzso during zzso As two zzso zzso zzso and zzso can be used to identify respiratory events and represent the disruption extent of sleep architecture in patients with sleep zzso zzso The proposed technique might serve as a complementary approach to enhance diagnostic zzso
