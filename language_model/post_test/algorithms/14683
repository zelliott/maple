Mechanical characterization of cartilage, other soft zzso and gels has become a ubiquitous and essential aspect of zzso and zzso zzso Current progress in theoretical modeling and tools for data analysis often exceed what is required for routine mechanical characterization zzso in experimental studies, making selection of zzso difficult for the zzso We have therefore developed an approach for measurement of confined zzso zzso and zzso zzso based on simple zzso theory and requiring only linear zzso tools for data zzso This technique involves a new application of an zzso solution for creep combined with stress relaxation zzso to characterize soft tissue mechanical parameters as a function of zzso strain or water zzso This combined methodology allows measurement of zzso zzso by two different techniques with only a modest increase in experimental zzso providing a more precise assessment of zzso and associated measurement zzso
