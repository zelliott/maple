We undertook this project in response to the rapidly increasing number of protein structures with unknown functions in the zzso Data zzso Here, we combined a genetic zzso with a support zzso machine to predict zzso binding zzso In an experiment on a testing zzso we predicted the binding sites for zzso of our zzso made up of 50 testing zzso This zzso achieved greater sensitivity zzso specificity zzso accuracy zzso and zzso zzso and a higher correlation zzso zzso than those of the support zzso zzso This result can be used to guide biologists in designing specific experiments for protein zzso
