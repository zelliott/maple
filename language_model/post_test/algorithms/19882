The acquisition of zzso data from an array of receiver coils has become a common means of reducing data acquisition time in zzso Of the various techniques used in parallel zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the most common, making use of a zzso weighted least squares zzso to unfold the zzso zzso It was recently shown in Bruce et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that when the zzso model is represented in terms of a zzso zzso assumes a zzso zzso between receiver zzso as well as an identity zzso structure between zzso In this zzso we show that not only is the zzso zzso zzso unlike that of real data, but the estimated zzso structure between zzso over a time series of experimental data is not an identity zzso As such, a new model, entitled zzso is described with both revised zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso models are represented in terms of zzso zzso allowing for a statistical analysis of reconstructed zzso means, zzso and correlations resulting from the use of different zzso and zzso zzso structures used in the reconstruction processes to be zzso It is shown through both theoretical and experimental illustrations that the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso structures in the zzso model results in a lower standard zzso in each zzso of the reconstructed images, and thus an artificial increase in zzso compared to the standard zzso and zzso of the zzso model where both the zzso and zzso zzso are appropriately accounted zzso It is also shown that there are differences in the correlations induced by the reconstruction operations of both models, and consequently there are differences in the correlations estimated throughout the course of reconstructed time zzso These differences in correlations could result in meaningful differences in interpretation of zzso
