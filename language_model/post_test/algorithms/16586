To zzso cerebral blood flow zzso in the entire brain using the zzso echo zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso star zzso zzso 

The zzso technique was modified to 1) incorporate a zzso inversion pulse to suppress background zzso 2) to use zzso zzso zzso and 3) to zzso flip angle in such a manner as to minimize the blurring resulting from zzso zzso along the slice zzso zzso zzso of zzso was performed using the general kinetic model zzso In a series of healthy volunteers zzso zzso zzso we first investigated the effects of introducing an inversion pulse on the measured value of zzso and on the zzso stability of the zzso zzso Next we investigated the effect of flip angle zzso on the spatial blurring of the zzso zzso Finally, we evaluated the zzso of the zzso zzso including the influence of the measurement of zzso blood zzso (a zzso factor for the zzso 

The sequence provides sufficient zzso signal to achieve whole brain coverage in zzso 5 zzso Introduction of the inversion pulse for background suppression did not significantly affect zzso zzso values, but did reduce the fluctuation in the zzso zzso Flip angle zzso reduced zzso resulting in higher estimates of gray matter zzso zzso and lower estimates of white matter zzso zzso The zzso study showed that measurement of zzso blood signal did not result in significantly higher error in the zzso zzso 

zzso in acquisition and sequence preparation presented here allow for better zzso and zzso of zzso zzso allowing for accurate zzso zzso zzso in 5 zzso
