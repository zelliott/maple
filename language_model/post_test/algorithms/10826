Mouse studies have recently compared the zzso patterns of cancer between different zzso Genes associated with earlier onset are tentatively assigned a zzso role in zzso These standard analyses ignore the great amount of information about zzso contained in zzso zzso We present a method for analyzing zzso that measures zzso the zzso role of candidate genes in cancer zzso We use our method to demonstrate a clear association between zzso zzso rates of different DNA mismatch repair zzso zzso and the zzso of cancer zzso 

Most experimental studies report zzso zzso as the fraction diagnosed with tumors at each age for each zzso We use such data to estimate smoothed survival curves, then measure zzso rates at each age by the slope of the fitted curve divided by the fraction of mice that remain zzso for tumors at that zzso With the estimated zzso curves, we compare between different zzso the median age of cancer onset and the acceleration of cancer, which is the rate of increase in zzso with zzso 

The direction of change in zzso zzso rate between zzso zzso predicts the direction of change in the acceleration of cancer onset in all 7 cases zzso approximately zzso with the same result for the association between zzso rate and the median age of zzso 

Many animal experiments compare zzso the onset zzso for different zzso If such experiments were designed to analyze zzso the research could move to the next stage in which the zzso consequences of particular genetic pathways are related to the dynamics of zzso The data we analyzed here were not collected to test zzso and quantitative hypotheses about zzso Even so, a simple zzso revealed significant insights about how DNA repair zzso affect separately the age of onset and the acceleration of zzso Our method of comparing zzso provides good statistical tests even with small samples for each zzso
