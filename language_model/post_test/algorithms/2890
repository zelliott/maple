zzso muscle zzso which is found mainly within the zzso lean soft tissue zzso zzso is a biological important body zzso zzso and accurate methods to estimate both zzso and zzso remain difficult to zzso We aimed to develop and to zzso zzso models for zzso in athletes, using zzso zzso zzso zzso as the reference zzso 

zzso equations were developed in 176 athletic boys zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 92 athletic girls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were measured at the zzso the zzso and zzso calf, and zzso were measured at the zzso arm, the zzso and the zzso zzso was assessed using zzso zzso zzso zzso MA; zzso zzso Two models were developed: a body weight model zzso zzso and a corrected muscle zzso model zzso model, which included the parameters height zzso zzso height zzso zzso and height zzso zzso where zzso is corrected arm zzso zzso is corrected thigh zzso and zzso is the corrected zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to identify the best model zzso The equations were internally zzso using the predicted residual sum of squares method, and performance of new equations was analyzed by zzso analysis and agreement between zzso 

The new zzso model generated the following zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso + zzso + zzso + zzso where gender zzso 1 for male and 0 for zzso The zzso model produced the following zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso equation had an R zzso zzso and an SEE zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso equation presented an R zzso zzso and an SEE zzso zzso zzso In both zzso slopes and zzso did not differ from the line of zzso no mean differences between predicted and measured values and no trend line were observed zzso zzso zzso 

Both models accurately predict zzso in young athletes, zzso a practical means to zzso this zzso
