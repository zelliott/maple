Two zzso zzso the chopped zzso zzso and the constant current zzso were assessed and zzso Two zzso are zzso The first one is the ratio between the delivered energy W and the energy zzso of a zzso pulse with the same duration and electric zzso The second index zzso zzso stands for the level of utilizing the initially loaded zzso energy zzso Some design considerations are also zzso Another aspect of the study is the choice of appropriate zzso for pulse zzso The results obtained show that there is no outstanding optimal zzso The zzso ratio is higher for the known constant current shapes but specifically with a patient resistance lower than 80 zzso On the other hand, the zzso of these shapes would face several zzso The chopped zzso zzso are obtained by relatively simple technical solutions leading to very small in size and weight portable zzso
