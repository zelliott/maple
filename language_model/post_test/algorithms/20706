zzso of exercise tests as positive or negative is primarily based upon zzso ST segment zzso zzso accurate zzso are difficult to obtain during zzso 

This study compared zzso computer-generated zzso zzso analysis with visual zzso The goals were to document the extent of agreement, establish reasons for zzso characterize zzso depression zzso zzso zzso and determine the sensitivity and ability to zzso coronary artery disease for each zzso 

Comparisons were made in 120 patients at eight Veterans Affairs Medical zzso An exercise test was considered positive if zzso zzso zzso horizontal or zzso zzso depression was detected zzso s after the J point during exercise or zzso The zzso depression had to be present on at least two successive zzso recordings 15 s zzso Computer interpretation was based on median averaged zzso 

There was an zzso agreement of visual and computer interpretations zzso (both positive, zzso zzso zzso both negative, zzso zzso zzso The disagreements involved visual negative, computer positive in 10 cases and visual positive, computer negative in 4 zzso zzso was excellent between methods for characterization of zzso depression zzso zzso zzso zzso for detecting and the ability to zzso coronary artery disease zzso or zzso zzso zzso were similar for both zzso 

This computer zzso using median averaged beats is a reasonable surrogate for visual interpretation of the exercise zzso making it a valuable source of confirmation of physician readings in large research trials and in clinical zzso
