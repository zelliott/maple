zzso blood flow zzso is an important indicator of cardiac tissue health, which can be measured using zzso spin zzso This study aimed to develop a new method of zzso zzso with blood pool zzso measurement zzso zzso that allows zzso cardiac zzso spin zzso 

A zzso segmented zzso zzso zzso mapping sequence was zzso zzso of zzso zzso spin labeling is not straightforward due to the large volume of blood zzso following zzso zzso For zzso zzso a direct measurement of the zzso blood pool zzso was used to approximate the blood input function into the Bloch zzso zzso and in zzso zzso in the mouse heart were performed to evaluate the zzso zzso 

zzso indicated that blood pool zzso requires zzso s to return to equilibrium following zzso zzso zzso and in zzso results show that zzso zzso is robust to variations in zzso thickness and therefore zzso to zzso zzso whereas traditional methods are likely to underestimate zzso zzso In zzso single and zzso zzso values matched well when zzso using zzso 

The first zzso cardiac zzso spin labeling technique has been zzso which can be used for accurate zzso zzso in studies of cardiac zzso
