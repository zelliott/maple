We study the behavior of pathogens on host protein networks for humans and zzso - noting striking zzso Specifically, we zzso zzso see zzso decomposition analysis on these networks - which groups the proteins into various zzso based on network zzso We observe that shells with a higher average degree are more highly targeted (with a zzso zzso and that highly targeted zzso lie in shells closer to the zzso of the zzso Additionally, we also note that the inner core of the network is significantly zzso We show that these core proteins may have a role in zzso communication and zzso that they are less attacked to ensure survival of the zzso This may explain why certain zzso proteins are not significantly zzso
