A new system, zzso zzso for finding zzso coding genes in bacterial and zzso zzso has been zzso The current algorithm, which is based on the Z curve representation of the DNA zzso lays stress on the global statistical features of zzso genes by taking the zzso of bases at three zzso positions into zzso In zzso zzso since only 33 parameters are used to characterize the coding zzso it gives better consideration to both typical and zzso cases, whereas in zzso methods, zzso zzso zzso thousands of parameters are trained, which may result in less zzso To compare the performance of the new system with that of zzso zzso both systems were run, respectively, for 18 zzso not zzso by the zzso zzso Comparisons were also performed for predicting some zzso genes by both zzso zzso the average accuracy of both systems is well zzso however, zzso zzso has more accurate gene start zzso lower additional prediction rate and higher accuracy for the prediction of zzso transferred zzso It is shown that the joint applications of both systems greatly improve zzso zzso For a typical zzso zzso zzso coli, the system zzso zzso takes approximately 2 zzso on a zzso III zzso PC without any human zzso The system zzso zzso is freely available at: zzso zzso
