Patients with type 2 diabetes zzso typically exhibit a pattern of zzso with high zzso low HDL cholesterol, and small LDL zzso We aimed at investigating whether also LDL cholesterol levels are altered in diabetic zzso 

zzso panels were obtained in a consecutive series of zzso coronary patients zzso and in a large sample of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients in the cohort of coronary patients zzso zzso had significantly higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lower HDL cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso lower zzso A1 zzso zzso zzso zzso lower total cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso and, importantly, lower LDL cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso Whereas zzso B was similar in zzso patients as in zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso the LDL zzso B ratio was significantly lower zzso zzso zzso zzso and LDL particles were significantly smaller zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Also among the zzso subjects, diabetic patients zzso zzso besides higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and lower HDL cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited lower total cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso and lower LDL cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso 

Both among zzso coronary patients and zzso zzso LDL cholesterol is significantly lower in zzso patients than in zzso zzso
