zzso of the zzso effects of zzso and zzso zzso feeding on the synthesis and turnover of zzso would help in the management of acute zzso because the disease is caused by the premature zzso of zzso To investigate this, we labeled intravenous infusions with zzso and zzso with zzso and measured isotope enrichment of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins over 6 h by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thirty healthy volunteers were studied during zzso zzso zzso zzso intravenous feeding zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso feeding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All diets provided zzso g zzso zzso zzso zzso protein and 40 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that compared with zzso zzso feeding increased the rate of appearance (71 zzso 4 zzso 91 zzso 5 zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 80 zzso 219 zzso 37 zzso P zzso zzso of newly labeled zzso and expanded zzso stores zzso zzso 237 zzso zzso zzso 133 units, P zzso zzso These differences persisted whether the zzso were zzso or zzso zzso or zzso In contrast, intravenous feeding had no effect on zzso zzso zzso labeling of the plasma zzso acid pool by zzso and intravenous isotope infusions suggested that zzso of absorbed zzso acids were retained within the zzso bed during zzso feeding and that zzso protein turnover increased from a zzso rate of 34 zzso 6 to 108 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with no change after intravenous zzso In conclusion, all common forms of zzso feeding stimulate the synthesis and zzso of pancreatic zzso and only zzso nutrition avoids zzso
