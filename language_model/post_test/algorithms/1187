A method for the determination of the zzso propagation in vessel trees is zzso A standard three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso procedure is performed to reconstruct the zzso of the zzso vessel tree in a 3-D zzso An additional zzso projection series acquired with a fixed projection angle delivers the zzso information of the zzso zzso The mapping of the propagation information from the two-dimensional projections to the 3-D image data set is the topic of this zzso A symbolic tree structure is built up that represents the vessel tree including zzso Neighborhood relations between vessel pieces are given in three zzso This zzso filtering procedures and zzso controls of the resulting time dependent 3-D data zzso The presented method proved to be accurate with phantom data and gives novel insight in the feeding structure of zzso zzso and zzso
