Generally speaking, rate zzso video systems today are evaluated zzso meaning that the zzso is implemented and the zzso performance is evaluated for an example set of zzso However, in these cases it is difficult to separate the artifacts caused by the zzso zzso and data set with general trends associated with zzso In this paper, we derive and evaluate theoretical zzso performance bounds for both layered and continuously rate zzso video zzso zzso which use a single zzso prediction zzso zzso These bounds are derived using zzso theory based on an optimum zzso error zzso zzso and are thus zzso to all methods of zzso zzso which use zzso as a distortion zzso By specifying zzso motion and using an approximation of the predicted error frame power spectral density, it is possible to derive zzso versions of the zzso functions which are based solely on the input power spectral density and the accuracy of the zzso zzso The theory is zzso to systems which allow prediction zzso such as the zzso and zzso schemes in zzso as well as those with zero prediction drift such as fine zzso zzso zzso For systems which allow prediction drift we show that optimum motion compensation is a sufficient condition for stability of the decoding zzso
