The zzso of zzso zzso plant operation is of great importance to make biomass a competitive source of renewable zzso The zzso of innovative control and zzso zzso such as zzso Model zzso zzso requires an online zzso of operating states of zzso zzso This state zzso allows for optimal control and operating decisions according to the actual state of a zzso In this paper such a state zzso is developed using a zzso simulation model of a zzso zzso plant, which is based on the zzso zzso Model zzso The use of advanced pattern recognition methods shows that model states can be predicted from basic online zzso such as zzso production, zzso and CO2 content in the zzso pH value and zzso feed volume of known zzso The machine learning methods used are trained and evaluated using synthetic data created with the zzso plant model simulating over a wide range of possible plant operating zzso zzso show that the operating state zzso of the zzso zzso zzso process can be predicted with an overall accuracy of about zzso This zzso the application of zzso zzso and control zzso on zzso zzso plants and therefore fosters the production of eco-friendly energy from zzso
