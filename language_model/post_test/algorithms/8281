Current spike sorting methods focus on zzso zzso characteristic spike zzso The resulting zzso data are typically used to estimate how zzso of interest zzso the firing rates of zzso However, when these zzso do zzso the firing rates, they provide information about zzso zzso which thus far have been ignored for the purpose of spike zzso This letter describes a novel approach to spike zzso which incorporates both zzso information and tuning information obtained from the zzso of firing zzso Because it efficiently uses all the available information, this spike zzso yields lower spike zzso rates than traditional automatic spike zzso This theoretical result is verified zzso on several zzso The proposed method does not require additional zzso only its zzso is zzso It essentially consists of performing spike sorting and tuning zzso simultaneously rather than zzso as is currently zzso We used an zzso maximum likelihood zzso to implement the new spike zzso We present the general form of this zzso and provide a detailed zzso version under the assumptions that zzso are independent and spike according to zzso zzso Finally, we uncover a systematic flaw of spike sorting based on zzso information zzso
