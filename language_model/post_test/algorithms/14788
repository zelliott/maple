Wireless Sensor Networks have become an important technology with numerous potential applications for the interaction of computers and the physical environment in civilian and military zzso In the zzso protocols that are specifically designed for the applications used by sensor networks, the limited available power of the sensor zzso has been taken into consideration in order to extend the lifetime of the zzso In this paper, two protocols based on zzso and called zzso and zzso with base and threshold values are zzso zzso and zzso are two efficient energy aware zzso protocols that can be used for some critical applications such as detecting dangerous gases zzso zzso carbon zzso zzso in an indoor zzso In zzso sensor zzso are deployed randomly in a field similar to zzso In zzso zzso are deployed zzso in the rooms of the zzso of a zzso zzso In both zzso zzso forming clusters do not change during a cluster change time, only the cluster heads zzso Furthermore, an zzso operation is performed on the collected data in order to prevent the sending of the same data sensed by the zzso close to each zzso zzso results show that our proposed protocols are more energy-efficient than the conventional zzso zzso
