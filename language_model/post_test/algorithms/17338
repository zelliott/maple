The zzso Assessment for the zzso zzso of the zzso patient zzso zzso surveys for the presence or absence of blood in dependent abdominal regions including the right upper zzso left upper zzso and the zzso But it does not readily identify zzso or zzso injuries, and a CT scan of the abdomen may be needed to reduce the zzso of missed zzso We hypothesized that select patients who are considered high risk for zzso injuries should undergo a CT scan of the abdomen when the zzso is negative so that zzso injuries can be zzso 

An zzso was zzso tested for the evaluation of select injured patients over a 3 zzso zzso zzso criteria included adult patients with a blunt mechanism of zzso a negative zzso examination, and a spine fracture (with or without zzso zzso or a pelvic zzso zzso team members performed the zzso on patients during the Advanced zzso Life Support secondary zzso Data recorded included the patient's mechanism and type of injury, the results of the zzso and CT scan zzso operative or zzso findings or both, and patient zzso Patients with spine injuries were grouped according to spine level and the presence or absence of zzso zzso The patients with pelvic fractures were grouped according to the Young and zzso zzso 

One hundred two of zzso patients zzso who had zzso examinations were entered into this zzso zzso patients zzso had spine injuries, with only one zzso ultrasound zzso zzso patients zzso had pelvic fractures with 13 zzso ultrasound zzso 11 ring (9 from motor vehicle crashes, 2 from zzso zzso 1 zzso and 1 isolated pelvic zzso Nine patients underwent zzso management for solid organ injuries, and 4 patients needed zzso 

Based on these preliminary data, we conclude that patients with pelvic zzso fractures should have CT scans of the abdomen because of the higher yield for zzso zzso
