zzso electrical zzso zzso zzso has been proposed to deal with technical difficulties of a conventional zzso zzso imaging method caused by unknown boundary zzso uncertainty in zzso positions and other systematic measurement zzso In zzso we try to produce images showing changes of a complex zzso distribution with respect to zzso zzso injecting currents with at least two zzso we find differences of measured boundary zzso between those zzso In most previous studies, real parts of zzso zzso data were used to reconstruct zzso changes and imaginary parts to reconstruct zzso zzso This conventional approach zzso the interplay of zzso and zzso upon measured boundary zzso zzso In this paper, we propose an improved zzso image reconstruction zzso that properly handles the zzso It uses weighted frequency differences of complex zzso data and a complex sensitivity zzso to reconstruct zzso images of complex zzso zzso We found that there are two major sources of image contrast in zzso The first is a contrast in complex zzso values between an anomaly and zzso The second is a frequency dependence of a complex zzso distribution to be zzso We note that even for the case where zzso and zzso do not change with frequency, the zzso zzso may show a contrast in zzso images of complex zzso zzso On the other hand, even if zzso and zzso values significantly change with frequency, there is an example where we cannot find any zzso The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by using computer simulations to validate its feasibility in future experimental zzso
