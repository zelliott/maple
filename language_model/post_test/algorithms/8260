Liver disease, the most common disease in Taiwan, is not easily discovered in its initial zzso early diagnosis of this leading cause of mortality is therefore highly zzso The design of an effective diagnosis model is therefore an important issue in liver disease zzso This study accordingly employs zzso and zzso tree zzso and zzso reasoning zzso techniques to structure an intelligent diagnosis model aiming to provide a comprehensive zzso framework to raise the accuracy of liver disease zzso 

Based on the advice and assistance of doctors and medical specialists of liver conditions, 510 zzso visitors using zzso zzso zzso of zzso 9th zzso codes at a medical center in Taiwan from 2005 to 2006 were selected as the cases in the data set for liver disease zzso Data on 340 patients was zzso for the development of the model and on 170 patients zzso to perform comparative analysis of the zzso This paper accordingly suggests an intelligent model for the diagnosis of liver diseases which zzso zzso and zzso The major steps in applying the model include: zzso adopting zzso to diagnose whether a patient suffers from liver zzso zzso for patients diagnosed with liver disease in the first step, employing zzso to diagnose the types of liver zzso 

In the first phase, zzso is used to extract rules from health examination data to show whether the patient suffers from liver zzso The results indicate that the zzso rate of accuracy is zzso In the second phase, zzso is developed to diagnose the type of liver disease, and the new case triggers the zzso system to retrieve the most similar case from the case base in order to support the treatment of liver zzso The new case is supported by a similarity ratio, and the zzso diagnostic accuracy rate is zzso zzso zzso shows that the intelligent diagnosis model is capable of zzso zzso and zzso techniques to examine liver diseases with considerable zzso The model can be used as a supporting system in making decisions regarding liver disease diagnosis and zzso The rules extracted from zzso are helpful to physicians in diagnosing liver zzso zzso can retrieve the most similar case from the case base in order to solve a new liver disease problem and can be of great assistance to physicians in identifying the type of liver disease, reducing diagnostic errors and improving the quality and effectiveness of medical zzso
