zzso Kalman zzso is an established field in applied probability and control systems, which plays an important role in many practical applications from target tracking to weather and climate zzso However, its application for acoustic zzso zzso source zzso has been very zzso In this paper, two well-known zzso Kalman zzso zzso are presented to estimate the location of zzso sources in zzso zzso the zzso Kalman zzso zzso and zzso Kalman zzso zzso These zzso are applied to two zzso zzso profile known zzso I) and zzso profile unknown zzso zzso The zzso are compared with a more traditional zzso least squares zzso Experimental tests are carried out on a zzso reinforced zzso zzso composite panel zzso with a sparse array of zzso zzso to validate the proposed zzso zzso sources are simulated using an zzso miniature impulse zzso In order to evaluate the performance of the zzso two metrics are zzso zzso accuracy of the zzso source zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, it is shown that both zzso and zzso can provide a confidence zzso of the estimated zzso source location and can account for uncertainty in time of flight zzso
