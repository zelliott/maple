The central dogma of molecular biology relates DNA with zzso zzso zzso measures DNA copy number and gene expression zzso measure the amount of zzso zzso that integrate data from these two platforms may uncover meaningful biological relationships that further our understanding of zzso We develop zzso tests for the detection of copy number induced differential gene zzso The tests incorporate the uncertainty of the calling of zzso zzso The test is preceded by a zzso zzso that zzso certain genes to improve the overall power of the false discovery rate selection zzso Moreover, the test statistics are zzso to borrow information across neighboring genes that share the same array zzso zzso For each gene we also estimate its effect, its amount of differential expression due to copy number changes, and calculate the zzso of zzso The method is illustrated on breast cancer data, in which it confirms previously reported findings, now with a more profound statistical zzso
