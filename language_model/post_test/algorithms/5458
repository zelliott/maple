The zzso zzso permits zzso measurement of zzso plane zzso response during blunt zzso zzso Although experiments may reveal complex two-dimensional zzso deformation response to boundary conditions, zzso studies have zzso employed only zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The present study described and evaluated an zzso by which source zzso zzso data may be systematically mapped to a target generalized zzso for zzso studies of zzso response or zzso test dummy zzso Algorithm performance was evaluated using zzso zzso zzso from two rigid lateral impact boundary conditions: Flat wall and zzso zzso Comparing source and target zzso zzso peak zzso and zzso traces deviated by less than zzso These results suggest that the zzso is appropriate for zzso deformation response to lateral impact boundary zzso
