We investigated the use of the quantum Grover zzso in the zzso protein identification zzso The approach coded the mass zzso on a quantum register and uses the Grover search zzso for searching multiple solutions to find matches from a zzso zzso of the zzso between the input and final states was used to zzso the similarity between the experimental and theoretical zzso The optimal number of iteration is proven to be zzso , where k refers to the number of marked zzso We found that one iteration is sufficient for the search if we let more that zzso of the N states be marked zzso By measuring the zzso after only one iteration of Grover search, we discovered that it resembles that of the zzso measurement used in the existing protein identification zzso We concluded that the quantum Grover zzso can be adapted for a zzso mass zzso database search, provided that zzso can be kept to a zzso
