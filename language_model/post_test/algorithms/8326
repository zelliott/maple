A new zzso function model for zzso probabilities of zzso coronary disease was tested for reliability and clinical utility in 3 patient test zzso This model, derived from the clinical and zzso test results of zzso patients undergoing zzso at the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, was applied to a group of 425 patients undergoing zzso at the Hungarian Institute of zzso in Budapest, Hungary zzso prevalence zzso 200 patients undergoing zzso at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Long Beach, California zzso prevalence zzso and 143 such patients from the University zzso in zzso and zzso Switzerland zzso prevalence zzso The probabilities that resulted from the application of the Cleveland zzso were compared with those derived by applying a zzso zzso derived from published medical studies called zzso to the same 3 patient test zzso Both zzso zzso the probability of disease at the Hungarian and American zzso zzso was more pronounced with the use of zzso zzso zzso 16 vs zzso and 11 vs zzso p less than zzso In the Swiss group, the zzso function underestimated (by zzso and zzso slightly overestimated (by zzso disease zzso Clinical utility, assessed as the percentage of patients correctly zzso was modestly superior for the new zzso function as compared with zzso in the Hungarian group and similar in the American and Swiss zzso It was concluded that coronary disease probabilities derived from zzso functions are reliable and clinically useful when applied to patients with chest pain syndromes and intermediate disease zzso
