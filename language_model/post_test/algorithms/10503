zzso implant surgery is a procedure performed to treat profound hearing zzso Clinical results suggest that zzso the zzso in the zzso zzso one of the two principal cavities inside the zzso may result in better hearing zzso zzso of zzso cavities could thus aid the surgeon to choose the point of entry and angle of approach that maximize the likelihood of successful implant zzso which may lead to more substantial hearing zzso However, because the membrane that separates the zzso cavities is too thin to be seen in conventional in zzso imaging, traditional zzso techniques are zzso In this paper, we circumvent this problem by creating an active shape model with zzso CT zzso scans of the zzso acquired ex zzso We then use this model to segment conventional CT zzso The model is fitted to the partial information available in the conventional scans and used to estimate the position of structures not visible in these zzso zzso evaluation of our method, made possible by the set of zzso results in zzso similarity zzso averaging zzso Mean and maximum surface errors average zzso and zzso zzso
