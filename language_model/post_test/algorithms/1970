To evaluate how a more flexible and thorough zzso search of feasible zzso plans affects performance in zzso zzso 

A zzso evolutionary zzso zzso was used as a tool to investigate how expanding the search space to include a wider range of penalty functions affects the quality of the set of zzso plans zzso The zzso uses a population of zzso plans to generate new zzso plans through deterministic zzso of zzso penalty functions that are weighted sums of zzso zzso objective zzso The quality of the generated plans are judged by an independent set of zzso clinically relevant decision criteria, and all dominated plans are zzso As this process repeats itself, better plans are produced so that the population of zzso plans will approach the zzso zzso Three different approaches were used to explore the effects of expanding the search zzso First, the evolutionary zzso used genetic zzso principles to search by simultaneously zzso both the weights and zzso dose parameters in penalty zzso Second, penalty function parameters were individually zzso for each zzso in all zzso at risk zzso in the zzso Finally, a zzso zzso improvement zzso zzso that can be used on any zzso plan was developed that zzso improves zzso penalty function parameters for all structures zzso and zzso Different approaches were compared using the concept of domination comparison applied to the sets of plans obtained by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso that simultaneously searched both importance weights and dose parameters generated sets of zzso plans that were superior to sets of plans produced when either type of zzso was fixed for four example prostate zzso The amount of improvement increased with greater overlap between zzso and zzso zzso the zzso to search for zzso penalty functions improved results for simple cases with three structures but did not improve results for a more complex case with seven zzso For this zzso the amount of improvement increased with less overlap between zzso and zzso The zzso improvement zzso improved results for all cases, and its clinical relevance was demonstrated in a complex prostate and a very complex head and neck zzso 

Using an evolutionary zzso as a zzso it was found that allowing more flexibility in the search space enhanced zzso The two strategies of zzso varying the weights and reference doses in the objective function and zzso removing the constraint of equal penalties for all zzso in a structure both generated sets of plans that dominated sets of plans considered to be zzso zzso within the zzso more limited search zzso When considering zzso zzso the very large search space can lead to convergence problems in the zzso for complex cases, but this is not an issue for the zzso zzso
