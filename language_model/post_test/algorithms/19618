Biological zzso consisting of zzso zzso zzso are potentially excellent materials for various controlled molecular release zzso The individual zzso consists of zzso zzso peptides with 16 zzso acids zzso zzso that are characterized by a stable zzso structure and undergo zzso into zzso containing approximately zzso zzso zzso We report here on the diffusion properties of zzso red, zzso blue, zzso acid zzso salt zzso zzso zzso acid zzso salt zzso and zzso zzso Blue zzso zzso through zzso zzso The apparent zzso zzso ) of zzso red zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is higher than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The difference in zzso and zzso zzso suggests that the zzso acid groups directly facilitate zzso interactions with the zzso fiber zzso zzso blue and zzso were not released from the zzso suggesting that they interact strongly with the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso ) of the zzso decreased with increasing zzso zzso zzso providing an alternate route of controlling release zzso These results indicate that release profiles can be tailored through controlling zzso molecular level zzso
