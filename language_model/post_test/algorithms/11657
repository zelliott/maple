A major zzso scientific and technological pursuit is to describe the functions performed by the proteins zzso by the zzso One strategy is to first identify the zzso interactions in a zzso then determine pathways and overall structure relating these zzso and finally to statistically zzso functional roles of individual zzso Although huge amounts of zzso data are at hand, current experimental protein interaction zzso must overcome technical problems to zzso for zzso zzso In the meantime, zzso approaches may help bridge the information gap required for zzso of protein zzso In this paper, a previously described data mining approach to prediction of zzso interactions zzso and zzso 2001, zzso 17, zzso is extended to interaction mining on a zzso zzso An zzso (the zzso zzso is introduced, which suggests zzso of a zzso zzso rounds of zzso and experiment, to develop a knowledge base of protein interactions in zzso zzso 

The interaction mining approach was demonstrated by building a learning system based on zzso zzso validated zzso interactions in the human gastric zzso zzso zzso An estimate of the zzso performance of the zzso was derived from zzso zzso which indicated expected upper bounds on precision of zzso and sensitivity of zzso when applied to related zzso One such zzso is the enteric pathogen zzso zzso in which comprehensive machine learning prediction of all possible zzso zzso interactions was zzso The resulting network of interactions shares an average protein connectivity characteristic in common with previous investigations reported in the literature, offering strong evidence supporting the biological feasibility of the hypothesized zzso For zzso about complete zzso in which the number of zzso zzso is expected to be much larger than the number of actual zzso we anticipate that the sensitivity will remain the same but precision may zzso We present specific biological examples of two zzso of zzso interactions in zzso zzso resulting from the application of this approach, including elements of a zzso signal zzso systems for zzso and a zzso zzso zzso
