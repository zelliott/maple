The Young's zzso of zzso is estimated by measuring the strain applied by a pressure difference across zzso zzso using zzso zzso The strain induced on zzso zzso balloons can be estimated directly from the peak shift of the zzso G zzso By comparing the measured strain with zzso zzso we obtained the Young's zzso of zzso The estimated Young's zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
