A zzso simulation of zzso is used to examine how a reaction that zzso zzso in the medium external to the probe affects the extraction and recovery zzso The simulations suggest that such a reaction can promote the extraction process while simultaneously zzso the recovery process, which appears to be consistent with recent experimental evidence of asymmetry in the extraction and recovery of the zzso zzso during brain zzso This suggests that quantitative zzso strategies that rely on the extraction fraction as a measure of the probe recovery value, such as the zzso method, will produce an underestimate of the zzso concentration in the external medium when that zzso is consumed by a reaction in the external zzso Furthermore, if experimental conditions arise under which the zzso of the reaction are changed, then changes in the extraction and recovery processes are likely to occur as zzso The implications of these theoretical findings for the quantitative interpretation of in zzso zzso results obtained for the neurotransmitter zzso are zzso
