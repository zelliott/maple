A method has been developed for zzso the sample sizes needed to identify categories that comprise a large proportion of a compositional zzso The method is to be used in the design of surveys of zzso zzso for identifying the key container types from which the majority of adult dengue zzso zzso Although a zzso correction was devised for zzso the mean of a negative zzso distribution, other complications of zzso approaches make them unlikely to yield methods simple enough to be practically zzso The zzso index was therefore investigated as a more useful alternative, at the cost of theoretical zzso in an approach based on zzso methods in conjunction with the use of zzso This index can be used to zzso the degree to which zzso are either concentrated in a few container types, or dispersed among zzso An empirical relationship between the index and the zzso of surveys of differing sample sizes was zzso A zzso rule, based on the zzso of the cumulative data, was devised for determining the sample size, in terms of the number of houses positive for zzso at which a zzso survey might reasonably be zzso
