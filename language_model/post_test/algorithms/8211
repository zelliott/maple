In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging, the detection of small zzso zzso zzso around two or three times the zzso spatial zzso is a critical zzso Indeed, spatial resolution is altered by zzso smoothing operations used to reduce the noise introduced by (among other things) an inaccurate system zzso The authors previously proposed a zzso zzso easily zzso on a clinical zzso based on zzso zzso which introduces less noise than a geometrical zzso In the present study, they took advantage of the lower noise levels by reducing the zzso and then zzso the zzso impact on image zzso This study was performed on an zzso Body Phantom Set filled with zzso zzso activity zzso zzso The same 3 zzso acquisition was reconstructed with either zzso a clinical system based on a geometrical zzso operator zzso or zzso an zzso zzso using the suggested system zzso zzso In order to compare the resulting images, they set the zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso so as to obtain similar background zzso ratio zzso to that of zzso with a zzso zzso full zzso at half maximum of 5 zzso (as recommended for zzso imaging on a zzso They then assessed the zzso ratio zzso and zzso zzso recovery zzso for the zzso four smallest spheres (with internal diameters of 10, 13, 17, and 22 zzso zzso of zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso showed that a value of zzso zzso in zzso gave the closest background zzso to that of zzso with a zzso of 5 zzso For all studied targets, the zzso was higher with zzso than with zzso For the 10 and 13 zzso zzso zzso increased the size of the zzso zzso by 37% and zzso relative to zzso The zzso technique yielded higher zzso values than zzso zzso For the 10, 13, 17, and 22 zzso zzso the zzso values at eight zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso They evaluated a practical method for determining a zzso system zzso based on zzso zzso This zzso operator is more realistic than geometrical system zzso and introduces less noise into PET images during statistical zzso it thus reduces the extent of zzso operations zzso Thus, spatial resolution is better maintained with zzso than with clinical zzso They showed that this method improves the zzso ratio and zzso of zzso zzso (especially those that are at the system's limit of zzso and, in a clinical context, could allow better detection and earlier zzso
