The yield of screening for acute zzso infection among general medical patients in zzso settings remains zzso Our objective was to evaluate the strategy of using pooled zzso plasma zzso to diagnose acute zzso infection in patients with negative or zzso rapid zzso zzso tests in zzso South zzso 

We zzso enrolled patients with negative or zzso rapid zzso zzso tests from a routine zzso screening zzso in an zzso department in zzso with an zzso prevalence of zzso Study participants underwent zzso for pooled qualitative zzso zzso and, if this was positive, quantitative zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso Patients with negative or indeterminate zzso and positive quantitative zzso zzso were considered acutely zzso Those with chronic infection zzso zzso and zzso despite negative or zzso rapid zzso tests were considered to have had false negative rapid zzso zzso 

Nine hundred and zzso participants were enrolled with either negative zzso or zzso zzso rapid test zzso Eleven zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso had acute zzso infection, and an additional 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso had chronic zzso infection zzso negative rapid zzso 

One per cent of zzso with negative or zzso rapid zzso tests in zzso South Africa had acute zzso infection readily zzso through pooled serum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso testing also identified an additional zzso of patients with chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso screening has the potential to identify both acute and chronic zzso infections that are otherwise missed by standard zzso testing zzso
