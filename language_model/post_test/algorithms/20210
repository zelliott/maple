Little information is available on the reliability of coronary zzso zzso obtained from quantitative analysis of a single zzso view, an approach that is central to the practical use of zzso quantitative zzso In the present study we investigated the contribution of two different techniques of quantitative zzso edge detection zzso and zzso zzso to the application of this concept during coronary zzso zzso balloon zzso procedures were included in this study, all of them performed in a zzso located in the mid right coronary zzso This coronary location was chosen to zzso data collection on zzso zzso and to minimize the number of factors that may adversely affect quantitative analysis with both zzso In all cases two zzso zzso projections were obtained before, after balloon zzso and at zzso zzso zzso and differences between zzso zzso obtained with each technique were used to evaluate the agreement between zzso readings at every stage of the zzso The obtained correlation zzso and mean differences zzso between zzso zzso were as zzso before zzso zzso coronary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso respectively zzso test for zzso p zzso zzso after balloon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso test for MD, p zzso zzso and at follow-up zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
