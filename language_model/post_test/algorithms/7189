To study the mechanism of cells subjected to external electromagnetic fields, the expression of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso is analyzed in the four cell cycle zzso The regulatory functions are investigated in gap zzso to zzso gap phase 2 to zzso phase and post zzso phase transition in the zzso cell cycle zzso A mathematical model is developed to meet the general cell cycle regulatory network based on the molecular dynamics zzso Phase plane analysis results show that the zzso zzso can lead to the zzso effect of cell cycle processes and phase transition zzso It is an universal approach to predict the key regulatory gene in signal zzso zzso
