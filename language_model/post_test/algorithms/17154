In this study, the selective windowed discrete zzso transform zzso zzso for zzso analysis was applied on zzso heart rate signals, recorded during zzso zzso These zzso were achieved in healthy subjects zzso zzso zzso by inducing the zzso zzso and the diving zzso The results showed that the SDA can detect and zzso the expected, although brief, increase in zzso tone, by displaying a marked transient increase in the respiratory peak of the zzso zzso It allowed us to demonstrate an zzso reduction of the zzso response, obtained from the respiratory peak of the heart rate zzso zzso The SDA approach is thus an adequate tool for the evaluation of an instantaneous change in zzso activity, as well as zzso zzso activity, including the detection of a malfunction or an exaggerated response of the zzso zzso Since changes in heart rate control are expressed by a transient response, they would not have been detected by a standard, zzso spectral analysis of heart rate zzso which requires the consideration of long and steady trace lengths and would therefore cause zzso of such fast zzso zzso or transient changes in zzso control can thus be detected and zzso by SDA zzso zzso
