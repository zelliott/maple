zzso between the zzso zzso and zzso of diverse series of compounds through zzso barrier has been zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso molecular connectivity zzso zzso zzso based zzso zzso and eccentric connectivity zzso zzso zzso based zzso zzso were used for the present zzso A data set zzso of 28 compounds with established zzso zzso tendency was selected for present zzso The values of all the zzso zzso in the original as well as in the zzso form for each of the 28 compounds zzso the data set were zzso using an in-house computer zzso zzso data was analyzed and suitable models were developed after identification of the permeable zzso zzso zzso characteristic was assigned to each compound involved in the data set using these models, which was then compared with the reported zzso through zzso zzso zzso of prediction was found to vary from a minimum of zzso to a maximum of approximately zzso using these zzso
