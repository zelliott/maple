In this paper, a supervised zzso for vessel zzso in zzso images of the human zzso is zzso The zzso is modular and made up of two fundamental zzso The optimal values of two zzso parameters are found out by maximizing proper measures of performances zzso able to evaluate from a quantitative point of view the results provided by the proposed zzso The choice of the zzso allows one to tailor the solution to the specific image features to be zzso The performances of the zzso are compared with those of other methods described in the zzso The simulation results show a good zzso between quality and processing speed zzso For instance, in terms of the maximum average accuracy zzso K value, and specificity zzso the best performance outcomes are zzso zzso and zzso zzso
