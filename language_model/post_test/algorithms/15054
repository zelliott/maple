zzso is characterized by zzso and cortical brain zzso Evidence indicates that some zzso relatives of schizophrenic patients manifest zzso zzso including brain zzso The goal of this study was to determine whether zzso and zzso abnormalities are present in relatives of schizophrenic zzso 

zzso were 28 zzso and zzso first-degree adult relatives of zzso and 26 normal control zzso Sixty zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance images of the brain were acquired on a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gray and white matter and zzso fluid zzso were segmented using a zzso intensity zzso mapping zzso zzso of zzso of the volumes of brain regions, controlling for expected intellectual zzso zzso ability and diagnosis, were used to compare zzso 

The main findings were that relatives had significant volume reductions zzso in the zzso region and zzso compared to control zzso Marginal differences were noted in the zzso zzso zzso and third and fourth zzso 

zzso support the hypothesis that core components of the vulnerability to schizophrenia include structural abnormalities in the zzso and zzso These findings require further work to determine if the abnormalities are an expression of the genetic liability to zzso
