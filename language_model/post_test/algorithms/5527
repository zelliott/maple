An zzso investigation of proteins with known X-ray structures is of interest in a number of zzso Performing these studies through nuclear magnetic resonance zzso requires the costly step of resonance zzso The prevalent assignment strategy does not make use of existing structural information and requires uniform isotope zzso Here we present a rapid and cost-effective method of assigning zzso data to an existing zzso an X-ray or zzso modeled zzso The presented method, zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso residual zzso zzso zzso data that can easily be obtained by zzso zzso The zzso uses only the backbone zzso zzso from multiple alignment media along with the zzso acid type of the zzso It is inspired by previous work from zzso and provides several zzso We present results on 13 synthetic and experimental zzso from 8 different structures, including two zzso Using just two alignment media, zzso achieves an average assignment accuracy greater than zzso With three media, the average accuracy is higher than zzso The zzso also zzso a prediction of the assignment zzso which has a correlation of zzso to the true zzso This prediction score can be used to establish the needed confidence in assignment zzso
