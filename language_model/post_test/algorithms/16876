zzso particle swarm zzso zzso motivated by concepts from quantum mechanics and particle swarm zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso belonging to the bare-bones zzso zzso Although it has been shown to perform well in finding the optimal solutions for many zzso problems, there has so far been little analysis on how it works in zzso This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the zzso zzso In the theoretical analysis, we analyze the behavior of a single particle in zzso in terms of probability zzso Since the zzso behavior is influenced by the zzso zzso zzso which is the most important zzso of the algorithm, the goal of the theoretical analysis is to find out the upper bound of the zzso zzso within which the value of the zzso zzso selected can guarantee the convergence or zzso of the zzso zzso In the experimental analysis, the theoretical results are first validated by zzso simulations for the zzso zzso Then, based on the derived upper bound of the zzso zzso we perform empirical studies on a suite of well-known benchmark functions to show how to control and select the value of the zzso zzso in order to obtain generally good zzso performance in real world zzso Finally, a further performance comparison between zzso and other zzso of zzso on the benchmarks is made to show the efficiency of the zzso zzso with the proposed zzso control and selection zzso
