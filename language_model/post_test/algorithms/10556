Ethanol exposure contributes to infectious complications in burn and trauma patients through a process known as zzso zzso Two major factors, 1) physical disruption of the zzso zzso barrier and 2) suppression of immune defense, explain this zzso However, little information is available concerning the immune mechanisms of zzso bacterial zzso In this study we investigated the effect of zzso zzso of ethanol on immune function, especially on zzso zzso zzso migration, and barrier function in the small zzso 

A rat small zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso was exposed to zzso zzso ethanol for 24 zzso with or without zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was measured by zzso zzso and barrier dysfunction was assessed by the zzso flux of zzso zzso zzso was assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Exposure to ethanol zzso of 200 zzso and over increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased at 500 zzso Administration of ethanol in combination with zzso beta had no additive effect on the release of zzso and zzso Exposure of zzso zzso to ethanol resulted in a zzso increase in zzso but zzso beta had no effect on barrier zzso Ethanol had no effect on zzso migration in zzso zzso analysis 

The above observations suggest that ethanol induced physical disruption of the zzso but not zzso zzso is the main cause of the bacterial zzso that leads to zzso and zzso in zzso
