The zzso zzso Test zzso compares zzso of transmission of two zzso from zzso parents to an affected zzso This test requires all zzso to be known from all members of the nuclear zzso However, obtaining all zzso in a study might not be possible for some families, in which case, a data set results in missing zzso There are many techniques of handling missing zzso in parents but only a few in zzso The robust zzso zzso is one of the methods that handles missing zzso for all members of nuclear families zzso one affected zzso Even though all family members can be zzso the zzso is a conservative test with low zzso We propose a new method, zzso zzso zzso zzso that controls type I error and has high zzso The zzso uses zzso zzso properties, and takes population zzso of the disease zzso and marker zzso into account in the zzso zzso One of the advantages of using the zzso is that the zzso can identify additional significant genes that are not found by the zzso We demonstrate the performances of both tests along with zzso zzso in zzso Carlo simulation zzso Moreover, we apply our method to the type 1 diabetes data from the Warren families in the United Kingdom to identify significant genes that are related to type 1 zzso
