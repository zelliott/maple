Many zzso reports reference discrete zzso regions of the brain which were delineated according to a brain zzso or zzso zzso Currently, however, no widely accepted standards exist for zzso the zzso and zzso structures, or for assigning labels to the resulting regions, and many procedures are being actively zzso Previous attempts to reconcile zzso zzso have been largely zzso focusing on the development of zzso or simple semantic zzso between zzso Here we take a fundamentally different approach, zzso the names of regions and instead comparing their definitions as spatial entities in an effort to provide more precise quantitative zzso between anatomical entities as defined by different zzso We develop an zzso framework for studying this brain zzso zzso problem, and apply these methods in a comparison of eight diverse labeling methods used by the zzso zzso These analyses result in conditional probabilities that enable mapping between regions across zzso which also form the input to zzso methods for zzso zzso relationships between sets of regions and to procedures for assessing the global similarity between different zzso of the same zzso At a global scale, the overall results demonstrate a considerable lack of zzso between available zzso schemes, falling within chance levels for some zzso zzso At a finer level, this study reveals spatial relationships between sets of defined regions that are not obviously zzso these are of high potential interest to researchers faced with the challenge of comparing results that were based on these different anatomical models, particularly when zzso data are not zzso The complexity of the spatial overlap patterns revealed points to problems for attempts to reconcile anatomical zzso and zzso using strictly qualitative and/or zzso zzso zzso results from this study are made available via an interactive web site at zzso
