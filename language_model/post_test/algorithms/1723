This clinical study was to demonstrate the zzso of diffuse zzso zzso intensity ratio zzso in the zzso and discrimination of zzso and zzso from healthy zzso DR spectral zzso were carried out with zzso zzso from 70 healthy sites in 30 healthy volunteers, and 63 zzso and 58 zzso sites in 60 zzso Clinical parameters such as probing pocket depth, clinical attachment level, and zzso index were recorded in patient zzso zzso zzso for discrimination of zzso and zzso from healthy zzso were determined by comparison of spectral signatures with clinical zzso zzso of average DR spectral intensity ratio between control and test groups was studied using analysis of zzso The mean DR spectrum on zzso at zzso zzso showed marked differences between healthy zzso zzso and zzso zzso concentration and apparent zzso zzso zzso were also calculated for healthy, zzso and zzso zzso DR spectral zzso at zzso and zzso zzso showed a decreasing trend with progression of zzso Among the various DR intensity ratios zzso the zzso ratio provided a sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso for discrimination of healthy zzso from zzso and a sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso for discrimination of zzso from zzso
