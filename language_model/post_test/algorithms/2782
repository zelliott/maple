The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been used to zzso local dynamic stability zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso with prevalence of the latter one that is considered more suitable for small data zzso However, such a claim has never been zzso To address it, the zzso of the Lorenz zzso was estimated using small data sets and varied delays and embedding zzso Overall, the zzso estimates from the zzso got closer to the theoretical zzso than those from the zzso The zzso also overestimated zzso while the zzso underestimated it, overlooking the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Local dynamic stability was then examined from zzso zzso and zzso long gait time series of younger zzso and older adults zzso The zzso were found more locally unstable than the zzso regardless of time series length with the zzso but only for the longest time series with the zzso The lack of sensitivity to capture age-related decline in local dynamic stability from shorter time series is proposed to result from a drawback of the zzso that overlooks the expansion of the zzso zzso The zzso is advocated for use when examining local dynamic stability with small gait data zzso
