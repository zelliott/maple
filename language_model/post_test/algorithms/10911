To investigate the influence of zzso and optical zone zzso diameter on zzso aberrations zzso after zzso zzso laser in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso eyes of 19 patients were zzso The mean zzso zzso equivalent was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso the mean planned zzso diameter was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso All patients had zzso zzso zzso zzso version zzso Bausch & zzso and an uncomplicated follow-up of 12 zzso zzso zzso were performed with a zzso sensor in maximum zzso preoperatively and 12 months after zzso zzso errors were zzso for zzso diameters zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the individual zzso diameter and for the individual zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The impact of the relationship between zzso diameter and zzso diameter zzso clearance zzso on zzso was described and zzso using zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso 

There was a zzso relationship between zzso and the amount of induced zzso The change in zzso root mean square and primary zzso aberration zzso was significantly correlated with zzso If the zzso was zzso larger than the zzso zzso zzso zzso only half the amount of zzso was expected to be induced than if the zzso equaled the zzso In contrast, an zzso that was zzso smaller than the zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in an zzso induction 50% higher than at zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zone to zzso ratio zzso zzso had a significant impact on zzso induction after zzso zzso
