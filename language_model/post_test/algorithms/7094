This paper presented an ultrasound zzso scanning method of zzso active zzso mapping zzso in a liquid or liquid filled tissue cavities exposed by high-intensity focused ultrasound zzso Scattered signals from zzso bubbles were obtained in a scan line immediately after one zzso exposure, and then there was a waiting time of 2 s long enough to make the liquid back to the original zzso As this pattern extended, an image was built up by zzso measuring a series of such zzso The acquisition of the zzso zzso zzso signals for a scan line was synchronized with zzso zzso The duration of zzso exposure, as well as the delay of the interrogating pulse relative to the moment while zzso was turned off, could vary from zzso to zzso The feasibility of this method was demonstrated in zzso and a zzso filled cavity in the zzso zzso phantom as capable of observing zzso evolutions of zzso bubble cloud with zzso resolution of several zzso lateral and zzso resolution of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The dissolution process of zzso bubble cloud and spatial distribution affected by zzso previously generated were also zzso Although the application is limited by the requirement for a zzso fluid zzso tap water, zzso that allows zzso of zzso between zzso zzso the technique may be a useful tool in zzso zzso mapping for zzso with high precision and resolution, providing a reference for clinical zzso
