The aim of this study was to determine whether visual analysis of graphic records of small zzso zzso is a reliable method of discriminating pressure events caused by zzso wall contraction from those of zzso origin and to compare this method with computerized zzso Each of six independent observers was supplied with the same pair of records of 1 h of zzso zzso zzso zzso acquired with a zzso zzso zzso system; one record included many artifacts due to body movement while the other did zzso The observers were asked to identify and zzso pressure events and to measure the duration and zzso of zzso zzso A computer program for zzso analysis is zzso the zzso was designed to overcome the problems of a variable baseline and sudden changes in pressure due to body movements that are unavoidable in prolonged recording from the small zzso of zzso zzso For regular zzso zzso III of zzso motor zzso there was good agreement between observers but not for irregular zzso particularly when movement artifacts were zzso When the observers were asked to repeat the analysis 6 zzso later, there was poor agreement with their original identification of irregular zzso and zzso There was, however, good agreement between the computer analysis, which was totally zzso and the median decisions of the observer zzso this agreement supports the zzso of our computer zzso We conclude that computer analysis is not merely a valuable zzso aid for analysis of large quantity of data acquired in prolonged ambulatory monitoring, but also that, even for brief recordings, it provides a standard of zzso zzso by zzso zzso Visual analysis is unreliable and thus susceptible to zzso zzso this may, in part, account for conflicting reports of small zzso zzso under similar conditions reported by different workers in our own and other zzso
