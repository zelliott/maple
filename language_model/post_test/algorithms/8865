Over the past few decades, zzso has emerged as an excellent zzso zzso In present study, a new strain zzso isolated from soil site near degrading hospital waste, was investigated for the production of zzso zzso Further, it was renamed as zzso zzso zzso based on its zzso features, zzso zzso fatty acid zzso zzso zzso profile and zzso similarity of zzso zzso zzso The strain was found zzso and its optimal growth occurred at 37 degrees C and pH zzso The strain was capable of producing zzso zzso with maximum specific activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when grown in zzso medium composition and physical zzso In order to improve the production of zzso by the zzso response surface methodology zzso and genetic zzso zzso based techniques were zzso The data achieved through the statistical design zzso were used for zzso analysis and analysis of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was implemented utilizing zzso zzso equation as a fitness zzso zzso average zzso productivity of zzso zzso was found at zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso yield of the zzso was zzso higher in comparison to the yield obtained through zzso based zzso
