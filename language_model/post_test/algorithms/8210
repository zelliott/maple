The purpose of this work is to investigate robust zzso zzso techniques which account for respiratory motion zzso Two robust zzso techniques were applied to generate zzso zzso lung treatment zzso The zzso zzso approach zzso the dose zzso in the target volume while the worst case zzso zzso a weighted combination of the nominal and worst case dose zzso which occur in the presence of respiratory motion zzso The two zzso zzso approaches were compared with a zzso zzso planning approach in five lung zzso Respiratory motion zzso and baseline variations were zzso from tidal volume zzso during planning zzso CT zzso A similar target coverage was obtained for all three approaches, although the zzso zzso methods tended to be better at sparing the zzso at zzso Both robust planning methods are suited for automatic determination of treatment plans which ensure target dose zzso under respiratory motion variations, while minimizing the dose burden of healthy lung zzso
