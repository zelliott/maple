zzso of zzso zzso axis plays an important role in zzso surgery of total knee zzso In traditional total knee replacement surgery, the axis is obtained by inserting a rod into zzso zzso However, in the zzso total knee replacement based on CT zzso the zzso zzso axis must be determined zzso Because the lengths in zzso are quite different in different patients, besides noises, the upper segment and lower segment of the zzso influence the design of the axis zzso Traditionally, the zzso zzso axis is obtained by using the zzso method zzso However, this method is easily disturbed by zzso To avoid the noise zzso of CT data, the least median of squares method is used to fit the zzso zzso axis for its characteristic of robust zzso The least median squares method eliminates the disadvantage brought by the method of least zzso In finding the zzso line, genetic zzso are used in the zzso In our experiment, we use the proposed method to fit the zzso zzso axis and obtain an excellent zzso
