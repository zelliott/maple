The main motivation of this paper is to propose a method to extract the output structure and find the input data zzso that best represents that output structure in a zzso zzso zzso A graph similarity viewpoint is used to develop an zzso based on zzso and to find out different output models which are learned as an input zzso The main novelty of the zzso is related with finding different structured groups and apply different models to fit better those zzso Finally, the proposed method is applied to a real remote sensing retrieval problem where we want to recover the physical parameters from a spectrum of zzso
