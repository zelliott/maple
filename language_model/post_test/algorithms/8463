Comparative zzso promises to rapidly accelerate the identification and functional zzso of biologically important human zzso We developed the zzso zzso Gene zzso zzso zzso database to provide a zzso between fully and partially zzso zzso transcribed zzso Starting with the assembled expressed sequence tag zzso and gene sequences that comprise the 28 zzso Gene zzso we used zzso zzso sequence searches and a zzso zzso closure process to associate zzso best hits, generating zzso tentative zzso groups zzso This has allowed us to identify putative zzso and zzso for known zzso as well as those that exist only as zzso zzso and to provide links to additional information including zzso sequence and mapping zzso zzso provides an important new resource for the analysis of gene function in zzso In addition, an analysis of the most widely represented sequences can begin to provide insight into zzso biological zzso
