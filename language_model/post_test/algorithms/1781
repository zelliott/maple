In our previous publication, a framework for information flow in interaction networks based on random walks with zzso was formulated with two fundamental modes: emitting and zzso While many other network analysis methods based on random walks or equivalent notions have been developed before and after our earlier work, one can show that they can all be mapped to one of the two zzso In addition to these two fundamental zzso a major strength of our earlier zzso was its accommodation of zzso directed information flow that yielded plausible and meaningful biological interpretation of protein functions and zzso However, the directed flow from origins to destinations was induced via a potential function that was zzso Here, with a theoretically sound approach called the channel mode, we extend our earlier work for directed information zzso This is achieved by constructing a potential function zzso a purely zzso interpretation of the channel zzso For each network zzso the channel mode combines the solutions of emitting and absorbing modes in the same context, producing what we call a channel zzso The entries of the channel zzso at each zzso can be interpreted as the amount of flow passing through that zzso from an origin to a zzso zzso to our earlier model, the channel mode encompasses zzso as a free zzso that controls the locality of information zzso Through examples involving the zzso zzso response pathway, we illustrate the versatility and stability of our new zzso
