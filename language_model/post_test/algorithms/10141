zzso similarity comparisons may be made on a local or global basis and may consider sequence information or differing levels of structural zzso We present a local three-dimensional method that compares protein binding site surfaces in full atomic zzso The approach is based on the zzso similarity method which has been widely applied for global comparison of small zzso We apply the method to zzso comparisons two sets of human protein zzso a very diverse set of zzso proteins from multiple species, and three zzso benchmark protein binding site data zzso Cases of disagreement between zzso similarity and binding site similarity yield zzso zzso Where sequence similarity is very low, high pocket similarity can reliably identify important binding zzso Where sequence similarity is very high, significant differences in pocket similarity are related to zzso binding specificity and zzso Local protein binding pocket similarity provides zzso complementary information to other approaches, and it can yield quantitative information in support of functional zzso
