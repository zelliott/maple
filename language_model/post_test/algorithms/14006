A novel method for zzso prediction uncertainty using machine learning techniques is zzso zzso is expressed in the form of the two zzso zzso the prediction zzso of the underlying distribution of prediction zzso The idea is to partition the input space into different zones or clusters having similar model errors using fuzzy zzso zzso The prediction zzso is constructed for each cluster on the basis of empirical zzso of the errors associated with all instances belonging to the cluster under consideration and zzso from each cluster to the examples according to their membership grades in each zzso Then a zzso model is built for zzso data using zzso prediction limits as targets, and finally, this model is applied to estimate the prediction intervals zzso for zzso zzso The method was tested on artificial and real zzso data sets using various machine learning zzso zzso results show that the method is superior to other methods zzso the prediction zzso A new method for evaluating performance for zzso prediction zzso is proposed as zzso
