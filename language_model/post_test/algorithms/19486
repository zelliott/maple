We develop methods for assessing the association between a zzso zzso zzso process and a failure time zzso when the former is observed only at a single time point and the latter is right censored, and when the observations are subject to zzso and competing causes of zzso Using a zzso hazards model for the effect of the zzso process on the failure time of interest, we develop an approach utilizing zzso zzso and profile likelihood for zzso the relative risk zzso and zzso hazards for zzso The methods are extended to account for other zzso that can influence the zzso zzso process and zzso risks of zzso We illustrate the methods with data from a recent study on the association between loss of zzso B e zzso and the development of zzso zzso in a population of chronic carriers of zzso zzso
