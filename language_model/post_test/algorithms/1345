To compare the accuracy of portable automated zzso zzso with that of manual zzso zzso in measuring zzso power for zzso lens zzso 

zzso Hall Medical Center, San Antonio, Texas, zzso 

In Part 1 of the study, five zzso technicians performed zzso analysis in 20 eyes in 10 volunteers using both manual and automated methods to determine the relative accuracy and zzso of each zzso In Part 2, both zzso and zzso were zzso performed in 11 patients having cataract surgery to compare the accuracy of each instrument in predicting zzso zzso zzso 

The difference between instruments in determining the average zzso power in all eyes was less than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso D, zzso zzso zzso zzso Portable zzso demonstrated less zzso in zzso in each eye zzso standard zzso zzso zzso zzso D, zzso zzso zzso zzso average range, zzso zzso zzso D, zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean absolute zzso error zzso between the actual zzso outcome and predicted zzso zzso was zzso D zzso zzso zzso using zzso values and zzso zzso zzso D using zzso zzso 

Portable automated zzso is a simple zzso technique that appeared to be as accurate as but with less zzso than manual zzso in determining zzso power for cataract zzso
