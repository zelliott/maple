Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging zzso zzso is a quantitative technique to probe the zzso of fluorescent zzso It is the most robust way to zzso zzso zzso Energy Transfer zzso as it allows reliable differentiation between concentration changes and zzso In this way, molecular interactions can be zzso in single living zzso The most common zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which determines the zzso lifetime by measuring the phase and zzso changes of the zzso in each zzso upon zzso with a light source modulated at a high zzso The zzso lifetimes are derived from a stack of images acquired at different phase shifts between zzso and zzso In this work we describe a simple method to enhance the dynamic range of zzso based on zzso the expected zzso zzso by varying the laser power through the phase zzso We show theoretically and zzso that most of the dynamic range of the camera can be recovered to zzso cells with different zzso This improvement can be added to any zzso setup with minimal zzso enhancing the zzso of information zzso
