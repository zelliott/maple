When a zzso is applied in a zzso transformation task, subjects can adapt and maintain performance by either relying on sensory feedback, or, in the absence of such feedback, on information provided by zzso For example, in a classical rotation task where movement zzso must be rotated to reach a fixed target, human subjects can successfully adapt their reaching movements solely on the basis of zzso zzso although this proves much more difficult than with visual zzso Here, we investigate such a zzso zzso adaptation process in a minimal zzso model of the zzso The key assumption of the model is that synaptic plasticity is gated by the zzso We study how the learning dynamics depend on the target size, the movement zzso the rotation angle and the number of zzso We show that when the movement is zzso for multiple targets, the adaptation process for the different targets can interfere zzso or zzso depending on the similarities between the sensory stimuli (the zzso and the overlap in their zzso zzso zzso zzso can result in a drastic slowdown of the zzso As a result of zzso the time to adapt varies zzso with the number of zzso Our analysis shows that these zzso are weaker if the reward varies smoothly with the zzso performance instead of being zzso We demonstrate how shaping the reward or shaping the task can accelerate the adaptation dramatically by reducing the destructive zzso We argue that zzso investigating the dynamics of zzso zzso adaptation for more than one sensory stimulus can shed light on the underlying learning zzso
