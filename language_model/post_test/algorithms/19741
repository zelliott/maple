zzso designed to improve speech zzso for those with zzso hearing loss zzso by enhancing zzso in a spectrum have had limited zzso Since testing of such zzso cannot separate the theory of the design from the zzso itself, the contribution of each of these potentially limiting factors is not zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to test subjects with either normal hearing or zzso in detection tasks using well controlled stimuli to predict and assess the limits in performance gain from a zzso enhancing zzso A group of zzso zzso and zzso zzso subjects listened in two zzso auditory filter zzso and detection of zzso zzso in a harmonic zzso The results show that zzso and zzso subjects have an improved ability to detect zzso zzso when there are spectral zzso surrounding the zzso Various zzso zzso and depths were compared against subjects' equivalent zzso zzso zzso zzso subjects effectively used the available energy cue in their auditory zzso Some zzso subjects, while showing significant improvements, zzso the energy reduction in their auditory zzso
