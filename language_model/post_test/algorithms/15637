This paper investigates the possibility of developing a zzso system that combines the high spatial resolution of position sensitive zzso tubes zzso with the excellent performance of zzso reconstruction zzso A small field of view zzso camera based on a zzso and a zzso zzso crystal made of zzso have been used for the acquisition of the zzso With the use of maximum likelihood expectation zzso zzso and ordered zzso expectation zzso zzso slices of the object are obtained while three-dimensional zzso reconstruction of the object is carried out using a modified marching cubes zzso zzso The spatial resolution of zzso images obtained with the system was zzso The spatial resolution of a conventional system that uses filtered zzso zzso for slices reconstruction was more than 9 zzso
