More zzso of finite element analysis zzso in implant zzso requires element zzso However, excess downsizing needs computer memory and calculation zzso To evaluate the effectiveness of a new zzso established for more valid zzso model construction without zzso three-dimensional zzso bone zzso models with different element sizes zzso 150 and 75 zzso were zzso Four zzso of zzso (1 to 4 zzso assignment of Young's zzso zzso with bone volume in the individual cubic element was used and then stress distribution against vertical loading was zzso The model with 300 zzso element size, with 4 ranks of Young's zzso zzso with bone volume in each element presented similar stress distribution to the model with the 75 zzso element zzso These results show that the new zzso was effective, and the use of the 300 zzso element for bone zzso representation was proposed, without critical changes in stress values and for possible savings on computer memory and calculation time in the zzso
