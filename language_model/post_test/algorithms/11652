Global gene expression zzso both at the transcript level and at the protein level, can be a valuable tool in the understanding of zzso biological networks, and cellular zzso As larger and larger gene expression data sets become available, data mining techniques can be applied to identify patterns of interest in the zzso Association rules, used widely in the area of market basket analysis, can be applied to the analysis of expression data as zzso Association rules can reveal biologically relevant associations between different genes or between environmental effects and gene zzso An association rule has the form zzso zzso zzso where zzso and zzso are zzso sets of items, the zzso set being likely to occur whenever the zzso set zzso Items in gene expression data can include genes that are highly expressed or zzso as well as relevant facts describing the cellular environment of the genes zzso the diagnosis of a tumor sample from which a profile was zzso 

We demonstrate an zzso for efficiently mining association rules from gene expression data, using the data set from Hughes et zzso zzso zzso 102, zzso of 300 expression profiles for zzso Using the algorithm, we find numerous rules in the zzso A zzso analysis of some of these rules reveals numerous associations between certain zzso many of which make sense biologically, others suggesting new hypotheses that may warrant further zzso In a data set derived from the zzso data set, but with the expression values for each transcript randomly shifted with respect to the experiments, no rules were found, indicating that most all of the rules zzso from the actual data set are not likely to have occurred by zzso 

An zzso of the zzso using Microsoft zzso zzso with Access 2000 is available at zzso Our results from mining the zzso data set are available at zzso
