zzso of zzso zzso in zzso stocks are dependent on zzso zzso in segments defined by zzso zzso and zzso The expectation zzso zzso is proposed as a general method to perform maximum likelihood zzso of the zzso zzso in the intervals between such zzso The estimates can be translated via mapping functions into genetic maps of zzso zzso One set of zzso data was analyzed to exemplify application of these methods, results of which were largely zzso with other comparable zzso The method was also tested by zzso Carlo simulation of zzso of zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso assuming six different sample zzso The estimate averages were always close to the values given initially to the zzso The maximum likelihood zzso procedures can be extended readily to other kinds of zzso stocks and allow the pooling of diverse zzso data to collectively estimate lengths of zzso arms, and zzso
