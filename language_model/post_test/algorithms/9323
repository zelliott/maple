Two zzso are commonly applied in computerized zzso zzso procedures zzso Adjustment and zzso zzso however, the degree to which the two zzso produce similar patterns of zzso is zzso The present experiment compared the two common zzso across sign zzso and zzso and magnitude ($10 and zzso zzso Twenty participants made choices between larger later and smaller sooner alternatives that were presented by each of the zzso in separate zzso Strong correlations were found between the two zzso however, the zzso Adjustment Algorithm tended to produce lower indifference points and higher rates of zzso than the zzso zzso Both zzso found significant magnitude zzso Less consistent results were found when comparing the two zzso across zzso The present results suggest that researchers should apply caution when making comparisons between outcomes of delay zzso studies that have used the two different zzso However, the interpretation of findings from individual studies is probably not strongly affected by the use of different computer zzso
