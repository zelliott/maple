The zzso zzso of zzso zzso were measured in the range of several tens of zzso to about zzso zzso The zzso were excited using zzso laser zzso The zzso zzso were simulated using finite element modeling in a zzso zzso Using the method of resonant ultrasound zzso the zzso spectrum of an aluminum wire of diameter 33 zzso served to determine Young's zzso and zzso ratio with a precision of zzso and zzso zzso The calculated and measured zzso of zzso zzso were fitted with a precision better than zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
