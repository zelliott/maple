zzso the effect of a single zzso acid substitution on the stability of a protein structure is a fundamental task in zzso zzso It has relevance to drug design and understanding of zzso protein zzso We present zzso a web server for performing in zzso zzso experiments on protein structures from the zzso Data zzso Our zzso approach permits fast evaluation of the effects of zzso that may not be easy to perform in zzso because it is not always possible to express a protein with a specific zzso acid zzso We use zzso to identify critical zzso and we show that our predictions correlate with zzso zzso to zzso In two in-depth case studies we show that the zzso zzso identified by zzso as critical correlate with experimental data, and would not have been identified by other methods such as zzso zzso Surface Area zzso or zzso ranking by contributions to stabilizing zzso We also generate 48 zzso for 14 zzso and compare our zzso results against experimental zzso stability zzso zzso is available at zzso
