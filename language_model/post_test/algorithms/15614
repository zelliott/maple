In the classical deterministic zzso model, the zzso of parameters must be very zzso Otherwise, the system performance is very zzso To improve the system performance, we can use a Kalman filtering zzso to guide the operation of a trained zzso neural network zzso In this case, during training, we need to estimate the state of hidden layer, as well as the weights of the zzso This paper discusses how to use the dual extended Kalman filtering zzso for this dual zzso and how to use our proposing zzso for removing some zzso weights from a trained zzso In our approach, one Kalman zzso is used for zzso the state of the hidden layer, and one zzso least square zzso zzso is used for zzso the zzso After training, we use the error zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to remove zzso zzso zzso showed that our approach is an effective zzso method for zzso under the online zzso
