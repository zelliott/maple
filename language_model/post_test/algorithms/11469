The auditory radiation crosses other white matter tracts and cannot reliably be delineated or zzso assessed with zzso fiber zzso This study investigates whether zzso fiber tracking can be used to robustly delineate the full extent of the zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were acquired from 25 control participants between 8 and 26 years zzso zzso zzso and zzso fiber tracking of the auditory radiation was performed with starting and filter regions automatically generated from the zzso white matter zzso zzso fiber tracking was performed with both the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso trials demonstrating connectivity from the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso nucleus were considered zzso 

The zzso fiber tracking success rate was zzso and was significantly higher than the zzso zzso rate of 50% or the zzso zzso rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso The success rates of zzso fiber tracking for the left and right auditory zzso were not significantly zzso In contrast, the left auditory radiation was successfully delineated with zzso fiber tracking at a higher rate than the right auditory zzso 

zzso can discriminate the complex white matter pathways at the junction of the auditory radiation and the zzso zzso fiber tracking can reliably delineate the auditory zzso
