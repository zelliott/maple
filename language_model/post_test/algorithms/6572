Human decisions often proceed in two zzso zzso those most preferred are chosen followed by a subsequent choice of these zzso zzso one artificial neural network zzso a zzso is limited to the zzso zzso The final categorization is only possible by a subsequent ANN that zzso the zzso zzso zzso strategies using coupled zzso are discussed and a new approach particularly suited for zzso zzso problems is introduced zzso zzso zzso 

Evaluating a simulated data base zzso 3 classes, zzso results of zzso were obviously superior to those achieved by zzso To evaluate a real-world data base the zzso benchmark zzso zzso zzso was zzso The ANN results reached zzso comparable to previous zzso Using zzso up to zzso of the tumors were correctly zzso 

Programs used in this work and zzso results are available upon zzso
