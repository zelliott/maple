zzso zzso imaging of tissue surrounding metallic implants is often limited by metal zzso This paper compares 3 existing metal artifact reduction techniques that are based on zzso of zzso regions in native images, followed by zzso of segmented areas into original zzso space, removal of metal zzso and renewed zzso zzso zzso linear zzso zzso zzso and combination of zzso linear zzso and zzso zzso For each method, improvements of CT number accuracy and zzso as well as zzso ratios near the zzso and in the image periphery over the values found for native images were evaluated in a phantom experiment simulating zzso bone zzso of different size and density around a zzso hip zzso zzso Improvement in diagnostic zzso was evaluated as zzso zzso by zzso zzso and qualitative results showed that the linear zzso and the combination method removed the artifacts most zzso The mean accuracy error over different regions of interest placed in the direct vicinity of the metal and in the periphery of the object decreased zzso with linear zzso These methods increased zzso ratio up to zzso of that measured on zzso images for the least dense zzso zzso the linear zzso and the combination method improved the zzso zzso and enabled differentiation of different zzso zzso However, in proximity to the zzso some artifacts remained for all zzso We conclude that published zzso for metal artifact reduction substantially improve image quality for CT imaging of a metallic object and may be adequate for quantitative zzso except for the direct vicinity of the metallic zzso
