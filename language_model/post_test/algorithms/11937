The objectives of this study were to evaluate the zzso behavior of blood vessels and their interaction within the coronary zzso tree and to evaluate the possible role of the zzso response in zzso The model consists of 10 compartments in series, each representing a class of vessel zzso zzso and resistance in each class are determined by their value at full zzso zzso zzso and by the zzso zzso Three zzso of zzso and three zzso of zzso strength, zzso zzso of zzso curve, range zzso to zzso were evaluated (9 zzso It was found that larger vessels zzso the zzso activity of smaller vessels and that zzso responsiveness is sufficient to achieve zzso When zzso has a maximum in vessels of 84 zzso the maximum effect of zzso pressure on active diameter occurs in vessels between 123 and 181 zzso depending on the distribution of zzso Distribution of resistance and control mechanisms in the coronary zzso tree are important for interpretation of individual vessel responses as observed in zzso
