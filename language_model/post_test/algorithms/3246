In traditional zzso zzso one derives evolution equations at the zzso zzso scale of interest; these are used to perform a variety of tasks zzso zzso analysis, zzso using an arsenal of zzso and zzso zzso For many complex systems, however, although one observes evolution at a zzso scale of interest, accurate models are only given at a more detailed zzso zzso level of description zzso lattice zzso kinetic zzso zzso molecular zzso Here, we review a framework for zzso zzso analysis, which enables zzso zzso tasks (over extended zzso zzso using only appropriately zzso microscopic simulation on short time and length zzso The methodology zzso the derivation of zzso evolution equations when these equations zzso exist but are not available in closed zzso the term zzso We selectively discuss basic zzso and underlying principles and illustrate the approach through representative zzso We also discuss potential difficulties and outline areas for future zzso
