In zzso spectral zzso imaging has made it possible to zzso zzso superficial curved structures as well as structures deep to the zzso However, the zzso created by blurring has been an obstacle to creating zzso zzso surface zzso zzso we present a methodology to correct for blurring induced by curved structures during spectral zzso imaging using signal intensity projection zzso In a phantom and an animal model in which the zzso system was zzso after the zzso injection of quantum dots with zzso zzso in the zzso zzso range, the planes of focus were zzso adjusted to obtain a zzso of images which contains images acquired from multiple focal zzso zzso zzso median and average intensity projections were applied to the resulting zzso Using the zzso the minimum and the median intensity projection images demonstrated improved zzso whereas during in zzso imaging the median intensity projection images more clearly zzso important structures than did the other projection zzso Image stacking with subsequent application of appropriate projection techniques provides a simple method for zzso in zzso optical images obtained from curved surfaces, thus improving their zzso zzso
