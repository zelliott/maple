zzso quantitative zzso relationship zzso models are zzso from zzso input data, by using a zzso of molecular zzso for each chemical in the zzso Another alternative is to consider the structural relationships between the chemical structures, such as molecular zzso presence of certain zzso or chemical transformations between zzso We defined a class of zzso models based on molecular networks induced by a sequence of substitution reactions on a chemical structure that generates a partially ordered set (or zzso oriented graph that may be used to predict various molecular properties with quantitative zzso relationships zzso The zzso zzso models defined on zzso zzso namely average zzso cluster expansion, and zzso zzso were tested with success for the prediction of several zzso properties for diverse zzso We introduce the flow network zzso a new zzso zzso model in which the zzso of zzso represented as a reaction zzso is transformed into an oriented network of electrical zzso in which the current flow results in a potential at each zzso The molecular property considered in the zzso model is represented as the electrical potential, and the value of this potential at a particular zzso is determined by the electrical zzso assigned to each edge and by a system of zzso Each zzso with a known value for the molecular property is attached to a battery that sets the potential on that zzso to the value of the respective molecular property, and no external battery is attached to zzso from the prediction set, representing chemicals for which the values of the molecular property are not known or are intended to be zzso The flow network zzso zzso determines the values of the molecular property for the prediction set of molecules by applying zzso law and zzso current law to the zzso network of electrical zzso Several applications of the flow network zzso are zzso
