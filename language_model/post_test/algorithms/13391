An zzso was developed to obtain zzso local optical axis in zzso samples by using conventional zzso optical zzso zzso zzso that uses a single zzso polarized incident zzso The round-trip sample Jones zzso were first constructed from the cumulative zzso zzso An zzso method was then applied to construct the zzso local Jones zzso from which the local optical axis was zzso The proposed zzso was validated in samples with homogeneous axis and with zzso optical zzso Imaging examples were shown to demonstrate the capability of this method for zzso correct local axis and revealing features not evident in other zzso
