In this article, a new zzso zzso is proposed and evaluated for the suppression of the combined effects of zzso and zzso 

The proposed zzso zzso on a short-term basis zzso 20 zzso the zzso stimuli into a number of channels and retains only a subset of the channels satisfying a zzso ratio zzso zzso The construction of this criterion assumes access to a zzso knowledge of the target zzso zzso and the aim of this study was to assess the full potential of the proposed zzso algorithm, assuming that this criterion could be estimated zzso zzso tests with zzso listeners were conducted to assess the performance of the proposed zzso in highly zzso conditions zzso zzso zzso zzso which included additive noise at 0 and 5 zzso zzso ratios zzso 

A substantial gain in zzso was obtained in both zzso and combined zzso and noise zzso The mean zzso scores improved by 44 and 33 percentage points at 0 and 5 zzso zzso zzso + noise zzso Feature analysis of the consonant confusion zzso revealed that the transmission of zzso information was most zzso affected, followed by manner and place of zzso 

The proposed zzso produced substantial gains in zzso and this benefit was attributed to the ability of the proposed zzso criterion to detect accurately voiced or zzso zzso It was zzso that detection of those boundaries is critical for better perception of zzso information and manner of zzso
