A zzso approach and zzso zzso Carlo simulations are presented for describing the zzso microscopic structure around the DNA zzso immersed in zzso zzso zzso In the zzso approach, the zzso contribution to the zzso energy functional is obtained from the modified fundamental measure theory zzso Yu and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso contribution is evaluated through a zzso functional Taylor zzso The new theory is suitable to the systems containing zzso of arbitrary sizes and zzso In the established zzso zzso Carlo zzso an zzso zzso method is used to evaluate the long-range energy, and another zzso zzso is adopted to obtain desired bulk zzso zzso The zzso zzso from the zzso theory zzso are in good agreement with those from the corresponding zzso Carlo zzso zzso It is found that the ratio of the bulk zzso of two species of zzso zzso makes significant contribution to the zzso zzso in the vicinity of zzso Comparisons with the zzso potential profiles from the zzso simulations show that the accuracy of the zzso becomes low when a small zzso zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso simulation results illustrate that the zzso potential at the surface of DNA increases as the zzso diameter or the total zzso concentration is increased and decreases as the diameter of one zzso species is zzso The calculation of zzso potential using real zzso diameters shows that the accuracy of zzso predictions for zzso zzso is also zzso
