We devised a new analysis using zzso zzso of integrated and zzso zzso termed zzso to determine a zzso dimension of zzso zzso In the algorithm, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of all integrated and zzso fluctuations are repeated over all scales zzso The zzso zzso zzso is determined as a slope of the line relating log zzso to log zzso zzso of the zzso and a spectral analysis using 20 zzso fractional zzso motions demonstrates zzso of the zzso to zzso zzso
