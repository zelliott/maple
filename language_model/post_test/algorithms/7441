zzso blood flow models have been used extensively for computing pressure and flow zzso in the human zzso zzso We propose an improved zzso zzso based on a graphics processing unit zzso for the acceleration of the execution time of one-dimensional zzso A novel parallel hybrid zzso zzso with compact copy operations zzso and a parallel zzso only zzso zzso are developed, which are compared against previously introduced zzso versions, a zzso CPU only zzso and a zzso CPU only zzso Different zzso zzso schemes zzso and Taylor series) are evaluated for the zzso solution of one-dimensional model, and the zzso zzso include zzso motivated zzso zzso and periodic boundary conditions zzso zzso zzso and elastic and zzso wall zzso Both the zzso and the zzso zzso improved the execution time zzso The zzso values over the zzso CPU only zzso range from zzso to zzso whereas the zzso values over the zzso CPU only zzso range from zzso to zzso The zzso zzso performs best for an elastic wall law with zzso BC and for zzso wall laws, whereas the zzso zzso performs best for an elastic wall law with periodic zzso
