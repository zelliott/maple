The double nucleus enhanced zzso zzso experiment employs simultaneous zzso of zzso and zzso to promote spin diffusion processes in a zzso zzso This results in 4-5 times higher sensitivity in zzso zzso correlation experiments as compared to zzso zzso Here, a quantitative comparison of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been performed to analyze the influence of spin diffusion on polarization transfer zzso Cross peak buildup zzso were analyzed to obtain guidelines for choosing the best experimental zzso The largest cross peak zzso were observed for the zzso zzso The fastest zzso rate was observed in the zzso experiment within a buildup range of zzso zzso whereas values between 24 and 69 zzso are observed for the zzso zzso Furthermore, the effects of direct zzso and cross polarization zzso are zzso A comparison between zzso and zzso experiments reveal zzso more intense cross zzso in the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso zzso zzso spectrum applying zzso zzso zzso As a zzso determining the zzso in zzso correlation experiments, zzso zzso efficiency is investigated using zzso samples with zzso ratios at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso strong zzso zzso signal intensity is observed for such proteins even with very low zzso zzso The effect of zzso and/or zzso decoupling is analyzed at various zzso spinning zzso zzso decoupling was found most crucial for obtaining high zzso Long range correlations are readily observed representing distances up to zzso zzso by using zzso zzso
