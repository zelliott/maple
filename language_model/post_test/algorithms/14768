This paper is concerned with networked zzso where sensor data are transmitted over a network of limited transmission zzso The transmission rate depends on the sampling periods and the zzso bit zzso To investigate how the sampling periods and the zzso bit lengths affect the zzso performance, an equation to zzso the zzso performance is zzso An zzso is proposed to find sampling periods and zzso bit lengths zzso which gives good zzso performance while satisfying the transmission rate zzso Through the zzso example, the proposed zzso is zzso
