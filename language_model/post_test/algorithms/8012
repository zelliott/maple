Conventional zzso neural networks zzso have difficulties in learning long-term zzso To tackle this problem, we propose an architecture called zzso zzso neural network zzso A symbolic sequence is broken into segments and then presented as zzso to the zzso one symbol per zzso The zzso uses separate internal states to store zzso context, as well as zzso zzso The zzso context is updated for each symbol presented for zzso The zzso context is updated after each zzso The zzso is trained using an extended real-time zzso learning zzso We test the performance of zzso on the information zzso problem, the zzso zzso and the problem of protein secondary structure zzso zzso Our zzso results indicate that zzso performs better on long-term dependency problems than conventional zzso Besides, we also theoretically analyze how the segmented memory of zzso helps learning long-term zzso zzso and study the impact of the segment zzso
