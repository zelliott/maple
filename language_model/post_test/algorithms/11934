A model of simple zzso zzso acting in a discrete temperature field is used to investigate the movement of individuals in zzso honey bee zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso clusters is thought to be the result of individual bees attempting to regulate their own body zzso At ambient temperatures above zzso degrees zzso a zzso bee will move relative to its zzso so as to put its local temperature within some ideal zzso The proposed model incorporates this zzso into an zzso for bee agents moving on a two-dimensional zzso Heat transport on the lattice is zzso by a discrete diffusion zzso Computer simulation of this model demonstrates qualitative zzso which agrees with that of real honey bee zzso In particular, we observe the formation of both zzso and zzso cluster zzso The simulation also suggests that at lower ambient temperatures, clusters do not always have a stable shape but can zzso between insulating rings of different sizes and zzso
