Brain zzso and zzso zzso zzso are common features at cerebral zzso of both normal and zzso elderly zzso In a zzso study of zzso elderly subjects aged zzso years, free of zzso who had a cerebral zzso at entry, we investigated the relationship between zzso volume and brain zzso markers estimated by zzso gray matter zzso and zzso fluid zzso zzso 

An automated zzso of detection and zzso of zzso was developed, and zzso zzso methods were used to estimate zzso zzso and zzso zzso To evaluate the relation between those volumes and zzso load, we used analysis of zzso and multiple linear zzso models adjusting for potential zzso and total zzso zzso 

Age was highly correlated with zzso load and all brain zzso zzso Total zzso volume was zzso associated with both zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso volumes zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and positively with zzso volumes zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso after controlling for sex, age, education level, hypertension and zzso E zzso Evidence for a relationship between brain zzso markers and zzso was stronger for zzso zzso We found that the relationship between zzso and zzso volumes was independent of other brain tissue zzso 

These results suggest that, in the brain of zzso elderly subjects, degenerative processes and vascular changes zzso and are related independently of vascular risk zzso
