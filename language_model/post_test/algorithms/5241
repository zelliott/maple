Manual state scoring of zzso recordings in sleep studies is zzso resulting in a data zzso research delays and increased personnel zzso We developed zzso software to automate scoring of zzso states in rats, potentially zzso to other animals, from a variety of recording zzso The software contains two programs, Sleep zzso and zzso for manual and automated zzso zzso is a zzso program that displays power spectral zzso of an zzso zzso signal and zzso zzso and zzso frequency bands of an zzso zzso zzso along with the zzso ratio and zzso for every zzso The user defines thresholds from the training file state definitions which the zzso uses with logic to discriminate the state of every zzso in the zzso zzso was evaluated by comparing its output to manually scored files from 6 rats under 2 experimental conditions by 3 zzso Each user generated a training file, set zzso and zzso the 12 files into 4 states zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in 1/4 the time required to manually score the zzso zzso performance comparisons between zzso and manual scoring resulted in a mean agreement of zzso comparable to the average agreement among 3 manual scorers zzso There was no significant difference between zzso and zzso agreement zzso These results support the use of our zzso zzso coupled with user review, to rapidly and accurately score zzso states from rat zzso
