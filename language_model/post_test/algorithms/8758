Surveillance for zzso zzso attack zzso using administrative data has traditionally been limited to reporting patients who had an acute event and were zzso This zzso the true prevalence because many events do not result in zzso We examined whether the accuracy of administrative data for identifying prevalent zzso could be improved by using data from both zzso and zzso zzso 

An administrative data validation reference standard was developed through chart abstraction of zzso adult patients randomly sampled from zzso patients of 83 family physicians who participate in the Electronic Medical Record zzso Data Linked Database zzso in Ontario, zzso 

The prevalence of zzso in our adult population was zzso An zzso of 1 hospital record had a sensitivity of zzso zzso and specificity of zzso zzso whereas an zzso of 2 physician zzso within 1 year or 1 hospitalization had a sensitivity of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and specificity of zzso zzso zzso zzso for the identification of patients who had ever had a zzso We found that hospitalization data underestimated the prevalence of stroke by zzso 50% and zzso by zzso zzso compared with using both hospitalization and physician claims zzso 

The use of zzso physician claims data in addition to hospitalization data improves the sensitivity of administrative data for the identification of prevalent zzso and may be used to estimate the prevalence of cerebrovascular events in large populations and over zzso
