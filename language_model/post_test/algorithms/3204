A procedure for the optimal zzso and representation of the information retrieved from atmospheric observations is zzso We show that the zzso zzso exclusively contains the information present in the zzso but is not suitable for a representation of the retrieved profile in the form of a zzso The new method of the zzso zzso which provides in a complement space an external constraint and makes the solution zzso with this zzso is zzso In this way the measurement and the constraint are separately determined and are given in a vertical grid that can be freely chosen as fine as zzso The method is applied to simulated zzso and is used to define a procedure for data zzso
