The new sequencing technologies enable to scan very long and dense genetic zzso obtaining zzso of genetic markers that are an order of magnitude larger than previously zzso Such genetic sequences are characterized by common zzso zzso with multiple rarer zzso This situation has renewed the interest for the identification of zzso carrying the rare risk zzso However, large scale explorations of the zzso zzso pattern to identify zzso blocks are not easy to perform, because traditional zzso have at least zzso time and memory zzso 

We derived three incremental zzso of the widely used zzso block recognition zzso proposed by Gabriel et zzso in zzso Our most efficient solution, called zzso zzso has only zzso memory complexity and, on a zzso scale, it omits zzso of the calculations, which makes it an order of magnitude faster than the original zzso zzso from the existing software, the zzso zzso analyzes the zzso between zzso at any distance, avoiding restrictions on the zzso block zzso The zzso block partition of the entire zzso II zzso zzso was obtained in zzso zzso By replacing the standard zzso zzso zzso zzso with an zzso zzso the zzso was further zzso While producing a zzso zzso the approximate method allowed to obtain the zzso zzso block partition of the entire 1000 zzso Project zzso zzso in 44 hours, with no restrictions on zzso frequency or long-range zzso These experiments showed that zzso zzso blocks can span more than one million zzso in both zzso II and 1000 zzso zzso An application to the North American zzso Arthritis zzso zzso zzso shows how the zzso zzso can support zzso zzso association zzso 

The zzso zzso enables to perform zzso zzso block recognition on genetic sequences of any length and zzso In the new generation sequencing era, this can help identify zzso that carry rare zzso of zzso The low zzso requirements open the possibility to include the zzso block structure into zzso association scans, downstream zzso and visual zzso for online zzso zzso
