The electrical zzso zzso of freshly excised zzso and zzso white matter were studied in the frequency range of zzso relevance for zzso zzso zzso in 21 patients zzso zzso to 55 zzso undergoing zzso zzso zzso patients were classified as having cortical zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso for apparent diffusion zzso zzso and fractional zzso zzso was obtained in 9 zzso zzso found that electrical zzso in freshly excised zzso vary significantly from patient to patient zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from CD patients had increased zzso compared with zzso zzso In addition, longer seizure zzso positively correlated with zzso for CD zzso while they zzso correlated for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with electrical zzso in CD and zzso zzso These results in a small initial cohort indicate that electrical zzso of freshly excised zzso from zzso surgery patients varies as a consequence of clinical zzso such as underlying pathology and seizure zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso how disease affects cortical electrical zzso and ways to zzso measure it, perhaps through zzso could enhance the ability to zzso zzso zzso and other relevant information in the treatment of zzso surgery zzso
