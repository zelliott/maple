zzso elastic zzso of zzso zzso duplex DNA fragments were evaluated using four 5 zzso unrestrained molecular dynamics simulation zzso of 17 zzso duplexes with explicit inclusion of zzso and zzso All simulations were carried out with the Cornell et zzso zzso and particle mesh Ewald method for long-range zzso zzso The elastic zzso including zzso zzso and all zzso terms were derived by analyzing the correlations of fluctuations of structural properties along the zzso The following sequences have been zzso zzso zzso and zzso and alternating zzso and zzso The calculated values of elastic zzso are in very good overall agreement with experimental values for random zzso The zzso molecular dynamics approach, however, reveals a pronounced zzso of the stretching and zzso rigidity of DNA, while zzso of the zzso rigidity is smaller for the sequences zzso The earlier predicted zzso zzso emerged as the most important zzso for fragments shorter than one zzso zzso The calculated zzso relaxation times suggest that zzso of zzso motions may play a role in molecular dynamics simulations of long DNA zzso A comparison of elasticity calculations using global and local zzso analyses is zzso The calculations reveal the importance of the zzso length zzso The present work shows that large-scale molecular dynamics simulations represent a unique source of data to study various aspects of DNA elasticity including its zzso
