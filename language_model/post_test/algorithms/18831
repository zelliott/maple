In this paper, we present an zzso filtered zzso zzso type inversion method for zzso synthetic zzso radar zzso We consider a zzso system where a scene of interest is illuminated by electromagnetic waves that are zzso at known times, from positions along an arbitrary, but known, flight trajectory and the scattered waves are measured from positions along a different flight trajectory which is also arbitrary, but zzso We assume a zzso model for the radar data, and we assume that the ground topography is known but not necessarily zzso We use zzso analysis to develop the zzso reconstruction zzso We analyze the zzso complexity of the zzso zzso of the method and present zzso simulations to demonstrate its zzso
