The unique physical forces exerted on the zzso zzso artery during movement have been implicated in the high rates of zzso and zzso fracture in this zzso zzso changes in the zzso artery during movement are important surrogates of these zzso This study sought to zzso the zzso change in the zzso artery between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Using paired zzso images of overlapping segments of the zzso artery in zzso and zzso positions from patients with peripheral zzso disease, 3-D models of individual segments were generated and subsequently fused to create a 3-D model of the entire zzso artery in both leg zzso Based on these 3-D models, the following parameters in the zzso and zzso positions were zzso assessed for the superficial zzso artery zzso zzso artery zzso and zzso artery zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso twist angle, and development of new zzso angles zzso 15 zzso 

In nine male patients with a mean age of 57 zzso zzso years, zzso was performed in 10 zzso zzso with successful generation of 3-D models for all zzso Movement from the zzso to the zzso position for the zzso zzso and zzso artery was associated with zzso a mean zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a mean increase in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and small absolute changes in mean zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The same leg movement was associated with a mean twist angle of zzso degrees zzso zzso degrees zzso of zzso zzso degrees ) and zzso degrees zzso zzso degrees zzso of zzso zzso degrees ) for the zzso and zzso zzso Compared to the zzso position, the zzso position induced a single zzso point zzso zzso degrees in the zzso in two patients, and a mean of zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso zzso in the zzso 

zzso changes in zzso zzso and twist occur in the PA and significant but more modest changes in length and twist occur in the zzso during movement from the zzso to the zzso zzso This data has important implications for zzso therapies that are used to treat disease in the zzso zzso
