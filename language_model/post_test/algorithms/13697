This study presents an zzso that zzso zzso techniques for zzso and zzso drug zzso The aim of the method is to link two or more predetermined functional groups into a sensible molecular zzso The proposed designing process mimics the classical manual design method, in which the drug designer sits in front of the computer screen and with the aid of computer graphics attempts to design the new zzso zzso the key principle of the zzso is the zzso of some criteria that affect the decision-making process carried out by the drug zzso This zzso is based on the generation of weighting factors that reflect the knowledge and zzso zzso of the drug designer, and thus add further rationalization to the drug design zzso The proposed zzso has been shown to yield a large variety of different structures, of which the drug designer may choose the most zzso Performance tests indicate that with the proper set of zzso the method generates a new structure within a short zzso
