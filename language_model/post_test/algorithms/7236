zzso sensitivity of the human visual system to visual stimuli can be significantly affected by several mechanisms, zzso vision zzso and zzso zzso studies on zzso based video quality assessment only take into account zzso zzso zzso This paper first proposes an advanced zzso imaging model to generate the perceived representation of video by zzso visual attention into the zzso zzso For accurately simulating the dynamic zzso zzso a novel approach to predict video zzso is proposed by mimicking the essential functionality of eye zzso zzso an advanced contrast sensitivity function, derived from the attention driven zzso zzso is modeled and then integrated into a zzso distortion visibility measure to build a full reference attention driven zzso video quality zzso zzso zzso exploits adequately zzso visual mechanisms in video quality zzso zzso evaluation results with respect to several publicly available zzso and video quality databases demonstrate promising performance of the proposed video attention model, fixation prediction approach, and quality zzso
