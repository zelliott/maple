This article presents a sequential learning zzso for function approximation and zzso prediction using a minimal zzso basis function neural network zzso The zzso combines the growth criterion of the zzso network zzso of Platt (1991) with a pruning strategy based on the relative contribution of each hidden unit to the overall network zzso The resulting network leads toward a minimal zzso for the zzso The performance of the zzso is compared with zzso and the enhanced zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso for the following benchmark problems: zzso zzso from the benchmark problems database zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso chaotic time zzso For these problems, the proposed zzso is shown to realize zzso with far fewer hidden zzso with better or same zzso
