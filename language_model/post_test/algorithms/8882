The objective of this study was to validate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso phase contrast vastly zzso imaging with zzso resolution projection reconstruction magnetic zzso for the zzso of ascending zzso zzso and main pulmonary artery zzso flow in zzso 

Data from 18 healthy volunteers zzso zzso zzso years zzso zzso zzso body mass index, zzso zzso zzso zzso scanned at 3 T with a zzso zzso were zzso The left and right zzso stroke volumes calculated from zzso zzso zzso steady state free zzso zzso slices were used as the primary reference for cardiac zzso zzso measured from zzso phase contrast zzso zzso in the zzso and the zzso served as the secondary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso flow zzso using zzso was performed with a zzso sensitivity of zzso zzso 150 zzso reconstructed to 20 time frames at zzso zzso spatial zzso In 11 of 20 volunteers, zzso zzso flow zzso data were also zzso zzso between methods of calculating the left zzso and right zzso cardiac output were assessed with the zzso analysis zzso mean difference zzso The zzso was calculated for each zzso 

Initially, zzso compared unfavorably with zzso zzso zzso stroke zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso right zzso stroke zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso with BA differences of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Whereas phantom correction had minor effects on zzso results and comparison with zzso it improved zzso zzso BA differences between zzso and zzso after correction were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso BA comparison with zzso improved to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results for all techniques were within zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso and zzso flows with zzso zzso zzso flow zzso applying zzso zzso zzso is achievable when phantom correction is zzso
