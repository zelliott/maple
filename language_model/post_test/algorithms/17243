At what levels of brain organization might pathological change in schizophrenia be zzso zzso zzso regional or zzso We zzso that brain structure reflects a set of zzso anatomical systems with common zzso zzso We conducted an exploratory analysis to identify zzso brain systems and to investigate whether abnormal brain architecture in schizophrenia is zzso within one or more of these zzso zzso resonance zzso images were acquired from 27 patients with schizophrenia and 37 control zzso After zzso and registration of each individual zzso zzso in the standard space of zzso and zzso zzso matter and zzso fluid zzso maps were automatically zzso into 104 zzso We used principal components analysis of the multiple regional zzso matter and zzso zzso on all 64 subjects, to extract the five main zzso zzso zzso The first two of these components represented global variation in zzso matter and zzso regional zzso We interpreted the other three components as representing zzso systems zzso a zzso system, a zzso system and a zzso zzso zzso zzso group mean scores on the first component zzso zzso zzso zzso and fourth component zzso zzso were significantly reduced compared to zzso These results suggest that pathological change in schizophrenia may be expressed at two mutually independent levels of anatomical zzso global change in a zzso zzso system and zzso change in a zzso zzso
