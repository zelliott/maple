The purpose of this prospective zzso study was to evaluate a clinical protocol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the initial screening examination for the zzso of penetrating neck zzso 

All penetrating neck injuries assessed at two Level I trauma centers (January zzso zzso zzso underwent a structured clinical zzso Those with hard signs of injury zzso zzso instability, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and air zzso underwent zzso those who were zzso were zzso The zzso with soft signs underwent zzso zzso and specificity were tested against an zzso gold standard of operative intervention, clinical zzso and when zzso conventional zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

Four hundred zzso penetrating neck injuries were zzso Hard signs of vascular or zzso tract injury were observed in zzso with an zzso zzso of clinically significant zzso zzso had no signs of injury and were observed with no missed injuries zzso zzso days zzso zzso days zzso zzso The remaining 225 zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso gunshot zzso zzso zzso zzso The external wounds were in zone II zzso multiple zzso zone I zzso and zone III zzso zzso injuries were found in 22 patients (5 internal zzso 2 external zzso 1 zzso 7 common zzso 2 internal zzso 3 external zzso 2 zzso 3 zzso and 3 zzso Five patients had zzso findings (2 vascular and 3 zzso zzso The zzso negative studies zzso zzso days zzso zzso days zzso zzso had no delayed diagnosis of zzso zzso was zzso in four patients zzso secondary to zzso One of these had a zzso injury diagnosed at zzso zzso achieved zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity in detecting all clinically significant zzso 

In the initial evaluation of patients who have sustained penetrating neck zzso physical examination can safely reduce unnecessary zzso If imaging is required, zzso is a highly sensitive and specific screening zzso for evaluating the vascular and zzso structures in the zzso
