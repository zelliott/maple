zzso spin zzso zzso zzso offers a zzso means to create zzso contrast in zzso for dynamic zzso zzso By spatial zzso of the zzso process it is possible to uniquely label individual arteries over a series of zzso allowing each to be separately identified in the resulting zzso zzso This separation requires appropriate analysis for which a general zzso framework has previously been zzso Here this framework is adapted for clinical dynamic zzso zzso This specifically addresses the issues of zzso speed of the zzso and the zzso required to deal with real patient zzso An zzso is proposed that can incorporate planning information about the arteries being zzso whilst adapting for subsequent patient zzso A fast maximum a zzso solution is adopted and shown to be only marginally less accurate than zzso Carlo sampling under zzso The final zzso is demonstrated on in zzso data with analysis on a time scale of the order of zzso from both a healthy control and a patient with a zzso zzso
