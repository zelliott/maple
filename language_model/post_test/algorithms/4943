Shape analysis requires zzso under translation, scale, and zzso zzso and scale zzso can be realized by zzso shape zzso with respect to their mean and zzso This maps the shape feature zzso onto the surface of a zzso After zzso the shape zzso can be made zzso zzso by modeling the resulting data using complex zzso zzso zzso defined on the complex zzso zzso using the complex zzso zzso However, the use of these zzso is hampered by the difficulty in zzso their parameters and the zzso nature of their zzso In the present paper, we show how a set of kernel functions that we refer to as rotation zzso kernels can be used to convert the original zzso problem into a linear zzso As their name implies, these kernels are defined to provide the much needed rotation zzso property allowing one to bypass the difficulty of working with complex zzso zzso The resulting approach provides an easy, fast mechanism for zzso & zzso shape zzso zzso validation using a variety of shape modeling and zzso problems demonstrates the accuracy of this proposed zzso
