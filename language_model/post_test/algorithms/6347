To determine whether specific regions of cerebral zzso are activated at the onset and during the propagation of absence zzso 

Twenty-five absence zzso were recorded in five subjects (all zzso age zzso zzso with primary generalized zzso To improve spatial resolution, all studies were performed with zzso zzso scalp zzso zzso analysis was conducted with equivalent zzso zzso and smoothed linear inverse zzso zzso zzso were applied to the spike components of each zzso burst in each seizure, with sources zzso with standard brain zzso 

For each patient, the major findings were apparent on inspection of the scalp zzso maps and zzso and the two methods of source analysis gave generally zzso zzso The onset of zzso was typically associated with zzso of zzso often unilateral areas of zzso frontal or zzso frontal zzso zzso across all seizures, the negative slow wave was zzso over frontal cortex, and the spike that appeared to follow the slow wave was highly localized over zzso regions of zzso frontal zzso In addition, sources in zzso frontal zzso were engaged for each zzso zzso Although each patient showed unique features, the absence zzso of all patients showed zzso stereotyped evolution to engage both zzso frontal and zzso frontal zzso sources during the repeating cycles of zzso zzso 

These data suggest that absence zzso are not truly zzso with immediate global cortical involvement, but rather involve selective cortical networks, including zzso frontal and zzso frontal regions, in the propagation of zzso zzso
