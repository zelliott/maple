zzso real-time zzso zzso is the zzso technique for measuring zzso zzso To correctly compare samples and generate biologically valid results, zzso data usually require comprehensive zzso to account for sample content variation between zzso The most common zzso approaches use one or more zzso controls zzso or zzso zzso to adjust the measured levels of experimental genes zzso zzso reference genes are those that display minimal variation across experimental conditions, and thus can vary widely across different biological zzso In particular, zzso studies of zzso zzso like zzso zzso require careful consideration of reference zzso 

We examined seven candidate reference genes in 199 mice varying in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso We assessed zzso in four ways: zzso the zzso of the raw zzso values across biological zzso zzso the zzso from zzso zzso levels following treatment, zzso the zzso and zzso stability evaluated using the zzso algorithm, zzso the comparative zzso method for each candidate zzso zzso analyses showed zzso and zzso are the two most stable individual reference zzso It has been suggested that using multiple genes would produce a more consistent zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed using zzso In general, stability increased with the number of genes used, but specific zzso zzso 

We have validated seven reference genes for use in analyzing zzso zzso in mouse models of zzso zzso The use of multiple reference genes increases stability, providing more consistent zzso and more reliable zzso The number of reference genes used should be zzso based on experimental capabilities zzso sample zzso zzso Our results show the benefit of zzso reference genes using multiple methods prior to generating large biological zzso
