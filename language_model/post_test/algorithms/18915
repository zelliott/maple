We developed an zzso named zzso zzso enrichment analysis of regional DNA copy number zzso for functional interpretation of zzso DNA copy number changes identified by zzso comparative zzso zzso zzso selects two types of zzso zzso with potential biological zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Then it performs functional enrichment analysis using a zzso selected functional gene sets to identify primary and clinical zzso zzso The zzso signatures identified by zzso represent functionally coordinated zzso changes, which can provide clues on the underlying molecular mechanisms related to the zzso of zzso zzso can help the identification of key molecular functions that are activated or zzso in the tumor zzso leading to the improved understanding on the tumor zzso 

zzso software is available with online manual in the zzso zzso
