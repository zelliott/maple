zzso zzso data provides us a possible means for identification of zzso regulation relationships among zzso Currently, the most commonly used method in determining whether or not two genes have a potential regulatory relationship is to measure their zzso similarity using zzso correlation zzso Although this traditional correlation method has been successfully applied to find functionally correlated zzso it does have many zzso In the hope of overcoming such circumstances and getting more insights into the zzso regulatory issue, we propose an zzso zzso technique for detection of potential regulated gene pairs from zzso zzso zzso 

We use the well-known zzso modeling technique to characterize zzso gene expression data from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this method, zzso expression profiles are zzso into spectral components and correlations between profiles are then zzso in a zzso zzso We show how these zzso correlations reveal possible regulatory zzso Our technique is applied on known zzso regulations and is able to identify many of those missed by the traditional correlation zzso
