A zzso zzso laser providing zzso pulse zzso and zzso pulse energies is suitable for typical biomedical PA zzso However, such zzso are both bulky and zzso An alternative method is to use a zzso laser, which can achieve a higher pulse repetition zzso Although the energy from a zzso laser is generally too low for effective PA generation, this can be zzso by using high-speed coded laser zzso with the signal intensity of the received signal being enhanced by pulse zzso In this study we tested a version of this method that employs coded zzso A zzso PA zzso was used for zzso PA zzso A zzso PA signal was generated by tuning the zzso between two adjacent laser zzso The experimental results showed that this methodology improved the zzso ratio of the zzso PA signal by up to zzso zzso although high range side zzso were also zzso These side zzso could be reduced by zzso the zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso codes proposed in the literature, the proposed coded zzso requires only a single zzso
