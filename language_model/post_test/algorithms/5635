With increasing knowledge about the potential mechanisms underlying cellular functions, it is becoming feasible to predict the response of biological systems to genetic and environmental zzso Due to the lack of zzso in living zzso it is difficult to estimate the zzso effect of zzso including potential zzso Here we investigate a biologically motivated model for zzso tissue level responses by zzso the behavior of a cell zzso We assume that the molecular state of individual cells is independently governed by discrete zzso signaling zzso This results in noisy but highly zzso zzso level responses that are consistent with experimental zzso 

We developed an zzso threshold zzso network simulation zzso to model signal zzso in a single cell, and then used an ensemble of these models to estimate the zzso response across a cell zzso Using published data, we derived a putative zzso network involving growth factors and zzso - zzso zzso Growth zzso zzso zzso like Growth Factor Type 1, and zzso zzso Factor zzso - to describe early signaling events in cell proliferation signal zzso zzso of the modeling technique across ensembles of zzso networks representing cell populations is zzso Furthermore, we compare our simulation results to experimental observations of zzso reported in the zzso 

A systematic analysis of the results following differential stimulation of this model by growth factors and zzso suggests that: zzso using zzso network ensembles with zzso updating provides biologically plausible noisy individual cellular responses with zzso mean behavior for large cell zzso and zzso with sufficient data our model can estimate the response to different zzso of zzso zzso Our results suggest that this approach is both zzso allowing statistical zzso and zzso and zzso allowing modification and revision as guided by experimental zzso The simulation methodology is part of the US zzso zzso zzso which is investigating the effects of everyday zzso on living zzso Future models will incorporate additional zzso surrounding proliferation as well as the putative effects of zzso on these signaling zzso within zzso
