zzso and zzso zzso covering the whole zzso range were studied by zzso transform infrared attenuated total zzso zzso Factor analysis separates the zzso into four principal factor zzso and zzso zzso Those containing negative factors are abstract, but the zzso are zzso A statistical distribution model of the molecules in the solutions rendered the factors zzso From these we define the intermediate species that occur in a zzso zzso ratio of zzso in zzso present principally in the low zzso concentration regions, and in a zzso zzso ratio of zzso in zzso present principally in the higher zzso concentration zzso However, except at the concentration range limits where only pure zzso and pure zzso are present, the four species are present over the whole zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the species indicated very little displacement of the zzso stretch bands, zzso deformation bands, and zzso stretch bands, although there are some small intensity zzso Most of the modifications are observed on the zzso zzso stretch zzso From the gas phase position, a strong zzso shift of 19 zzso of the pure liquid is assigned to zzso zzso In the zzso zzso the shift that decreases to 15 zzso is due to the diminished zzso zzso In the zzso zzso no zzso interaction can exist, and the zzso displacement of 9 zzso is attributed to van der zzso zzso In the one zzso to two zzso zzso no zzso interaction can exist, and the zzso displacement of 9 zzso is attributed to van der zzso zzso From the statistical distribution of the zzso we determine that zzso of zzso and zzso form a random organization with no preferred association or zzso
