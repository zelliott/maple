A complex neural problem must be solved before a voluntary eye movement is triggered away from a stimulus zzso The location code activated by a stimulus must be internally translated into an appropriate signal to direct the eyes into the opposite visual field, while the reflexive tendency to look directly at the stimulus must be zzso No doubt these extra processes contribute to the ubiquitous slowing of zzso However, there is no consensus on the cognitive mechanisms that contribute to the zzso zzso Visual attention is closely associated with the generation of zzso eye movements and it has been shown that attention will track an illusion of line zzso A series of experiments combined this illusion with a zzso eye movement that was zzso zzso directed zzso or zzso with zzso direct away zzso a peripheral zzso zzso 1 showed that zzso zzso had faster reaction times than zzso zzso In contrast, zzso 2 and 3 demonstrated that, with zzso line motion, zzso zzso now had faster reaction times than zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that an zzso phenomenon can accelerate the processing of an zzso relative to a zzso zzso
