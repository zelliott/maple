zzso of the zzso zone zzso of the external zzso zzso zzso zzso during delivery, can promote the development of zzso zzso Recently developed zzso allow high-resolution detection of zzso signals from the zzso The analysis of pelvic floor muscles by surface zzso (in particular, the zzso of the location of the zzso has potential applications in the diagnosis and investigation of the mechanisms of zzso An automatic method (based on matched filter zzso for the zzso of the zzso distribution of zzso from surface zzso is discussed and tested using an zzso model of generation of zzso signals from zzso zzso zzso are performed varying length of the zzso thickness of the zzso position of the motor units, and force zzso Different zzso of zzso are zzso The performance of the proposed method in the zzso of the zzso distribution is affected by surface zzso zzso (as the zzso made by visual zzso by zzso thickness zzso decreases when zzso length is zzso and by different zzso zzso However, in general the method is able to identify the position of two zzso locations and can measure asymmetry of the zzso zzso This strengthens the potential applications of high density surface zzso in the prevention and investigation of zzso
