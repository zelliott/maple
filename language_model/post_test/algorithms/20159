To determine clinical, zzso features, management and outcomes of patients presenting zzso zzso zzso complicating zzso zzso zzso and demonstrate the impact of zzso zzso on morbidity and mortality of these zzso 

We have analyzed clinical, zzso zzso aspects, therapies and outcomes of patients with zzso zzso occurring during zzso and we compared these data with those of patients presenting zzso without zzso zzso zzso in the same period in the zzso department of the University Hospital of zzso from January 2006 to January zzso 

Above 56 cases of zzso zzso 16 patients had an zzso zzso Mean age was 33 zzso 11 years with a clear male predominance in the group zzso with zzso versus zzso without zzso Heart failure was noted in all patients in zzso zzso group, and was more severe in this group compared to zzso zzso and staphylococcus predominated with no significant difference between the two zzso zzso zzso coupled with zzso zzso made the diagnosis of zzso zzso witch was isolated in 11 cases and associated with other complications in five zzso In terms of zzso zzso zzso was more frequent in the group with zzso zzso versus zzso zzso There was not a significant difference between the two groups for the others zzso Surgery associated with a double zzso therapy was the standard treatment with a variable delay for surgery of four days to four zzso Hospital mortality in the acute phase was higher in zzso zzso group zzso versus zzso zzso The evolution of survivors at six months was zzso 

zzso zzso complicating zzso is associated with a high morbidity and mortality in spite of modern approach as well as on medical or surgical zzso It requires therefore a strict monitoring of patients with zzso zzso
