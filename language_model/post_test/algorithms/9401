To zzso compare maximum intensity projection zzso and volume rendering zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso data for the detection of small zzso zzso 

This institutional review zzso prospective study included 20 zzso patients zzso women and 12 zzso mean age, 56 years zzso 16 zzso zzso who underwent clinically indicated zzso zzso zzso CT and provided informed zzso zzso thin zzso of the chest zzso 7 zzso reconstruction zzso zzso zzso were created by using zzso and zzso techniques to reconstruct CT data zzso 16 zzso zzso zzso and were reviewed in interactive zzso zzso zzso zzso and maximum reading time per examination and per zzso was zzso Three zzso digitally zzso all zzso seen in a way that clearly determined their zzso The maximum number of zzso detected by the three observers and confirmed by consensus served as the reference zzso zzso statistics were zzso with P zzso zzso indicating a significant zzso The zzso zzso signed rank test and confidence intervals for differences between methods were used to compare the sensitivities of the two zzso 

zzso performed significantly better than zzso with regard to both detection rate zzso zzso zzso and reporting time zzso zzso zzso The superiority of zzso was significant for all three observers and for zzso smaller than 11 zzso in diameter and was pronounced for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso achieved with zzso ranged from zzso to zzso depending on zzso zzso 

zzso is the superior reading method compared with zzso for the detection of small solid zzso zzso
