In this study, we evaluated the performance of an zzso zzso controller and its ability to automatically develop and zzso stimulation patterns for use in functional zzso stimulation zzso zzso zzso from previous experiments using the pattern zzso zzso zzso controller to generate zzso zzso demonstrated its ability to adjust stimulation patterns to account for recruitment zzso and muscle zzso In this study, the zzso controller was tested under zzso zzso This evaluation required the zzso controller to account for muscle zzso and zzso properties as well as limb zzso The performance of the zzso controller was also compared with that of a zzso zzso feedback zzso The zzso controller is composed of a neural network system that zzso filters a periodic signal to produce a muscle stimulation pattern for generating zzso zzso We used zzso models to determine controller parameters for the zzso and zzso controller that perform well across a variety of musculoskeletal zzso The controllers were then zzso evaluated on both legs of two subjects with spinal zzso zzso zzso indicated that the zzso controller was able to achieve and maintain better tracking performance than the zzso zzso This study indicates that the zzso control system may provide an effective mechanism for automatically customizing stimulation patterns for individuals using zzso zzso
