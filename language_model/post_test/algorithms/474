zzso thickness is thought to play a key role in protein zzso Thus understanding the cell's ability to zzso the thickness of its zzso is essential in zzso the zzso relationship in biological zzso We have investigated the influence of cholesterol on the structure of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso using oriented zzso and small angle zzso zzso zzso contrast variation was used to determine the structure factors and the distribution of water across the zzso We found that in response to cholesterol, zzso thickness changed in a similar fashion in both zzso The zzso of zzso was rationalized in terms of zzso ordering effect on the zzso zzso zzso which dominates over the other option of zzso the zzso zzso surprisingly even in the case of zzso and zzso
