In this work, we introduce in the first part new developments in Principal zzso Analysis zzso and in the second part a new method to select variables zzso in our zzso Our focus is on problems where the values taken by each variable do not all have the same importance and where the data may be contaminated with noise and contain zzso as is the case with zzso zzso The usual zzso is not appropriate to deal with this kind of zzso In this context, we propose the use of a new correlation zzso as an alternative to zzso This leads to a so-called weighted zzso zzso In order to illustrate the features of our zzso and compare it with the usual zzso we consider the problem of analyzing gene expression data zzso In the second part of this work, we propose a new zzso zzso to zzso select the most important genes in a zzso data zzso We show that this zzso produces better results when our zzso is used instead of the usual zzso Furthermore, by using Support zzso zzso we show that it can compete with the zzso Analysis of zzso zzso
