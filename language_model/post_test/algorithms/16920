How does a folding protein negotiate a vast, featureless zzso landscape and adopt its native structure in biological real time? zzso by this search problem, we developed a novel zzso to compare protein zzso zzso to identify structural zzso are typically conducted in three-dimensional zzso the zzso structure of a target protein is matched against each candidate in a database of structures, and goodness of fit is evaluated by a zzso measure, such as the zzso distance between target and zzso This is an expensive approach because three-dimensional space is zzso Here, we transform the problem into a simpler one-dimensional zzso Specifically, we identify and label the 11 most populated zzso zzso in a database of high-resolution protein zzso Using this zzso zzso any zzso three-dimensional structure can be transformed into a one-dimensional string by mapping each zzso onto its corresponding zzso zzso between the zzso basin strings can then be evaluated by conventional zzso zzso The disorder zzso order folding transition is abridged on both zzso At the zzso folding conditions zzso formation of zzso scaffold elements on which proteins are zzso severely restricting the magnitude of accessible zzso zzso Near the end, chain zzso is established prior to emergence of the zzso native zzso At this latter stage of zzso the chain remains zzso and zzso populate natural zzso that are zzso by the 11 zzso derived zzso In essence, our zzso reduces the zzso search problem to mapping the zzso acid sequence onto a restricted basin zzso
