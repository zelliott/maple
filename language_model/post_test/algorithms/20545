In this paper a zzso method for analyzing mixed discrete and continuous zzso models is zzso We focus on marginal zzso models, that is, models in which the marginal expectation of the response zzso is related to zzso by known link zzso The proposed model is based on an extension of the general location model of zzso and Tate zzso zzso of zzso Statistics 32, zzso and can accommodate missing zzso When there are no missing data, our particular choice of zzso yields maximum likelihood estimates of the marginal mean parameters that are robust to zzso of the association between the zzso This zzso property does not, in general, hold for the case of incomplete zzso There are a number of potential benefits of a zzso approach over separate analyses of the distinct zzso First, a zzso analysis can exploit the correlation structure of the response zzso to address zzso zzso zzso Second, zzso test statistics allow for control over the inflation of the type I error that results when separate analyses of the distinct responses are performed without accounting for multiple zzso Third, it is generally possible to obtain more precise zzso estimates by accounting for the association between the zzso Finally, separate analyses of the distinct responses may be difficult to interpret when there is zzso because different sets of individuals contribute to each zzso Furthermore, separate analyses can introduce bias when the missing responses are missing at random zzso A zzso analysis can circumvent both of these zzso The proposed methods are applied to two biomedical zzso
