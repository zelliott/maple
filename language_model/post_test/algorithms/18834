In our previous study, zzso process of water into a zzso zzso film, zzso zzso zzso was monitored by zzso in zzso attenuated total reflection infrared zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso 23, zzso zzso In the present study, noisy and heavily overlapped zzso stretching zzso bands of zzso water have been analyzed from the series zzso where the spectral shapes change zzso with zzso In spite of these zzso a powerful spectral analysis technique, zzso curve resolution zzso by means of alternating least squares zzso yielded smooth and meaningful pure component zzso and detailed kinetic zzso profiles of each zzso excluding zzso zzso smoothing techniques and zzso curve fitting would not achieve these significant zzso The zzso of the kinetic parameters such as zzso zzso and relaxation time zzso zzso is significant for the systematic development of zzso materials and also for revealing the mechanisms of zzso of a zzso Moreover, the ratios of zzso of each component at zzso corresponded well to the values obtained by zzso et zzso measured by zzso zzso This study is the first to report the detailed concentration profile of each water component whose zzso zzso is discussed zzso
