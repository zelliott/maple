The zzso profile of samples contaminated with zzso and zzso compounds allows identifying sources of zzso This article studies the statistical methods of zzso profile analysis reported in the literature with respect to the reliability of obtained zzso The performance of customary analysis methods regarding raw data transformation and applied zzso zzso zzso zzso values is zzso In particular, the method of principal component analysis and zzso cluster is taken as an example and examined in zzso zzso for occurring inconsistencies such as the dependence of results on raw data transformation and the disregard of measurement uncertainty are zzso and it is shown that they also explain inconsistencies in other methods of cluster analysis such as zzso cluster analysis and neural zzso It is concluded that these methods cannot be employed to reach zzso decisions, zzso decisions which meet court evidentiary zzso An alternative approach to analyzing zzso profiles based on mathematical statistics is briefly zzso allowing reliable, zzso zzso
