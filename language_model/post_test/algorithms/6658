We formulate a theory of zzso models in which agents compete to be in a winning zzso The agents may be part of a network or not, and the winning group may be a minority group or zzso An important feature of the present zzso is its focus on the zzso pattern of strategy rankings, and its careful treatment of the strategy ties which arise during the system's zzso zzso We apply it to the minority game with connected zzso Expressions for the mean success rate among the agents and for the mean success rate for agents with k neighbors are zzso We also use the theory to estimate the value of connectivity p above which the zzso system with high resource levels makes the transition into the zzso zzso
