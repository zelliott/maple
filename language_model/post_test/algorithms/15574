zzso The critical role of zzso zzso in the clinical exposure of many pharmaceuticals and toxins has become widely zzso The zzso influence can often be more significant than that of other well-known zzso zzso zzso in both breadth and zzso The zzso of zzso therefore, has often been examined by testing a compound for its influence on the zzso transport of some marker zzso often the compound is also evaluated for its active zzso zzso by zzso zzso Although a zzso for a zzso zzso zzso is logically presumed to be an inhibitor of that zzso toward an alternate zzso that is not necessarily the case with a zzso active zzso zzso A zzso that is ejected from the zzso side of the membrane zzso that does not rapidly cross the membrane by passive diffusion back into the cell interior will not zzso the zzso binding zzso zzso some zzso may not significantly affect the overall zzso function of causing a concentration zzso by efficient net zzso A wide variety of compounds that are documented as zzso of zzso are characterized here as having no effect on the ability of zzso to transport several conventional zzso marker zzso zzso zzso passive diffusion apparently dictates the ability of a zzso zzso to be an zzso as described zzso based on relative rates of transport zzso zzso versus passive zzso and the interaction of zzso compounds with the cell zzso zzso The portion of zzso zzso whose disposition is dependent on zzso function and which are not also zzso is zzso It is therefore important to characterize both the zzso rate parameters and those of zzso zzso This report zzso a valuable list of known zzso zzso that are zzso
