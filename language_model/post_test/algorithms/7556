In this paper, we present a new approach for human action recognition based on zzso selection and zzso zzso in video frames are described by the proposed extensive zzso features zzso which include the zzso zzso and zzso zzso These features are able to zzso the orientation, intensity, and zzso information and therefore provide an zzso representation of human zzso Due to the fact that not all poses in a sequence are zzso and zzso we further zzso the zzso zzso to learn a subset of zzso zzso Given the zzso poses for each video zzso a new zzso named weighted local zzso zzso nearest neighbor is proposed for the final action zzso which is demonstrated to be more accurate and robust than other zzso zzso support zzso machine zzso and zzso zzso nearest zzso The proposed method is systematically evaluated on the zzso data set, the Weizmann data set, the zzso zzso data set, and the challenging zzso data zzso Experimental results manifest that our method zzso the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of recognition zzso
