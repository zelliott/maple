The zzso time zzso test once designed by Dr zzso to investigate patients with zzso zzso was later adapted and standardized by means of the international zzso ratio zzso to monitor patients on treatment with vitamin K zzso zzso After more than 70 years from its introduction it is now time to think about its zzso for those very patients for whom it was intended at the beginning of its zzso Two studies carried out independently and published recently in the same issue of a specialized journal do exploit the very same idea on how to accomplish this zzso Both of them confirm previous anecdotal observations that the zzso as devised for patients on zzso zzso is not valid to harmonize zzso results for patients with chronic liver zzso This fact, that at first sight may appear academic, has important consequences because the zzso zzso is used to construct the model for zzso liver disease zzso scores, which is widely used to prioritize patients for liver zzso The two studies further demonstrate that an alternative zzso model, modified from that recommended by the World Health Organization for patients on zzso may be feasible also for patients with chronic liver zzso This alternative zzso model, which calls for the substitution of zzso from patients on zzso with those from patients with chronic liver disease, may be highly beneficial to harmonize the calculation of the zzso score, with important implications for the zzso of patients for liver zzso
