zzso zzso imaging is still widely used zzso zzso of zzso images with images from zzso zzso such as CT, or with other zzso images would be zzso Here, we present and evaluate a method for such an zzso using zzso transmission images acquired with the zzso images and zzso of the zzso CT zzso This method permits determination of which CT slice zzso to a particular row of zzso in the zzso image and which column of zzso in that CT slice zzso to a particular zzso in the zzso zzso 

A method based on zzso of the correlation zzso previously used for zzso zzso was modified to permit zzso zzso zzso transmission zzso were obtained using a zzso zzso flood source in conjunction with zzso zzso zzso The CT data were first zzso to permit the zzso zzso The registration method was evaluated for its accuracy and zzso 

For phantom data, the registration errors were zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso degrees for zzso For patient data, the errors were zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso degrees for zzso An examination of the need for zzso of the zzso data (to compensate for the different zzso energies used in the respective zzso zzso showed no significant impact on registration zzso When 5 different regions of interest were used for the correlation zzso zzso the mean errors attributable to zzso choice alone were zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso degrees for zzso 

In almost all instances, zzso registration errors were kept to zzso levels zzso size, zzso zzso and zzso errors to 1 degrees or zzso The 1 exception was in the easily zzso case of zzso zzso of the patient of 2 degrees or zzso The modified registration method provides a simple yet reliable way to provide zzso evaluation of zzso zzso zzso
