The purpose of the study was to develop a new three-dimensional model using force, time and displacement to characterize the zzso behavior of zzso zzso zzso time zzso displacement converted to zzso - zzso according to zzso zzso and force presented as pressure zzso were used to plot a zzso A twisted plane was fitted to this three-dimensional zzso This plane was characterized by three parameters zzso the slope over time called zzso zzso zzso the slope over pressure called zzso zzso and zzso the angle of rotation called zzso elastic zzso These parameters were used to characterize the zzso behavior of the well-known materials zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cellulose zzso and zzso zzso at different zzso zzso It could be shown that zzso elastic and plastic zzso properties could be very well distinguished and zzso Further on, it could be shown whether these properties were due to pressure or zzso Thus this model has the prevailing advantage to characterize zzso materials in one step according to time and pressure and it is a useful tool to develop tablet zzso or new zzso
