We propose a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso for various images that is based on human attention and semantic region zzso As zzso image zzso is beyond current computer vision techniques, the proposed method segments an image into regions, which are then merged as a semantic zzso At the same time, an attention window zzso is created based on the zzso map and zzso points from an zzso Within the zzso a support zzso machine is used to select the salient regions, which are then clustered into the zzso using the proposed region zzso Unlike other zzso the proposed method allows multiple zzso to be segmented according to the zzso zzso
