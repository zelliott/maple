The objective of this study was to examine the zzso of the distribution of zzso zzso in the rat zzso After an intravenous infusion of 15 zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso profiles of the plasma levels of zzso declined in a zzso zzso Moment analysis indicated that the clearance and zzso volume of distribution for zzso were not statistically different with the dose, indicating that the zzso for zzso is linear in the range zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso in the plasma and the brain revealed that the linear zzso into and out from the brain reasonably described the data and that the zzso for influx into and zzso from the brain were zzso Transport zzso for zzso across zzso zzso an in zzso model of the zzso barrier, were also comparable for influx and zzso and were independent of the medium zzso The concentration of zzso in zzso fluid was negligible compared with that found in zzso indicating that the drug is not primarily distributed to the brain via the zzso fluid zzso These observations indicate that zzso is transported from the systemic circulation to the brain via the zzso barrier by linear zzso
