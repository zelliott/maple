In bearing zzso using a zzso modeling approach, a concern is the need for data from all possible scenarios to build a practical model for all operating zzso This paper is a study on bearing zzso with the concurrent occurrence of multiple zzso zzso The authors are not aware of any work in the literature that studies this practical zzso A strategy based on zzso zzso class zzso is proposed to improve fault zzso accuracy while reducing the number of scenarios for data collection, by predicting concurrent defects from training data of normal and single zzso The proposed zzso diagnostic approach is evaluated with empirical analysis using support zzso machine zzso and zzso decision tree, two popular zzso zzso frequently applied to system health zzso and zzso zzso features are extracted from the time domain and the frequency zzso zzso performance of the proposed strategy is compared with that of a simple zzso zzso as well as that of random guess and worst-case zzso We have verified the potential of the proposed zzso diagnostic strategy in performance improvements for zzso diagnosis and predictions of zzso plus zzso concurrent defects using two zzso zzso data zzso
