zzso zzso zzso implemented in a single zzso gate array zzso chip which overcome the difficulties found in other zzso zzso are proposed in this zzso zzso is placed on the construction of two delay lines with a good delay consistency, as well as a minimum delay difference by which the measurement resolution can be improved and measurement error can be zzso A modified zzso delay line structure is introduced which abandoned special delay elements and directly used zzso internal zzso resources to generate the cell zzso To get a good consistency for the system, manual placement and manual zzso are used to zzso the zzso The resolution of the system is 9 zzso and the standard zzso is less than 1 least significant bit zzso within the whole measurement zzso The corrected differential zzso is as low as zzso zzso zzso showed that the proposed system features high zzso low cost, and high zzso
