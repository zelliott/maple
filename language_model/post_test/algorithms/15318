Although zzso zzso zzso are highly important in various biological processes and pharmaceutical developments, general prediction of zzso structures is still far from zzso Because zzso have significantly different zzso properties from soluble zzso current protein structure prediction tools for soluble proteins may not work well for zzso With the increasing number of experimental zzso structures available, zzso methods have the potential to become broadly zzso for zzso structure zzso However, the current fold recognition methods for zzso are not as well developed as they are for soluble zzso 

We developed a novel zzso Fold zzso method, zzso to recognize zzso folds based on zzso zzso zzso The method zzso zzso features in alignment together with sequence profile and zzso zzso It also incorporates a gap penalty that depends on predicted zzso structure zzso Given the difference between zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso parameters of scoring functions are trained respectively for these two protein categories using 58 zzso and 17 zzso in a zzso training zzso 

We compared our method with zzso a leading alignment tool using a zzso testing zzso including 72 zzso and 30 zzso Our method achieved zzso and zzso better zzso than zzso in zzso and zzso zzso The raw score generated by zzso is zzso correlated with the structure similarity between the target and the template, which indicates its effectiveness for fold zzso The result demonstrates zzso provides an effective zzso fold recognition and alignment zzso
