zzso regulations and the provision of plant health certificates still rely mainly on long and zzso zzso methods of diagnosis, which are frequently zzso zzso methods of detection can circumvent many of the limitations of currently used screening methods, allowing a fast and accurate monitoring of zzso The zzso zzso includes 13 zzso zzso organisms for which improved methods of diagnosis are zzso In this work, we propose 21 new zzso molecular zzso within zzso coding for zzso protein zzso useful for zzso methods of identification of zzso The specificity of these markers was assessed by a dot zzso zzso array using 23 zzso species, mostly soil dwelling and/or zzso for the same host zzso In addition, the validation of these markers on 15 zzso zzso suggested zzso zzso patterns, which allowed discrimination among the different zzso zzso Having in mind that zzso methods of diagnosis are particularly hampered for zzso species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for which comparative zzso tools to search for DNA signatures are not yet zzso emphasis was given to the selection of zzso markers able to identify zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to avoid inconsistencies due to zzso interpretation of dot zzso data, an zzso zzso was developed to analyze automatically the dot zzso zzso Ultimately, the proposed markers and the dot zzso platform, coupled with automatic data zzso have the potential to foster a thorough monitoring of zzso zzso
