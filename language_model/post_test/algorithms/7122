Multiple sequence alignment zzso generally constitutes the foundation of many zzso studies involving functional, zzso and evolutionary relationship analysis between zzso As a result of the exponential zzso complexity of the exact approach to producing optimal multiple zzso the majority of state-of-the-art zzso zzso are designed based on the progressive alignment zzso In this chapter, we outline zzso a zzso zzso zzso for protein sequences based on progressive zzso To achieve high alignment zzso this zzso employs a hybrid combination of a pair hidden zzso model and a partition function to calculate zzso zzso Furthermore, we provide some practical advice on the usage of the zzso
