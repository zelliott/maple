zzso predictions of in zzso zzso interactions zzso resulting from zzso zzso are commonly made based upon the inhibitor concentration at the zzso active site zzso and the in zzso zzso constant zzso Previous studies have involved the use of various plasma inhibitor zzso as surrogates for zzso along with zzso values obtained from published zzso Although this approach has resulted in a high proportion of successful predictions, a number of falsely predicted interactions are also zzso 

To focus on three issues that may influence the zzso value of the zzso ratio approach: zzso the use of zzso zzso zzso values generated from zzso in zzso experiments compared with literature values; zzso the selection of an appropriate zzso and zzso incorporation of the impact of zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To this end we have selected eight zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and 18 victim drugs from a previous database analysis to allow prediction of 45 clinical zzso zzso 

In zzso kinetic and zzso studies were performed in human liver zzso using zzso probe zzso of zzso and zzso with various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso estimates obtained were corrected for zzso zzso zzso and the zzso was incorporated into in zzso predictions using various zzso zzso zzso for zzso were based upon in zzso data obtained from a previous publication within our laboratory, and an assessment of the impact of the interaction in the gut wall is zzso zzso were validated against 45 in zzso studies and those within zzso of the in zzso ratio of area under the plasma zzso curve of the zzso in the presence and absence of the inhibitor zzso were considered zzso 

zzso based upon the average systemic total plasma drug concentration zzso zzso the effects of parallel drug elimination zzso and the zzso value resulted in zzso of studies predicted to within zzso of the in zzso zzso This represents a zzso improvement in prediction accuracy compared with predictions based upon total zzso values obtained from various published literature zzso A corresponding reduction in bias and an increase in precision were also observed compared with the use of other zzso surrogates zzso the total and new zzso maximum zzso input plasma zzso No significant improvement in prediction accuracy was observed by incorporating consideration of gut wall zzso for zzso 

zzso predictions based upon the use of zzso data obtained under a set of optimal zzso conditions were significantly improved compared with predictions using in zzso data collated from various zzso The use of zzso as the zzso surrogate generated the most successful predictions as judged by several zzso zzso of either plasma protein binding of inhibitor or gut wall zzso zzso did not result in a general improvement of zzso zzso
