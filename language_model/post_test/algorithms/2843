During zzso bypass zzso monitor alarms are routinely zzso Failure to reactivate these alarms after zzso may jeopardize patient zzso We have produced an electronic reminder that automatically alerts clinicians to reactivate alarms after zzso and have evaluated the alarm zzso rate after its zzso 

We developed and implemented an zzso that identifies separation from zzso by the return of zzso flow and of mechanical zzso and checks alarm status zzso disabled or zzso If alarms have not been zzso after separation from zzso an electronic reminder zzso Data were collected during three time zzso Stage I zzso zzso period before zzso of the electronic zzso Stage II zzso zzso zzso Stage zzso zzso after a single educational zzso meeting, at the end of Stage zzso zzso of proper alarm zzso and the number of electronic reminders per patient were compared among zzso 

The rate of alarm zzso at baseline zzso I) was zzso increased to zzso zzso zzso and again to zzso during Stage III zzso zzso zzso The spontaneous alarm zzso rate before the appearance of the electronic reminder on the zzso information management system screen increased from zzso at Stage II to zzso at stage III zzso zzso zzso 

zzso an automatic electronic reminder significantly increased the rate of alarm zzso after separation from zzso zzso computerized zzso tools can be developed within zzso information management system and may be useful for improving safety during zzso
