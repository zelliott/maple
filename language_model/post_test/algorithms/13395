The zzso detection and zzso processes constitute the first stages of a greater process, zzso zzso zzso feature zzso Their accuracy is a prerequisite to a satisfactory performance of the P and T wave zzso and also to the reliability of the heart rate zzso zzso This work presents an innovative approach of zzso detection and zzso and the detailed results of the proposed zzso based on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso threshold and an approach of surface zzso The method combines the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso techniques, avoiding the whole zzso signal zzso After each zzso zzso the zzso of an indicator related to the area covered by the zzso complex envelope provides the detection of the zzso onset and zzso The zzso detection proposed technique is evaluated based on the well-known zzso zzso and zzso databases, obtaining the average sensitivity of zzso and the positive predictability of zzso for the first database, and zzso and zzso respectively, for the second zzso The zzso zzso approach is evaluated on the zzso zzso database with the average zzso errors of zzso and zzso for zzso onset and zzso zzso Those results demonstrate the accuracy of the developed zzso for a wide variety of zzso zzso and the adaptation of the zzso parameters to the existing zzso zzso variations within a single zzso
