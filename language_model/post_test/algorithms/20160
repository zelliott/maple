Patients with zzso arthritis zzso are at increased risk of mortality compared with the general zzso Evidence suggests that this increased mortality can largely be attributed to increased cardiovascular zzso zzso In a prospective study, 34 patients with zzso were compared with zzso and zzso zzso 

We found a lower zzso zzso A1 and B in patients with zzso However, zzso and zzso were significantly higher than control zzso The zzso thickness was significantly higher in patients with zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso 

Increased attention to cardiovascular risk in zzso will be necessary to reduce the excess zzso mortality and morbidity in zzso zzso It appears that the excess risk that is observed in the zzso population can be explained, in part, by promotion of zzso disease through increased systemic inflammation associated with zzso
