A novel technique for zzso the distribution of the zzso zzso of peripheral nerve fibers is described in this zzso In order to overcome the sensitivity of present methods to noisy data, a zzso zzso method with a smoothing constraint and a zzso of zzso zzso was zzso The simulation results demonstrated that the improved technique maybe applied in clinical diagnosis because it yielded reliable and almost zzso results even when the simulated data are severely contaminated by zzso
