One of the most useful applications of virtual reality is to let doctors view the inside of the human body zzso and in real zzso In this paper, we first survey the area of virtual reality and zzso zzso We discuss our ray casting zzso for viewing the medical data which is available as a set of slices from zzso and CT zzso Next we present a new method, the zzso algorithm, for zzso zzso from volume zzso A simple zzso of our technique is zzso Since the zzso of the extracted surface is well defined and zzso the zzso zzso eliminates a major problem of surface extraction zzso In addition, the number of polygons representing the surface can be controlled to obtain a finer zzso Therefore real-time interaction is feasible on both low-end and high-end graphics machines, making the zzso zzso suitable for virtual reality zzso
