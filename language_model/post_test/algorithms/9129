We study zzso electrical zzso networks, the smallest example of which consists of a zzso zzso an zzso and a zzso driven by a pure tone zzso By allowing the network zzso to be that of any connected zzso such circuits zzso zzso discrete zzso transmission zzso that have proven useful in zzso analog zzso For such networks, we develop two zzso to zzso the zzso response when a subset of zzso are driven at the same fixed zzso The zzso we devise are orders of magnitude more accurate and efficient than stepping towards the zzso using a standard zzso zzso We seek to enhance a given network's zzso behavior by altering the zzso of the graph zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso We develop a zzso method that zzso for the network zzso such that the graph zzso achieves a desired set of zzso this method enables one to move the zzso while keeping the network zzso zzso Running zzso experiments using three different random graph models, we show that shrinking the gap between the graph zzso first two zzso dramatically improves a network's ability to zzso transfer energy to higher zzso and zzso generate zzso zzso Our results shed light on the relationship between a network's structure, zzso by the graph zzso and its function, defined in this case by the presence of strongly zzso effects in the frequency zzso
