zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is widely used in the field of medical imaging for zzso Inspired by zzso directional zzso zzso methods, directional zzso zzso zzso was implemented to generate more CB projections by zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso space and directional zzso A new zzso was subsequently reconstructed with the zzso zzso using both the original and zzso CB zzso The proposed method was evaluated on both phantom and clinical data, and image quality was assessed by correlation ratio zzso between the zzso image and a gold standard obtained from full measured zzso Additionally, streak artifact reduction and image blur were zzso In a zzso reconstructed by 40 acquired projections over an arc of 360 degree, streak artifacts dropped zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso when our method was compared to linear zzso zzso and zzso zzso Meanwhile, image blur was assessed by a zzso zzso where image blur of zzso was zzso and zzso less than zzso and zzso When our method was compared to zzso and zzso methods, zzso increased by zzso and zzso zzso artifacts of sparsely acquired zzso were decreased by our method and image blur induced by zzso was constrained to below other zzso zzso
