A zzso monitor capable of zzso accurate detection of clinical zzso within the operating room could improve management of bleeding after zzso bypass zzso The zzso Signature zzso is a zzso that measures global zzso in whole zzso The authors hypothesized that zzso zzso could detect a clinical zzso state in cardiac surgical zzso 

zzso adult patients scheduled for a variety of zzso cardiac surgical procedures were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso bleeding were all managed by standardized zzso Clinical zzso was defined by the need for zzso or fresh frozen plasma zzso The zzso Signature zzso zzso zzso formation zzso zzso measured zzso zzso in zzso The activated zzso time, zzso count, zzso time, activated partial zzso time, and zzso concentration were also zzso 

The zzso zzso was greater in patients who required zzso zzso than in those who did not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso values were highly correlated with zzso and fresh frozen plasma zzso zzso r zzso zzso P zzso zzso and r zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso operator characteristic zzso showed a highly significant relation between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and fresh frozen plasma zzso zzso under the curve, zzso P zzso zzso with zzso sensitivity, zzso positive and negative zzso values at zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso was independently zzso of zzso zzso zzso but standard zzso zzso were zzso 

The zzso Signature zzso zzso detects a clinical zzso state after zzso and is independently zzso of the need for zzso zzso zzso has potential utility for monitoring zzso in cardiac zzso
