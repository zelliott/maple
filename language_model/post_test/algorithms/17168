An zzso model, zzso key state variables in zzso is zzso for control of zzso zzso zzso zzso The state estimates are produced by balances and zzso expressions combined with zzso zzso The goal of the control strategy is to maintain the highest possible zzso flux that can be entirely zzso assimilated by the cells, resulting in the highest possible zzso growth without formation of zzso products, such as zzso acid and zzso zzso improvement of the control zzso is carried out in order to find a strategy to avoid zzso irreversible zzso zzso In the final algorithm, such zzso changes in metabolism are predicted from an estimate of zzso storage zzso A considerable decrease in the estimate indicates future zzso changes at a time early enough to avoid zzso At zzso yield, a growth rate near the highest possible is obtained in zzso zzso zzso zzso with the control strategy zzso
