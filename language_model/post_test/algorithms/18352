An zzso is developed for the zzso of the plasma concentration time curve for a drug administration regime involving fast injection zzso and/or continuous zzso The effect of the zzso model zzso variations on the plasma concentration time curve is analyzed and efficient zzso for the zzso of the zzso zzso variation and confidence bounds of the plasma concentration time curve are also zzso The application of the method is illustrated with zzso data for the zzso
