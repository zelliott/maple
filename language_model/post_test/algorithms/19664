For many electroencephalogram zzso zzso zzso zzso a tedious and time-consuming training process is needed to set zzso In zzso Competition 2005, reducing the training process was explicitly proposed as a zzso Furthermore, an effective zzso system needs to be zzso to dynamic variations of brain zzso that is, its parameters need to be adjusted zzso In this article, we introduce an extended expectation zzso zzso algorithm, where the extraction and zzso of common spatial pattern zzso features are performed jointly and zzso In each zzso the training data set is updated using all or part of the test data and the labels predicted in the previous zzso Based on the updated training data set, the zzso features are zzso and classified using a standard zzso zzso Since the training data set is updated zzso the initial training data set can be small zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso During the above zzso the parameters of the zzso zzso and the zzso transformation zzso are also updated zzso In online situations, we can still run the training process to adjust the system parameters using zzso data while a subject is using the zzso zzso The effectiveness of the zzso depends on the zzso of zzso feature to noise and iteration zzso which are discussed in this zzso Our proposed approach has been applied to data set zzso of zzso Competition zzso The data analysis results show that we can obtain satisfying prediction accuracy using our zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso The convergence of the zzso and zzso of zzso feature are also demonstrated in our data zzso
