zzso plays an important evolutionary role in several groups of zzso A zzso approach to detect zzso zzso sequencing multiple zzso across the zzso of a group of species of interest, reconstructing their gene trees, and taking their differences as indicators of zzso However, methods that follow this approach mostly ignore population effects, such as incomplete lineage sorting zzso Given that zzso occurs between closely related organisms, zzso may very well be at play and, zzso must be accounted for in the analysis zzso To address this issue, we present a zzso criterion for reconciling gene trees within the branches of a zzso network, and a local search zzso for zzso zzso networks from collections of zzso zzso under this zzso This framework enables zzso analyses while accounting for both zzso and zzso Further, we propose two techniques for incorporating information about uncertainty in zzso zzso Our simulation studies demonstrate the good performance of our framework in terms of identifying the location of zzso events, as well as zzso the proportions of genes that underwent zzso Also, our framework shows good performance in terms of efficiency on handling large data sets in our zzso Further, in zzso a zzso data set, we demonstrate issues that arise when zzso real data zzso Although a zzso approach was recently introduced for this problem, and although zzso zzso have accuracy issues under certain settings, our zzso framework provides a much more zzso efficient technique for this type of zzso Our framework now allows for zzso scans for zzso while also accounting for zzso
