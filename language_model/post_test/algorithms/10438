zzso of zzso and zzso with zzso was investigated using various zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso studies revealed that both the compounds bind zzso zzso The binding of zzso was about one order of magnitude higher than that of zzso zzso binding of the former was also zzso from zzso zzso data, quantum efficiency values and circular zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso experiments suggested that the binding of both compounds was predominantly zzso driven with a smaller but favorable zzso term that increased with zzso A large favorable zzso contribution to the binding of zzso to zzso was revealed from salt dependence data and the dissection of the free energy zzso The zzso component to the free energy change for zzso interaction was smaller than that of zzso This was also zzso from the slope of log K versus zzso zzso Both compounds enhanced the zzso stability of zzso The small heat capacity changes of zzso and zzso zzso K, respectively, observed for zzso and zzso and the observed zzso compensation phenomenon confirmed the involvement of multiple weak zzso zzso zzso aspects of the interaction have been zzso 

This study presents the structural and energetic aspects of the binding of zzso and zzso to zzso
