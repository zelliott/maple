The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using zzso zzso for zzso imaging zzso of the zzso 

zzso abdominal imaging was performed in 9 healthy volunteers and 3 patients using both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We compared zzso zzso in zzso liver and pancreatic zzso and performed qualitative comparisons of the zzso images and zzso maps provided by these 2 zzso 

zzso significantly improved image quality zzso zzso zzso with reduced geometric distortion and zzso The zzso values of zzso and abdominal zzso measured by zzso were generally greater than those measured by zzso zzso The zzso values measured by both zzso techniques were significantly different for liver zzso but not for pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patient studies demonstrated clearly distinguished zzso areas from surrounding normal liver zzso in the zzso zzso zzso offers the potential for high-resolution zzso of the zzso 

The zzso zzso sequence is a promising technique for zzso of abdominal zzso Future clinical studies will evaluate the use of zzso technique for abdominal zzso imaging zzso
