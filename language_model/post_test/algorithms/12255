The flat zzso volume zzso zzso zzso is a new CT device zzso for zzso three-dimensional evaluation of teeth at a resolution of about 150 zzso in the high contrast zzso The aim of this study was to investigate whether zzso was suitable for zzso of the volumes of dental hard zzso and the root canal system to establish a new method for zzso zzso zzso extracted third zzso zzso 31, zzso zzso were examined with a zzso of an zzso using a zzso zzso at different levels according to the zzso density of zzso and zzso zzso of the root canal system was performed after zzso growing zzso starting from a zzso in the zzso of the root canal, this zzso searches zzso of same density in the zzso The zzso of the root canal system was stopped by the investigator at the zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso and root canal system could be well distinguished in three-dimensional zzso zzso yielded the following data zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso root canal system zzso and total volume zzso In conclusion, the zzso is appropriate for zzso zzso of large numbers of teeth in experimental laboratory zzso
