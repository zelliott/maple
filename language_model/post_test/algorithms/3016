To determine whether longer stays of premature infants allowing for increased physical maturity result in subsequent zzso cost savings that help counterbalance increased zzso zzso 

One thousand four hundred and two premature infants born in the Northern California Kaiser zzso Medical Care Program between 1998 and zzso 

Using zzso matching with a zzso propensity score we matched zzso zzso babies to zzso zzso babies zzso similar at the time the earlier baby was sent home but who were discharged on average 3 days later) and assessed subsequent costs and clinical zzso 

Late babies accrued zzso costs after the Early baby was already home, yet costs after discharge through 6 months were virtually identical across groups, as were clinical zzso Overall, after the Early baby went home, the zzso cost difference was zzso zzso A sensitivity analysis suggests our conclusions would not easily be altered by failure to match on some zzso zzso 

In a large integrated health care system, if a baby is ready for discharge (as defined by the typical zzso staying longer increased zzso costs but did not reduce zzso costs nor improve zzso clinical zzso
