Gene networks have been predicted using the expression profiles from zzso experiments that include multiple samples representing each of several classes or states zzso treatments, zzso zzso health zzso A framework that zzso zzso networks, mixture of gene zzso models and zzso is proposed to further mine information from the variation of samples within and across classes and enhance the understanding of gene zzso The approach was evaluated on two independent pathways using data from two zzso zzso Our zzso succeeded on reconstructing the zzso of the gene pathways when zzso against empirical reports and zzso data zzso The majority or all the samples within a class shared the same zzso model and were classified within the corresponding zzso Our approach uncovered both gene relationships and profiles that are unique to a particular class or shared across zzso
