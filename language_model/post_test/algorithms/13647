Diabetes is a type of disease in which the body fails to regulate the amount of zzso necessary for the zzso It does not allow the body to produce or properly use zzso Diabetes has widespread zzso with a large people affected by it in zzso In this zzso we demonstrate that a fuzzy zzso zzso zzso of diabetes disease with an acceptable zzso is zzso The accuracy of the zzso is measured by the number of correctly recognized diabetes record while its complexity is measured by the number of fuzzy rules zzso Experimental results show that the proposed fuzzy zzso can achieve a good zzso between the accuracy and zzso Also the basic structure of the fuzzy rules which were automatically extracted from the zzso zzso learning database shows strong similarities to the rules applied by human zzso zzso are compared to other approaches in the zzso The proposed approach gives more zzso zzso and accurate zzso
