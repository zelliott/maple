The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcome of the diabetic foot reconstructed with the zzso thigh zzso zzso 

This study reviews 71 cases of salvaged diabetic foot over a zzso zzso Patients ranged in age from 33 to 72 years zzso 51 zzso with an average follow-up of 11 zzso 

zzso survived in all but one reconstructed case, resulting in zzso findings compared with zzso free tissue transfer of zzso zzso Early complications such as delayed healing with minor wound zzso were seen in three cases, and partial zzso necrosis was seen in four zzso Patients with chronic infections were controlled without zzso During the zzso 69 patients achieved full weight bearing, acceptable zzso and quality of gait before diabetic foot zzso However, late complications such as recurrence of zzso was noted in one patient, who was blind and unable to perform daily inspection of the zzso 

The zzso thigh zzso zzso provides zzso tissue that controls infection, a thin zzso that provides zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a skin paddle that resists pressure and improves zzso The zzso can also be combined with zzso zzso muscle to increase bulk and blood supply against large dead spaces and chronic zzso zzso thigh zzso zzso can be used to achieve acceptable function and aesthetic results for diabetic foot zzso
