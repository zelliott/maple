The zzso ability of artificial neural networks zzso is greatly dependent on their zzso zzso zzso provide an attractive automatic way of determining a zzso ANN architecture for a given zzso Several such zzso have been proposed in the literature and shown their zzso This paper presents a new constructive zzso zzso in automatically determining ANN zzso Unlike most previous studies on determining ANN zzso zzso puts emphasis on architectural adaptation and functional adaptation in its architecture determination zzso It uses a constructive approach to determine the number of hidden layers in an ANN and of zzso in each hidden zzso To achieve functional adaptation, zzso trains hidden zzso in the ANN by using different training sets that were created by employing a similar concept used in the boosting zzso The purpose of using different training sets is to encourage hidden zzso to learn different parts or aspects of the training data so that the ANN can learn the whole training data in a better zzso In this paper, the convergence and zzso issues of zzso are zzso zzso The zzso complexity of zzso is found to be zzso zzso zzso where W is the number of weights in the zzso zzso is the number of training examples, and zzso is the number of training zzso This complexity has the same order as what the zzso learning zzso requires for training a fixed ANN zzso A set of eight zzso and two approximation benchmark problems was used to evaluate the performance of zzso The experimental results show that zzso can produce ANN zzso with fewer hidden zzso and better zzso ability compared to existing constructive and zzso zzso
