The zzso zzso provides useful global zzso assessment of the cardiac activity, but has limited spatial zzso The zzso zzso zzso an improvement over the zzso provides high zzso distributed information about cardiac electrical zzso We designed and developed zzso zzso concentric ring zzso active sensors based on the finite element zzso zzso zzso zzso The active sensors were used in an array of 6 by 12 zzso locations to record bipolar and zzso zzso from the body surface over the zzso zzso Compared to bipolar zzso zzso zzso showed significantly higher spatial selectivity which may be helpful in zzso information about cardiac zzso detected on the body zzso In this study the moment of zzso zzso an indicator of a zzso wave passing below the active sensors, was used to zzso possible timing information of the cardiac electrical zzso below the active zzso recording zzso The zzso on the body surface was used to generate zzso maps that may some day be used by clinicians in diagnosing zzso and assessing the efficacy of zzso
