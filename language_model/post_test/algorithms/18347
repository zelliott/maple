We have developed two zzso that construct a simultaneous functional order in a collection of neural elements using purely functional zzso The input of the first zzso is a zzso describing the total of zzso of signals carried by the members of the neural zzso The second zzso proceeds from a zzso describing a primitive inclusion relation among the members of the neural collection that can be determined from zzso in their signal zzso From this information both zzso zzso a partial functional order in the collection of neural zzso Such an order has an objective existence for the system itself and not only for an external zzso By either merging individual zzso or recruiting previously unspecified ones the partial order is locally transformed into a lattice zzso Thus, the simultaneous functional order in a nervous net may become zzso with a geometrical order if the system has enough internal zzso zzso experiments were done, both for the zzso and the zzso zzso to study the number of individuals in the resulting lattice order as a function of the number of individuals in the underlying partially ordered zzso
