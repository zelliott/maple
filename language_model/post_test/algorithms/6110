Image zzso systems commonly operate by transforming the input signal into a new representation whose elements are independently zzso The success of such a system depends on two properties of the zzso First, the coding rate is minimized only if the elements of the representation are statistically zzso Second, the perceived coding distortion is minimized only if the errors in a reconstructed image arising from zzso of the different elements of the representation are zzso zzso We argue that linear zzso cannot achieve either of these goals and zzso instead, an zzso zzso image representation in which each zzso of a linear transform is divided by a weighted sum of zzso zzso in a generalized zzso We then show that the divisive operation greatly reduces both the statistical and the zzso zzso amongst representation zzso We develop an efficient method of zzso this zzso and we demonstrate through simulations that the dual reduction in dependency can greatly improve the visual quality of compressed zzso
