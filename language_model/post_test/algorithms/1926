To evaluate the effectiveness of the zzso decomposition of water and fat with echo zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso into the zzso zzso in myeloma patients without visible focal zzso 

The zzso spine was examined with 3 T zzso in 24 patients with multiple myeloma and in 26 zzso The zzso fraction was calculated as the mean value from three zzso zzso A post hoc test was used to compare the zzso fraction in controls and patients with zzso zzso of zzso significance zzso zzso myeloma or symptomatic zzso zzso were considered significant at zzso The zzso fraction and zzso ratio were entered into the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were significantly lower in patients with symptomatic zzso zzso zzso zzso than in the other three zzso zzso analysis showed that 22 of the 24 patients zzso were correctly classified into symptomatic or zzso myeloma zzso 

Fat zzso using the zzso sequence in zzso was significantly different when comparing patients with symptomatic myeloma and those with zzso zzso The zzso fraction and zzso ratio facilitated discrimination of symptomatic myeloma from zzso myeloma in patients without focal bone zzso 

zzso A new magnetic resonance technique zzso offers new insights in multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso were lower in patients with symptomatic zzso than in those with zzso zzso zzso The zzso ratio also aided discrimination of symptomatic zzso zzso The zzso fraction may provide information about the myeloma cell zzso
