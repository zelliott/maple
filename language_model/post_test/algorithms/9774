zzso complexes, zzso multiple gene products, perform all sorts of fundamental biological functions in zzso Much effort has been put into identifying protein complexes using zzso zzso A vast majority attempt to research densely connected regions in zzso interaction zzso zzso In this research, we try an zzso approach to analyze protein complexes using hybrid features and present a method to determine whether multiple (more than zzso proteins from zzso can form a protein zzso The data set consists of 493 positive protein complexes and zzso negative protein zzso Every complex is represented by graph features, where proteins in the complex form a graph zzso of zzso and features derived from biological properties including protein zzso zzso properties and zzso zzso These features are filtered and zzso by Minimum zzso zzso zzso method, zzso Feature zzso and Forward Feature zzso established through a zzso model called zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso test is employed to evaluate the identification zzso As a result, the highest accuracy for the identification of the real protein complexes using filtered features is zzso and feature analysis shows that, among the adopted features, graph features play the main roles in the determination of protein zzso
