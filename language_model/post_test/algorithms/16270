The hypothesis tested was that processing, zzso and zzso techniques can modify the zzso measured deformation of a zzso 

zzso zzso zzso of a zzso were zzso following light zzso at 430 and 180 zzso zzso Thirty zzso zzso zzso discs were prepared and a reference surface produced by zzso zzso were zzso zzso particle air zzso and zzso zzso evaluation was performed following each zzso or zzso operative technique using a contact diamond stylus zzso zzso zzso strength of the zzso discs, light zzso at 430 and 180 zzso zzso zzso A and B), and the zzso discs zzso zzso was zzso Data were zzso by a one-way analysis of zzso with post hoc zzso tests zzso or repeat measure analyses when zzso 

zzso (at zzso for 40 zzso resulted in a significant reduction zzso in the zzso mean zzso as did zzso particle zzso zzso zzso coating significantly increased the mean zzso for Groups A and B zzso specimens against the zzso zzso zzso no significant impact of increasing time or zzso intensity on the mean zzso was zzso The mean zzso zzso strength was significantly increased zzso after zzso zzso A and zzso when compared with Group C specimens although no difference between Groups A and B specimens zzso was zzso 

The results of the zzso technique in combination with the strength supported a strengthening mechanism sensitive to shrinkage stress generation associated with the zzso of zzso
