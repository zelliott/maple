Because of surveillance strategies in patients with known Barrett's zzso more patients with high-grade zzso or early cancer in the zzso esophagus and at the zzso junction are zzso The need for and extent of zzso in such patients are zzso The technique of zzso zzso zzso dissection zzso to diagnose early zzso spread is applied increasingly in tumors of the gastrointestinal zzso The poorly defined zzso drainage of the zzso junction has so far prevented many investigators from performing zzso in tumors of this zzso zzso We report the first results of zzso in Barrett's and zzso zzso The preliminary experience indicates that the method is, even in this anatomical area, feasible and yields good results in early zzso In advanced tumors, the method lacks zzso zzso should be done with blue dye and a zzso The concept of zzso zzso zzso mapping and detection thus may open the door to individualized therapy for patients with high-grade zzso in a Barrett's esophagus or with early Barrett's and zzso zzso
