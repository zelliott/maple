Because every spike of a zzso is determined by input signals, a train of spikes may contain information about the dynamics of zzso zzso A zzso method based on the leaky zzso model, describing zzso transformation from input signals to a spike train has been proposed for tracking input parameters represented by their mean and fluctuation zzso In the present paper, we propose to make the zzso more realistic by adopting an zzso model zzso with an zzso moving zzso Moreover, because the direct zzso method is zzso zzso for a data set zzso thousands of zzso we further develop a practical method for transforming instantaneous firing characteristics back to input zzso The instantaneous firing zzso represented by the firing rate and zzso zzso can be estimated using a zzso feasible zzso We applied our proposed methods to synthetic data to clarify that they perform zzso
