Modern zzso evolved by modification of pre-existing zzso It is extremely important to comparative biology that related proteins be identified as members of the same zzso group, since a characterized putative zzso could be used to find clues about the function of zzso proteins from the same zzso Typically, databases of related proteins focus on those from zzso zzso Unfortunately, relatively few organisms have had their zzso fully zzso zzso many proteins are ignored by the currently available databases of zzso zzso despite the high amount of important genes that are functionally described only for these incomplete zzso 

We have developed a method to cluster zzso proteins from multiple organisms beginning with only one zzso through connectivity zzso with that zzso zzso We show that the generated clusters are in agreement with some other approaches based on full zzso zzso 

The method produced results that are as reliable as those produced by conventional zzso zzso zzso clusters based only on individual proteins of interest is less time consuming than generating clusters for whole zzso
