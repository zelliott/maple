Continuous zzso monitoring by zzso devices may lead to clarification of the zzso of zzso clarification of the origin of zzso chest pain, and zzso or preventative application of established zzso zzso Although zzso monitoring zzso are available for surface zzso the zzso demand of zzso for zzso devices must be minimized for considerations of device zzso The new zzso first locates a zzso point zzso at the dominant peak of each zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso at 2 zzso delays after zzso zzso zzso + 96 zzso and zzso + 152 zzso at 60 zzso with respect to the zzso level zzso at the minimum slope preceding the zzso is then zzso The following features are also zzso by simple operations: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and noise content during the zzso zzso zzso in these features relative to their zzso normal ranges are used to reject noisy or zzso beats and sudden zzso zzso Finally, the zzso zzso over time is filtered to reject rates of change that are not likely attributable to human zzso Performance of the zzso was evaluated on the European Society of zzso zzso zzso which contains 180 hours of ambulatory zzso with 250 zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and positive zzso was zzso zzso zzso This performance is statistically equivalent to that of published zzso zzso that were validated on the same zzso Estimates of zzso burden suggest that the zzso could process two channels of zzso continuously for more than 5 years with current implanted device zzso In conclusion, we have developed an zzso for zzso monitoring that can be implemented in current zzso devices with sensitivity and positive zzso that are comparable with the zzso
