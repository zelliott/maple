We report a newly developed analysis zzso for optical zzso zzso zzso that makes a retinal zzso analysis with calculation of the average thickness of retinal layers zzso The aim of the study was to examine specific patterns of retinal layer pathology as a potential marker of zzso in Parkinson's disease zzso progressive zzso zzso zzso and multiple system zzso zzso zzso domain zzso with a semiautomatic zzso to calculate the average thickness of single retinal layers was applied to zzso scans of 65 zzso 16 zzso and 12 zzso patients as well as 41 matched zzso zzso and clinical data were collected for correlation zzso Only zzso and zzso showed a significant reduction of retinal layers in comparison to zzso In zzso there were no significant findings in single retinal layer zzso Most zzso the zzso of the outer nuclear layer in zzso and the outer zzso layer in zzso was highly specific for these disease entities and allowed zzso zzso from zzso with high sensitivity and zzso With this analysis zzso of zzso data, zzso retinal layer changes could be zzso Despite a general tendency to whole retinal and single retinal layer thinning that may reflect zzso in all zzso zzso the specific findings in zzso and zzso may serve as a highly sensitive and specific differential diagnostic tool and as a progression marker in these disease zzso zzso studies with a zzso setting will have to prove this zzso
