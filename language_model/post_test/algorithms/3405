An zzso has been written which automatically selects a left zzso region of interest on zzso zzso zzso It accomplishes a zzso search from the geometric center of the zzso On each of the 30 profiles, the local maximum of the 1st zzso is selected as the zzso zzso The zzso has been tested in 40 patients at stress and zzso In ten patients, conventional zzso images were obtained in three zzso In 30 patients conventional short axis zzso images were obtained after reconstruction of 32 projections acquired over 180 zzso The rate of success is zzso for both imaging zzso This procedure is another step towards fully automated assessment of zzso defects and zzso
