Recent advances in large-scale zzso sequencing have led to the rapid zzso of zzso acid sequences of proteins whose functions are zzso Since the functions of these proteins are closely correlated with their zzso zzso many efforts have been made to develop a variety of methods for predicting protein zzso zzso In this study, based on the strategy by zzso the functional domain composition and the zzso acid composition zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso Algorithm zzso zzso was developed for predicting the protein zzso zzso As a zzso the same plant and zzso protein zzso as investigated by the previous investigators were used for zzso The overall success rate by the zzso test for the plant protein zzso was zzso and that for the zzso protein zzso zzso These are so far the highest success rates achieved for the two zzso by following a rigorous cross validation test zzso further confirming that such a hybrid approach may become a very useful zzso tool in the area of zzso zzso as well as molecular cell zzso
