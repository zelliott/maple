zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) has proposed that zzso zzso functions in zzso and V2 may form zzso critical part of the selective detection of compound stimuli over their zzso and that zzso zzso functions allow even greater conjunction zzso Here, we argue that zzso and zzso zzso functions cannot be exploited by conjunction detectors in the way that zzso zzso First, the advantage of these functions only applies to zzso with components of lower contrast than the equivalent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso most types of conjunction do not have this zzso Second, in many experiments, conjunction and zzso components have identical contrast, sampling the zzso function at a single point, so the zzso shape is zzso Third, zzso considered only zzso zzso whereas contrasts in natural scenes are low, corresponding to a zzso zzso expansive zzso we show that, for naturally occurring zzso zzso plaid detector would generally respond more zzso to zzso than to zzso We also reassess zzso claim that zzso zzso functions are zzso for contrast zzso we argue that zzso improves contrast coding, and that the zzso of zzso levels reflects varying zzso between contrast coding and coding of other zzso
