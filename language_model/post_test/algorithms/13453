For groundwater conservation and management, it is important to accurately assess groundwater pollution zzso This study proposed an integrated model using zzso zzso and a genetic zzso zzso to effectively select the major zzso parameters influencing groundwater pollution vulnerability in an zzso The zzso zzso method determined that depth to water, net zzso topography, and the impact of zzso zone media were the zzso parameters that influenced zzso pollution vulnerability in a Korean zzso When using these selected zzso zzso the accuracy was improved for various statistical zzso and artificial intelligence zzso techniques, such as zzso zzso regression, decision trees, artificial neural networks, and zzso zzso These results provide a proof of concept that the zzso zzso is effective at determining influential zzso parameters for the pollution vulnerability of an zzso and in turn, improves the zzso performance in assessing groundwater pollution zzso
