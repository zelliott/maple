De zzso assembly is a commonly used application of next-generation sequencing zzso The ultimate goal is to puzzle millions of reads into one complete zzso although draft zzso usually result in a number of gapped scaffold zzso In this paper we propose an automated strategy, called zzso to reliably close gaps within scaffolds using paired zzso The method shows good results on both bacterial and zzso zzso allowing only few zzso As a consequence, the amount of additional zzso work needed to close a zzso is drastically zzso The software is available at zzso
