The relationship between fabric (a measure of structural zzso and elastic properties of zzso bone was examined by zzso zzso and homogenization theory on the basis of zzso resonance images from the zzso zzso in specimens (N zzso 30) and human subjects (N zzso zzso acquired at a 160 zzso 160 zzso 160 zzso zzso zzso The fabric zzso was mapped in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cubic zzso by a three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso (three Young's and three zzso zzso were derived from linear zzso element simulations of three-dimensional zzso bone volume zzso zzso In the zzso data, zzso fit power laws of bone volume fraction zzso zzso zzso for all three test directions and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso linear relationships were found for the in zzso data because of a zzso range in bone zzso zzso When pooling the data for all test directions and zzso bone zzso volume predicted elastic zzso less well in the specimens zzso zzso zzso zzso and not at all in zzso A model of bone zzso volume and fabric was highly zzso of zzso zzso Young's zzso mean zzso s of zzso and zzso (in zzso The results show that zzso an important predictor of bone mechanical properties, can be assessed in the limited resolution and zzso ratio regime of zzso resonance zzso
