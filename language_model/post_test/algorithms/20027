There are a vast number of biology related research problems involving a combination of multiple sources of data to achieve a better understanding of the underlying zzso It is important to select and interpret the most important information from these zzso Thus it will be beneficial to have a good zzso to simultaneously extract rules and select features for better interpretation of the zzso zzso We propose an efficient algorithm, Combined Rule zzso and Feature zzso zzso based on zzso zzso random zzso zzso simultaneously extracts a small number of rules generated by random forests and selects important zzso We applied zzso to several drug activity prediction and zzso data zzso zzso is capable of producing performance comparable with state-of-the-art prediction zzso using a small number of decision zzso Some of the decision rules are biologically zzso
