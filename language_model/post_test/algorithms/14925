We describe an zzso process specially designed for regional zzso of zzso tumors in order to achieve desired zzso temperature zzso A zzso three-dimensional heat transfer model based on zzso blood zzso is applied to predict the zzso Using zzso implicit methods in time and zzso zzso finite elements in space, we are able to integrate efficiently the zzso zzso heat equation with high zzso zzso heating is obtained by minimizing an integral objective function which measures the distance between desired and model predicted zzso A sequence of zzso is calculated from successively improved zzso zzso models employing a zzso Newton method in an inner zzso We compare temperature zzso for two individual patients calculated on coarse and fine spatial zzso and present zzso results of zzso for a zzso 60 zzso of the zzso 2000 zzso zzso
