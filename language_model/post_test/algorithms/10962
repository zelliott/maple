The role of zzso zzso in affecting the property of visual cells is investigated by means of an original mathematical model of cortical zzso in zzso The model represents a compromise between zzso simplicity and zzso zzso The model incorporates four different zzso into a cortical zzso zzso input from the lateral zzso nucleus, according to an even zzso zzso short-range zzso confined within the zzso a long-range zzso which emphasizes the properties of the zzso and a long-range zzso In the model we assume that all cells receive a similar zzso zzso which differs simply according to its position in the zzso and orientation zzso zzso were performed, with different zzso values, to assess the main characteristics of cell response zzso the zzso and locations of zzso in the receptive field zzso orientation tuning curve, and response to drifting and zzso zzso as a function of the strength and extension of zzso zzso zzso zzso suggest that, if zzso zzso is confined within the zzso the cells exhibit the same properties as simple cells, both with regards to the zzso and shape of the zzso orientation tuning curve, and response to drifting and zzso zzso By contrast, if zzso zzso extend beyond the zzso with sufficient strength, the cells exhibit the typical characteristics of complex zzso A progressive shift from complex to simple cells can be realized with a zzso variation in zzso zzso are also performed with a zzso model, to suggest possible experiments able to discriminate the present zzso mechanism from the classical zzso zzso zzso support the assumptions of previous simpler models zzso et zzso zzso and may help to understand and assess the role of zzso zzso in rigorous quantitative zzso
