Support zzso machine modeling has become increasingly popular in zzso Recently, several advanced support zzso machine applications have been reported including, among others, zzso learning for zzso zzso Here, we introduce another support zzso machine approach to add compound potency information to similarity searching and enrich database selection sets with potent zzso For this purpose, we introduce a zzso kernel function and a zzso support zzso machine linear combination zzso Using fingerprint zzso zzso support zzso machine searching has been successfully applied to four zzso screening data sets, and different support zzso machine strategies have been zzso For zzso compound reference sets, zzso support zzso machine searching meets or exceeds recall rates of standard support zzso machine calculations but detects many more potent zzso
