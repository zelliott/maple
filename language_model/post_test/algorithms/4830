The shotgun approach has gained considerable zzso in recent years as a dominant strategy in zzso We observed a dramatic increase of specific protein spots in two-dimensional zzso zzso gels of the zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso appearance, a characteristic stage during embryonic development of zzso which is involved with temperature increase by zzso zzso We employed shotgun liquid zzso tandem mass zzso zzso technology to zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso at this zzso A total of zzso proteins were identified with an in-house zzso zzso zzso of them had zzso point zzso values distributed theoretically in the range zzso zzso and approximately zzso of them had molecular weights of zzso zzso Furthermore, 111 proteins had an zzso greater than 10 and were difficult to separate by zzso Many important functional proteins related to embryonic development, stress response, DNA zzso cell growth, proliferation and zzso zzso and reproduction were zzso Among them proteins related to nervous system development were zzso All known heat shock proteins zzso were detected in this zzso stage of zzso zzso zzso In addition, Gene zzso zzso and zzso Encyclopedia of Genes and zzso zzso zzso analysis showed energetic metabolism at this zzso These results were expected to provide more information for zzso monitoring of the insect zzso and better understanding of the zzso expression of genes during embryonic zzso zzso
