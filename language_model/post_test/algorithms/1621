To define selection criteria for pelvic zzso zzso dissection zzso based on a contemporary Australian cohort of men with clinically zzso prostate cancer undergoing radical zzso zzso with zzso as stage migration of prostate cancer has led to zzso of the role of zzso at the time of zzso 

In all, 200 consecutive men treated by one surgeon between 2000 and 2005 with open zzso and zzso The clinical and pathological data were extracted by retrospective chart zzso zzso between clinical zzso and zzso zzso were assessed by zzso zzso zzso 

Overall, there were zzso zzso were in 10 zzso zzso The zzso zzso rate was significantly associated with biopsy zzso score, zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration and percentage of positive zzso zzso with respective odds ratios zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Trend toward significant association with clinical stage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On zzso analysis, zzso concentration and biopsy zzso score were significant zzso of zzso zzso All 10 men with zzso zzso came from a high-risk group of 96, identifiable by having at least one of the zzso stage zzso zzso biopsy zzso score zzso zzso zzso concentration of zzso 10 zzso or zzso of zzso zzso 

The risk of zzso zzso depends upon zzso clinical risk factors of stage, biopsy zzso score, zzso concentration and zzso The present data suggests a simple zzso method, using these risk factors, of identifying men to have zzso at the time of zzso
