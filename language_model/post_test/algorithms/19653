Recent developments in the generation and characterization of genetically engineered mouse models of human cancer have resulted in notable improvements in these models as platforms for zzso target validation and experimental zzso In this review, we zzso the criteria used to assess the accuracy of various models with respect to human disease and provide some examples of their zzso and therapeutic utility, focusing on models for zzso that affect the largest zzso zzso zzso that allow greater exploitation of genetically engineered mouse models, such as zzso interference in zzso are described in the context of target and drug zzso Finally, this review discusses stratagems for, and obstacles to, the application of these models in the drug development zzso
