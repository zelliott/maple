zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared by the zzso zzso The in zzso degradation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in PBS zzso zzso at 37 degrees C was zzso The particle size, molecular weight of the zzso and the amount of zzso and zzso acids formed were followed in zzso zzso zzso gradually zzso over a period of 2 years and retain their size during that zzso A faster degradation was observed for zzso zzso which was nearly complete after 10 zzso zzso zzso retained their size during that zzso In zzso zzso the zzso bond connecting the zzso and the zzso segments was zzso zzso which led to a relatively fast decrease in molecular weight and to zzso zzso as zzso size zzso were zzso zzso zzso were almost completely zzso within 8 zzso
