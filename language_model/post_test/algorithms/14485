We assess the performance of filtered zzso zzso the simultaneous zzso reconstruction technique zzso and the maximum likelihood zzso zzso for digital breast zzso zzso under variations in key imaging zzso including the number of zzso number of projections, angular range, initial guess, and radiation zzso This is the first study to compare these zzso for the application of zzso We present a methodology for the evaluation of zzso zzso and use it to conduct preliminary experiments investigating zzso between the selected imaging zzso This investigation includes zzso not previously considered in the zzso literature, such as the use of a stationary detector versus a zzso imaging zzso A real breast CT volume serves as a ground truth digital phantom from which to simulate X-ray projections under the various acquisition zzso The reconstructed image quality is measured using zzso zzso namely signal zzso and the zzso of a zzso zzso Observer with zzso basis zzso The task at hand is the detection of a simulated mass inserted into the breast CT zzso We find that the image quality in limited view zzso is highly dependent on the particular acquisition and reconstruction parameters zzso In particular, we draw the following zzso First, we find that zzso the zzso filter design and zzso relaxation zzso yields significant improvements in reconstruction quality from the same projection zzso Second, we show that the convergence rate of the maximum likelihood algorithm, zzso with zzso surrogates and zzso zzso ascent zzso can be greatly accelerated using zzso zzso Third, we find that the optimal initial guess is zzso zzso In particular, we obtained best results with a zero initial guess for zzso and an zzso initial guess for zzso Fourth, when the exposure per view is constant, increasing the total number of views within a given angular range improves the reconstruction quality, albeit with diminishing zzso When the total dose of all views combined is constant, there is a zzso between increased sampling using a larger number of views and increased levels of quantum noise in each zzso zzso we do not observe significant differences when testing various access ordering schemes, presumably due to the limited angular range of zzso zzso we find that adjusting the zzso of the reconstruction can improve image quality, but that this resolution is best adjusted by using zzso zzso rather than by declaring zzso zzso zzso we find that the zzso zzso yields higher image quality than a stationary detector zzso the difference being most outspoken for the zzso zzso Lastly, we find that not all zzso systems found in the literature are currently being run under the best possible system or zzso zzso In other words, the present study demonstrates the critical importance (and zzso of using zzso zzso such as the one presented here to zzso the zzso reconstruction quality from a single scan of the zzso
