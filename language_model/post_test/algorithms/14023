Association rules represent a promising technique to improve heart disease zzso Unfortunately, when association rules are applied on a medical data set, they produce an extremely large number of zzso Most of such rules are medically irrelevant and the time required to find them can be zzso A more important issue is that, in general, association rules are zzso on the entire data set without validation on an independent zzso To solve these limitations, we introduce an zzso that uses search constraints to reduce the number of rules, searches for association rules on a training set, and finally zzso them on an independent test zzso The medical significance of discovered rules is evaluated with support, confidence, and zzso Association rules are applied on a real data set containing medical records of patients with heart zzso In medical terms, association rules relate heart zzso zzso and risk factors to the degree of disease in four specific zzso Search constraints and test set validation significantly reduce the number of association rules and produce a set of rules with high zzso zzso We exhibit important rules with high confidence, high lift, or both, that remain valid on the test set on several zzso These rules represent valuable medical zzso
