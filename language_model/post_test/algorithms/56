The choice of the zzso zzso has a profound effect on the solution of zzso inverse problems such as optical zzso We review 11 different methods for selecting the zzso zzso zzso that have been described previously in the zzso We test them on two trial problems, zzso and optical topography, and conclude that the zzso method is the method of choice, though in particularly zzso problems, generalized zzso may provide an zzso
