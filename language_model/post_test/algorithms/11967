zzso zzso gene identification in the zzso sequence of zzso zzso was obtained using zzso gene zzso and zzso programs that have zzso parameters for human, zzso plants, zzso and zzso We did not use information about zzso in most predictions to model a real situation for finding new genes because information about complete zzso is often absent or based on very small partial zzso We investigated the accuracy of gene prediction on different levels and designed several schemes to predict an zzso set of genes zzso zzso a set of reliable zzso zzso zzso and the most complete set of zzso zzso zzso For 49 zzso protein products of which have clear zzso in protein databases, predictions were zzso by zzso zzso The first zzso serves as the optimal zzso description of new sequence to be presented in a zzso Reliable zzso from the second zzso serve as good candidates for selecting the zzso zzso for experimental work for gene structure zzso Our results shows that we can identify approximately zzso of coding zzso with zzso false zzso At the zzso level we accurately predicted zzso of zzso and zzso including overlapping zzso with zzso false zzso zzso accuracy of zzso we designed a gene identification scheme using zzso which provided sensitivity zzso zzso zzso and specificity zzso zzso zzso at the base level, zzso zzso zzso zzso including overlapping zzso and zzso zzso zzso at the zzso level and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at the gene level zzso sensitivity on zzso set and specificity on zzso zzso In general, these results showed that zzso gene prediction can be a reliable tool for zzso new zzso zzso giving accurate information on zzso of coding sequences with zzso false zzso However, exact gene prediction (especially at the gene zzso needs additional improvement using gene prediction zzso The program was also tested for predicting genes of human zzso 22 (the last zzso of zzso can analyze the whole zzso zzso This analysis has demonstrated that the zzso of manually zzso zzso in zzso 22 were among the zzso zzso predicted zzso The suite of gene identification programs is available through the zzso server of zzso zzso Group at zzso zzso
