The beam orientation zzso zzso problem in intensity modulated radiation therapy zzso treatment planning is a zzso problem, and existing methods to obtain solutions to the zzso problem are time consuming due to the complex nature of the objective function and size of the solution zzso These issues become even more difficult in total zzso zzso zzso where many more beams must be used to cover a vastly larger treatment area than typical zzso treatments zzso zzso zzso zzso These complications result in excessively long zzso times to develop zzso treatment plans for zzso so we attempt to develop methods that drastically reduce treatment planning zzso We transform the zzso problem into the classical set cover problem zzso and use existing methods to solve SCP to obtain beam zzso Although SCP is zzso our methods obtain beam solutions that result in quality treatments in zzso We compare our approach to an zzso programming solver for the SCP to illustrate the speed advantage of our zzso
