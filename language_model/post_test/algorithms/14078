To compare and evaluate zzso zzso and zzso based zzso zzso zzso zzso techniques in the treatment of zzso zzso 

Ten patients diagnosed with zzso tumors, originally planned for zzso guided zzso to prescribed doses of zzso zzso were zzso for treatment with clinically deliverable zzso zzso All original CT scans, zzso fusion defined target and normal structure zzso and zzso margins were used for zzso zzso zzso zzso based plans zzso one of the following zzso planning zzso zzso or zzso intensity modulated radiation therapy zzso multiple zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso radiation therapy zzso These plans were used as the standard to which the subsequent zzso plans were zzso using the following criteria: prescription zzso to target volume zzso ratios, an zzso index zzso equivalent uniform dose zzso for zzso volumes, mean zzso total doses zzso for critical structures, and size of 10, 20, and 30 zzso zzso zzso 

Use of both zzso based zzso techniques and zzso zzso generated highly zzso treatment zzso zzso plans, which are predominantly zzso in nature, compared to zzso zzso based plans exhibited increased zzso ratios, variable change in II, similar zzso values, and generally comparable zzso values for zzso at zzso When compared to zzso field arrangements, deliverable (as opposed to zzso zzso plans also resulted in zzso increases in low dose zzso zzso All criteria except for the II, which was generally improved with zzso were found to be similar when zzso zzso based plans were compared to zzso zzso zzso 

zzso show a distinct advantage in using zzso beam arrangements for treatment of zzso zzso In the case where disease spreads far zzso limiting the ability to use zzso arrangements, zzso zzso can be used to generate a comparable treatment plan, with potentially superior zzso
