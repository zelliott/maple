We have developed an zzso for automated detection of the dynamic pattern characterizing flashes of zzso in video images of membrane zzso The zzso detects the zzso zzso transient increases and decreases in brightness that result from the zzso of fluorescent dye in zzso zzso or zzso zzso fusing with a zzso zzso The flash is identified in video images by its zzso time zzso and the symmetry of its spatial zzso zzso is implemented by forward and backward zzso of video zzso The zzso groups zzso connected zzso brighter than a zzso threshold into distinct objects in zzso and zzso zzso zzso are classified as either flashes or noise particles by comparing the zzso of matched forward and backward difference profiles and then by tracking each profile in successive difference zzso The number of flashes identified depends on the brightness zzso the size of the zzso kernel used to filter the image, and the time difference between the zzso video zzso When these parameters are changed so that the zzso identifies an increasing percentage of the flashes recognized by eye, an increasing number of noise objects are zzso identified as zzso These mistaken flashes can be eliminated by a human zzso The zzso considerably shortens the time needed to analyze video zzso Tested extensively with zzso zzso and zzso fusion with zzso zzso our zzso of the zzso accurately determined the rate of fusion of influenza zzso labeled with the zzso dye zzso zzso
