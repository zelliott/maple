zzso Wiener systems consist of two or more linear dynamic zzso whose zzso are transformed by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the linear elements of these systems can be estimated using either a first order zzso zzso or a slice of the second, or higher, order zzso zzso zzso zzso work used a multiple input zzso structure, in which the output of the zzso zzso was then filtered by a linear dynamic zzso In this paper we show that by restricting our study to the slightly simpler Wiener structure, it is possible to improve the linear zzso estimates obtained from the measured zzso zzso Three zzso which taken together can identify any zzso Wiener system, have been zzso We present the theory underlying these zzso and detail their zzso zzso results are then presented which demonstrate that the zzso are robust in the presence of output noise, and provide good estimates of the system dynamics under a wide set of zzso
