Potential areas where zzso zzso zzso zzso could be used are second- and zzso treatment planning in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso radiation therapy, single fraction zzso treatment and for the treatment of patients with metal zzso A feasibility study was done on using zzso cone beam CT zzso images generated by proprietary zzso reconstruction software based on the zzso zzso for zzso treatment zzso The reconstructed images were converted to a zzso file zzso The zzso values of zzso cone beam zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso to those of zzso CT for use with a treatment planning zzso A zzso phantom was designed and developed for zzso of geometric accuracy and CT number zzso The distance measured between two marker points on the zzso image and the physical dimension on the phantom were in good zzso Point dose zzso for a 10 zzso zzso 10 zzso beam at a zzso angle of 0 degrees and zzso of 100 zzso were performed for a 6 zzso beam for both zzso and zzso zzso zzso The point doses were found to vary between zzso of the dose calculated from the zzso CT zzso The zzso zzso for 6 zzso for both zzso CT and zzso zzso images were within zzso and 3 zzso zzso A plan with three beams was performed on zzso zzso simulating a treatment plan for cancer of the zzso The distribution obtained was compared with those corresponding to that obtained using the zzso zzso This study has shown that treatment planning with zzso cone beam CT images is zzso
