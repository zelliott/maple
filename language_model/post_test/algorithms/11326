zzso cartilage plays an important role in the function of zzso zzso zzso methods have been used to study the zzso mechanics of cartilage, and zzso has been one of the most widely used commercial software packages for this zzso A newly developed zzso finite element zzso zzso has been developed specifically for zzso zzso The aim of this study was to undertake a direct comparison between zzso and zzso for some practical contact problems involving zzso Three model types, representing a porous zzso zzso test, a zzso zzso test, and a conceptual natural joint contact model, were zzso In addition, a zzso sensitivity study was also performed for the zzso zzso test to investigate the effects of changes in the input material properties on the model zzso using both zzso and zzso Excellent agreement was found between zzso and zzso for all of the model types and across the range of material properties that were zzso
