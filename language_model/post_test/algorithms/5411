The zzso solutions of the fundamental equation of the zzso zzso zzso are derived in two cases, when the dependence of the zzso of the zzso retention zzso upon the volume fraction of organic modifier zzso is a zzso zzso zzso and when a simple linear relationship between zzso and zzso is zzso The derived theoretical expressions for retention times under zzso zzso conditions are embodied to simple zzso for fitting zzso data and especially for resolution zzso Their performance was examined by using a mixture of 16 model compounds chosen among zzso zzso and zzso in zzso systems modified by zzso It was found that the accuracy of the predicted zzso retention times is very satisfactory even if the simple zzso expression for the retention behavior of zzso zzso the linear dependence of zzso upon zzso is zzso
