The quantitative evaluation of brain zzso and zzso particularly the relationship between brain function and oxygen zzso is important for the understanding of normal human brain operation, as well as the zzso of neurological zzso It can also be of great importance for the evaluation of zzso within tumors of the brain and other zzso A fundamental discovery by zzso and zzso of the blood zzso zzso zzso contrast opened up the possibility to use this effect to study brain zzso and zzso properties by means of zzso zzso Such zzso require the development of theoretical models connecting the zzso signal to brain structure and function, and the design of experimental techniques allowing MR zzso to be made of the salient features of theoretical zzso In this review, we discuss several such theoretical models and experimental methods for the zzso of brain zzso and zzso zzso The zzso main focus is on methods for the evaluation of the oxygen extraction fraction zzso based on the measurement of the blood zzso zzso A combination of the measurement of zzso and the cerebral blood flow zzso allows an evaluation to be made of the cerebral zzso rate of oxygen consumption zzso zzso We first consider in detail the magnetic properties of blood - magnetic zzso MR relaxation and theoretical models of the zzso contribution to the MR signal under different experimental zzso We then describe a zzso effect - the influence of zzso magnetic fields, created in the zzso space by zzso zzso blood, on the formation of the MR zzso Further, we describe several experimental techniques taking advantage of these theoretical zzso Some of these techniques - MR zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso - zzso the zzso MR zzso Another technique - quantitative zzso - evaluates zzso by making use of zzso zzso In this review, we target both scientists just entering the MR field and more experienced MR researchers interested in the application of advanced zzso techniques to the study of the brain in health and zzso
