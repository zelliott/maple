The use of a zzso knowledge in the alignment of targeted sequencing data is investigated using zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso to incorporate the zzso position information from the targeted capture, we demonstrate that alignment can be done to just the target region of zzso When in addition use is made of direct string comparison, an improvement of up to a factor of 8 in alignment speed compared to the fastest conventional zzso zzso is zzso This results in a total alignment time in targeted sequencing of around 7 zzso for aligning approximately 56 million captured zzso For conventional zzso such as zzso zzso or zzso alignment to just the target region is not feasible as experiments show that this leads to an additional zzso zzso calls, the vast majority of which are false zzso zzso zzso
