zzso zzso zzso zzso commonly coexist with zzso Recently, zzso have been identified as a possible cause of zzso We developed a zzso zzso animal model using a novel premature pacing zzso to assess zzso and zzso of this zzso and examine the associated zzso zzso 

Thirteen zzso dogs were implanted with a specially programmed zzso capable of simulating zzso zzso Animals were randomly assigned to either 12 weeks of zzso zzso zzso zzso 7) or no zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Continuous 24-hour zzso monitoring zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso versus control, zzso zzso zzso After 12 weeks, only the zzso group had zzso with a significant reduction in left zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso zzso zzso versus control, zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and an increase in left zzso zzso dimension zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus control, zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso effective zzso period showed a trend to prolong in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was resolved within 2 to 4 weeks after zzso of zzso No zzso fibrosis, or changes in zzso and zzso zzso zzso were observed with zzso zzso 

This novel zzso animal model demonstrates that frequent zzso alone can induce a zzso form of zzso in otherwise structurally normal zzso zzso zzso lacks gross zzso and zzso abnormalities seen in other canine models of zzso
