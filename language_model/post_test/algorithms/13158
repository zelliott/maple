zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging can enable the in zzso zzso of zzso of vascular pathology, including high-risk zzso The technique resolves the zzso of zzso administered fluorescent zzso with molecular specificity in the vessel zzso However, the geometrical variations that may occur in the distance between zzso and vessel wall can lead to signal intensity variations and challenge zzso zzso we examined whether the use of anatomical information of the zzso vessel zzso obtained from zzso zzso ultrasound zzso can lead to zzso improvements when zzso and vessel wall distance variations are zzso The zzso developed employs a zzso propagation model derived from phantom experiments that is used to calculate the relative zzso of zzso signals as they are collected over zzso along the vessel wall, and zzso it to restore accurate zzso zzso The findings zzso point to zzso improvements when employing hybrid zzso with possible implications to the clinical detection of high-risk plaques or blood vessel zzso
