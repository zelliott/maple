zzso infants receiving chronic total zzso nutrition zzso due to feeding intolerance develop zzso zzso and reduced zzso zzso Although providing the zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso during chronic zzso improves zzso growth and zzso it is uncertain whether zzso enhances zzso zzso We placed zzso in the carotid artery, jugular and portal zzso zzso and a portal vein flow probe in zzso before providing either zzso formula zzso zzso or a zzso of zzso plus zzso for 6 zzso On zzso day 7, all zzso were fed zzso and zzso functions were evaluated in zzso using dual infusion of zzso zzso and intravenous zzso zzso in zzso by measuring zzso zzso activity and rates of zzso zzso zzso and by assessing the zzso of sodium zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso pigs had larger zzso zzso longer zzso and higher zzso zzso capacity and in zzso net zzso and zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso These zzso were similar in zzso and zzso pigs except for a lower zzso weight and net zzso zzso in zzso compared with zzso zzso The enhanced zzso zzso in zzso compared with zzso pigs corresponded with higher zzso zzso and zzso zzso transport zzso increased abundance of zzso but not zzso and lower zzso metabolism of zzso to zzso Our findings indicate that zzso treatment during chronic zzso maintains zzso structure and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso reduces zzso zzso zzso and may facilitate the transition to zzso feeding in zzso zzso
