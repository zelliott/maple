The zzso paradigm is being increasingly used in the assessment of medical imaging zzso The currently implemented method of analyzing the data, namely zzso zzso zzso analysis, has some validation and zzso zzso The purpose of this work is to address these zzso 

The general principles of zzso evaluation and methodology validation are zzso A model for simulating zzso data was used to test the statistical zzso of several methods of analyzing the zzso The methods differed only in the choice of the figure of merit used to zzso zzso zzso zzso was judged by investigating the behaviors of the methods under zzso hypothesis conditions of no difference between zzso 

The zzso of the different methods of analyzing the data was found to be dependent on the choice of figure of zzso A figure of merit is identified that zzso abnormal images with multiple (one or more) zzso zzso of which could have different clinical zzso zzso This figure of merit is shown to be statistically zzso An extension of the analysis to single reader interpretations of images from different zzso is also shown to be statistically zzso 

With the validated enhancements, zzso is expected to be of greater utility to users of the zzso zzso The extension to zzso interpretations should be of particular value to developers of image processing zzso including developers of zzso diagnosis zzso
