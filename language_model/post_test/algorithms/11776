We present a fast zzso for sequence zzso and searching which works with large sequence zzso It uses a strictly defined similarity zzso The zzso is faster than conventional zzso zzso approaches because its complexity is directly related to the number of zzso shared by the zzso Furthermore, the zzso also works with zzso sequences and large sequences like entire zzso We present a theoretical study of our approach and provide experimental zzso
