This paper introduces the genetic zzso partial least square zzso as a novel zzso feature selection zzso This technique combines genetic zzso zzso as powerful zzso methods with zzso as a robust zzso statistical method for variable zzso This feature selection method is combined with artificial neural network to develop a zzso zzso model for predicting activities of a series of zzso aromatic zzso as zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso Eight simple one- and two-dimensional zzso were selected by zzso and considered as zzso for developing artificial neural networks zzso These parameters represent the role of zzso pair, hydrogen zzso zzso and zzso of the active sites and also the size of the zzso on zzso zzso The accuracy of zzso networks was illustrated by validation techniques of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of this method zzso over the linear one zzso in a previous work and also the zzso in which a linear feature selection method has been used indicates that the zzso approach is a powerful method for the variable selection in zzso zzso
