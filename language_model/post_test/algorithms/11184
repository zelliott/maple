zzso zzso is an zzso small zzso zzso that plays an important role in gene expression through the zzso gene regulation zzso There are many literature works focusing on predicting zzso targets and exploring gene regulatory networks of zzso zzso We suggest, however, the study to identify the interaction between zzso is zzso This paper presents a framework to identify relationships between zzso using joint zzso to investigate the regulatory features of zzso Both the sequence and secondary structure are taken into consideration to make our method more relevant from the biological zzso Further, joint zzso is applied to identify correlated zzso which are more desirable from the perspective of the gene regulatory zzso A data set including zzso zzso and zzso zzso is used in the zzso The results demonstrate that our approach is able to identify known zzso interaction and uncover novel patterns of zzso regulatory zzso
