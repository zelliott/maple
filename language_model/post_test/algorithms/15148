zzso developing next-generation sequencing zzso technologies produce a large amount of data across the whole human zzso and allow a large number of DNA samples to be analyzed zzso zzso zzso fetal DNA zzso obtained from maternal blood using zzso technologies has provided new opportunities for zzso prenatal diagnosis zzso of fetal zzso One of the major challenges to the analysis of fetal abnormalities is the development of accurate and reliable zzso capable of analyzing large numbers of short sequence zzso Several such zzso have recently been zzso Here, we provide a review of recent zzso zzso methods as well as the available zzso for zzso sequence zzso We zzso introduce the practical application of these zzso for the detection of different types of fetal zzso and compare the performance, cost and complexity of each approach for clinical zzso Our review identifies several main technologies and trends in zzso zzso The main considerations for clinical development for zzso and screening tests using DNA sequencing are: zzso intellectual property, cost and the ability to screen for a wide range of zzso abnormalities and genetic zzso The cost of the diagnostic test depends on the sequencing method, diagnostic zzso and volume of the zzso If the cost of sequencing equipment and zzso remains at or around current levels, targeted approaches for zzso zzso testing and zzso methods are zzso
