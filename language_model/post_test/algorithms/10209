We aimed to estimate the scattered radiation from dental metallic crowns during head and neck zzso by irradiating a jaw phantom with external zzso zzso The phantom was composed of a dental metallic plate and zzso embedded in zzso zzso We used zzso film measurement and zzso Carlo simulation to calculate the radiation dose and dose distribution inside the zzso To estimate dose variations in scattered radiation under different clinical situations, we altered the incident energy, field size, plate zzso plate depth and plate zzso The simulation results indicated that the dose at the incident side of the metallic dental plate was approximately zzso of that without the zzso The differences between dose zzso calculated with the radiation zzso system zzso zzso and the data zzso except around the dental metallic plate, were zzso for a 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso we should carefully consider the dose distribution around dental metallic crowns determined by a zzso
