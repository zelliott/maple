Use of internal margins to account for respiratory motion of the target volumes is a common strategy in zzso of mobile zzso Although efficient for tumor coverage, this expansion also risks increased toxicity to nearby healthy zzso and therefore requires a careful selection of appropriate zzso In this study, we demonstrate an zzso of the internal margin used to account for zzso zzso 

zzso zzso treatment plans for phantom zzso target volumes as well as clinical treatment plans of 11 patients were evaluated zzso for optimum internal margin zzso A software-based simulation of zzso motion was performed for all zzso Moreover, the interplay with treatment setup uncertainties and corresponding margins was investigated in the phantom zzso 

zzso internal margins in both phantom and patient studies were found to be substantially smaller than the actual target displacement due to zzso The optimal internal margin was also observed to be approximately independent of the setup zzso Furthermore, no statistically significant dependence on target size and shape was observed in the group of 11 zzso 

These findings present significant implications for treatment planning of mobile targets, such as tumors found in the lung and upper zzso We conclude that the full motion zzso for the internal margin is overly conservative, and zzso of the internal margin provides improved sparing of nearby zzso at risk without sacrificing zzso coverage for the zzso
