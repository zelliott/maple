Many proteins are composed of two or more zzso each associated with different zzso zzso The number and arrangement of zzso forming a protein are referred to as zzso zzso It has been known for long that the functions of proteins are closely related to their zzso zzso In this paper the zzso zzso degree is introduced that can calculate the zzso relation between various zzso expressed the similar or different degree between these zzso We have demonstrated that introduction of the zzso zzso degree can remarkably enhance the success rates in predicting the protein zzso structural zzso It is anticipated that the zzso zzso degree can be also used to predict many other protein zzso such as zzso zzso membrane protein type, zzso functional class, zzso type, zzso type, among many zzso
