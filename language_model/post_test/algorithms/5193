zzso interactions zzso though extremely valuable towards a better understanding of protein functions and cellular zzso do not provide any direct information about the zzso within the proteins that mediate the zzso Most often, it is only a fraction of a protein that directly interacts with its biological zzso Thus, understanding interaction at the domain level is a critical step towards zzso thorough understanding of zzso zzso zzso precise identification of binding zzso zzso acquisition of insights into the causes of deleterious zzso at interaction zzso and zzso most importantly, development of drugs to inhibit pathological protein zzso In addition, knowledge derived from known zzso interactions zzso can be used to understand binding zzso which in turn can help discover unknown zzso 

Here, we describe a novel method called zzso zzso zzso of zzso to narrow down the zzso sites to smaller zzso zzso zzso an initial zzso network from zzso zzso networks, and then expands the zzso network by zzso additional zzso using a zzso zzso zzso guided by Gene zzso zzso information, which identifies zzso zzso zzso in the zzso network and makes them complete zzso zzso by adding zzso Our results indicate that zzso can reliably predict zzso Most importantly, zzso novel network expansion procedure allows prediction of zzso that are otherwise not identifiable by methods that rely only on zzso zzso
