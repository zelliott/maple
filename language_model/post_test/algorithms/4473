zzso errors zzso in PET can cause incorrect zzso of zzso zzso in small zzso An zzso zzso method was evaluated that zzso for zzso without a zzso knowledge of tumor size or zzso 

Volumes of interest zzso were drawn on zzso PET zzso zzso images were produced using an zzso zzso zzso zzso and a local point spread zzso The zzso were projected on the corrected image to estimate the zzso mean activity zzso These corrected mean values were compared with zzso maximum and mean zzso zzso data were generated as a first test of the correction zzso Phantom zzso were made using zzso spheres in a scattering zzso Clinical validation used 154 surrogate tumors from 9 zzso The surrogate tumors were zzso images of the descending zzso as well as zzso and zzso arteries and zzso zzso tumors ranged in diameter from 5 to 25 zzso Analysis used zzso and zzso zzso (both dynamic and zzso zzso representing zzso were derived from imaging the blood pool in large structures zzso the left zzso left atrium, or sections of the zzso where zzso were zzso zzso tumor sizes were measured from contrast zzso 

The zzso technique, when applied to the mean value in zzso zzso yielded recovery zzso of zzso for an zzso sphere and between zzso and zzso for spheres between 13 and 29 zzso For the human studies, zzso data recovered a large fraction of the true activity concentration zzso zzso zzso for an zzso tumor and zzso zzso zzso for tumors between 10 and 24 zzso For tumors smaller than 18 zzso the zzso mean values were less biased zzso than the zzso maximum or mean zzso 

zzso zzso zzso correction generated more accurate zzso zzso in zzso tumors for both zzso and patients than the zzso zzso The method eliminates the requirement for zzso zzso data and zzso tumor zzso size or tumor background zzso This technique applies a zzso correction to the mean zzso value within a zzso yielding a more accurate estimate of zzso than the maximum zzso zzso
