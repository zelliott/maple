We zzso implemented and tested two new methods for irreversible zzso of zzso still zzso brightness error limitation zzso and zzso zzso brightness and contrast error limitation zzso The scan path used to compress the digital images is based on the zzso zzso zzso The zzso methods limit, for each zzso the brightness errors introduced when zzso the original image zzso the difference between the values of corresponding zzso as zzso zzso Additional limitations are imposed to the contrast error observed when considering along the scan path consecutive zzso of both the original and the reconstructed zzso After previous testing on zzso images selected as clinically significant from 35 zzso films, we enlarged our experiment to a set of 38 coronary zzso digitally zzso zzso and zzso methods were experimented according to several values of the implied zzso Up to a zzso ratio of zzso for the zzso method and zzso for the zzso method, no deterioration of the reconstructed images were detected by human zzso After a visual zzso we performed a quantitative zzso The zzso of zzso difference images showed the capability of zzso and zzso for preserving the most significant clinical details of the original zzso For comparison, we applied the zzso zzso photographic experts zzso zzso standard to the same set of zzso In this case, zzso difference images showed a homogeneous distribution of errors on the image zzso zzso zzso results obtained by testing the different methods are comparable, but, unlike zzso zzso and zzso methods allow the user to keep under his direct control the maximum error allowed at each single zzso of the original zzso These different behaviors are confirmed by the values obtained for the considered zzso quality zzso
