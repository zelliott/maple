This paper describes methods for zzso zzso of spatial zzso zzso For stationary and zzso zzso processes it gives zzso zzso of the zzso and the pair correlation function, which are based on zzso zzso The zzso methods are applied in transmission electron zzso analysis of blood zzso in the rat zzso They lead to the result that the zzso show an zzso pattern of their spatial arrangement, with a hard-core distance of about zzso zzso There is a close relationship to three-dimensional size characteristics estimated recently for these elliptical zzso
