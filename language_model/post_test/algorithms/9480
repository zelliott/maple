We propose a novel zzso to adjust zzso insulin dose using sparse blood zzso zzso The dose is adjusted on the basis of a performance measure for the same meal on the previous zzso We determine the best performance measure and tune the zzso to match the recommendations of experienced zzso 

Eleven subjects with type 1 diabetes, using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, were recruited zzso women and four men, aged zzso years with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin infusion rates were zzso Target zzso content for the lunch meal was calculated on the basis of a zzso zzso Over a period of 2-4 days, subjects were asked to measure their blood zzso according to the zzso zzso Starting with their usual zzso ratio, the insulin zzso dose was zzso downward until zzso zzso levels were high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso physicians made insulin zzso recommendations to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso methods were then used to determine the most appropriate performance measure for the zzso to match the zzso zzso For the best performance measure, the gain of the controller was determined to be the best match to the dose recommendations of the zzso 

The correlation between the clinically determined dose adjustments and those of the zzso is zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso - zzso 

We have shown how engineering methods can be melded with medical expertise to develop and refine a dosing zzso This zzso has the potential of drastically simplifying the determination of correct zzso zzso
