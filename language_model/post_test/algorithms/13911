The authors present a technique for correcting for exposure measurement error in the analysis of zzso data when subjects have a variable number of repeated zzso and the average is used as the zzso measure of zzso The true exposure as well as the measurement error are assumed to be normally zzso The method zzso each zzso observed average by a factor which is a function of the measurement error zzso prior to fitting the zzso zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso zzso estimate based on the transformed average is corrected for zzso A zzso method for obtaining confidence intervals for the true zzso zzso which takes into account the zzso due to zzso of the measurement error zzso is also zzso The method is applied to data from a zzso zzso study of hormones and breast zzso
