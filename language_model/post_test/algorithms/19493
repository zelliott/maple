When building an imaging system for detection tasks in medical imaging, we need to evaluate how well the system performs before we can zzso zzso One way to do the evaluation is to calculate the performance of the zzso ideal zzso The zzso performance is often zzso expensive, and it is very useful to have an approximation to zzso We use a zzso probability density function to represent the corresponding zzso of data under the zzso and the zzso zzso We develop approximations to the zzso zzso as a function of signal parameters involving the Fisher information zzso which is normally used in zzso zzso zzso The accuracy of the approximation is illustrated in zzso examples and zzso zzso We are able to predict the slope of the zzso as a function of the signal zzso This capability suggests that the Fisher information zzso itself evaluated at the zzso zzso value can be used as the figure of merit in imaging system zzso We are also able to provide a theoretical foundation for the connection between detection tasks and zzso zzso
