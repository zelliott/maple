The zzso zzso spatial linkage zzso zzso is often the measurement system of choice for monitoring motion of anatomical zzso However, due to zzso of the linkage zzso the system may not be as accurate as zzso A zzso zzso and associated zzso device have been developed to refine the initial zzso of the zzso mechanical and electrical parameters so that the measurement of zzso motion will be most accurate within the zzso of the anatomical zzso The zzso adjusts the zzso of selected linkage parameters to reduce the squared differences between the six known and calculated anatomical position parameters at all the zzso zzso zzso is permitted so as to obtain a linkage zzso set that is specialized for measuring certain anatomical position zzso zzso of the zzso includes estimates of the measuring system zzso For a particular zzso zzso and zzso device, several zzso design zzso relationships have been zzso These zzso relationships are due to the zzso of the zzso and zzso device, the number of zzso positions, and the limited resolution of the devices that monitor the position of the linkage zzso It is shown that if zzso is not zzso then the resulting zzso zzso set will not be accurate in measuring motion outside of the zzso positions, even though these positions are within the zzso zzso
