zzso identification of zzso of a zzso is critical in defining its zzso zzso We previously predicted that zzso zzso a zzso zzso is a candidate zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The present study is an experimental validation of this zzso As demanded by our published method zzso zzso of Natural zzso from zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Pol zzso PLoS ONE 4, zzso this zzso pair shares a common zzso distribution and the predicted zzso site is accessible to the zzso zzso zzso cells showed enhanced zzso zzso at the cell surface and formed larger cell zzso When zzso was mobilized from zzso storage deposits to the cell surface there was a decrease in the band intensity of zzso in the plasma membrane zzso with a zzso zzso of a zzso product in the zzso zzso The zzso addition of pure active zzso zzso decreased the surface levels of zzso zzso whereas the levels of zzso and zzso were zzso zzso with a zzso at the predicted zzso site is resistant to zzso by zzso Thus zzso seems to be a functionally relevant zzso zzso of zzso Since breakdown of zzso contact is the first major event in invasion, this zzso relationship is likely to have a profound role in zzso of zzso zzso Our zzso has the potential to become an integral tool for discovering new zzso zzso
