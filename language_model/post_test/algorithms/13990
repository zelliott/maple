zzso sampling by direct zzso of an zzso energy function is ineffective and inefficient because of the zzso of the energy zzso zzso sampling schemes represent an attractive alternative for generating ensembles of zzso consistent with spatial restraints derived from empirical zzso zzso sampling is becoming increasingly important for structure prediction as the bottleneck in accurate prediction shifts from energy functions to the methods used to find low-energy zzso Experimental structure determination remains a perennial challenge as investigators tackle larger zzso systems, and begin to incorporate more complete descriptions of uncertainty, zzso and dynamics into their zzso zzso approaches that combine dense, discrete sampling with zzso energy evaluation and refinement may help to overcome the remaining barriers to solving these zzso
