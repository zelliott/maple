zzso monitoring and control of industrial zzso requires the knowledge of a great number of zzso being some of them not measurable with standard zzso To overcome this difficulty, software sensors can be used for zzso zzso of those variables and, therefore, its development is of paramount zzso An zzso Observer was used for monitoring zzso coli zzso zzso Its performance was evaluated using simulated and experimental zzso The results obtained showed that the observer was able to predict the biomass concentration profiles showing, however, less satisfactory results regarding the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso In comparison with the results obtained with an zzso Kalman Observer, the performance of the zzso Observer in the zzso monitoring was slightly zzso
