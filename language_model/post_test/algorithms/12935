The extension of the Jones zzso zzso to zzso zzso modes using N zzso N zzso presented in a previous paper zzso is applied to laser zzso The zzso discussed in detail has a zzso zzso mode, an zzso zzso zzso combined with an zzso zzso phase zzso as a rear mirror and a folding mirror with conventional polarization dependent zzso and phase zzso The analysis reveals some useful zzso where the output polarization is close to zzso or zzso and the sensitivity to variations in the phase shift of the folding mirror is zzso
