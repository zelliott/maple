In this article a scheme for image transmission over Wireless Sensor Networks zzso with an zzso zzso factor is zzso The proposed control architecture affects the quality of the transmitted images according to: zzso the traffic load within the network and zzso the level of details contained in an image zzso Given an approximate transmission period, the zzso zzso mechanism applies zzso Tree zzso zzso with a varying decomposition zzso factor based on a zzso zzso zzso For the zzso of the proposed control zzso the desired a zzso maximum bound for the transmission time delay is being set, while a zzso among the quality of the zzso image frame and the time needed for completing the transmission of the frame should be taken under zzso Based on the proposed control zzso the quality of the slowly varying transmitted image frames is zzso deviated based on the measured time delay in the zzso The efficacy of the zzso zzso control scheme is validated through extended experimental zzso
