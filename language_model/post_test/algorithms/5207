Wave intensity analysis is a concept providing information about the interaction of the heart and the vascular zzso zzso the technique was zzso Since then new zzso methods have been zzso A recently developed ultrasound technique to estimate tissue motion and deformation is zzso zzso zzso zzso techniques allow for accurate measurement of movement and deformation variables in the zzso wall in both the zzso and the zzso zzso The aim of this study was to test if zzso zzso deformation data could be used as input for wave intensity zzso The new concept was to approximate changes of flow and pressure by deformation changes of the zzso wall in zzso and zzso zzso zzso changes zzso were zzso by strain rate zzso zzso of the zzso wall in the zzso direction, whereas pressure changes zzso were zzso by sign reversed strain rate zzso in the zzso wall in the zzso zzso To validate the new concept, a comparison between the newly developed Wave zzso Wall Analysis zzso zzso and a commonly used and validated wave intensity system zzso zzso Tokyo, Japan) was zzso The studied population consisted of ten healthy individuals (three women, seven zzso and ten patients (all zzso with coronary artery zzso The present validation study indicates that the mechanical properties of the zzso wall, as measured by a zzso zzso technique are a possible input for wave intensity zzso The study demonstrates good visual agreement between the two systems and the time zzso between the two positive zzso zzso measured by the zzso system and the zzso system correlated for the total group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The correlation for the diseased zzso was r zzso zzso P zzso zzso and for the healthy zzso no significant correlation was found zzso zzso zzso The results of the study indicate that the mechanical properties of the zzso wall could be used as input for wave intensity zzso The zzso concept is a promising new method that potentially provides several advantages over earlier wave intensity methods, but it still has limitations and needs further refinement and larger studies to find the optimal clinical zzso
