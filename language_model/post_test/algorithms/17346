The prediction of a zzso structure from its zzso acid sequence has been a long-standing goal of molecular zzso In this work, a new set of zzso parameters for membrane spanning alpha zzso was developed using the information from the zzso of 70 membrane zzso Based on these zzso zzso a simple zzso has been formulated to predict the zzso alpha zzso in membrane zzso A zzso program has been developed which takes the zzso acid sequence as input and gives the predicted zzso zzso as zzso The present method correctly identifies 295 zzso zzso segments in 70 membrane proteins with only two zzso Furthermore, this method predicts all 45 zzso zzso in the zzso reaction center, zzso and zzso c zzso to an zzso level of accuracy and so is better than all other methods published to zzso
