zzso zzso zzso is of great interest for gene mapping and the study of population zzso We propose a zzso model for zzso based on the zzso of zzso sharing zzso The zzso model is most appropriate when the zzso in which one is interested is due to the introduction of a zzso on an ancestral zzso with zzso in succeeding generations resulting in preservation of only a small region of the ancestral zzso around the zzso This is generally the scenario of interest for gene mapping by zzso The zzso zzso is a measure of zzso that can be interpreted as the expected genetic distance to which the ancestral zzso is zzso or, zzso zzso in generations to the ancestral zzso The method allows for multiple origins of zzso and for zzso and it takes into account missing observations and ambiguities in zzso determination, via a hidden zzso zzso Whereas most commonly used measures of zzso apply to pairs of zzso the zzso measure is designed for application to the densely mapped zzso data that are increasingly zzso The zzso method explicitly models the dependence among multiple tightly linked zzso on a zzso When the assumptions about population structure are sufficiently zzso the estimate of zzso is obtained by maximum zzso For zzso models of population history, we find means and zzso based on the model and solve a zzso zzso zzso zzso show that this approach works extremely well both for zzso of zzso and for fine zzso We apply the zzso method to published data sets for zzso zzso and progressive zzso zzso
