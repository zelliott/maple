Quality assessment plays a crucial role in data zzso In this paper, we present a zzso approach to volume data quality zzso Our zzso extracts important statistical information from the original data in the zzso zzso Using the extracted information as feature and zzso distance functions, we are able to identify and zzso the quality loss in the reduced or distorted version of data, eliminating the need to access the original zzso Our feature representation is naturally organized in the form of multiple zzso which zzso quality evaluation of data with different zzso The feature can be effectively compressed in zzso We have experimented with our zzso on scientific and medical data sets of various sizes and zzso Our results show that the size of the feature does not increase in proportion to the size of original zzso This ensures the zzso of our zzso and makes it very zzso for quality assessment of large-scale data zzso Additionally, the feature could be used to repair the reduced or distorted data for quality zzso Finally, our approach can be treated as a new way to evaluate the uncertainty introduced by different versions of zzso
