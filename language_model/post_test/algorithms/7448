We develop a random zzso image registration method that incorporates two zzso 1) a progressive zzso scheme that conducts the solution search efficiently via a novel use of information derived from the obtained zzso solution, and 2) a zzso zzso step that zzso performs feature selection in a zzso zzso manner so that the data costs are based primarily on trusted information zzso zzso experiments on three public zzso of different anatomical regions and zzso showed that our method performed efficient search without sacrificing registration zzso zzso performed on 60 real brain image pairs from a public zzso also demonstrated our zzso better performance over existing zzso image registration zzso
