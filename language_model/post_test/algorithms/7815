Manual zzso of experimental data from the biomedical literature is an expensive and time-consuming zzso Nevertheless, most biological knowledge bases still rely heavily on manual zzso for data extraction and zzso zzso mining software that can zzso or fully automate information retrieval from the literature would thus provide a significant boost to manual zzso zzso 

We employ the zzso zzso information retrieval and extraction system zzso developed by zzso to explore how zzso might improve the efficiency with which we manually zzso zzso zzso proteins to the Gene zzso Cellular zzso zzso Using a training set of sentences that describe results of zzso experiments in the published literature, we generated three new zzso zzso categories zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso containing words and phrases associated with reports of zzso determined zzso zzso We compared the results of manual zzso to that of zzso queries that searched the full text of articles for sentences containing terms from each of the three new categories plus the name of a previously zzso zzso zzso zzso and found that zzso searches identified zzso papers with recall and precision rates of zzso and zzso respectively zzso of zzso when compared to manual zzso Within those documents, zzso identified relevant sentences with recall and precision rates of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso From returned sentences, curators were able to make zzso of all possible zzso supported GO Cellular zzso zzso with zzso precision zzso of zzso zzso the relative efficiencies of zzso versus manual zzso we find that zzso has the potential to increase zzso efficiency by at least zzso and perhaps as much as zzso given differences in individual curatorial zzso 

zzso is an effective tool for improving the efficiency of manual, zzso based zzso zzso a zzso Cellular zzso zzso pipeline at zzso has allowed us to transition from strictly manual zzso of this data type to a more efficient pipeline of zzso zzso zzso development of zzso zzso zzso categories will provide an invaluable resource for zzso databases that rely heavily on manual zzso
