zzso the zzso zzso is a controlled vocabulary of terms used in zzso It was developed by the zzso Society of North America in recognition of a lack of coverage of these zzso concepts by other zzso There are still additional concepts, particularly those related to imaging observations and imaging observation zzso that could be added to the zzso We used a free and open source software system to extract these terms from the medical zzso The system retrieved relevant articles from the zzso zzso and passed them through zzso in the zzso zzso Information Management zzso Image observations and image observation characteristics were identified through a zzso zzso The system was run on a corpus of zzso journal zzso The system generated lists of 624 imaging observations and zzso imaging observation zzso Three domain experts evaluated the top 100 terms in each list and determined a precision of zzso and zzso respectively, for identification of image observations and image observation zzso We conclude that candidate terms for inclusion in standardized zzso may be extracted automatically from the zzso zzso These terms can then be reviewed for zzso into the zzso
