zzso relationships between calculated molecular structure and 26 zzso zzso zzso zzso were investigated by zzso multiple linear zzso In multiple linear zzso analysis, the quantitative zzso relationship models were constructed by grouping zzso and also dual selection of variables using genetic zzso and zzso selection methods from each group of the pool of all calculated zzso The accuracy of the proposed multiple linear zzso model was demonstrated using the following evaluation zzso zzso validation through an external test set, and zzso Furthermore, the domain of zzso that shows the area of reliable predictions was zzso The prediction results were in good agreement with the experimental zzso
