The early zzso enhancers of zzso zzso comprise one of the most sophisticated regulatory systems in higher zzso An elaborate code in their DNA sequence translates both maternal and early embryonic regulatory signals into spatial distribution of zzso zzso One of the most striking features of this code is the zzso of binding sites for these zzso factors zzso Using this zzso we explored the possibility of predicting functional binding sites in a single zzso region without any prior zzso description or evolutionary sequence zzso We developed a zzso simple algorithm, zzso that employs an original statistical evaluation for identifying the most redundant motifs and locates the position of potential zzso in a given regulatory zzso To estimate the biological relevance of our predictions, we built thorough zzso zzso for the best-known zzso zzso enhancers and we generated detailed distribution maps for the most robust binding zzso The high statistical correlation between the location of zzso in these zzso maps and the location predicted in zzso by zzso confirmed the relevance of our zzso We also discuss the definition of true binding sites and the possible biological principles that govern patterning of regulatory regions and the distribution of zzso zzso
