zzso studies have a major role in the diagnosis of zzso tunnel syndrome zzso The parameters used in this regard include nerve zzso zzso zzso and compound nerve action potential zzso In some individuals, recording sensory nerve action potential zzso and as a result zzso is zzso This study aims at determining the zzso correlation between zzso and zzso calculated through zzso zzso zzso and zzso in 100 hands of 50 zzso and clinically zzso individuals and 100 hands of 70 patients with zzso were zzso The correlation between zzso and zzso was determined using independent zzso and zzso zzso 

The results indicated that there is a significant correlation between sex, group, zzso and zzso statistically zzso zzso zzso zzso correlation zzso was zzso zzso between zzso and zzso was proved based on zzso Altman zzso 

There is zzso correlation between zzso and zzso that we can use it when we are not able to calculate zzso through zzso
