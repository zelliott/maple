To determine the relationship between the zzso volume, zzso target volume zzso zzso and zzso sparing of the zzso with zzso radiation therapy zzso 

zzso data were collected zzso for 51 patients treated with simultaneous boost zzso zzso patients received 54 or zzso zzso to zzso disease, 70 zzso to gross zzso Patients treated zzso received 54, 60, and 66 zzso to zzso zzso and tumor bed zzso Volume and mean dose of each zzso and zzso segments outside of and overlapping the zzso were zzso Proximity of each zzso to each zzso was zzso 

zzso sparing zzso dose zzso zzso zzso was achieved in 66 of 71 zzso with zzso or zzso zzso overlap and 8 of 23 zzso with zzso overlap zzso zzso zzso Among spared zzso the median mean dose in the overlap region was zzso zzso in zzso with zzso or zzso zzso but only zzso zzso when overlap zzso Median mean dose was zzso zzso to zzso overlapping zzso or zzso alone and zzso zzso to those abutting zzso zzso zzso zzso Although proximity to zzso was associated with higher zzso dose, satisfactory sparing was achieved in 24 of 43 zzso zzso 

zzso sparing of the zzso is feasible when the zzso overlap is less than approximately zzso With more zzso sparing may result in low doses within the overlap region, possibly leading to inadequate zzso zzso zzso proximity to the high-dose zzso is associated with higher mean dose but does not always zzso zzso zzso
