Dynamic Nuclear zzso zzso of the zzso nucleus has been investigated for zzso acid, doped with the zzso radical zzso at zzso T and zzso The dependence of the polarization on zzso frequency, radical concentration and electron zzso was zzso For zzso conditions, a zzso polarization equal to zzso was zzso an increase by more than a factor of two compared with earlier results at zzso T of the same zzso It was zzso observed that the addition of zzso which resulted in a twofold polarization increase at zzso zzso only resulted in a minor improvement at zzso zzso The dependence of the electron zzso on zzso frequency and zzso power was zzso by first moment zzso which were obtained by zzso double resonance zzso zzso Complete electron zzso was observed for a zzso frequency close to the zzso frequency of the zzso line, and by using maximum power of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso time at zzso T zzso zzso zzso was prolonged by approximately a factor three over the zzso time at zzso T zzso 1200 zzso However, after approximately 20 zzso of zzso zzso the polarization at zzso T exceeded the polarization at zzso zzso
