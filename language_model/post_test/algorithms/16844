An zzso overall cardiovascular risk should guide appropriate therapy and patient zzso Several risk assessment scores are zzso however, further development of risk zzso is necessary to account for changes in available treatments and patient zzso to make use of emerging risk factors and more accurate methods for measuring zzso and to provide more targeted measurement of risk for different patient zzso When developing a risk model it is important to clearly define the outcome that the risk will zzso the period of follow up, the patient population, and the zzso to be used and how they will be zzso An appropriate statistical model is specified with the aim of finding the weighted combination of the candidate risk factors that best predicts the disease zzso zzso zzso is used to systematically search through candidate risk factors to produce a final model with an acceptable number of highly relevant zzso zzso zzso effects of continuous variables and interactions between variables must be zzso However, the selection of variables requires not just statistical criteria but also clinical, biological and zzso zzso In general, relatively simple, clinically reasonable and zzso models that can be generalized to other settings are preferred to complex mathematical models that fit the sample data zzso There is a permanent need for updating cardiovascular risk scores to reflect advances in our clinical knowledge over time and changes in population zzso Development of a risk model requires both statistical expertise and a sound knowledge of the clinical and zzso aspects of cardiovascular zzso
