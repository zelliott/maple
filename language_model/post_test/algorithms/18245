zzso zzso zzso is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in severely injured zzso Early and aggressive use of blood products in these patients may correct zzso control zzso and improve zzso However, rapid identification of patients at risk for zzso has been zzso We zzso that evaluation of clinical variables routinely assessed upon admission would allow identification of these patients for earlier, more effective zzso 

A retrospective cohort study was conducted at a single combat support hospital to identify risk factors for zzso in patients with traumatic zzso zzso zzso and laboratory variables obtained upon admission were zzso zzso and zzso analyses were zzso An zzso was formulated, validated with an independent zzso and a simple scoring system was zzso 

Three thousand four hundred zzso patient records were zzso At least one unit of blood was zzso to zzso patients at the combat support zzso zzso criteria included age less than 18 years, transfer from another medical facility, designation as a security zzso or incomplete data zzso The final number of patients was zzso of whom zzso zzso of zzso received a zzso Patients with zzso had higher mortality (29 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Four independent risk factors for zzso were zzso heart rate zzso zzso zzso blood pressure zzso zzso zzso pH zzso and zzso zzso An zzso was created to analyze the risk of zzso zzso under the curve zzso zzso zzso In an independent data set of zzso patients the ability to accurately identify those requiring zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Independent zzso for zzso were identified in a cohort of severely injured patients requiring zzso Patients requiring a zzso can be identified with variables commonly obtained upon hospital zzso
