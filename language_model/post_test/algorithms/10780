The zzso zzso for monitor unit zzso calculations was evaluated and implemented to replace a previous methodology based on zzso data measured in a zzso zzso This traditional method relies on data zzso at the depth of dose maximum zzso as well as on the zzso of the zzso 25 table for the conversion of zzso fields into equivalent square zzso The treatment planning system zzso was subsequently updated to reflect the new beam data zzso at a depth zzso of 10 zzso Comparisons were then carried out between the zzso zzso the zzso dose calculation zzso on the zzso (with beam data zzso at zzso and zzso and the traditional zzso zzso All zzso except for the zzso methodology, separated zzso from zzso effects and none of the zzso except for the zzso zzso zzso wedge depth dose information for zzso The accuracy of zzso calculations was verified against zzso in a homogeneous phantom for square and zzso open and wedged fields, as well as blocked open and wedged fields, at 5, 10, and 20 zzso zzso under fixed zzso and zzso zzso for 6 and 10 zzso Overall, the zzso zzso showed the most accurate performance, with the root mean square zzso error with respect to zzso remaining below zzso even for the most complex beam zzso zzso The zzso error for the zzso deteriorated with the introduction of a wedge, with a worse zzso error for the beam data zzso at zzso zzso at 6 zzso and zzso at 10 zzso than at zzso zzso at 6 zzso and zzso at 10 zzso The further addition of blocking had only a marginal impact on the accuracy of this zzso The zzso methodology showed a loss in accuracy for calculations involving either wedges or zzso and performed worst for blocked wedged fields zzso errors of zzso at 6 zzso and zzso at 10 zzso The origins of these discrepancies were zzso and the shortcomings of these zzso calculation zzso are discussed in the zzso
