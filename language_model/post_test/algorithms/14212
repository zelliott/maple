We have previously reported a flow rate zzso method for the determination of absolute zzso zzso counts that removes the need for the addition of latex beads to each zzso However, a limitation with this approach is that a zzso factor zzso needs to be applied to adjust for differences in zzso between latex zzso suspensions and biological zzso We have also demonstrated the value of using stabilized whole blood samples in external quality assessment zzso zzso such samples have a stable absolute zzso count for over 1 year, at 4 degrees zzso It was successfully demonstrated that this material can be used as a flow rate zzso zzso material for use as a flow zzso control to provide a sample with a known zzso zzso zzso Such material has advantages over latex zzso technology as it can act as a full process control as well as having the same zzso and zzso characteristics as the test material, thus removing the need for a zzso 

In this study, we have analyzed 268 consecutive normal, zzso and zzso samples using zzso incorporating the zzso approach and compared this to the zzso method, defined as the zzso 

Percentage similarity statistics revealed the zzso zzso zzso zzso mean percentage difference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso 

This study demonstrates that stabilized whole blood can be used for zzso It has the advantage of being a full process control, in addition to costing less than latex beads with highly comparable zzso As bench top flow zzso are extremely stable, this is a low cost and robust alternative to zzso based methods for generating absolute zzso zzso
