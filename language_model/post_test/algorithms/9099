This study compared the predicted zzso concentration of zzso at loss and recovery of consciousness when using zzso infusion devices with the same zzso model zzso but a different plasma zzso zzso rate constant zzso ), the zzso zzso zzso zzso ) and Base zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We studied 60 female patients undergoing minor zzso surgery under general zzso Although the total dose of zzso and time until loss of consciousness were comparable, the zzso concentration at loss of consciousness was significantly lower with the zzso than with the Base zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso , respectively, p zzso zzso The zzso concentration at recovery of consciousness was significantly higher with the zzso than with the Base zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso , respectively, p zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso concentration of zzso differs depending on the zzso , despite the use of the same zzso zzso zzso the zzso should be considered when predicting loss and recovery of consciousness based on the zzso concentration of zzso
