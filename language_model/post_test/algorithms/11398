A novel information retrieval zzso for X-ray zzso zzso imaging based on the zzso of the object and the reference phase stepping curve zzso as proposed by zzso et zzso was investigated in this zzso We applied the method for the first time on data obtained with a zzso spectrum and compared the results to those, received by applying the commonly used method, based on a zzso zzso We confirmed the zzso that both methods deliver the same results for the zzso and the differential phase zzso For the zzso image, a mean zzso ratio zzso increase by a factor of zzso using the new method was zzso Furthermore, the dose saving potential was estimated for the zzso method zzso It is found, that for the conventional method a dose which is higher by a factor of zzso is needed to obtain a similar zzso value compared to the novel zzso A further analysis of the data revealed, that the improvement in zzso and dose efficiency is due to the superior background noise properties of the zzso method, but at the cost of zzso between zzso at different applied dose values, as the mean value becomes dependent on the zzso statistics zzso
