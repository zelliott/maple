The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of the zzso that can also be associated with zzso The majority of zzso zzso respiratory zzso lack the genes for capsule production and are zzso zzso Whereas zzso strains are known to belong to zzso zzso groups, the structure of the zzso population has not been previously zzso A total of 656 zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso have been typed by zzso sequence typing and found to have zzso sequence types zzso We performed zzso analysis of the zzso sequences and calculated the zzso consensus of zzso resulting equally most zzso zzso Eleven zzso were identified, consisting of six or more ST on a branch that was present in zzso of zzso Two additional zzso were defined by branches present in zzso and zzso of trees, zzso Of these 13 zzso 8 consisted predominantly of zzso zzso three were zzso specific, and 2 contained distinct zzso and zzso clusters of zzso Sixty percent of zzso strains have ST within one of the 13 zzso and zzso analysis identified an additional zzso group that contained zzso of zzso zzso There was zzso zzso of certain zzso reactions and putative zzso zzso but not of disease source or geographic zzso We conclude that zzso zzso groups of zzso strains exist and that these groups differ in genetic zzso These observations will provide a framework for further study of the effect of genetic diversity on the interaction of zzso with the zzso
