A large number of highly zzso bacteria zzso zzso systems to zzso zzso proteins into host zzso Using these zzso the bacteria zzso host cell processes during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso via the zzso zzso zzso system and to date, approximately 100 zzso have been identified by various experimental and zzso zzso zzso identification is a critical first step towards the understanding of the zzso system in zzso zzso as well as in other bacterial zzso Here, we formulate the task of zzso identification as a zzso problem: each zzso zzso open reading frame zzso was classified as either zzso or zzso We zzso defined a set of features that best distinguish zzso from zzso These features cover a wide range of characteristics including zzso zzso regulatory data, zzso organization, similarity to zzso zzso and zzso zzso learning zzso utilizing these features were then applied to zzso all the zzso within the zzso zzso zzso Using this approach we were able to predict and zzso validate 40 new zzso reaching a success rate of above zzso zzso the number of validated zzso to around zzso we were able to gain novel insights into their zzso zzso were found to have low zzso content, supporting the hypothesis that a large number of zzso originate via horizontal gene transfer, probably from their zzso zzso In addition, zzso were found to cluster in specific zzso zzso Finally, we were able to provide a novel description of the zzso zzso signal required for zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso To zzso we have discovered 40 novel zzso zzso zzso predicted over a hundred additional highly probable zzso and shown the zzso of machine learning zzso for the identification and characterization of bacterial zzso zzso
