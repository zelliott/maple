The aim of this brief review is to provide an update on the theory regarding minimal fresh gas flow techniques for zzso general zzso The article also includes an update and discussion of the practical aspects associated with zzso zzso including the advantages, potential limitations, and safety considerations of this important zzso zzso 

zzso the fresh gas flow to zzso 1 zzso during maintenance of zzso is associated with several zzso zzso preservation of temperature and zzso cost savings through more efficient zzso of zzso zzso and environmental considerations are three key reasons to implement zzso and zzso zzso although potential risks are hypoxic gas zzso and inadequate depth of zzso The basic elements of the related pharmacology need to be considered, especially zzso of the zzso zzso The third-generation zzso zzso zzso and zzso have low blood and low tissue zzso which zzso rapid zzso between the zzso and effect site zzso zzso and makes them zzso suited for zzso zzso The use of modern zzso machines designed for zzso techniques, zzso circle systems, highly efficient zzso zzso and the common practice of utilizing zzso real-time zzso zzso including essential alarm systems, allow for safe and cost-effective zzso techniques during maintenance of zzso The introduction of new zzso machines with built-in zzso zzso for the automatic control of inspired oxygen and zzso zzso concentration will further enhance the feasibility of zzso zzso 

With our modern zzso machines, reducing the fresh gas flow of oxygen to zzso zzso and using third-generation zzso zzso provide a zzso safe zzso zzso This environmentally friendly practice can easily be implemented for zzso zzso zzso it will facilitate cost savings and improve temperature zzso
