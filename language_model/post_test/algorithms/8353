This zzso suggests that in steady states the momentary burden of zzso zzso zzso in zzso bone equals the rate of creation of new zzso multiplied by the time taken to repair a locus of zzso completely in the zzso zzso That zzso zzso equals about zzso years in healthy human zzso When zzso production suddenly increases, the momentary zzso burden begins to increase too, and does so for a time equal to the repair period and in proportion to the increased zzso zzso After the repair period zzso the momentary zzso would tend to reach and stay at a maximum value as long as increased zzso production zzso zzso the repair period, preventing the creation of new zzso units to repair zzso or delaying zzso of the new bone made by those units would also increase zzso zzso zzso zzso production or the repair period, or accelerating the creation of new modeling units would have the opposite effects on the momentary zzso burden but would also go through a transient phase before developing the new steady state zzso zzso these relationships zzso and zzso requires expressing them zzso and using for the terms in any equations things one can define logically and measure zzso zzso the article suggests a special definition of a unit amount of zzso how to measure it, and simple algebra and equations for calculating some effects of zzso on the zzso zzso
