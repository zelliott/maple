zzso penetration enhancers zzso are chemicals used to enhance the zzso delivery of zzso zzso of the approximately 150 zzso used for the zzso delivery of drugs have been reported in cigarette mainstream smoke zzso zzso is a complex zzso of minute liquid droplets zzso the particulate zzso suspended within a mixture of gases zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The gases and many of the zzso are termed the vapor zzso zzso of the 58 zzso have been identified in zzso vapor phase, 15 in the particulate phase and 14 in both the vapor and particulate zzso There is a tendency for zzso zzso to be zzso with 40 of the 58 compounds zzso being either zzso or strongly zzso and only zzso being zzso Many of the zzso known constituents of zzso are zzso and would not be expected to readily cross cell zzso or penetrate tissue when delivered as single zzso The in zzso effect on biological activity of the juxtaposition within the cigarette smoke zzso of the large number of zzso constituents with the 58 zzso is currently zzso As an initial step in understanding this potential complex interaction, the 58 zzso in zzso have been identified and a number of molecular parameters related to the ability to penetrate tissue have been zzso including zzso zzso measured and calculated base ten zzso of the zzso partition zzso zzso P and zzso zzso molecular volume zzso and calculated zzso zzso zzso
