zzso exposure to cigarette smoke on zzso induced a zzso of pulmonary zzso and zzso dysfunction might be an early trigger of this vascular zzso zzso the present study was aimed to evaluate the effect of a 12 weeks exposure to passive smoking on the pulmonary zzso zzso zzso 

zzso response of pulmonary arteries rings isolated in organ bath, zzso with zzso was compared in the presence of cumulative doses zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and independent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that chronic exposure of zzso to cigarette smoke zzso the impairment only of zzso zzso response zzso was zzso zzso zzso % for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso % in control, p zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso % for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

The in zzso study of pulmonary arteries zzso function in guinea pigs chronically exposed to cigarette smoke may represent a reliable and relevant experimental model for the assessment of pulmonary zzso dysfunction in early stages of zzso
