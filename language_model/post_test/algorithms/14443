Comparing and computing distances between zzso trees are important biological problems, especially for models where edge lengths play an important zzso The zzso distance measure between two zzso trees with edge lengths is the length of the shortest path between them in the continuous tree space introduced by zzso Holmes, and zzso This tree space provides a powerful tool for studying and comparing zzso trees, both in exhibiting a natural distance measure and in providing a zzso structure for solving zzso problems on zzso An important open problem is to find a zzso time zzso for finding zzso in tree zzso This paper gives such an algorithm, which starts with a simple initial path and moves through a series of successively shorter paths until the zzso is zzso
