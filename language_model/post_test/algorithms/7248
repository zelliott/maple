zzso is used clinically to evaluate retinal and zzso nerve function by measuring zzso response to light zzso We have developed a mathematical zzso to automate and zzso the analysis of zzso zzso zzso data obtained from mouse zzso light zzso recordings, obtained from dynamic zzso diameter recordings following exposure of varying light zzso The zzso zzso zzso data is filtered through a low pass finite impulse response zzso zzso zzso is used to remove data caused by eye zzso loss of zzso zzso and/or head zzso Twelve zzso relevant parameters were extracted from the collected zzso zzso baseline diameter, zzso minimum diameter, zzso response zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso percent of baseline diameter, zzso response time, zzso zzso time, zzso average zzso zzso zzso average zzso zzso (10) maximum zzso zzso (11) maximum zzso zzso and zzso onset zzso No significant differences were noted between parameters derived from zzso calculated values and manually derived results zzso zzso zzso This mathematical zzso will zzso zzso data derivation and eliminate human error in the manual calculation of zzso parameters from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these values can be used as reference metrics for characterizing the natural history of retinal zzso Furthermore, it will be instrumental in the assessment of functional visual recovery in humans and zzso models of retinal zzso and zzso nerve disease following pharmacological or zzso zzso
