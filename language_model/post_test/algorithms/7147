X-ray phase contrast zzso zzso zzso zzso can zzso provide the internal structure information of soft zzso and low atomic number zzso It has become an invaluable analysis tool for biomedical zzso Here an zzso phase contrast zzso reconstruction technique is reported, which consists of a projection extraction method and the conventional filter zzso zzso reconstruction zzso The projection extraction is implemented by applying the zzso transform to the forward projections of zzso phase contrast zzso This work comprises a zzso study of the method and its experimental zzso using a biomedical zzso zzso measured at an X-ray tube source zzso zzso The zzso and experimental results demonstrate that the presented technique can improve the imaging contrast of biomedical zzso It will be of interest for a wide range of zzso phase contrast zzso applications in medicine and zzso
