We describe an algorithm, zzso Area zzso for separating background from foreground in gray scale zzso The zzso is based on the area contained within gray scale zzso zzso It can be viewed as a form of local zzso or as a seed growing algorithm, or as a type of watershed zzso The most important feature of the zzso is that it uses object area to determine the zzso Thus, it is relatively impervious to brightness and contrast variations across an image or between different zzso zzso Area zzso was designed specifically for image analysis of zzso zzso gels, although it can be applied to other gray scale zzso A typical gel image is an zzso or a zzso image of zzso spots representing protein or DNA restriction zzso The images are quantitative with spot zzso reflective of the number of proteins or the DNA zzso copy zzso The background intensity can vary widely across the image caused both by variation in spot density and by the physical laboratory process of creating a zzso zzso and comparing gel images zzso zzso and zzso spots, registering images and matching spots, and measuring differences between zzso We present experimental results which show that zzso Area zzso is a zzso efficient method for separating zzso gel background from foreground with extremely high zzso
