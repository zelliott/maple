To describe and present some preliminary results for a novel zzso for zzso with zzso connectedness as a means to separate arteries and veins in magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

The proposed algorithm, zzso uses the zzso degree of connectedness as a tool to find the zone surrounding each vessel, in order to split the original volume into its different vessel zzso In contrast to traditional zzso methods, no zzso information is lost in the zzso The zzso is performed in one step, resulting in a partition of the initial volume into a chosen number of regions of interest zzso Finally, zzso is achieved by projecting the zzso vessel trees to zzso using the common maximum intensity projection zzso The zzso was tested in two zzso data sets of the vessels of the pelvis acquired after injection of an zzso contrast agent and in one data set of the vessels of the neck with zzso 

In all data sets, a large proportion of the zzso signal was removed while preserving that of the zzso thus improving zzso of the relevant zzso 

zzso of arteries and veins is feasible with the proposed zzso with a moderate amount of zzso
