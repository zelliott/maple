This study compared the zzso of zzso therapy zzso and zzso zzso zzso with a dynamic zzso zzso using the zzso Carlo zzso in the treatment of prostate cancer with and without simultaneous integrated boost zzso at different energy zzso 

The data of 15 zzso prostate cancer patients were zzso The prescribed dose was zzso to the planning target volume zzso including the prostate and seminal zzso and zzso zzso in 39 zzso to the zzso zzso which was delineated by zzso or zzso 

zzso dose zzso was better for zzso than zzso at all energy levels for both zzso and zzso Lower zzso doses zzso were significantly higher with zzso compared with zzso plans in both zzso and zzso plans at all energy zzso The zzso doses at high dose level zzso were significantly higher in zzso plans with zzso at all energy levels compared with zzso plans, but no significant difference was observed in zzso zzso zzso plans resulted in a significant decrease in the mean monitor units zzso for 6, 10, and zzso energy levels both in plans with and those without zzso 

zzso escalation to zzso zzso with zzso is safe without causing serious increase in zzso at risk zzso zzso zzso is advantageous in sparing zzso and requiring less zzso than zzso 

zzso with zzso to zzso zzso is a feasible method in treating prostate zzso Additionally, no zzso advantage of higher energy is zzso
