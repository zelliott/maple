The overall goal was to study cardiovascular function in small animals using a clinical zzso MR scanner zzso a fast zzso zzso sequence to obtain high spatial and zzso zzso 

zzso rat hearts zzso zzso 9) were zzso using a zzso MR scanner with a spiral fast zzso zzso field echo for Philips zzso zzso three Cartesian fast zzso zzso field echo for Philips zzso sequences with different zzso resolution, and with and without flow compensation and zzso zzso The hearts of four rats were then excised and zzso mass was zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis was performed for magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso 

zzso acquisition with flow compensation gave the best sequence in terms of image quality, spatial as well as zzso resolution, and suppression of flow zzso zzso fraction was 71 zzso zzso with less than zzso zzso and zzso zzso A good correlation was found between zzso zzso mass and wet zzso 

Using zzso sequences on a clinical zzso MR scanner can provide accurate zzso of cardiac function in small animals and can promote cardiovascular research on small animals at zzso
