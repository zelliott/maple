The zzso fields of turbulent jets can be described using a single formula which includes two empirical zzso zzso determining the length of the central core and zzso the jet zzso zzso models simulating jet zzso confinement and zzso zzso were studied using laser zzso zzso and the modifications of the zzso were derived from series of zzso zzso In circular free jets, zzso was found equal to zzso with a zzso of zzso In complex zzso its zzso was equal to zzso For zzso the value for free circular jets was of zzso with a zzso of zzso and this zzso in complex zzso was significantly higher zzso zzso zzso The correlation between the actual orifice size and the jet extension was poor zzso However, the almost constant value of zzso allowed to define a new zzso calculating the zzso orifice diameter with the use of outlines of the jet image zzso In conclusion, the fluid mechanics of zzso jets is modified in complex zzso but, due to the relative zzso of the central core, zzso fields could be used to evaluate the dimensions of the effective zzso zzso
