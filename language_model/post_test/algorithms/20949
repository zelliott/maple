One of the most sensitive zzso of zzso zzso is represented by the rate of increase of zzso pressure during zzso contraction zzso and zzso which represents the rate of change of pressure during zzso Today these parameters can be obtained only by invasive zzso zzso We developed a novel technique that leads to the zzso reconstruction of the central zzso zzso The technique is based on the concept of applying multiple successive zzso pressures on the zzso artery from peak zzso to zzso using an inflatable cuff and plotting the values against time zzso The hypothesis is that the time intervals required for the zzso pressure wave to overcome a given zzso zzso pressure applied by a zzso on the arm are equal to time needed to reach the same pressure in the central zzso plus the propagation time to the zzso point, which is constant in the same patient throughout the zzso 

We tested the hypothesis using an animal zzso The new zzso device was mounted on the left zzso of the zzso A zzso pressure zzso zzso was inserted to the zzso and the zzso pressure was recorded at time intervals of 1 zzso A second zzso was inserted into the coronary arteries and used to create controlled zzso of the arteries using a balloon inflated to 10 zzso zzso were obtained before the intervention was started, and throughout the sequence of repeated zzso and zzso At the end of the zzso IV zzso was administered and results were monitored for 10 zzso while the heart rate and blood pressure were zzso zzso zzso was reduced typically by zzso in response to balloon zzso In long zzso zzso stabilization and sometimes recovery of zzso is zzso By plotting zzso measured by the new zzso device versus zzso zzso a correlation factor of zzso was zzso 

A newly developed method of zzso measurement of central zzso has been found to correlate to invasive zzso in an animal zzso
