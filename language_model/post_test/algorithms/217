A living cell is a complex zzso system, in which a great variety of zzso and physical processes have to be coordinated to ensure zzso We investigate properties of zzso transport in single cells of the zzso zzso zzso a relevant model zzso due to its zzso zzso In the cells, zzso undergo two types of zzso directed zzso driven by molecular zzso on zzso or zzso diffusion in a crowded active zzso We present results obtained with our recently developed zzso algorithm, which performs a high-resolution zzso analysis of the track of zzso zzso particles and splits zzso transport into different motion zzso It results in a two-state model, distinguishing active and passive transport zzso We can extract the precise effect of cellular zzso and zzso on zzso transport by disturbing the zzso through the use of zzso drugs zzso for zzso and zzso A for zzso Further, we investigate how zzso filaments act together in order to maintain cell integrity, by applying external mechanical force on the magnetic particle and influencing its zzso
