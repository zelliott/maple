A major objective of brain science research is to model and zzso functional interaction patterns among neural networks, in the sense that meaningful interaction patterns reflect the working mechanisms of neural systems and represent their relationships with the external zzso Most current research approaches in the zzso field, however, focus on zzso zzso connectivity and are thus unable to handle zzso zzso functional zzso In this paper, we propose a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso model to represent the functional interaction among multiple regions of interests zzso based on resting state zzso zzso zzso In particular, the structural connectivity constraints derived from diffusion tenor imaging zzso data are used to guide the selection of the zzso thus zzso adjusting the penalty levels of different zzso which zzso to different zzso The zzso and accuracy of our models are evaluated and demonstrated via a series of carefully designed zzso In an application example, the generated zzso zzso show different zzso mixing patterns between zzso zzso zzso zzso patients and normal controls zzso Our results indicate that the proposed model has promising potential to enable the construction of zzso functional networks and their applications in clinical zzso
