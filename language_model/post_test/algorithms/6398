zzso of bone zzso with zzso has been used in the diagnosis of wrist injuries, although zzso of zzso bone zzso with zzso zzso zzso has not been widely zzso We describe a zzso technique in patients with possible wrist zzso 

The technique was used on three patients and involved placing the wrist on a zzso board and tracing the outline of the zzso and hand with a pen to try and ensure accurate repositioning on the board for the two sets of zzso Four point source markers were attached to the board during both zzso Single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed 4 h after injection zzso zzso using a zzso gamma zzso CT images were acquired on a zzso CT zzso The zzso and CT images were zzso with commercially available image fusion zzso The zzso of the four markers was identified in both sets of images and a rigid body point match zzso was zzso Before patient studies, the technique was tested using a zzso 

In all the phantom and clinical studies it was possible to identify the positions of all the zzso There were varying degrees of success in patient zzso 

We describe a technique that may aid the fusion of functional images from skeletal zzso with the exquisite anatomical detail from the latest CT technology, in the detection of zzso wrist zzso The technique may aid fracture zzso and/or detection and might help distinguish the clinically important zzso fractures from other benign zzso zzso
