This paper presents a zzso module and zzso activity zzso zzso for energy expenditure zzso The purpose of our design is first to categorize physical activities with similar intensity levels, and then to construct energy expenditure zzso zzso models using neural networks in order to zzso the zzso zzso The zzso of physical activities for zzso model construction is based on the acceleration and zzso signal data collected by zzso sensor zzso developed by our research zzso The proposed zzso consists of procedures for data collection, data zzso activity zzso feature selection, and construction of zzso models using neural zzso In order to reduce the zzso load and achieve satisfactory zzso performance, we employed sequential forward and backward search strategies for feature zzso Two representative neural networks, a zzso basis function network zzso and a generalized zzso neural network zzso were employed as zzso models for performance zzso Our experimental results have successfully validated the effectiveness of our zzso sensor module and its zzso activity zzso zzso for energy expenditure zzso In addition, our results demonstrate the superior performance of zzso as compared to zzso
