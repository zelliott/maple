zzso is common in solid organ transplant zzso zzso with random zzso is performed frequently in the diagnostic evaluation of the zzso population with zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity of zzso with random biopsy in determining a specific diagnosis and changing management in solid organ transplant recipients with zzso 

From October 1996 to June 2008, 88 patients were identified who had undergone solid organ transplantation and subsequently underwent zzso for an indication of zzso These patient's electronic medical records were reviewed to determine patient zzso laboratory results, findings on zzso and zzso and any subsequent diagnoses made and management changes in relation to the zzso 

zzso patients zzso age 54 years, zzso zzso underwent zzso a mean of 69 months after zzso zzso zzso findings were seen in 16 zzso zzso zzso was abnormal in zzso zzso However, only eight zzso had findings on zzso or zzso condition that led to specific diagnosis being zzso In addition, only nine zzso patients had a change in medical management as a direct result of zzso with zzso 

Although zzso or zzso abnormalities are common in the solid organ transplant recipient with zzso the findings rarely lead to a specific diagnosis or management zzso zzso with biopsy should be performed only after zzso testing for infectious zzso and a thorough review and adjustment of zzso In many patients, a trial of zzso medication is warranted before zzso
