The potential for interactions between zzso and zzso or zzso was evaluated in two zzso zzso In study A, healthy subjects received a zzso course of zzso alone zzso zzso administered zzso zzso once zzso zzso zzso 10) or with zzso zzso zzso administered orally twice zzso zzso zzso 9) or zzso zzso zzso administered orally once zzso zzso zzso zzso In study B, 14 subjects received a zzso course of zzso zzso zzso administered orally once daily), with zzso zzso zzso administered IV once zzso zzso on the last 14 days, and 12 subjects received a zzso course of zzso alone zzso zzso administered IV once zzso The zzso alone geometric mean ratio for the zzso area under the zzso profile calculated for the zzso period following dosing zzso was as follows zzso in parentheses are zzso confidence intervals zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso The shape of the zzso plasma profile was altered by zzso resulting in a 14 to zzso reduction in the trough concentration at 24 h after dosing zzso consistent with a net induction effect at steady zzso Both the zzso and the zzso were elevated in the initial days of zzso zzso in study A zzso and zzso zzso respectively, on day 1) but not in study B, consistent with transient net zzso prior to full zzso The zzso alone geometric mean ratio for the zzso zzso on day 14 was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso does not zzso alter zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso resulting in a reduced zzso at steady zzso An increase in the zzso dose to 70 zzso administered daily, should be considered when the drug is zzso with zzso
