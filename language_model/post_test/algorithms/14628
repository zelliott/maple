The zzso L protein of zzso plays a central role in viral zzso replication and zzso This study aimed at providing evidence for the domain structure of L protein by combining zzso with a zzso zzso approach using the zzso virus zzso zzso Potential zzso zzso were predicted using various zzso The prediction was challenged by zzso of flexible sequences into the predicted zzso zzso of 5 or 10 zzso acid zzso was tolerated at seven sites zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso virus zzso At two of these sites, zzso and zzso L protein could be split into an zzso and a zzso part, which were able to zzso each other and zzso a functional complex upon zzso zzso studies revealed physical interaction between the zzso and zzso zzso irrespective of whether L protein was split at zzso or zzso In zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso showed a zzso sometimes zzso zzso distribution similar to that of full-length L zzso while the zzso zzso were zzso distributed in zzso The latter were redistributed into the zzso structures upon zzso with the corresponding zzso zzso In conclusion, this study demonstrates two zzso zzso in zzso virus L zzso at zzso and zzso suggesting that L protein is composed of at least three structural zzso spanning zzso 1 to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso The first domain seems to mediate zzso of L protein into zzso zzso zzso
