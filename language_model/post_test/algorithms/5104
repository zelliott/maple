A zzso model can be represented as a zzso graph zzso linked reaction and zzso zzso Here it is shown how a network of zzso zzso can be assigned to the edges of such a graph by combining the reaction zzso with a zzso zzso property such as molecular zzso A similar flux network can be constructed by combining the primal and dual solutions to the linear programming problem that typically arises in zzso zzso Such constructions may help with the zzso of flux zzso in complex zzso zzso The analysis also explains the strong correlation observed between zzso shadow prices (the dual linear programming zzso and zzso zzso zzso The methods were applied to recent zzso models for zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso results are reported for zzso zzso similar results were found for other zzso
