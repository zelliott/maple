Conventional population zzso considers the evolution of a limited number of zzso corresponding to zzso with different zzso As model zzso in particular zzso secondary structure, have become zzso zzso however, it has become apparent that the context dependent effect of zzso and the zzso nature inherent in these zzso maps can have fundamental evolutionary zzso It has previously been demonstrated that populations of zzso evolving on the neutral networks corresponding to all zzso with the same secondary structure only through neutral zzso can evolve zzso zzso zzso van zzso zzso Crutchfield, zzso zzso zzso evolution of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso zzso by concentrating the population on regions of high zzso zzso zzso we zzso through zzso calculating the stationary distribution of an infinite population on ensembles of random neutral networks that zzso zzso is significantly enhanced and further that the magnitude of this enhancement is sensitive to details of the neutral network zzso Through the simulation of finite populations of zzso evolving on random neutral networks and a scaled down zzso neutral network, we show that even in finite populations zzso will still act to focus the population on regions of locally high zzso
