An zzso for automated analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the marine environment is zzso A standard zzso zzso technique is implemented for obtaining a smoothed spectrum, while the stability of the energy spectrum is achieved by taking advantage of the permanent presence of two energy lines in the marine zzso The automated analysis provides peak zzso net area zzso energy zzso zzso identification and activity zzso The results of the zzso performance, presented for two different cases, show that analysis of short-term zzso with poor statistical information is considerably improved and that incorporation of further zzso could allow the use of the zzso in zzso marine zzso zzso
