The objective of this study was to explore suitable spatial filters for inverse zzso of cortical zzso from the scalp zzso The effect of incorporating noise zzso into inverse procedures was examined by computer simulations and tested in human zzso 

The zzso projection zzso which allows inverse zzso with the presence of information on the noise, was applied to an zzso zzso model under various noise conditions in order to estimate the cortical zzso from the scalp zzso The method for determining the optimum zzso zzso which can be applied for zzso inverse techniques, is also zzso 

Human visual evoked potential experiment was carried out to examine the performance of the proposed restoration zzso The zzso projection filter gave more localized inverse solution of cortical potential distribution than the truncated zzso and zzso zzso 

The present simulation results suggest that incorporation of information on the noise zzso allows better zzso of cortical zzso than inverse solutions without knowledge about the noise zzso when the correlation between the signal and noise is zzso
