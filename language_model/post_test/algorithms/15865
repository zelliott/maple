As a method for the analysis of neural spike trains, we examine fundamental characteristics of zzso zzso zzso reconstruction theoretically with a zzso zzso model and zzso with cricket wind zzso zzso Both the input to the leaky zzso and the stimulus to the wind zzso cells are the time series generated from the zzso zzso By zzso analysis of the leaky zzso it is shown that, even if zzso reconstruction is possible, sometimes the entire structure of the zzso zzso may not be reconstructed with zzso zzso For analysis of the in zzso zzso responses of cricket wind zzso cells, we apply zzso zzso zzso prediction and the surrogate data method to the experimental zzso As a result of the analysis, it is found that there is a significant deterministic structure in the spike zzso By this analysis of zzso data, it is also shown that, even if zzso reconstruction is possible, the entire zzso may not be zzso
