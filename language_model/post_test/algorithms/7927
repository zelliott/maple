The zzso of zzso C zzso zzso strains is an important zzso of the severity and aggressiveness of liver infection as well as patient response to zzso zzso Fast and accurate determination of viral zzso could provide direction in the clinical management of patients with chronic zzso zzso Using publicly available zzso zzso zzso we built a global zzso Weight zzso zzso for the zzso zzso Based on the zzso a set of zzso specific zzso sequence zzso were selected from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions of the zzso zzso We evaluated the zzso power of these signatures for predicting the most common zzso zzso and zzso We observed that zzso sequence signatures selected from zzso and E1 regions generally demonstrated stronger zzso power in zzso major zzso zzso and zzso than that from zzso zzso and zzso zzso Two zzso methods were used to build zzso zzso Through 10 fold cross zzso over zzso prediction accuracy was achieved using both support zzso machine zzso and random forest based zzso methods in a zzso of zzso sequences for zzso and zzso sequences for zzso zzso accuracy for each zzso is also zzso
