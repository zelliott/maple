A large number of zzso have been developed to zzso individuals into discrete populations using genetic zzso Recent results show that the information used by both zzso zzso methods and principal components analysis can be summarized by a zzso of zzso similarity measures between zzso zzso zzso have been constructed in a number of ways, usually treating markers as independent but differing in the weighting given to zzso of different zzso Additionally, methods are now being developed that take linkage into zzso We review several such zzso and evaluate their information zzso A zzso approach for population identification is to first construct a similarity zzso and then perform zzso We review a range of common zzso zzso and evaluate their performance through a simulation zzso The zzso step can be performed either on the zzso or by first using a zzso zzso we find that the latter approach substantially improves the performance of most zzso Based on these results, we describe the population structure signal contained in each similarity zzso and find that accounting for linkage leads to significant improvements for sequence zzso We also perform a comparison on real data, where we find that population zzso models outperform generic zzso approaches, particularly with regard to zzso for features such as zzso between zzso
