The temperature of the zzso of male New Zealand White rabbits was measured by use of infrared zzso At ambient temperatures of 15, 20, and 25 degrees C, the average zzso temperatures were zzso zzso and zzso degrees C, zzso From these temperatures, average heat loss from the total zzso surface area was calculated to be zzso zzso and zzso W, zzso zzso temperature changes also affect the zzso state of the zzso At an ambient temperature of 20 degrees C, cooling the zzso area of the rabbit by approximately 1 degree C resulted in an average zzso temperature of zzso degrees C and a heat loss of zzso zzso zzso the zzso area by approximately 1 degree C resulted in an average zzso temperature of zzso degrees C and a heat loss of zzso zzso Finally, zzso temperatures were measured by use of a zzso and infrared zzso zzso When the zzso were zzso the zzso zzso were consistently higher than the zzso surface temperatures measured zzso When the zzso were zzso the zzso zzso were consistently lower than the zzso surface temperatures measured zzso The zzso between the two methods of measurement is zzso
