The advent of zzso zzso which can efficiently measure gene expression on a global basis, has led to the creation and population of zzso rich databases and zzso Such zzso have the potential to add enormous scientific value beyond that provided by individual studies which, due largely to cost considerations, are typified by small sample zzso zzso substantial effort has been invested in devising analysis schemes for utilizing zzso zzso Here, we focus on one such zzso the zzso zzso zzso that was developed with the express purpose of identifying drugs with putative efficacy against a given disease, where the disease in question is characterized by a zzso zzso zzso zzso claims surrounding zzso zzso that such tools might lead to new, previously unanticipated applications of existing zzso However, further application suggests that its primary utility is in connecting a disease condition whose biology is largely unknown to a drug whose mechanisms of action are well zzso making zzso a tool for enhancing biological zzso success of the zzso zzso is belied by its zzso The aforementioned signature serves as an zzso query which is applied to a customized database of zzso zzso experiments designed to elicit response to a wide range of drugs, across of spectrum of zzso zzso and cell zzso Such application is zzso by computing a per experiment score that measures zzso between the signature and the zzso zzso experiments, and the attendant zzso are then deemed relevant to the disease underlying the zzso zzso supporting such zzso is pursued via zzso In this paper, we revisit two key aspects of the zzso zzso zzso zzso we develop new approaches to measuring closeness for the common scenario wherein the query constitutes an ordered zzso These involve using metrics proposed for analyzing partially ranked data, these being of interest in their own right and not widely zzso zzso we advance an alternate zzso approach based on generating empirical zzso zzso that exploit the zzso and capture zzso embodied by the zzso Using these refinements we undertake a comprehensive zzso of zzso zzso findings that, in general terms, reveal that accommodating ordered queries is less critical than the mode of zzso
