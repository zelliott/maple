Two commercial robotic devices, the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso assist zzso practice of zzso The gait patterns induced by these zzso devices have not been characterized and zzso 

A healthy participant chose the most comfortable gait pattern on each device and for treadmill zzso walking at 1, 2 zzso for the zzso and 3 zzso and over ground at similar zzso A system of zzso on the zzso and feet allowed the calculation of zzso features and zzso during the gait zzso 

At the 1 and 2 zzso speed settings, zzso stance times were prolonged on the devices compared with zzso zzso zzso on the zzso were decreased by adjusting the hip and knee angles and step zzso At the 3 zzso setting, the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso to heel contact were induced by the devices, especially at slower zzso 

The zzso and zzso impose mechanical constraints that may alter leg zzso during stance and swing zzso as well as stance zzso especially at their slower speed settings, that are not found during TM and zzso zzso The potential impact of these zzso on training to improve gait needs further zzso
