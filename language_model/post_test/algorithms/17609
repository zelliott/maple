zzso therapies remain a major problem in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the proportion of inappropriate therapies is a major zzso With the addition of zzso detection and advanced zzso zzso zzso are designed to offer better discrimination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The present zzso open study aimed to evaluate the performance of a zzso detection algorithm, the zzso View algorithm, incorporated in a zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Paul, Minnesota, zzso 

Fifty-one patients zzso zzso zzso years, ejection fraction zzso with standard indications received a zzso zzso zzso which zzso within the VT zone zzso stability, zzso zzso zzso rate and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso stability 24 zzso onset zzso zzso zzso threshold 200 zzso and zzso An additional sustained rate duration criterion was programmed at least at 30 zzso zzso were interrogated every 3 months or when patients received zzso A blinded review of zzso for zzso diagnosis and appropriateness of therapy was performed by 2 zzso Over the follow-up period zzso zzso a total of 400 zzso episodes was recorded within the VT zzso After the review of stored zzso 237 zzso true positive, 143 zzso true negative, 17 zzso false positive and 3 zzso false negative episodes were zzso Considering the 3 zzso incorrectly detected by the detection zzso therapy was delivered in 2 cases after sustained rate duration and 1 VT reverted zzso zzso therapy occurred in 17 zzso All but 1 were related to zzso with zzso zzso zzso Finally, on a per episode basis, the detection zzso sensitivity was zzso and specificity was zzso 

zzso of detection criteria based on stability, zzso zzso zzso rate threshold and zzso allows a zzso sensitivity and an zzso specificity in zzso zzso Discrimination of zzso with zzso zzso relationship, however, remains a challenge for which new zzso have to be zzso
