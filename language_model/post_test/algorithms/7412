Many proteins tune their biological function by transitioning between different functional states, effectively acting as dynamic molecular zzso zzso structural characterization of transition zzso is central to understanding the relationship between protein dynamics and zzso zzso approaches that build on the zzso zzso framework are in principle able to model transition zzso at great detail but also at considerable zzso zzso zzso that delay consideration of dynamics and focus instead on zzso zzso zzso paths connecting two zzso structures provide a complementary zzso zzso zzso path planning methods originating in zzso have been recently proposed to produce zzso zzso These methods largely model short peptides or address large proteins by simplifying zzso zzso 

We propose a zzso method that connects two given structures of a protein by sampling zzso zzso The method focuses on small- to medium-size zzso efficiently modeling structural zzso through the use of the molecular zzso replacement zzso In particular, the method grows a tree in zzso space rooted at the start structure, steering the tree to a goal region defined around the goal zzso We investigate various bias schemes over a progress coordinate for balance between coverage of zzso space and progress towards the zzso A geometric projection layer promotes path zzso A zzso temperature scheme allows sampling of rare paths that cross energy zzso 

zzso are conducted on small- to medium-size proteins of length up to 214 zzso acids and with multiple known zzso states, some of which are more than zzso apart of zzso Analysis reveals that the method effectively zzso zzso paths connecting structural states that are significantly zzso A detailed analysis on the depth and breadth of the tree suggests that a soft global bias over the progress coordinate enhances sampling and results in higher path zzso The explicit geometric projection layer that biases the exploration away from zzso regions further increases coverage, often improving proximity to the goal by forcing the exploration to find new zzso The zzso temperature scheme is shown effective in increasing path diversity, particularly in difficult structural transitions with known zzso zzso
