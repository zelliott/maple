This paper presents and discusses the liquid density sensing potential of a delay line zzso sensor zzso where Lamb wave is excited only by zzso zzso zzso without membrane when zzso An zzso cut orientation and the zzso thickness of zzso by using genetic zzso is presented to improve the sensitivity of the sensor and to get low zzso Experimental zzso performed on zzso device zzso from zzso zzso in a delay line zzso are found to be in agreement with theoretical zzso
