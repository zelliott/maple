We introduce a framework for simulating signal propagation in geometric networks zzso that can be mapped to geometric zzso in some zzso and developing zzso that estimate zzso zzso the state and functional zzso of complex dynamic geometric zzso Within the zzso we define the key features typically present in such networks and of particular relevance to biological cellular neural zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The framework is particularly well suited for zzso functional connectivity in cellular neural networks from zzso zzso data and has been implemented using graphics processing unit zzso zzso zzso the framework can simulate cellular network signaling close to or faster than real zzso We further propose a standard test set of networks to measure performance and compare different mapping zzso
