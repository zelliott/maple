To develop a zzso population zzso model based on gastric zzso function for zzso plasma concentration in critically ill patients tolerant and intolerant to zzso nutrition before and after zzso zzso 

zzso plasma zzso were available from a study with 10 tolerant and 20 intolerant patients before and after zzso therapy with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso was carried out in a zzso mixed effects analysis software, zzso 

A zzso zzso model for stomach, zzso central and peripheral compartments was zzso The rate of zzso of the stomach was described by a zzso rate zzso The final model has two gastric zzso rate constant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the intolerant group before zzso therapy and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for both the intolerant group after zzso therapy and the tolerant zzso Other parameters and estimates zzso in the model were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso L zzso and zzso L zzso 

The zzso zzso population zzso model adequately described the zzso The gastric zzso zzso is improved by a factor of about 20 in the patients that are intolerant to zzso nutrition after treatment with zzso zzso
