Type 1 diabetes zzso zzso is a zzso disease caused by a long-term negative balance between zzso zzso damage and zzso zzso Following zzso damage the zzso fate depends on several genes zzso or zzso in parallel and/or zzso Based on the information obtained by the analysis of several zzso experiments of zzso exposed to zzso conditions zzso double stranded zzso zzso and zzso we have developed a spotted rat zzso zzso the zzso containing zzso zzso for zzso genes selected for the study of zzso zzso 

The zzso was validated by a combination of zzso First we performed an internal validation of the spotted zzso based on a weighted linear zzso model using dilution series zzso Second we zzso expression zzso in ten dissimilar rat zzso samples for 515 genes that were represented on both the spotted zzso collection and on the in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Internal validation showed that most of the spotted zzso displayed a pattern of reaction close to that predicted by the zzso By using simple rules for comparison of data between platforms we found strong correlations zzso zzso between relative gene expression zzso made with spotted zzso and in zzso zzso probe zzso 

In conclusion our data suggest that there is a high zzso of the zzso in terms of technical replication and that relative gene expression zzso obtained with the zzso compare well to the zzso zzso The zzso is available to the scientific community and is a useful tool to study the molecular mechanisms regulating zzso zzso
