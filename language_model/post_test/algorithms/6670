The pulse height weighting integration method for measuring zzso using a plastic zzso has been developed through zzso Carlo simulations and laboratory zzso In order to design an optimal detector zzso the parameters of zzso thickness and plastic zzso thickness were investigated by zzso for their influences on the energy response for zzso Based on the calculated deposited zzso in the plastic zzso for electrons with various incident zzso a weighting function zzso folded with the deposited energy zzso was introduced in order to obtain a flat energy response in the low energy zzso A constant response within zzso was confirmed, by zzso for electrons with energy zzso zzso In addition, a preliminary experiment was performed using three beta sources zzso zzso zzso and the energy response within zzso for beta rays with the maximum energy zzso zzso was zzso Some factors causing uncertainties in the zzso are also discussed in this zzso
