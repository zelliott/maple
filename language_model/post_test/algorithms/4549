The objective of the present work is to investigate the presence or absence of a critical concentration of zzso starch according to the zzso theory for a truly zzso system with respect to a minimum disintegration zzso The results of this study show that the application of zzso theory is not limited to the study of zzso zzso In this work it is shown how it can be used to analyze the behavior of zzso and zzso systems for caffeine and zzso acid zzso containing a zzso zzso The zzso threshold zzso can be described by the zzso ratio of the zzso to the drug substance being equal to zzso zzso zzso zzso in in which both components have similar average particle zzso In addition, the behavior of the disintegration time in the neighborhood of the zzso threshold can be zzso modeled with the basic equation of the zzso theory yielding a critical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
