This paper describes a new method for zzso wave zzso zzso that is capable of zzso zzso automatically without zzso zzso The proposed method is an zzso random sample consensus zzso and the metric used here is finding the certain percentage of zzso according to the closest distance zzso To evaluate the method, the simulation and phantom experiment results were compared using linear zzso with all points zzso and zzso sum transform zzso zzso The assessment reveals that the relative biases of mean zzso are zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso respectively for zzso zzso zzso and zzso for phantom zzso The results suggested that the proposed zzso zzso is accurate in zzso wave speed zzso
