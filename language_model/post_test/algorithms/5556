zzso of the performance of the new zzso of the zzso London for screening for zzso 21 using a combination of maternal age, fetal zzso zzso zzso and maternal serum free zzso and zzso 

Between 2002 and 2007, zzso was measured zzso in zzso zzso in the context of routinely performed first zzso screening in zzso Individual zzso 21 risks were calculated by a combination of zzso maternal age, free zzso and zzso using the zzso zzso in force at the time of zzso In this study we zzso the zzso 21 risks applying the new zzso of the zzso UK that includes the new mixture model for the zzso zzso 

zzso singleton zzso could be included in the study of which 109 zzso zzso had a zzso zzso Only 35 % of the zzso zzso of zzso were above the median and 25 % of the zzso zzso were below the 5th zzso of the zzso zzso For zzso that were qualified according to level II or III of the German zzso system, the median zzso of fetuses with zzso 21 was zzso zzso above the median of the zzso UK and only zzso zzso above the median for all other zzso Despite the limited performance of the zzso zzso the overall detection rate for a zzso 21 was zzso % when combining the zzso with maternal age, zzso and free zzso The overall zzso rate for a zzso 21 was zzso % at a zzso value of zzso 

In this study we were able to show that the use of the new risk zzso of the zzso UK leads to a zzso 21 detection rate of about 90 % at a 5 % zzso rate in a German collective despite a significant zzso of the zzso
