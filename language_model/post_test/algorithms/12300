We study zzso the effect of zzso structured connectivity on the behavior of zzso zzso The steady state equations are derived for a generic zzso function, and then we focus on their solutions in the case of networks composed of three alternative simple zzso model zzso zzso zzso or smoothly zzso zzso For a connectivity which is short range enough the zzso network shows localized retrieval zzso The zzso and zzso models also exhibit zzso modulated retrieval states if the highest activity level that they can achieve is above the maximum activity of the units in the stored zzso We show that this zzso level together with the linear gain of the transfer function are important parameters that determine the possibility of localized zzso If the ratio of the number of stored patterns to the number of connections per unit goes to zero, while the latter goes to zzso it is possible to derive an zzso formula for the critical value of the connectivity zzso below which one observes zzso zzso retrieval zzso The formula is also shown to offer a good first approximation for higher storage zzso We show that even in the case of localized retrieval the storage capacity remains zzso to the number of connections per zzso with the zzso constant lower by a factor of zzso compared to uniform zzso The approach that we present here is generic in the sense that there are no specific assumptions on the single unit zzso function nor on the exact connectivity zzso
