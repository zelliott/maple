Air quality zzso currently in use have been criticized because they do not capture additive effects of multiple pollutants, or reflect the apparent zzso zzso relationship between air pollution and zzso We propose a new air quality health index zzso constructed as the sum of excess mortality risk associated with individual pollutants from a zzso analysis of air pollution and mortality in Canadian cities, adjusted to a zzso scale, and calculated hourly on the basis of trailing zzso average zzso zzso zzso sensitivity analyses were conducted using alternative combinations of pollutants from single and zzso zzso All zzso considered produced frequency zzso of the daily maximum zzso that were zzso with modal values of 3 or 4, and less than zzso of values at 7 or above on the zzso zzso In the absence of a gold standard and given the uncertainty in how to best reflect the mix of pollutants, we recommend a zzso based on associations of nitrogen dioxide, zzso and particulate matter of median aerodynamic diameter less than zzso zzso with mortality from zzso zzso Further sensitivity analyses revealed good agreement of this zzso with others based on alternative sources of zzso drawn from published studies of mortality and zzso These analyses provide evidence that the zzso represents a valid approach to zzso an index with the objective of allowing people to judge the relative probability of experiencing adverse health effects from day to zzso Together with health messages and a graphic display, the zzso scale appears promising as an air quality risk communication zzso
