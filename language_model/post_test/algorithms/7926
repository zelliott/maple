This study is primarily focused toward measuring the particle size distribution and chemical analysis of particulate matter that originates from combustion sources typically found in Indian urban zzso Four such sources were zzso zzso incense stick, zzso zzso and zzso the latter being actually a thick form of incense zzso Altogether, seven of the most popular brands available in the Indian market were zzso zzso size distribution in the smoke was measured using a scanning mobility particle zzso using both long and zzso forms of differential mobility zzso zzso with readings averaged from four to six zzso The measurable particle size range of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso to zzso zzso whereas that of the long zzso was zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso readings obtained from the long and the zzso zzso were compared for different brands as well as for different zzso An overlap was seen in the readings in the common range of zzso The lowest value of peak concentration was seen for one brand of incense stick zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the highest zzso zzso zzso zzso was seen for the zzso Generally, these sources showed a peak between 140 and 170 zzso however, 2 incense stick brands showed zzso at 79 zzso and 89 zzso The zzso showed results much different from the rest of the sources, with a mode at around 240 zzso Chemical analysis in terms of three heavy metals zzso zzso and zzso was performed using zzso tube zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were made to assess the expected cancer and zzso risks, using published toxicity zzso for these three heavy zzso Our calculations revealed that all the sources showed lead zzso much below the American Conference of zzso Industrial zzso zzso threshold limit value zzso zzso One of the two zzso zzso brands zzso showed cadmium zzso two times higher than the California Environmental Protection Agency zzso zzso reference exposure level zzso The latter also showed the highest zzso risks of 350 people per million zzso The amount of zinc obtained from the sources, however, was found to be quite below the standard limits, zzso no risk in terms of zzso
