A computer algebra tool for describing the zzso quantum evolution of nuclear zzso is introduced and implemented within a zzso framework named Spin zzso by Computer zzso System zzso A distinctive feature compared with zzso and previous computer algebra approaches to solving spin dynamics problems results from the fact that no zzso representation for spin operators is used in zzso which determines a full symbolic character to the performed zzso Spin correlations are stored in zzso as zzso zzso lists of which size increases zzso with the number of spins into the system and are easily mapped into zzso expressions in terms of spin operator zzso For the so defined zzso spin correlations a set of specialized functions and procedures is introduced that are essential for implementing basic spin algebra operations, such as the spin operator products, zzso and zzso zzso They provide results in an abstract zzso form: specific procedures to zzso evaluate such symbolic expressions with respect to the involved spin interaction parameters and experimental conditions are also zzso Although the main focus in the present work is on laying the foundation for spin dynamics symbolic zzso in zzso based on a zzso zzso practical aspects are also considered throughout the theoretical development zzso In particular, specific zzso routines have been implemented using the zzso computer algebra package zzso and their functionality was demonstrated on a few illustrative zzso
