zzso methods have a significant advantage to reduce the complexity of genes expression data and to make them more comprehensible and zzso In this paper, based on penalized zzso decomposition zzso a novel approach is proposed to extract plants core zzso zzso the characteristic gene set, responding to zzso zzso Core genes can capture the changes of the zzso In other words, the features of samples can be caught by the core zzso The experimental results show that the proposed zzso method is efficient to extract the core genes closely related to the zzso zzso
