zzso zzso contact maps provide a translation and rotation zzso zzso representation of a zzso They can be used as an zzso step in protein structure zzso However, the prediction of contact maps represents an unbalanced problem as far fewer examples of contacts than zzso exist in a protein zzso this study we explore the possibility of completely eliminating the unbalanced nature of the contact map prediction problem by predicting zzso distances between zzso zzso full zzso distance maps and applying them in protein structure predictions has been relatively unexplored in the zzso 

We initially demonstrate that the use of zzso distance maps is able to reproduce zzso structures almost identical to the targets, giving an average zzso of zzso In addition, the corrupted physical maps with an introduced random error of zzso are able to reconstruct the targets within an average zzso of zzso demonstrating the reconstruction potential of distance zzso we develop two classes of zzso using two-dimensional zzso neural zzso an zzso zzso predictor that relies only on the protein sequence and evolutionary information, and a zzso predictor in which additional structural zzso information is zzso We find that the zzso zzso predictor is able to reproduce distances with an zzso of zzso regardless of the evolutionary content zzso Furthermore, we show that the zzso predictor exploits both sequence and structure information even in cases of dubious zzso and zzso the best template hit with a clear margin of up to zzso we demonstrate the ability of the two zzso to reconstruct the zzso targets shorter than 200 zzso producing the results similar to the state of the machine learning art approach implemented in the zzso zzso 

The methodology presented here, if zzso by more complex reconstruction zzso can represent a possible path to improve machine learning zzso for zzso protein structure zzso Moreover, it can be used as an zzso step in protein structure predictions either on its own or zzso by zzso zzso
