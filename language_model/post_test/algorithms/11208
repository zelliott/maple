The influence of zzso pH on retention of zzso zzso during organic modifier zzso in zzso high performance liquid zzso is zzso Two approaches are examined for the retention prediction of zzso under organic modifier zzso conditions at any constant mobile phase zzso In the first approach an zzso solution of the fundamental equation of zzso zzso in linear organic modifier zzso for zzso zzso under certain assumptions is zzso The second approach is based on an empirical model arising from the evaluation of the zzso retention zzso Both approaches were successfully applied to describe the retention behavior of 16 zzso derivatives of zzso acids obtained in 19 simple zzso organic modifier zzso runs performed between two given zzso contents with different zzso duration and at different zzso zzso in a particular pH range where zzso acids behave as weak zzso zzso Further, this study provides a reliable way for zzso zzso zzso of zzso compounds with respect to mobile phase zzso
