The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association of zzso with an increase or reduction of zzso muscle zzso due to severe cerebral zzso 

zzso patients with zzso after severe cerebral damage were zzso Three groups were defined based on the presence of zzso zzso as resistance to passive stretch zzso zzso and the presence of zzso of the relevant knee zzso zzso (17 patients with zzso without zzso zzso (20 patients with zzso and zzso and zzso zzso patients without zzso and with zzso In all groups spontaneous zzso muscle activity was assessed continuously over a 12-hour period through zzso measurement of knee joint zzso zzso A mathematical zzso differentiated an hourly muscle activity spectrum zzso The frequency of zzso zzso from the activity spectrum was zzso 

We revealed that zzso had higher zzso and more frequent zzso compared with zzso and zzso zzso zzso had comparable zzso and zzso compared with zzso zzso 

The presence of zzso was associated with lower zzso muscle zzso in terms of lower zzso and less frequent zzso indicating that zzso may be associated with reduced zzso positive features of the upper motor zzso syndrome in patients with severe brain zzso
