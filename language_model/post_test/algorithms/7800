zzso zzso necrosis after immediate tissue zzso placement can have profound zzso resulting in prosthetic infection zzso tissue zzso zzso The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of timed, surgical zzso during continued serial expansion in the setting of mastectomy zzso necrosis and to identify an zzso for surgeons faced with the management of this difficult zzso 

zzso patients in whom documented mastectomy zzso necrosis developed following immediate tissue zzso placement from 1995 to 2008 were zzso Patient zzso zzso and complication data were obtained from a zzso maintained clinical zzso Medical records were then zzso reviewed to further characterize the extent of mastectomy zzso necrosis and its zzso 

Over the zzso study period, 178 patients with documented mastectomy zzso necrosis following immediate tissue zzso were zzso In 58 patients zzso percent), surgical zzso of the mastectomy zzso necrosis was zzso zzso zzso occurred a mean 36 days zzso 8 to 153 zzso after tissue zzso zzso Mean surface area of zzso excised was zzso zzso zzso zzso to 240 zzso In nine zzso percent) of the 58 patients, zzso of such an extensive area of mastectomy zzso necrosis necessitated zzso of the tissue zzso and subsequent zzso closure zzso advancement zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Of the remaining patients, only three (6 percent) developed a subsequent infection zzso the premature removal of a tissue zzso 

Timed zzso with continued expansion is a straightforward procedure associated with a low zzso of zzso This approach allows for salvage of a significant percentage of threatened tissue zzso and may be coordinated with zzso zzso therapy without excessive zzso
