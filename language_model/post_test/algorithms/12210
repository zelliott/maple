zzso carbon was produced from a zzso product, zzso sawdust zzso using steam in a high temperature zzso bed zzso zzso were carried out to investigate the influence of various process parameters such as zzso time, zzso temperature, particle size and zzso zzso on the quality of the activated zzso The activated carbon was characterized based on its zzso number, zzso blue number, zzso Emmet zzso zzso surface area and surface area obtained using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso retention zzso The best quality activated carbon was obtained at an zzso time and temperature of zzso and 750 degrees C for an average particle size of zzso zzso The zzso zzso shows that zzso rate fitted the zzso zzso better than zzso rate zzso The zzso capacity of carbon produced from zzso was found to be zzso zzso zzso for the zzso Brown zzso The rate constant and diffusion zzso for zzso transport were determined for steam activated zzso The characteristic of the prepared activated carbon was found comparable to the commercial activated zzso
