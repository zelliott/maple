In this paper, we present a new method to modify the appearance of a face image by manipulating the zzso condition, when the face geometry and zzso information is zzso This problem is particularly difficult when there is only a single image of the subject zzso Recent research demonstrates that the set of images of a convex zzso object obtained under a wide variety of lighting conditions can be zzso accurately by a zzso linear zzso using a zzso harmonic zzso Moreover, zzso models are statistical ensembles of facial properties such as shape and zzso In this paper, we integrate zzso zzso into the zzso model framework by proposing a zzso zzso harmonic basis zzso model zzso The proposed method can represent a face under arbitrary unknown lighting and pose simply by three zzso zzso zzso shape zzso zzso harmonic basis zzso and zzso zzso which are called the zzso zzso However, when the image was taken under an extreme lighting condition, the approximation error can be large, thus making it difficult to recover zzso zzso In order to address this problem, we propose a zzso framework that uses a zzso random field to model the statistical distribution and spatial zzso of face texture, which makes our approach not only robust to extreme lighting conditions, but also insensitive to partial zzso The performance of our framework is demonstrated through various experimental results, including the improved rates for face recognition under extreme lighting zzso
