zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso determination of summed stress score zzso is of established importance for zzso planning in coronary artery zzso zzso in zzso finding suggest zzso influence on zzso if heart axes are chosen zzso Thus, this study zzso the influence of zzso tilt on zzso calculation using zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

Stress zzso of 50 men acquired on a zzso gamma camera were correctly zzso by experienced technologists zzso and then zzso by 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso degrees along both long axes zzso zzso images were zzso for zzso using zzso and zzso zzso values for zzso and zzso were analyzed using correlation zzso zzso zzso values zzso were calculated to measure agreement regarding zzso zzso severity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

For zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso remained very high (R zzso zzso up to 20 degrees, but zzso for higher tilts (R zzso zzso for 30 zzso zzso zzso showed comparable zzso correlation only up to 10 degrees (R zzso zzso and strong deterioration thereafter (R zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso in severity class from zzso increased from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso and from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso 

For zzso zzso zzso considerable differences in zzso calculation emerge using zzso and zzso zzso showed more stable results than zzso
