zzso of heavy metals from contaminated environments is an emerging field of interest from both resource conservation and environmental zzso points of zzso This study investigated the feasibility of using zzso zzso a waste zzso of the zzso mining industry, as an effective zzso for zzso from zzso zzso The major parameters controlling zzso zzso zzso zzso initial metal zzso zzso solution zzso zzso zzso zzso strength and presence of both zzso and organic zzso were evaluated using batch zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso removal efficiency of zzso clay is controlled mainly by dissolution of zzso clay associated zzso zzso followed by subsequent zzso of zzso stable zzso zzso which was confirmed by both X-ray zzso zzso and scanning electron microscopic zzso zzso Lead removal efficiency of zzso clay increased with increasing zzso zzso amount and decreasing zzso zzso It also depends on the nature of zzso zzso zzso of zzso calcium zzso and lead zzso in the presence of zzso acid explained high zzso of zzso by zzso clay from zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso onto zzso clay were zzso with initially fast reactions followed by slow and continuous zzso removal zzso The slow reactions may include surface zzso zzso and zzso The exceptional capability of zzso clay to remove zzso zzso demonstrated its potential as a cost effective way to zzso zzso water, zzso and zzso
