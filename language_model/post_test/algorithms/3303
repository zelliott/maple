zzso surface approximation of 3-D zzso regions from sparse zzso images zzso mouse brain zzso bulb structures from a zzso brain zzso has proven to be difficult due to the presence of zzso shared boundary surfaces that are not handled by traditional zzso data structures and zzso zzso We describe a data structure and an zzso to reconstruct separating surfaces among multiple regions from sparse zzso zzso We define a zzso graph for each region, that describes the zzso skeleton of the region's boundary surface and that shows between which contours the surface patches should be zzso We provide a zzso zzso zzso to reconstruct surface patches between zzso We combine our zzso zzso zzso together with a zzso zzso curve fitting technique to ensure that abutting or shared surface patches are precisely zzso We show that our method overcomes limitations in 1) traditional zzso zzso that assume zzso not zzso zzso of space, and in 2) few existing separating surfaces zzso that assume conversion of input into a regular zzso grid, which is not possible with sparse zzso zzso
