zzso zzso of multiple myeloma patients experience zzso zzso zzso This is principally due to myeloma zzso a zzso injury caused by high circulating zzso of zzso free light zzso Studies have found that between zzso and 37% of patients with myeloma kidney requiring dialysis recover zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that extended zzso using high zzso zzso zzso can remove significant quantities of free light chains and is associated with a zzso recovery rate of zzso in these zzso 

The objective of this study was to assess the zzso of zzso compared to standard HD in the management of myeloma zzso 

The study used a lifetime zzso decision tree model that followed all patients from treatment of the initial presentation with myeloma kidney requiring dialysis to zzso It was populated with published clinical data, United Kingdom costs and expert opinion, using a National Health Service perspective and zzso annual zzso 

zzso was dominant to standard zzso meaning it was both more effective zzso life years and quality adjusted life zzso and less costly, due to a greater increase in the proportion of patients recovering zzso zzso The model projected lifetime costs of zzso per patient for patients treated with standard zzso only and zzso for the new treatment zzso The model predicted an average survival of zzso months for patients on standard HD and zzso months for the new therapy zzso 

The analysis found that treatment of myeloma kidney using an extended schedule of zzso may substantially improve zzso recovery in multiple myeloma patients compared to standard zzso resulting in greater life expectancy and cost savings due to avoided chronic zzso zzso of the study include those common to rare diseases including small study sizes and limited natural history zzso
