When investigating a new therapy, there is often some zzso that the treatment is more efficient (or efficient only) in a zzso as compared to the total patient zzso In this situation, the target population for the proof of efficacy is commonly selected in a zzso way, for example, based on the results of a pilot study or a planned interim zzso The performance of the applied selection rule is crucial for the success of a clinical trial or even a drug development zzso We consider the situation in which the selection of the patient population is based on a zzso and where the diagnostic that evaluates the zzso may be perfect, that is, with zzso sensitivity and zzso or zzso We develop methods that allow an evaluation of the operational characteristics of rules for selecting the target population, thus enabling the choice of an appropriate zzso zzso the proposed procedures can be used to calculate the sample size required to achieve a specified selection zzso Furthermore, we derive optimal selection rules by modeling the uncertainty about parameters by prior zzso Throughout, there is a strong impact of sensitivity and specificity of the zzso on the zzso It is therefore essential to evaluate the rules for patient selection before applying them, thereby bearing in mind that the diagnostic that evaluates the applied zzso may be zzso
