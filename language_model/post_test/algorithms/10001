We study random graph models for directed zzso zzso a class of networks that includes citation networks, food zzso and zzso neural networks among zzso We propose two specific models roughly analogous to the fixed edge number and fixed edge probability zzso of traditional zzso random zzso We calculate a number of properties of these models, including particularly the probability of connection between a given pair of zzso and compare the results with real-world zzso network data finding that theory and zzso agree surprisingly zzso better than the often poor agreement of other random graph models with their corresponding real-world zzso
