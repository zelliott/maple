To improve outcomes in open heart surgery zzso patients, the zzso Care Improvement Project zzso requires 6 am zzso day zzso 1 and 2 blood zzso zzso to be zzso This study examined risk factors for zzso noncompliance when using an insulin infusion protocol zzso and evaluated this zzso metric as a surrogate for zzso zzso The authors divided 99 consecutive zzso patients, all subjected to 1 uniform zzso into 2 groups: Group zzso zzso zzso and Group zzso zzso zzso They determined mean zzso for the first 48 zzso hours, percent of total time with zzso zzso time zzso zzso for each group, and assessed risk of zzso noncompliance as relates to multiple risk factors including intensity of zzso application, and switching to subcutaneous zzso insulin prior to 6 am on zzso zzso Group 1 had lower mean zzso than Group 2 and percent of total time with zzso zzso zzso analysis showed diabetes, obesity in zzso and switching to zzso insulin prior to 6 am on zzso 2 to be risk factors for zzso zzso The 6 am zzso values on zzso 1 or zzso 2 each correlated with average zzso zzso and compliance with the zzso zzso metric was associated with virtually uniform zzso zzso zzso application was not significantly different between groups zzso Only patients who had been switched to zzso insulin prior to 6 am zzso 2 were zzso at 6 am on zzso zzso There were zzso events zzso zzso in 15 of 99 patients zzso 12 of whom zzso were in Group zzso zzso with this zzso measure occurred more frequently in patients with diabetes or, if zzso in those patients with zzso A trend toward increased insulin assessments in the zzso zzso group suggests that 1 uniform zzso for all patients may not be zzso By not requiring the reporting of zzso zzso may inadvertently be exposing patients to zzso
