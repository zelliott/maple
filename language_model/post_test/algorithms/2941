zzso zzso maps were obtained using either zzso zzso or MR zzso in attempts to determine the structure of the type II restriction zzso zzso bound to zzso While neither solution strategy was particularly promising zzso correlation zzso of zzso and zzso with the final model, respectively, for the zzso and MR zzso and zzso Z scores of zzso and zzso for the rotation and translation zzso phase combination followed by density modification gave a readily zzso zzso MR with a zzso related model located a zzso in the zzso unit and provided the correct transformation to use in averaging electron density between zzso zzso zzso data sets with low substitution and MR solutions from only zzso related models should not be ignored, as zzso starting zzso can be significantly zzso The zzso strategy employed to improve the initial zzso zzso is zzso
