The zzso zzso rate ratios are estimated by zzso sequence comparison and joint likelihood analysis using zzso zzso b genes of 28 zzso species, representing both the zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso apes, and zzso zzso comparison reveals a strong negative correlation between estimates of the zzso ratio and the sequence distance, even when both are corrected for multiple zzso The zzso estimate of the zzso ratio changes with the species included in the zzso The zzso bias within the zzso zzso is found to be as strong as in the zzso in contradiction to an earlier study which sampled only one zzso zzso show the surprising result that both the zzso correction method and the joint likelihood analysis tend to zzso for multiple zzso and overestimate the zzso ratio, especially at low sequence zzso The bias, however, is not large enough to account for the observed zzso zzso frequency zzso variation of substitution rates among sites, and different evolutionary dynamics at the three zzso positions can be ruled out as possible zzso The zzso test suggests that the zzso rate ratios may be variable among evolutionary zzso Without any biological evidence for such a variation, however, we are left with no plausible explanations for the observed patterns other than a possible zzso effect due to the unrealistic nature of the model zzso
