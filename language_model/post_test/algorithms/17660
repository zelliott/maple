An zzso was developed to locally zzso gaps from the zzso zzso Over 2 million gaps were identified from all versus all zzso structure zzso and zzso of zzso gaps and zzso regions zzso between 90,000 and 135,000 sequence fragments were extracted for statistical zzso Relative to background zzso gaps were enriched in zzso types with small side chains and high turn propensity zzso G, zzso zzso zzso and were depleted in zzso types with zzso side chains zzso zzso I, zzso zzso W, zzso In contrast, regions zzso a gap exhibited opposite trends in zzso acid zzso zzso enrichment in zzso zzso and a high degree of secondary zzso zzso scores of zzso type as a function of position in or around a gap were derived from the zzso Three simple experiments demonstrated that these scores contained significant zzso zzso First, regions where gaps were observed in single sequences taken from zzso zzso multiple sequence alignments generally scored higher than regions where gaps were not zzso Second, given the correct zzso cores, the actual positions of gaps could be reproduced from sequence more accurately using the zzso statistics than by using random zzso zzso Finally, revision of the zzso zzso gap opening parameters with this new information improved the agreement of zzso alignments with the zzso zzso At least three applications for these results are zzso improvement of gap penalties in zzso (or zzso sequence zzso prediction of regions of single sequences likely (or zzso to contain zzso and more accurate placement of gaps in automated zzso structure zzso
