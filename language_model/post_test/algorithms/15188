A critical requirement of zzso interventions is the zzso of an instrument zzso zzso zzso during the zzso One approach is to fill the instrument with a contrast zzso Previously, the zzso of contrast agent zzso was performed only zzso In the present study, an zzso zzso of contrast agent zzso efficiency was performed for a zzso zzso echo pulse zzso 

zzso flip angle, repetition time, echo time, and contrast agent concentration were derived zzso The solution is valid for any contrast agent, provided the relationship between zzso , zzso , and doping concentration is zzso 

Phantom experiments validated the zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso contrast zzso zzso showed excellent agreement between zzso predicted and theoretically observed zzso zzso In zzso experiments demonstrated zzso contrast agent zzso in brain, heart, and prostate zzso The results demonstrated the large zzso that can be achieved with zzso zzso As a practical zzso an zzso dilution of 500 zzso zzso solution, repetition time zzso 4 zzso echo time zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso was found to provide a large zzso 

This study derived and validated a method for zzso zzso contrast agent zzso zzso This information may be useful for visualizing instruments during zzso zzso
