The mechanism of separating charged species by zzso zzso zzso was modeled with the conditions of zzso zzso by using a simple random zzso The most novel aspect of the work rests with the assumption that in sufficiently high electric field zzso sample components can also migrate in the zzso state on the zzso surface of the stationary zzso This feature of zzso leads to the introduction of three zzso zzso zzso reduced mobility of a sample component with the zzso mobility as the zzso zzso the zzso retention zzso and zzso the ratio of the zzso migration zzso and the zzso of surface zzso Since the interplay of zzso and zzso forces determines the overall migration zzso the separation mechanism in zzso is governed by the relative importance of the above zzso The model predicts conditions under which the features of the zzso system zzso migration behavior that zzso itself in a relatively narrow zzso window and in a zzso like zzso pattern in the separation of peptides and proteins by using pro forma zzso zzso It is believed that such zzso patterns, which resemble those obtained by the use of external zzso of the zzso are brought about by the formation of an internal zzso in the zzso system that gave rise to zzso peak zzso The peculiarities of zzso are discussed in the three operational zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso which is often called zzso zzso on zzso zzso is an zzso tool with great potential in the separation of peptides and zzso
