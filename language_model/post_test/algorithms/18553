Training data in a supervised learning problem consist of the class label and its potential zzso for a set of zzso zzso effective zzso from training data is the goal of supervised zzso In biomedical sciences and other scientific applications, class labels may be subject to zzso We consider a setting where there are two classes but observations with labels corresponding to one of the classes may in fact be zzso The application concerns the use of protein zzso data to discriminate between serum samples from cancer and zzso zzso The patients in the training set are classified on the basis of tissue zzso Although biopsy is zzso specific in the sense that a tissue that shows itself to have zzso cells is certainly cancer, it is less than zzso zzso zzso gold standards that are subject to this special type of zzso due to imperfect diagnosis certainty arise in many zzso We consider the development of a supervised learning zzso under these conditions and refer to it as partially supervised zzso Boosting is a supervised learning zzso geared toward zzso predictor data, such as those generated in protein zzso We propose a modification of the boosting zzso for partially supervised zzso The proposal is to view the true class membership of the samples that are labeled with the zzso class label as missing data, and apply an zzso related to the zzso zzso for zzso of a loss zzso To assess the usefulness of the proposed method, we artificially zzso a subset of samples and applied the original and zzso boosting zzso zzso for zzso zzso improvements in zzso rates are observed with zzso
