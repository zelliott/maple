We present the zzso of an zzso vision based zzso zzso zzso In this zzso system, the user is wearing a pair of glasses with a forward looking camera, and is actively engaged in the control loop of the robot in navigational zzso The zzso vision glasses serve for two zzso First, it serves as a source of visual input to request the robot to find a certain object in the zzso Second, the motion patterns zzso from the zzso video associated with a specific set of head movements are exploited to guide the robot to find the zzso These are especially helpful for zzso individuals who do not have needed hand functionality for interaction and control with other zzso zzso zzso In our zzso system, when the robot does not fulfill the object finding task in a zzso time window, it would actively solicit user controls for zzso Then the users can use the zzso vision based gesture interface to orient the robot towards the direction of the zzso After that the robot will automatically navigate towards the object until it finds zzso Our experiments validated the efficacy of the zzso design to engage the human in the zzso
