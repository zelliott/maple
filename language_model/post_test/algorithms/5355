Although zzso waves in networks of zzso in zzso are well zzso propagation in zzso is much more complex than in culture, and there is no consensus concerning the dominant roles of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that mediate zzso zzso Moreover, to date only simplified models that take very little account of the geometrical zzso of the networks have been zzso Our aim in this paper is to develop a mathematical model based on realistic cellular zzso and network zzso and a zzso framework for simulating the model, in order to address these zzso In the model, zzso zzso wave propagation through a network of zzso is driven by zzso diffusion between cells and zzso transport in the zzso zzso zzso simulations of the model show that different kinetic and geometric assumptions give rise to differences in zzso wave propagation patterns, as characterized by the zzso propagation distance, time delay in propagation from one cell to another, and the evolution of zzso response zzso The zzso zzso response patterns in cells are different from one cell to another, and the zzso response patterns evolve from one type to another as a zzso wave zzso In addition, the spatial patterns of zzso wave propagation depend on whether zzso zzso or both are zzso zzso Finally, two different zzso that reflect the in zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso networks also yield distinct zzso and zzso kinetic zzso The simulation results as well as the linear stability analysis of the model lead to the conclusion that zzso waves in zzso networks are probably zzso by both zzso zzso transport and zzso zzso the zzso cell releases zzso or partially zzso zzso zzso zzso
