An empirical model was developed to interpret differences in the zzso measured zzso and zzso zzso of freshly excised human pancreatic zzso normal, zzso and zzso zzso The model provided the first quantitative links between zzso zzso and zzso characteristics in the human zzso The zzso model enabled the first (to our zzso extraction of wavelength resolved zzso and reduced scattering zzso for normal and diseased human pancreatic zzso The zzso model employed zzso information to extract zzso free zzso zzso zzso zzso from normal pancreatic zzso pancreatic zzso and zzso The method developed is simple, zzso and potentially useful for a range of applications in optical tissue zzso This approach is potentially zzso to in zzso studies, because it can account for the zzso effects of blood in zzso
