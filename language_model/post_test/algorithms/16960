A zzso management decision to initiate a control treatment depends upon an accurate estimate of mean zzso zzso zzso sampling plans significantly reduce sampling efforts to make treatment decisions by using the proportion of infested leaves to estimate mean zzso density in lieu of counting individual zzso The use of sequential hypothesis testing procedures can significantly reduce the number of samples required to make a treatment zzso Here we construct a zzso relationship for zzso zzso zzso Baker, and zzso a zzso zzso of zzso from empirical data, and develop a sequential zzso sampling plan using zzso sequential test zzso zzso test can accommodate zzso population models that contain nuisance parameters that are not of primary zzso However, it requires that population zzso be independent, which may not be realistic because of spatial correlation of zzso zzso across trees within an zzso We propose to mitigate the effect of spatial correlation in a sequential sampling procedure by using a zzso rule zzso zzso that zzso selects each newly sampled tree to be zzso spaced from all other previously sampled zzso Our proposed zzso sampling methodology applies zzso test to a hypothesis test developed using an empirical zzso relationship coupled with a zzso statistical model of zzso zzso with spatial correlation zzso via the aforementioned zzso zzso We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology over a range of zzso estimates appropriate for zzso of zzso zzso that would be observed in zzso zzso in zzso
