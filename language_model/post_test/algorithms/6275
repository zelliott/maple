The recent trend in the development of zzso systems has profoundly emphasized the importance of zzso between the fundamentals of fuzzy sets and neural zzso The resulting zzso of the zzso systems took advantage of an array of learning mechanisms primarily originating within the theory of zzso and the use of fuzzy models zzso zzso systems) being well established in the realm of fuzzy zzso zzso one can anticipate that zzso systems should fully exploit the linkages between these two technologies while strongly preserving their evident identities zzso or learning abilities to be shared by the transparency and full zzso of the resulting zzso zzso Interestingly, this zzso still becomes a target yet to be zzso This study is an attempt to address the fundamental zzso challenge of zzso zzso Our underlying conjecture is that the transparency of any zzso system links directly with the logic fabric of the system so the logic fundamentals of the underlying architecture become of primordial zzso Having this in mind the development of zzso models hinges on a collection of logic driven processing units named here fuzzy zzso zzso These are zzso simple zzso elements that come with a zzso zzso and zzso zzso to their diversity, such zzso form essential building blocks of the zzso The study zzso the existing categories of logic zzso provides with their zzso helps understand their functional features and sheds light on their behavior when being treated as zzso components of any zzso zzso The two main categories of zzso and reference zzso are deeply rooted in the fundamental operations encountered in the technology of fuzzy sets (including logic operations, linguistic zzso and logic reference zzso The developed zzso networks come with a zzso zzso and high zzso (which directly translates into the zzso representation of the zzso As the network takes advantage of various logic zzso this zzso an immediate requirement of structural zzso which in this study is addressed by utilizing various mechanisms of genetic zzso zzso zzso We discuss the development of the networks, elaborate on the interpretation aspects and include a number of illustrative zzso zzso
