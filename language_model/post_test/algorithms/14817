In zzso treatment, the calculation of radiation dose distribution in target volume lead to an optimum set of planning zzso This worked has been aimed to compare two zzso beam dose calculation zzso in the zzso Treatment Planning system for zzso Linear zzso to assure the quality of treatment zzso 

Monitor Units to be delivered on zzso depth in patient has been calculated using the pencil beam and collapsed cone zzso for two zzso energies 6 and 10 zzso The percentage depth dose and beam profiles for 21 treatment fields, for both the calculation systems have been compared for both zzso zzso 

The percentage depth doses and beam profiles for both calculation systems are comparable in large field sizes as well as central axis field zzso The doses zzso depth zzso for some field settings, but in central axis large field sizes the difference within tolerance zzso 

Both calculation zzso are in close agreement in most of the field settings zzso in central axis zzso within tolerance zzso The difference is relatively greater in small field sizes and zzso field zzso
