Clinical trials of long duration are often hampered by high dropout rates, making statistical zzso and interpretation of results zzso zzso zzso should be based on models selected according to whether zzso is independent of response zzso completely at random zzso or depends on response either through observed responses only zzso at random zzso or through zzso responses zzso missing zzso If the dropout rate is high and little is known about the dropout zzso plausible zzso missing scenarios should be investigated as a sensitivity zzso offering the data analyst an understanding of the zzso of zzso Modeling zzso is illustrated by an analysis of an zzso censored zzso outcome from a zzso clinical trial on fracture response in osteoporosis in which the overall dropout rate was zzso In this article, we provide an overview of a zzso accounting for possible zzso zzso emphasize the importance of modeling the dropout and response mechanisms zzso and highlight critical points arising in missing data zzso
