The effects of methods used to improve the zzso reliability of zzso ratings of manuscripts submitted to the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent zzso were zzso 

zzso ratings of consecutive manuscripts submitted over approximately 1 year were first zzso 296 pairs of ratings were zzso zzso correlations and confidence intervals for the correlations were zzso for the two main ratings by which zzso zzso the quality of the zzso a zzso overall quality rating and a recommendation for acceptance or rejection with four possibilities along that zzso zzso were then introduced, including a zzso rating scale and two training manuals to accompany zzso Over the next year, 272 more articles were zzso and zzso were zzso for the new scale and for the scales previously zzso 

The zzso correlation of the most reliable rating before the intervention was zzso the reliability of the new rating procedure was zzso The difference between these two was zzso The reliability for the new rating scale was in the fair to good range, and it became even better when the ratings of the two zzso were averaged and the reliability stepped up by the zzso zzso The new rating scale had excellent internal consistency and correlated highly with other quality zzso 

The data confirm that the reliability of ratings of scientific articles may be improved by increasing the number of rating scale points, zzso ratings of separate, concrete items rather than a global judgment, using training zzso and averaging the scores of multiple zzso
