zzso zzso shift zzso zzso activity towards zzso slow zzso indicative of a synchronization of zzso activity in zzso zzso Additionally, they zzso brain areas in higher zzso frequency ranges possibly underlying conscious zzso It is currently thought that both effects may impair brain function by zzso proper information exchange between cortical zzso But what happens at the local network zzso Local networks with strong zzso zzso may be more resilient towards global changes in brain zzso but depend heavily on locally zzso zzso zzso As zzso bias cortical networks towards zzso we hypothesized that they may cause excessive zzso and compromise information processing already on a small spatial zzso Using a recently introduced measure of signal independence, zzso zzso zzso we investigated to what degree zzso synchronized local cortical network zzso We recorded local field zzso zzso from the zzso zzso of three rats chronically implanted with zzso zzso and compared activity patterns under control zzso zzso with those at increasing zzso of zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso signals were more zzso as expressed by zzso in the presence of zzso Specifically, zzso was a zzso declining function of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso at a concentration of 1 MAC (the minimum zzso concentration required to suppress movement in response to noxious stimuli in 50% of subjects) both volatile agents reduced zzso by about zzso whereas zzso was less potent zzso zzso 

The results suggest that zzso strongly diminish the independence of operation of local cortical zzso zzso and that the zzso of these effects in terms of zzso has a similar zzso power as changes of spontaneous action potential zzso Thus, zzso of field zzso recorded from local cortical networks provides valuable information on the zzso state of the zzso
