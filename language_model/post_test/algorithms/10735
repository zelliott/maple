zzso are familiar with many blemishes that zzso images can have due to dust and debris, glass flaws, uneven distribution of zzso or surface zzso zzso zzso scans do show similar artifacts, which might affect subsequent zzso Although all but the starkest blemishes are hard to find by the zzso eye, particularly in zzso zzso zzso zzso few tools are available to help with the detection of those zzso 

We develop a novel zzso zzso for the automatic detection and masking of blemishes in zzso zzso zzso zzso uses a combination of statistic and image processing methods to identify three different types of zzso localized blemishes affecting a few zzso diffuse defects affecting larger areas, and extended defects which may invalidate an entire zzso 

We demonstrate the use of zzso can materially improve analysis of zzso chips, especially for experiments with subtle changes between zzso For the widely used zzso algorithm, we show that compact blemishes cause an average of 8 gene expression values per chip to change by more than zzso two of them by more than zzso our masking zzso restores about two thirds of this zzso zzso artifacts are successfully detected and zzso
