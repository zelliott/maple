In the present work we evaluate the performance of an zzso for the automatic recognition of binding sites in proteins as well as in other zzso whose interactions are involved in many cellular and zzso zzso The zzso is a combination of an zzso learning zzso - based on zzso self organizing maps - to characterize the properties of patches of protein zzso accessible surfaces and a filtering zzso to establish both the physical boundaries of the patches as well as the level of contribution of different and distant atoms involved in the zzso We have found that the zzso performs extremely well in a set of randomly selected protein complexes for which the interaction zzso are extracted and compared with the results of the zzso A statistical evaluation of the zzso is additionally performed by analysis of the degree of zzso and zzso of the output patches and comparison with that of the observed interface constituent zzso zzso
