This paper proposes an efficient system which zzso multiple vision models for robust zzso detection and tracking for mobile service and social robots in public zzso The core technique is a novel maximum likelihood zzso zzso which combines the zzso zzso in zzso zzso First, a likelihood probability which zzso zzso and similarity to local appearance is zzso Then, an zzso zzso zzso zzso is derived under the zzso zzso In each zzso the zzso estimates the associations to the zzso and the zzso locates the new position according to the zzso zzso To be robust to the complex crowded scenarios for zzso zzso an improved sequential strategy to perform the zzso tracking is zzso Under this strategy, human objects are tracked zzso according to their priority zzso To balance the efficiency and zzso for real-time performance, at each stage, the first two objects from the list of the priority order are tested, and the one with the higher score is zzso The proposed method has been successfully implemented on real-world service and social zzso The vision system zzso zzso and zzso human zzso zzso reasoning, and sequential zzso zzso Various examples to show the advantages and zzso of the proposed system for zzso tracking from mobile robots are zzso zzso evaluations on the performance of zzso tracking are also zzso Experimental results indicate that significant improvements have been achieved by using the proposed zzso
