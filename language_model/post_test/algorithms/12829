A digital zzso image is an array of number values, which with adequate contrast can be interpreted as spatial zzso Through processing and analysis by mathematical means, using zzso imaging software programs, raw image data contrast can be enhanced to improve the extraction of image features for measurement and zzso This mathematical feature extraction zzso to as zzso provides the basis for general image zzso The methods discussed in this unit address common image analysis challenges such as object counting with touching objects, objects within other objects, and object identification in a field with uneven zzso or uneven zzso along with zzso procedures for achieving these zzso
