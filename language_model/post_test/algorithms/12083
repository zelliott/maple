Job rotation is one method that is sometimes used to reduce exposure to zzso materials zzso however, developing effective rotation schedules can be complex in even moderate sized zzso The purpose of this research is to develop methods of incorporating safety criteria into scheduling zzso to produce job rotation schedules that reduce the potential for zzso zzso programming and a genetic zzso were used to construct job rotation zzso zzso were comprised of lifting tasks whose potential for causing injury was assessed with the Job zzso zzso Each method was used to design four job rotation schedules that met specified safety criteria in a working environment where the object weight, horizontal distance and repetition rate varied over zzso Each rotation was assigned to a specific zzso capacity zzso Five versions of the zzso programming search method were applied to this zzso Each version generated one job rotation zzso The genetic zzso model was able to create a population of zzso feasible solutions to the rotation zzso zzso cluster analysis, a rule set was derived from the genetic zzso generated zzso These rules provided guidelines for designing safe job rotation schedules without the use of a zzso The advantages and limitations of these approaches in developing administrative controls for the prevention of back injury are zzso
