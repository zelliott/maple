A novel method is introduced to determine zzso the zzso of brain activity, using extension of the zzso empirical mode decomposition zzso The localized and zzso nature of zzso make it highly suitable for zzso zzso information across frequency for zzso and zzso zzso Analysis illustrates how zzso extension of zzso zzso zzso enhanced spectrum zzso for zzso recordings that contain similar signal zzso a realistic assumption in zzso zzso It is shown how this property can be used to obtain a more accurate estimate of the marginalized spectrum, critical for the localized calculation of zzso asymmetry in zzso zzso on synthetic data sets and feature zzso for a zzso interface zzso application are used to validate the proposed asymmetry zzso zzso
