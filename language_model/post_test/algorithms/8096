zzso spin echo envelope zzso zzso is a technique of zzso zzso resonance zzso zzso The zzso of zzso data to extract information about the nuclear and electronic structure of a zzso (powder) zzso system requires accurate and efficient zzso zzso A single coupled nucleus of known nuclear g value zzso and spin zzso can have up to eight adjustable parameters in the nuclear part of the spin zzso We have developed zzso an zzso simulation zzso for automated zzso simulation of powder two- and zzso one-dimensional zzso for arbitrary number zzso and type zzso zzso of coupled zzso and arbitrary mutual zzso of the zzso zzso principal axis systems for zzso zzso is based in the zzso environment, and includes the following features: zzso a fast zzso for translation of the spin zzso into simulated zzso zzso different zzso methods that can be zzso to achieve an efficient zzso zzso search of the zzso space and convergence to a global zzso zzso statistical analysis of the simulation zzso which allows the identification of simultaneous confidence regions at specific confidence zzso zzso also includes a zzso zzso averaging zzso as default for zzso and global zzso over multiple experimental conditions, such as the zzso time zzso for zzso zzso and external magnetic field zzso Application examples for simulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso in biological and chemical model zzso are zzso zzso zzso simulations by using zzso lead to a convergence on dramatically shorter time zzso relative to manual zzso
