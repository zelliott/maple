This paper explores a statistical basis for a process often described in computer vision: image zzso by region merging following a particular order in the choice of zzso We exhibit a particular blend of zzso and statistics whose zzso error is, as we show, limited from both the qualitative and quantitative zzso This approach can be efficiently zzso in linear zzso leading to a fast zzso zzso tailored to processing images described using most common zzso zzso attribute zzso The conceptual simplicity of the approach makes it simple to modify and cope with hard noise corruption, handle zzso authorize the control of the zzso scale, and process unconventional data such as zzso zzso zzso on zzso and color images, obtained with a short readily available zzso display the quality of the zzso zzso
