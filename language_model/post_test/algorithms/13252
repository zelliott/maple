It is shown that zzso a grating and zzso zzso are a simple way to achieve chromatic control in zzso zzso zzso A pair of zzso whose separation can be zzso provide a zzso beam with a zzso chromatic zzso from a zzso zzso zzso This simple control permits the correction of chromatic zzso in zzso imaging using zzso zzso zone plates and improved control of the zzso profile of a zzso spot in zzso zzso
