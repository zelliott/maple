zzso zzso regulation occurs through the concerted action of multiple zzso factors that bind zzso to zzso zzso zzso The zzso of these key regulators of zzso is lagging far behind the zzso of the zzso zzso Here, we give an overview of existing zzso methods to detect these zzso in zzso zzso We zzso these methods into three zzso zzso scanners screen sequences for zzso based on zzso models that often consist of multiple position weight zzso zzso zzso builders construct models of similar zzso controlling a set of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso screen sequences or complete zzso for zzso as zzso or zzso clusters of binding sites for any combination of zzso zzso We believe that zzso scanners are currently the most advanced methods, although their zzso is zzso Finally, we argue that zzso builders that make use of zzso libraries will benefit greatly from future advances and will prove to be most instrumental for the zzso of regulatory regions in zzso zzso
