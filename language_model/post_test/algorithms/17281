A set of zzso cellulose zzso with varying zzso and molecular weight has been investigated by principal component analysis zzso Several experimental variables such as dynamic surface tension, diffusion zzso zzso as monitored by a zzso probe technique, and intrinsic zzso are included in the zzso The experimental variables and observations zzso zzso are analyzed in models with good zzso zzso The apparent equilibrium surface tension zzso to the cloud point and to the critical zzso concentration in the presence of zzso The zzso is shown to be a zzso zzso for the degree of zzso zzso The irreversible process of dynamic surface tension is dependent on the diffusion zzso but to an even larger degree on the zzso zzso which is well illustrated by the zzso zzso
