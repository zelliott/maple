Conventional methods of zzso zzso and zzso motion in animal models are highly zzso zzso for example, the external isolation of segments of the gastrointestinal zzso tract either from dead or zzso zzso The present study was undertaken to determine the utility of zzso to zzso analyze these motions in the zzso region of zzso rats (N zzso 6) zzso Dynamic images of the zzso tract after oral zzso with a zzso contrast agent were acquired at a rate of six frames per second, followed by image zzso based on a combination of three-dimensional live wire zzso zzso and directional dynamic zzso zzso flow snakes zzso zzso analysis of the variation in diameter at a fixed zzso location showed clear indications of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the frequency response gave results in good agreement with those acquired in previous studies using invasive measurement zzso Principal component analysis zzso of the segmented data using active shape models resulted in three major zzso The individual modes revealed unique spatial patterns for zzso and zzso zzso
