Recently, zzso approaches zzso copy number aberrations zzso and gene expression zzso have been extensively studied to identify zzso genes and zzso In this work, we integrate these two data sets with zzso interaction zzso information to find zzso functional zzso To integrate zzso and GE data, we first built a zzso relationship network from a set of seed genes by enumerating all types of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso over multiple zzso Next, we propose a zzso cancer module identification zzso by combining zzso and zzso properties zzso zzso by using the zzso relationship network as a source of zzso information, and the zzso data as zzso zzso We applied the zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and 96 zzso zzso zzso samples that have both expression and copy number zzso and identified 22 zzso zzso and 23 zzso zzso Among 22 zzso zzso 15, 12, and 20 zzso were significantly enriched with zzso zzso zzso zzso and GO terms, zzso Among 23 zzso zzso 19, 18, and 23 zzso were significantly enriched with zzso zzso zzso zzso and GO terms, zzso Similarly, we also observed that 9 and 2 zzso zzso and 15 and 18 zzso zzso were enriched with cancer gene census zzso and specific cancer driver zzso zzso Our proposed zzso zzso significantly outperformed other existing methods in terms of both functional and cancer gene set zzso Most of the zzso pathways from both cancer data sets found in our zzso contained more than two types of zzso zzso showing strong positive correlations between the number of different types of relationship and zzso enrichment zzso see zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso This study suggests that identified zzso containing both expression changes and zzso can explain zzso activities with greater zzso
