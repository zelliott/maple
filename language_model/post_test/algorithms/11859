Various approaches to the solution to the inverse problem of zzso have been proposed over the zzso Recently, the use of inverse zzso using measured body surface zzso has been proposed, and in various studies this technique has been shown to outperform the traditional use of body surface zzso in certain model zzso In this paper, we compare the use of body surface zzso and body surface zzso on two model problems with different assumed cardiac zzso For the zzso cap model problems with an anterior source, the zzso estimates using body surface zzso had smaller average relative errors than when body surface zzso were zzso For the zzso cap model problems with a zzso source, the zzso estimates using body surface potential or body surface zzso sensors generally produced similar relative zzso For the zzso zzso model, the zzso estimates using body surface zzso had smaller errors than when body surface zzso were zzso We introduce a fusion zzso that combines the different types of signals and generally produces a good estimate for both model zzso
