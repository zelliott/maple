Acute zzso failure zzso after cardiac surgery is associated with high costs and a poor zzso Based on the results of a large US study, an zzso has been developed for predicting zzso from zzso risk zzso The aim of this study was to zzso this zzso in a patient population from Europe, and to assess its usefulness as a clinical zzso 

All coronary bypass and zzso surgery patients from a zzso period were zzso Data on zzso risk factors for all patients who developed zzso zzso and for a random sample of patients without zzso were zzso obtained from hospital databases and medical zzso For each patient, a risk score for zzso was calculated on the basis of the zzso The sensitivity, zzso positive and negative zzso values and area under receiver operating characteristic zzso curve of the score's ability to predict zzso were zzso 

zzso patients were zzso The risk of zzso was zzso and the area under the zzso curve zzso For a risk score of 6 or higher, the sensitivity was zzso the specificity zzso the positive zzso value zzso and the negative zzso value zzso 

The zzso of the zzso was confirmed in a population differing in several aspects from the US populations where it was zzso Although it is useful for zzso the risk of zzso in groups of patients, the low risk of zzso limits the zzso ability to predict the outcome for individual zzso
