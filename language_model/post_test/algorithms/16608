Acute leukemia is a zzso disease that affects a large proportion of the world zzso Different types and zzso of acute leukemia require different zzso In order to assign the correct treatment, a physician must identify the leukemia type or zzso Advanced and precise methods are available for identifying leukemia types, but they are very expensive and not available in most hospitals in developing zzso Thus, alternative methods have been zzso An option explored in this paper is based on the zzso properties of bone zzso images, where features are extracted from medical images and standard machine learning techniques are used to build leukemia type zzso 

This paper studies the use of ensemble particle swarm model selection zzso which is an automated tool for the selection of zzso models, in the context of acute leukemia zzso zzso is the application of particle swarm zzso to the exploration of the search space of ensembles that can be formed by zzso zzso models in a machine learning zzso zzso does not require prior domain knowledge and it is able to select highly accurate zzso models without user zzso Furthermore, specific models can be used for different zzso zzso 

We report experimental results for acute leukemia zzso with real data and show that zzso outperformed the best results obtained using manually designed zzso with the same zzso The highest performance using zzso was of zzso for zzso zzso problems and of zzso for more than two types zzso To the best of our knowledge, these are the best results reported for this data zzso Compared with previous studies, these improvements were consistent among different zzso zzso tasks, different features extracted from images, and different feature extraction zzso The performance improvements were statistically zzso We improved previous results by an average of zzso and there are improvements of more than zzso with some zzso In addition to the performance improvements, we demonstrated that no manual effort was required during acute leukemia zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of acute leukemia using zzso provides an alternative to expensive diagnostic methods in developing zzso zzso is a highly effective method for the automated construction of ensemble zzso for acute leukemia zzso which requires no significant user zzso zzso could also be used to address other medical zzso zzso
