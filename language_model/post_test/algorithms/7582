zzso reduction is commonly used as a zzso step before training a supervised zzso However, coupled training of zzso reduction and supervised learning steps may improve the prediction zzso In this paper, we introduce a simple and novel zzso supervised zzso reduction method that combines linear zzso reduction and linear supervised learning in a zzso zzso We present both Gibbs sampling and zzso approximation approaches to learn the proposed zzso model for zzso zzso We also extend our zzso toward model selection using automatic relevance determination in order to find the intrinsic zzso zzso experiments on three benchmark data sets show that the new model significantly zzso seven baseline linear zzso reduction zzso on very low dimensions in terms of zzso performance on test zzso The proposed model also zzso the best results on an image recognition task in terms of zzso and retrieval zzso
