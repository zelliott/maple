When examining the structural zzso properties of dynamic system models, some parameters can take on an infinite number of values and yet yield identical zzso zzso These parameters and the model are then said to be zzso Finding identifiable combinations of parameters with which to zzso the model provides a means for zzso analyzing the model and computing solutions in terms of the zzso In this paper, we revisit and explore the properties of an zzso for finding identifiable zzso combinations using zzso Bases and prove useful theoretical properties of these zzso zzso We prove a set of M zzso independent identifiable zzso combinations can be found using this zzso and that there exists a unique rational zzso of the zzso equations over these zzso zzso We also demonstrate application of the procedure to a zzso zzso
