To describe a novel method for calculating zzso lens zzso power after zzso laser in zzso zzso zzso without using the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 

Department of zzso Wake Forest University Eye Center, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston Salem, North Carolina, zzso 

This retrospective chart review comprised 9 eyes of 9 patients who had zzso after zzso using our method for zzso zzso This new method assumes the patient never had zzso zzso to calculate zzso power and then targets the zzso at the zzso amount of zzso The zzso zzso values, zzso manifest zzso and the current zzso length are placed in the zzso formula, bypassing the zzso zzso zzso In theory, assuming that the patient had satisfactory zzso results, the correct zzso can then be zzso 

The mean zzso equivalent zzso refraction was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso In all 9 eyes, our method consistently chose the most accurate and precise zzso compared with other zzso 

The new method of calculating zzso power after zzso provided excellent results and the most accurate and precise results to zzso
