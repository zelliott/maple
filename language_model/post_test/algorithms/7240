zzso factor is one of the most widely used measures of zzso of spike zzso Its standard zzso is the ratio of sample zzso to sample mean of spike counts observed in a time window and the quality of the zzso strongly depends on the length of the zzso We investigate this dependence under the assumption that the spike train behaves as an equilibrium renewal zzso It is shown what characteristics of the spike train have large effect on the zzso zzso zzso the effect of zzso period is zzso zzso Next, we create an approximate zzso formula for the mean square error of the zzso which can also be used to find minimum of the error in zzso from single spike zzso The accuracy of the zzso factor zzso is compared with the accuracy of the zzso based on the squared zzso of zzso All the results are illustrated for spike trains with gamma and inverse zzso probability zzso of zzso zzso Finally, we discuss possibilities of how to select a suitable observation window for the zzso factor zzso
