The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is comprised of a zzso zzso zzso The zzso kinetic mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso inherently generates a zzso zzso zzso However, a linear graded response of zzso zzso has also been observed in zzso cells, and its molecular mechanism remains zzso To dissect these zzso behaviors, we zzso measured the kinetic parameters involved in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling module in zzso zzso Using a zzso analysis based on zzso determined zzso we predicted in zzso and validated in zzso that zzso is zzso zzso in zzso zzso Finally, we identified molecular crowding as a critical factor that converts zzso zzso into zzso zzso We proposed the term zzso zzso to describe this mode of zzso zzso that is operated under the zzso condition of molecular zzso The zzso of this phenomenon may provide a new paradigm for a diverse set of zzso reactions including multiple zzso zzso
