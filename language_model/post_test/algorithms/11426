zzso analysis is a very general and powerful technique for zzso zzso zzso zzso An outstanding problem however is how to make zzso that are consistent over a group of subjects as to whether there are zzso differences in data features, and what are those features that zzso these zzso Here we propose a solution based on zzso zzso Analysis zzso model scoring at the subject level and random effects zzso model selection at the group zzso We apply this approach to zzso reconstructed zzso data in source zzso zzso estimates those zzso patterns of zzso that correlate most highly with the experimental zzso the order of a zzso model is then determined by the number of significant zzso zzso Random effects zzso model comparison then provides machinery for zzso the optimal order over the group of zzso zzso of a zzso dependence is indicated by the zzso model being the most zzso This approach can also be applied to zzso models with a fixed number of zzso zzso but supplied with different feature zzso We illustrate the method by identifying feature sets based on zzso zzso power zzso in the primary visual zzso and zzso zzso that are zzso zzso of data epochs before versus after visual zzso
