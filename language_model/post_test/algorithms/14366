In this paper the influence of intensity zzso and zzso correction on mutual information based image registration is zzso Instead of the generally used zzso zzso we use zzso zzso in order to achieve a more natural zzso of the intensity zzso zzso image zzso occurring notably in MR images can have adverse effects on the zzso We use a zzso correction method in order to reduce these zzso The method is validated on clinical zzso CT and PET images, as well as synthetic MR zzso It is shown that by employing zzso with zzso correction the number of zzso is reduced without loss of accuracy thus increasing zzso as compared to the standard zzso corrected and zzso zzso based zzso
