The zzso zzso spectral analysis zzso zzso is applied to the problem of separating the speech signals of two zzso speaking simultaneously on a single channel, zzso when two zzso use a single zzso A new zzso approach to the problem is proposed in which a spectral zzso is followed by a spectral tailoring zzso The spectral zzso produces an initial estimate of the speech spectrum for each zzso Then the spectral tailoring procedure employs the zzso zzso technique to adjust the initial spectral estimates to account for the characteristics of the known zzso composite speech zzso The research emphasis is placed on the zzso and evaluation of the spectral tailoring zzso zzso the use of the zzso zzso in the proposed zzso Its usefulness is evaluated and validated by listening tests and by comparing the spectral zzso of the estimated voices before and after the zzso zzso zzso
