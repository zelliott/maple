The Median zzso rule is a feature detection zzso to detect zzso signals in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso As the procedure does not adequately control the statistical zzso we investigate an extension of the Median zzso rule to zzso a statistical bound on the zzso zzso We then study the zzso rate and provide insights on the types of signal that can be detected by the zzso rule and the limit of zzso The resulting feature detection algorithm, which we term zzso zzso rule, can be used in most feature detection zzso to provide statistical control of the zzso and zzso zzso
