The use of magnetic resonance imaging zzso to assess the vascular nature of diseases such as multiple sclerosis zzso is a growing field of zzso This work reports on the application of MR zzso zzso and zzso zzso techniques in assessing the zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

A standardized zzso protocol containing zzso zzso and dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso was run for 170 zzso patients and 40 healthy controls zzso The zzso area zzso of the internal jugular veins zzso was measured at three neck levels in all subjects for both zzso techniques to determine the presence of zzso zzso All data were analyzed zzso 

For the values where both methods showed zzso the zzso method showed larger zzso measurement values compared to zzso methods in both zzso in both zzso and HC subjects which was confirmed with student paired zzso Of the 170 zzso patients, 93 zzso in zzso and 103 zzso in zzso showed zzso in at least one zzso The corresponding numbers for the 40 HC subjects were 2 zzso and 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso were seen in 26 cases zzso with zzso zzso and were not zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso were not seen in the HC zzso In the zzso zzso data, zzso of the zzso related to slow flow was seen in 58 zzso zzso cases and in no HC zzso zzso patients showed lower average zzso than the HC zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso depicted the vascular anatomy more completely than the zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso does not provide any information about the flow characteristics which are indirectly available in the zzso zzso in those cases where there is slow zzso
