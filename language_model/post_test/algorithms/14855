In 1964 Edwin zzso Land formulated the zzso theory, the first attempt to simulate and explain how the human visual system perceives zzso His theory and an extension, the zzso zzso were further zzso by Land and zzso Several zzso zzso have been developed ever zzso These color constancy zzso modify the zzso values at each zzso to give an estimate of the color sensation without a zzso information on the zzso Unfortunately, the zzso zzso original zzso is both complex and not fully zzso Indeed, this zzso zzso at each zzso an average of a very large set of paths on the zzso For this reason, zzso has received several interpretations and zzso which, among other zzso attempt to tune down its excessive zzso In this paper, it is proved that if the paths are assumed to be zzso random walks, the zzso solutions satisfy a discrete screened zzso zzso This zzso yields an exact and fast zzso using only two zzso Several experiments on color images illustrate the effectiveness of the zzso original zzso
