zzso infections cause morbidity and mortality in blood and zzso transplantation and pediatric zzso zzso zzso is active against zzso but must be used judiciously because of its zzso and unclear zzso zzso before introducing zzso use during an zzso outbreak, we developed a clinical zzso to distinguish low risk patients from those who merited zzso therapy because of significant zzso disease and high risk for zzso 

This study was conducted to determine whether the zzso accurately predicted severe zzso disease and whether selective zzso treatment was zzso 

A retrospective analysis of a pediatric zzso and zzso transplantation cohort zzso and zzso zzso was zzso 

Twenty patients with zzso infection were identified zzso high risk and 6 low zzso All low-risk patients cleared their infections without zzso Before zzso zzso all zzso high-risk patients died, 4 out of 5 zzso from zzso zzso In contrast, zzso reduced zzso mortality in the high-risk group zzso zzso (9 patients treated, 1 patient died; zzso zzso zzso and all treated high-risk patients cleared their zzso 

The clinical zzso accurately identified patients at high risk for severe fatal zzso disease who would benefit from selective use of zzso
