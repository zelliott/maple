The disturbing genetic algorithm, incorporating the disturbing zzso process into the genetic zzso flow, has been developed to extend the searching space of zzso zzso and to improve the quality of the zzso zzso Moreover, the growing generation amount idea, simulating the real situation of the natural evolution, is introduced to improve the searching zzso In the calculations using the zzso energy scoring function of the root mean squared zzso the disturbing genetic zzso method has been shown to be highly zzso With the real energy function based on zzso force field, the program has been applied to rebuilding zzso zzso of 25 high-quality zzso structures of zzso and zzso zzso The averaged root mean standard zzso of atom coordinates in zzso and zzso of the zzso angles of zzso and zzso + zzso are zzso A, zzso and zzso for the buried zzso respectively, and zzso A, zzso and zzso for all zzso showing that the method has equal precision to the program zzso whereas it performs better in the prediction of buried zzso and zzso zzso This method has been successfully used in redesigning the interface of the zzso complex, indicating that it will have extensive application in protein design, protein sequence and structure relationship studies, and research on zzso zzso
