One of the challenges in exploiting high zzso measurement techniques such as zzso is the conversion of the vast amounts of data obtained into relevant zzso Of particular importance is the identification of the intrinsic response of a zzso experiment and the characterization of the underlying zzso 

The proposed zzso seeks to provide the researcher a summary as to various aspects relating to the dynamic progression of a biological system, rather than that of individual zzso The approach is based on the identification of smaller number of expression motifs that define the zzso state of the system which zzso the zzso of the cellular response from a control state in the presence of an external zzso The approach is demonstrated with a number of data sets including a synthetic base case and four animal zzso The synthetic zzso will be used to establish the response of the zzso on a zzso zzso whereas the four different experimental zzso represent a spectrum of possible time course experiments in terms of the degree of zzso associated with the experiment as well as representing a wide range of zzso sampling zzso This wide range of experimental zzso will thus allow us to explore the performance of the proposed zzso and determine its ability identify relevant zzso 

In this work, we present a zzso approach which operates on high zzso zzso gene expression data to assess the information content of the experiment, identify dynamic markers of important processes associated with the experimental zzso and zzso in a concise manner the evolution of the system over time with respect to the experimental zzso
