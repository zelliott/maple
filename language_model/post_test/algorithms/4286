zzso motor proteins move on zzso tracks by converting input chemical energy that they derive by catalyzing the zzso of zzso The zzso site is the analogue of an engine and zzso of zzso is the analogue of burning of chemical zzso Moreover, the functional role of a segment of the motor is analogous to that of the transmission system of an zzso which consists of a zzso gear, zzso zzso The operation of the engine is zzso zzso and the motor faces a molecular zzso in the zzso zzso In this commemorative review, we celebrate the centenary of zzso and zzso landmark paper of 1913 and the golden zzso of zzso and colleagues classic paper of 1963 by highlighting their relevance with respect to explaining the operational mechanisms of the engine and the transmission system, respectively, of zzso zzso
