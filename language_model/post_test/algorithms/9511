A new zzso for zzso spectral zzso in the indirect dimension of zzso zzso experiments is zzso It takes a list of carbon chemical shifts as input and zzso the optimal spectral zzso and number of time increments to use in the carbon dimension of zzso experiments such as zzso zzso zzso When using zzso conditions where signals are better distributed along the carbon dimension, the number of time increments needed to resolve all of the signals is reduced by one to two orders of zzso This decreases the experimental time by the same factors and makes the acquisition of zzso such as zzso zzso zzso more zzso The new zzso allows users to limit the zzso zzso evolution time when relaxation is a concern, and can take lists of zzso that do not need to be zzso For any zzso insights regarding the position of signals in the zzso dimension increase the efficiency of the zzso by allowing the overlap of pairs of zzso with incompatible zzso zzso The application of a second zzso using a zzso spectrum as a source of zzso zzso for the zzso allows the number of time increments to be reduced zzso Application to zzso A shows that the time taken to acquire fully resolved zzso zzso can be 126 times less than would be required in a zzso spectrum with the same zzso The most interesting applications concern experiments where series of zzso experiments have to be acquired, for example in relaxation time zzso It is shown that the acquisition of quickly acquired series of zzso can facilitate assignment in zzso zzso spectral zzso zzso generally requires no modification of the pulse sequence and can therefore be easily applied by non zzso
