The inclusion of anatomical prior information in reconstruction zzso can improve the quality of reconstructed images in zzso diffuse optical zzso zzso Prior literature on possible locations of human prostate cancer from zzso ultrasound zzso however, is limited and has led to biased reconstructed zzso zzso In this work, we propose a zzso zzso method zzso to improve the accuracy of image reconstruction with limited prior zzso zzso reconstructs zzso images in three steps: 1) to reconstruct the human zzso 2) to divide the prostate region into geometric clusters to search for anomalies in finer zzso 3) to continue the geometric zzso within anomalies for improved zzso We demonstrated this zzso zzso method using computer simulations and laboratory phantom zzso Computer simulations were performed using combined zzso probe geometry with a multilayered zzso experimental demonstration was performed with a zzso tissue simulating zzso In computer simulations, two hidden zzso without prior location information were reconstructed with a recovery rate of zzso in their locations and zzso in their optical zzso In experiments, a hidden zzso without prior location information was reconstructed with a recovery rate of zzso in its location and zzso in its optical zzso
