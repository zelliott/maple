The combination of zzso zzso zzso technology with optical zzso zzso zzso zzso for imaging the zzso has proven to be a valuable tool for clinicians and researchers in understanding the healthy and diseased zzso The zzso resolution achieved by such a system allows imaging of the zzso at a cellular level, however imaging of some cell types remains zzso Improvement in contrast rather than resolution is needed and can be achieved through better zzso correction of zzso zzso A common tool for assessing and ultimately improving zzso system performance is the development of an error zzso Specifically, this is a list of the magnitude of the constituent residual errors of an optical system so that resources can be directed towards efficient performance zzso Here we present an error budget developed for the UC Davis zzso instrument indicating that bandwidth and controller errors are the limiting errors of our zzso system, which should be corrected first to improve zzso We also discuss the zzso of error sources for different subjects and the need to improve the zzso of the system by addressing subject zzso
