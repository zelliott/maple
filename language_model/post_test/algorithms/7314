The zzso and compensation of zzso aberrations is mandatory to reach the ultimate performance of zzso imaging zzso zzso is a focal plane zzso sensing method that consists in the extension of phase diversity to zzso imaging zzso Based on a zzso approach, it estimates the zzso aberrations from two focal plane images recorded from the scientific camera zzso In this paper, we present zzso extension which allows an zzso of low and high order aberrations with zzso precision for any zzso zzso The performance is evaluated by realistic simulations, performed in the zzso instrument zzso We develop a zzso zzso that allows us to take into account an imperfect knowledge on the used diversity zzso Lastly, we evaluate zzso performance in a compensation process, to zzso the contrast on the zzso and show it allows one to reach the zzso contrast required by zzso at a few resolution elements from the zzso zzso we present a zzso energy zzso method which can be used to reach very high contrast levels zzso than zzso in a zzso zzso
