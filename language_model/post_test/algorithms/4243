To evaluate the contribution of zzso reconstruction on image quality of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 

A torso phantom was scanned using two tube zzso zzso and 120 zzso and five different tube currents zzso 75, 40, 20, and 10 zzso All images were reconstructed with both filtered back projection zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso image noise within the zzso zzso zzso ratio, and sharpness of the zzso wall were zzso in the phantom for the two reconstruction zzso Data were analyzed using paired zzso zzso A value of P zzso zzso was considered zzso 

The zzso zzso was similar for zzso and zzso reconstruction zzso zzso zzso Image noise level was lower zzso zzso zzso and image sharpness was higher zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso ratios were higher with zzso reconstruction compared with those with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio at 80 zzso with zzso reconstruction zzso zzso zzso was similar to the zzso ratio at 120 zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Less image noise and higher image sharpness may be achieved with zzso reconstruction in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
