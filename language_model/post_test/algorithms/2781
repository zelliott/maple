This paper explores a new method for screening zzso in an array format based on relative polarity using selective zzso zzso A synthetic cocktail of zzso was spotted onto a zzso silicon surface, and zzso with zzso of varying zzso The zzso retained on the silicon surface after the zzso treatments were detected using zzso zzso secondary zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso retention was clearly evident on zzso analysis of the zzso using principal component zzso Selective removal of zzso was observed when zzso with different polarity were used, with the zzso retention or removal in most cases zzso to the polarity of the zzso used, although consideration of other forces in operation may be needed to arrive at fully predictable zzso This approach provides the basis for development of a technique to separate complex zzso into simpler constituents in a zzso array prior to identification and zzso using mass zzso It is an zzso approach that is intermediate between the more rapid but less zzso direct analysis methods (such as zzso that do not involve any zzso zzso and the more comprehensive but time consuming methods (such as zzso and zzso that involve zzso or zzso zzso The approach has the potential to be successfully developed for zzso yet zzso screening of zzso
