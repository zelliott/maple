zzso moment analysis was used to examine the transport of lead species in sand zzso The influence of sodium zzso zzso and zzso zzso on lead transport was also zzso Transport properties of lead zzso zzso zzso were a function of zzso zzso those particles with zzso mobility less than zzso zzso zzso exhibited significantly lower zzso first zzso moment zzso and second zzso moment zzso The forms of lead investigated in this work had a tendency to move in sand over a wide pH zzso Although the zzso amendment substantially reduced lead mass zzso in the sand column zzso lead zzso were formed that had a tendency to move rapidly and with minimal zzso when compared with zzso zzso with zzso provided limited reduction in lead mass recovery and minimal changes in lead transport zzso A zzso stability model was used to predict attachment of lead particles in zzso
