zzso strategy affects population dynamics and genetic parameters that can, in turn, affect evolutionary processes during the course of biological zzso zzso traits associated with zzso strategy are therefore potentially good candidates for rapid evolutionary shifts during zzso In a series of mating trials, we examined mixed groups of four males from invasive and native populations of the zzso zzso zzso zzso mating freely during 48 hours with one female of either zzso We recorded the identity of the first male to zzso and after the 48 zzso we examined female zzso and share of zzso using molecular zzso We found that invasive populations have a different profile of male and female zzso zzso Males from invasive populations are more likely to mate first and gain a higher proportion of offspring with both invasive and native zzso zzso from invasive populations reproduce sooner, lay more eggs, and have offspring zzso by a larger number of fathers than females from native zzso We found no evidence of direct zzso avoidance zzso in both invasive and native zzso This study highlights the importance of investigating evolutionary changes in zzso strategy and associated traits during biological zzso
