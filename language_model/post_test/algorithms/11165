zzso structure prediction methods play an important role for the understanding of zzso zzso zzso zzso secondary structure prediction is one of the most widely used and versatile approaches, and improved methods for this task have received much attention over the past five zzso Despite the impressive progress that as been achieved in this area, existing evaluations of the prediction accuracy achieved by various zzso do not provide a comprehensive, statistically sound zzso Furthermore, while there is increasing evidence that no prediction zzso consistently zzso all others, no work has been done to exploit the complementary strengths of multiple zzso 

In this work, we present two contributions to the area of zzso secondary structure zzso zzso we use state-of-the-art, zzso statistical methods together with a previously published and increasingly widely used zzso of high-quality zzso structures to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of existing zzso secondary structure prediction zzso The results from this evaluation clarify the performance relationship between ten well-known existing zzso zzso zzso secondary structure prediction methods and clearly demonstrate the progress that has been achieved in recent zzso zzso we introduce zzso a generic and powerful method for combining a set of existing secondary structure prediction procedures into an zzso method that achieves significantly higher prediction zzso than obtained from any of its component zzso 

Our new, zzso method, zzso improves the state of the art for zzso zzso zzso secondary structure prediction by exploiting the complementary strengths of multiple existing prediction procedures, as demonstrated using a state-of-the-art statistical zzso zzso In addition, zzso allows an intuitive and effective control of the zzso between false negative and false positive base pair zzso Finally, zzso can make use of arbitrary sets of secondary structure prediction procedures and can therefore be used to leverage improvements in prediction accuracy offered by zzso and energy models developed in the zzso Our data, zzso software and a zzso version of zzso are publicly available at zzso
