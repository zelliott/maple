zzso zzso by pancreatic zzso zzso is the principal regulating hormone of zzso metabolism and plays a key role in controlling zzso level in zzso zzso of the pancreatic zzso function may cause zzso to accumulate in blood, and result in diabetes zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso dysfunction has a strong negative effect on insulin zzso 

In order to study the cause of dysfunction of pancreatic zzso a multiple cell model containing healthy and zzso cells is proposed based on an existing single cell zzso A zzso that represents the function of zzso is modified for zzso zzso A 3-D zzso lattice structure is used to model the spatial differences among zzso in a pancreatic zzso The zzso in the model are connected through direct electrical connections between neighboring zzso 

The simulation results show that the low ratio of total zzso volume over zzso volume per zzso is a main reason that causes some zzso to lose their zzso The results also show that the overall insulin zzso will be seriously disrupted when more than zzso of the zzso in pancreatic zzso become zzso 

Analysis of the model shows that the insulin zzso can be reinstated by increasing the zzso zzso This new discovery sheds light on zzso zzso
