This brief describes neural modeling fields zzso for object perception, a zzso zzso We discuss previous difficulties in object perception zzso encountered since the 1950s, and describe how zzso overcomes these zzso zzso mechanisms are compared to recent experimental zzso zzso which have demonstrated that initial zzso signals are vague and during perception they evolve into crisp representations matching the bottom-up signals from observed zzso zzso and mathematical mechanisms are described and future research directions zzso
