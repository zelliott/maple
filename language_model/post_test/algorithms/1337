Image zzso is the partition of an image into a set of zzso regions whose union is the entire zzso The image is zzso into meaningful parts which are uniform with respect to certain zzso such as gray level or zzso In this paper, we propose a methodology for evaluating medical image zzso zzso wherein the only information available is boundaries outlined by multiple expert zzso In this case, the results of the zzso zzso can be evaluated against the multiple zzso zzso We have derived statistics to enable us to find whether the computer-generated boundaries agree with the zzso zzso boundaries as much as the different observers agree with each zzso We illustrate the use of this methodology by evaluating image zzso zzso on two different applications in ultrasound zzso In the first application, we attempt to find the zzso and zzso boundaries from cardiac ultrasound images, and in the second application, our goal is to find the fetal skull and abdomen boundaries from prenatal ultrasound zzso
