In zzso zzso also known as multiple cue probability learning zzso people learn to predict a discrete outcome on the basis of zzso valid zzso In zzso zzso irrelevant cues are usually ignored, which stands in apparent conflict with recent research in deterministic categorization that has shown that people sometimes use irrelevant cues to gate access to partial knowledge zzso in independent zzso The authors report 2 experiments that sought support for the existence of such knowledge zzso in zzso zzso The results indicate that, as in other areas of concept acquisition (such as function learning and deterministic zzso a significant proportion of participants zzso their knowledge on the basis of an irrelevant zzso The authors show by zzso modeling that knowledge zzso cannot be zzso by 2 zzso models zzso Context Model and Rapid Attention Shifts zzso zzso whereas a zzso model zzso zzso zzso can capture zzso zzso The authors conclude by pointing to the necessity of a zzso approach to capture performance in zzso and by identifying reduction of complexity as a possible explanation for zzso
