The purpose of this study was to extract the zzso rate zzso zzso from the zzso and zzso of the exponential sum fitted to zzso data points for a unique zzso mixed zzso zzso zzso zzso model, with losses solely from the central (blood) zzso This model is useful in zzso zzso and skeletal blood zzso Using zzso zzso the transfer functions of the exponential sum and the differential equations describing the model were obtained and the corresponding zzso zzso zzso which yielded the zzso rate zzso Three solution sets of rate zzso were found for the model, each of which zzso both transfer zzso A program written in zzso is zzso which requires only the zzso and zzso of the exponential terms as zzso the output is the three sets of rate zzso An example is given as an aid in zzso Only one solution set of the three was zzso zzso in the example, but the bounds defining these limits are not zzso The advantages and limitations of the method are zzso The method is suitable for zzso a zzso zzso fitting program for the rate zzso The appropriate zzso solution set for this model yields fractional and total zzso or skeletal blood flow in a subject in the steady zzso
