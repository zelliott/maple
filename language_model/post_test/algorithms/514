Debate continues in theoretical ecology over whether and why the zzso zzso of zzso zzso relationship varies along environmental zzso By developing a novel geometric model with assumptions of zzso growth at the individual level and open canopy at the stand level, we propose that plant zzso radius and canopy zzso relationships determine the zzso zzso relationship in stressful zzso zzso from field investigation along an zzso zzso (from eastern to western zzso confirmed our model prediction and showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso increased with drought zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso of the zzso relationship predicted by previous models may not hold for zzso parts in stressful zzso
