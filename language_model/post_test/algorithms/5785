We have previously developed the software for calculation of dynamic sensitivities, zzso in which one can calculate dynamic sensitivities with high accuracy by just setting the differential equations for zzso zzso However, zzso did not always provide calculated values with the machine accuracy of a computer, although a Taylor series method was employed to zzso solve the differential zzso This is because zzso derivatives calculated from an approximate formula were directly used in the derivation of the differential equations for sensitivities from those for zzso zzso The present work therefore attempts to further enhance the performance of zzso including not only the zzso of the calculated values but also the calculation zzso To overcome the problem, the approximate formula is expanded into a Taylor series in time and the zzso value of the series is replaced by the exact zzso on the second term of the flux function expanded into a Taylor series in an independent or dependent zzso The result reveals that this replacement certainly provides not only zzso derivatives but also dynamic sensitivities with zzso zzso comparable to the machine zzso regardless of the degree of zzso of the differential zzso Moreover, a comparison indicates that the improved zzso shortens the calculation time of the dynamic sensitivities without reducing their zzso even when the simplest approximate zzso formula is zzso
