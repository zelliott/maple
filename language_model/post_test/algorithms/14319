Eight zzso methods for determination of zzso have been developed and zzso These methods were based on the zzso of the drug by different zzso zzso zzso ammonium zzso zzso zzso ammonium zzso ammonium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso reactions were performed in zzso acid medium for zzso ammonium zzso and in zzso acid medium for the other zzso With zzso ammonium zzso and zzso zzso the concentration of zzso in its samples was determined by measuring the decrease in the zzso intensity of the colored zzso at 315 and 525 zzso zzso With the other zzso the concentration of zzso was determined by measuring the intensity of the developed colored reaction products at the zzso of maximum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 475 zzso for reactions with ammonium zzso ammonium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Different variables affecting the reaction conditions were carefully studied and zzso Under the optimum conditions, linear relationships with good correlation zzso zzso were found between the zzso readings and the zzso of zzso in the range of zzso zzso The zzso zzso were correlated with the zzso potential of the zzso zzso The precision of the methods were zzso the values of relative standard zzso did not exceed zzso The proposed methods were successfully applied to the analysis of zzso in pure drug material and capsules with good accuracy and zzso the recovery values were zzso zzso zzso The results obtained using the proposed zzso methods were comparable with those obtained with the official method stated in the United States zzso
