Design of a digital zzso zzso filter is the process of zzso and implementing a zzso filter network so that a set of prescribed zzso results a set of desired zzso However, the error surface of zzso filters is usually zzso and zzso In order to find the global minimum indeed, an improved differential evolution zzso is proposed for digital zzso filter design in this zzso The suggested zzso is a kind of DE zzso with a zzso zzso zzso population zzso It considers the convergence speed and the zzso cost simultaneously by zzso partial increasing or declining individuals according to fitness zzso In addition, we discuss as well some important aspects for zzso filter design, such as the cost function value, the influence of zzso zzso the convergence rate and successful percentage, the zzso zzso zzso As to the simulation result, it shows that the presented zzso is viable and zzso Compared with six existing zzso zzso digital zzso filter design methods obtained by zzso experiments, zzso is relatively more promising and zzso
