The aim of this study was to evaluate the zzso value of cerebral regional oxygen zzso zzso in the occurrence of zzso cognitive dysfunction zzso in elderly patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft zzso zzso 

A prospective zzso 

University zzso 

A total of 61 patients zzso zzso with a mean age of zzso zzso zzso on a waiting list for zzso surgery were enrolled in the zzso 

A complete zzso evaluation was performed 1 day before surgery as well as 4 to 7 days and 1 month after zzso During surgery, zzso was monitored zzso 

zzso was defined as a reduction of 1 standard zzso on 2 or more zzso zzso zzso patients zzso developed early zzso and 23 zzso showed late zzso Patients whose zzso decreased to less than 50% during the surgery experienced more zzso 4 to 7 days after surgery zzso zzso zzso In addition, a decrease of more than zzso from the patient's baseline zzso was associated with zzso 1 month after surgery zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cerebral oxygen zzso is associated with early and late zzso in elderly zzso zzso zzso is a promising tool in the prediction of subtle zzso deficits and further studies are zzso
