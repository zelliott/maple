zzso zzso zzso functions of most natural images, when compressed with state-of-the-art zzso zzso exhibit a zzso behavior D alpha zzso at moderately high rates, with gamma being a constant depending on the input image, zzso from the well-known exponential form of the zzso function D alpha zzso for zzso stationary zzso This paper explains this intriguing observation by investigating theoretical and operational zzso behavior of natural zzso We take as our source model the fractional zzso motion zzso which is often used to model zzso behaviors in natural zzso We first establish that the theoretical zzso function of the zzso process (both in zzso and zzso indeed follows a power zzso Then we derive operational zzso function of the zzso process when zzso zzso based on zzso zzso Interestingly, both the operational and theoretical zzso functions behave as D alpha zzso For natural images, the values of gamma are found to be distributed around zzso These results lend an information theoretical support to the merit of zzso zzso zzso of zzso processes and, in particular, natural images that can be zzso by such zzso They may also prove useful in predicting performance of zzso zzso image zzso
