A method of resolving the complex zzso ambiguity in zzso zzso is zzso The complex differential spectral zzso is obtained by simultaneous acquisition of the first and second zzso of the zzso component of the zzso zzso The zzso represent the imaginary and real parts of the zzso zzso The complex zzso rejection ratio is found to be at least 45 zzso and is limited by background zzso
