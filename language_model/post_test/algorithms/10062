Many pathogens associated with chronic infections evolve so rapidly that strains found late in an infection have little in common with the initial zzso This raises questions at different levels of analysis because rapid zzso evolution affects the course of an infection, but it can also affect the possibility for natural selection to act at the zzso zzso We present a zzso approach that incorporates zzso evolutionary dynamics of a rapidly mutating virus zzso C zzso targeted by a cellular zzso immune response, into an zzso zzso The viral trait we follow is the replication rate of the strain initiating the zzso We find that, even for rapidly evolving zzso the replication rate of the initial strain has a strong effect on the fitness of an zzso Moreover, infections caused by slowly replicating viruses have the highest infection fitness zzso lead to more secondary zzso but strains with higher replication rates tend to dominate within a host in the zzso We also study the effect of zzso immunity and viral zzso rate on infection life history zzso For instance, because of the zzso nature of our approach, we can identify factors affecting the outcome of the infection zzso or chronic zzso Finally, we show that zzso treatments modify the value of the optimal initial replication rate and that the timing of the treatment administration can have public health consequences due to zzso zzso Our results support the idea that natural selection can act on the replication rate of rapidly evolving viruses at the zzso zzso It also provides a zzso description of zzso constraints, such as zzso zzso and shows how these constraints affect the infection zzso This model raises questions that can be tested zzso and zzso the necessity to consider the evolution of quantitative traits to understand the outcome and the fitness of an zzso
