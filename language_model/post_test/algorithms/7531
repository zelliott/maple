We present in this paper novel techniques that determine the semantic relationships among zzso zzso zzso We implemented these techniques in a zzso system called zzso which resides between user application and GO zzso Given a set S of GO terms, zzso would return another set zzso of GO terms, where each term in zzso is zzso related to each term in zzso Most current research is focused on determining the semantic similarities among GO zzso terms based solely on their zzso and proximity to one another in the GO graph structure, while overlooking the contexts of the terms, which may lead to erroneous zzso The context of a GO term T is the set of other terms, whose existence in the GO graph structure is dependent on zzso We propose novel techniques that determine the contexts of terms based on the concept of existence zzso We present a zzso zzso zzso employing these techniques for determining the semantic similarities among GO zzso evaluated zzso zzso and compared it with three existing zzso The results of measuring the semantic similarities among genes in zzso and zzso pathways retrieved from the zzso and zzso zzso databases, respectively, have shown that our method zzso the other three methods in recall and zzso
