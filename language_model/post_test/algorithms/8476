In electrical zzso zzso the shape of the object being zzso (such as the human zzso is often zzso For this reason, zzso techniques, such as finite element method, are often used for solving the forward problem in zzso rather than zzso solutions which can only model simple geometrical zzso However, an zzso solution to the zzso forward problem can often be zzso This paper will present an zzso solution to the forward problem for an elliptical cylinder whose zzso can be easily modified to approximate the shape of the human zzso
