A similarity index based on the zzso properties of molecules is zzso Such an index is defined based on the fractional partition of the free energy of zzso developed within the framework of the zzso reaction field zzso model, which divides the free energy of zzso or the free energy of transfer into contributions assigned to the surface elements defining the zzso zzso These surface contributions can be integrated to derive atomic or group zzso The suitability of the index to zzso the molecular similarity based on zzso properties is examined by considering their application in a variety of test systems, including zzso zzso zzso properties, and molecular zzso The similarity index is expected to be a very powerful tool in molecular similarity studies for compounds of chemical, zzso and pharmaceutical zzso
