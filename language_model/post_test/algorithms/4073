The robust border identification of zzso carotid zzso the corresponding degree of zzso of the common carotid artery zzso and also the characteristics of the zzso wall, including plaque size, zzso and zzso have significant clinical relevance for the assessment of future cardiovascular zzso To facilitate the follow-up and analysis of the carotid zzso in serial clinical zzso we propose and evaluate an integrated system for the zzso of zzso carotid plaque in ultrasound videos of the zzso based on video frame zzso zzso reduction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso active zzso and snake zzso Initially, the cardiac cycle in each video is identified and the video zzso is generated, thus identifying zzso and zzso zzso The video is then segmented for a time period of at least one full cardiac zzso The zzso is zzso in the first video frame of the cardiac cycle, with human assistance if needed, and the moving zzso plaque borders are tracked and segmented in the subsequent zzso Two different zzso methods are investigated in which initial contours are estimated every 20 video zzso In the first zzso method, the initial snake zzso is estimated using zzso zzso in the second zzso method, the zzso active zzso model is zzso The performance of the zzso is evaluated on 43 real zzso digitized videos from zzso zzso ultrasound segments and is compared with the manual zzso of an expert, available every 20 frames in a time span of 3 to 5 zzso zzso in general, 2 cardiac zzso The zzso results were very zzso according to the expert objective zzso for the two different methods investigated, with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and between the ground truth and the proposed zzso method, zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and overlap zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso contours were also used to zzso the cardiac state identification and zzso zzso and zzso strain zzso for the zzso wall and plaque between the zzso and symptomatic groups were zzso The results of this study show that the integrated system investigated in this study can be successfully used for the automated video zzso of the zzso plaque in ultrasound zzso
