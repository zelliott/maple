zzso zzso are zzso zzso short zzso that regulate gene zzso zzso each zzso family member expression is especially important due to zzso abundance and connection with development and zzso However, short lengths zzso zzso and similarities between multiple sequences have prevented identification of individual zzso Here, we present zzso a zzso zzso which designs zzso matched sequences zzso yielding only noise levels in zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso to discriminate single zzso differences and to improve probe zzso Our zzso for the entire zzso family are both homogeneous and specific, verified using zzso signals from fluorescent zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso family, demonstrating the power of our zzso In addition, false zzso signals from conventional zzso zzso were identified in zzso zzso samples through comparison with our zzso signals, raising concerns about false zzso family signals in conventional zzso zzso
