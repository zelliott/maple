In imaging functional connectivity zzso analyses of the resting brain, zzso of zzso during zzso have been zzso These results are in accordance with recent zzso studies observing impaired zzso processing during zzso In this study, simultaneous records of functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso and electroencephalogram were performed to investigate the causality of neural mechanisms during zzso loss of consciousness by zzso zzso in zzso and directional connectivity zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso electroencephalogram and blood oxygen zzso zzso zzso of 15 healthy subjects were simultaneously registered during consciousness and zzso loss of zzso To indicate DC, zzso symbolic transfer zzso was applied as a zzso measure of mutual zzso between underlying zzso zzso The relationship between zzso of zzso networks of the brain zzso zzso and DC was analyzed by a partial zzso 

Independent component analyses of zzso zzso showed decreased zzso in zzso default networks during zzso whereas zzso in primary sensory networks zzso DC indicated a decline in zzso zzso under the receiver characteristic curve, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso feedback DC zzso zzso The changes of zzso in the anterior default network correlated with the changes of DC in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The simultaneous zzso suppression of frontal feedback connectivity in the electroencephalogram and of zzso zzso in the zzso indicates a fundamental role of zzso processing for zzso
