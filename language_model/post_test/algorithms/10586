zzso models of earthquake faults are important for understanding the mechanisms for their observed behavior, such as zzso zzso and the relation between large and small events, which is the basis for various forecasting zzso Although cellular zzso models have been studied extensively in the long-range stress transfer limit, this limit has not been studied for the zzso model, which includes more realistic friction forces and zzso We find that the latter model with long-range stress transfer exhibits zzso different behavior than both the long-range cellular zzso models and the usual zzso model with zzso springs, depending on the nature of the zzso friction zzso These results have important implications for our understanding of earthquakes and other driven zzso zzso
