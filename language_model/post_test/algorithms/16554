By zzso measuring the polarization of a zzso between two strong polarization zzso we zzso investigate the correlation between the appearance of anomalous values in quantum weak zzso and the violation of realism and zzso of zzso A quantitative zzso of the latter concept is expressed in terms of a zzso inequality for the outcomes of subsequent zzso of an individual quantum zzso We zzso violate the zzso inequality for several measurement zzso Furthermore, we zzso demonstrate that there is a zzso correlation between achieving strange weak values and violating the zzso zzso
