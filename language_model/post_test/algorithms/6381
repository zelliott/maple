A method is introduced to examine the geometrical accuracy of the three-dimensional zzso representation of coronary arteries from multiple zzso and more) zzso two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso When involving more then two projections, zzso zzso a novel procedure is presented that consists of fully automated zzso and zzso determination in all available projections based on the information provided by the zzso zzso detection in two initial zzso zzso The accuracy of the 3-D coronary modeling approach is determined by a quantitative examination of the 3-D zzso point position and the 3-D cross zzso area of the reconstructed zzso The zzso are based on the analysis of zzso phantom and zzso coronary zzso projection zzso From this analysis a confidence region zzso degrees approximately equal to zzso degrees - 145 zzso for the angular distance of two initial projection images is determined for which the modeling procedure is sufficiently accurate for the applied zzso Within this angular border range the zzso position error is less then zzso zzso in terms of the zzso distance to a zzso ground zzso When involving more projections using our new zzso experiments show that when the initial pair of projection images has an angular distance in the range alpha degrees approximately equal to zzso degrees - 145 zzso the zzso in all other projections zzso zzso 0 degrees - 180 zzso were indicated very precisely without any additional centering zzso When involving additional projection images in the modeling procedure a more realistic shape of the structure can be zzso In case of the zzso segment, however, the involvement of multiple projections does not necessarily provide a more realistic shape of the reconstructed zzso
