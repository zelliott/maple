zzso have shown that the lateral profile of a point target measured with a clinical ultrasound scanner is wider when the target is embedded in a zzso phantom than when it is in a traditional gel zzso The behavior has been attributed to the low speed of sound in the zzso material, with the possibility that some of the broadening is caused by increased zzso in this zzso In this paper we apply a computer simulation model to study this zzso zzso beam profiles modeled for targets within a medium having a speed of sound and an zzso matching that of zzso are compared with profiles for targets in a zzso zzso zzso yield results that agree zzso with published experimental zzso The lateral profile broadening in zzso is caused by the 6 % mismatch between speed of sound in this material and the speed of sound assumed in the receive focusing and beam zzso zzso plays a lesser role than the mismatch of the speed of zzso
