This paper presents a novel pattern recognition framework by zzso on zzso increasing zzso In particular, the framework zzso zzso image zzso a novel zzso zzso Fisher Analysis zzso method, and fractional power zzso models for improving pattern recognition zzso zzso image zzso which increases zzso by incorporating zzso filters with different scales and zzso is characterized by spatial frequency, spatial zzso and zzso selectivity for coping with image zzso such as zzso zzso The zzso method first performs zzso mapping from the input space to a zzso feature space, and then zzso the zzso Fisher zzso analysis in the feature zzso The significance of the zzso mapping is that it increases the discriminating power of the zzso method, which is linear in the feature space but zzso in the input zzso The novelty of the zzso method comes from the fact that 1) it extends the zzso kernel Fisher methods by addressing zzso pattern zzso problems and 2) it improves upon the traditional zzso zzso Analysis zzso method by zzso a unique solution zzso to the zzso solution, which is not zzso The fractional power zzso models further improve performance of the proposed pattern recognition zzso zzso on face recognition using both the zzso database and the zzso zzso zzso Grand zzso databases show the feasibility of the proposed zzso In particular, experimental results using the zzso database show that the zzso method performs better than the zzso method and the fractional power zzso models help both the zzso method and the zzso method improve their face recognition zzso Experimental results using the zzso databases show that the proposed pattern recognition framework improves face recognition performance upon the zzso baseline zzso and the zzso baseline zzso by large zzso
