The application of eye drops is known to be problematic due to the high zzso of eye drop volume, the low capacity of the zzso area resulting in an optimal drop volume of about 20 zzso and the risk of adverse systemic effects of drugs due to systemic zzso via the zzso zzso While zzso tip design and the surface activity of the zzso zzso strongly influence the volume of an zzso zzso solution dispensed as eye zzso the handling of the preparation zzso angle, zzso rate, and the residual volume of liquid in the zzso zzso is generally believed to produce a minimal zzso In this study, properties of two zzso tips zzso and zzso frequently used in the Czech Republic were systematically investigated in a fractional zzso zzso Of seven zzso potentially influencing the size of eye zzso the zzso tip design, the zzso angle and the zzso rate have been found to have a significant effect on the eye drop zzso zzso of the rubber zzso tip resulted in a dramatic increase in drop volume which could hardly be foreseen in real drop zzso As a result, therefore, rubber zzso tips could scarcely be recommended, as opposed to plastic zzso tips which produced drops of comparable volume when used in upright position with approximately the same zzso zzso Under those defined zzso conditions, the zzso of the drop volume could be expressed by a zzso zzso of zzso Using a zzso angle of 45 degrees from horizontal led to a decrease in drop volume and, in addition, to greater volume zzso due to the formation of air bubbles inside the zzso tip zzso
