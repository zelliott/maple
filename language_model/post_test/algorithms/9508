We here show the zzso zzso zzso zzso at high field zzso zzso and the first zzso spectrum at zzso field zzso zzso for zzso important zzso zzso The high-resolution zzso zzso present a clear evidence of multiple zzso sites in the zzso structures that have never been identified by other zzso zzso The present study suggests that the zzso zzso are mainly in 7- and zzso coordination zzso This will offer valuable insights for dynamic properties of zzso zzso The zzso zzso technique at high magnetic field is a unique tool to understand the detailed structural information on a specific element in zzso including organic and zzso zzso
