Five lateral excursions on both left and right sides of 20 healthy subjects were recorded by zzso which was an zzso system with six degrees of zzso The zzso point, the working zzso point zzso and the balancing zzso point zzso were zzso When the zzso point moved 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 zzso on its path, the zzso point and corresponding zzso points were zzso The linear distances from the zzso position zzso to each zzso point at each zzso position were calculated as Linear zzso The distance between five lateral excursions in zzso zzso zzso space coordinates at each zzso position of three zzso points were calculated as zzso zzso zzso zzso To evaluate the stability of lateral excursions, the Index S was defined as the equation zzso distance * zzso and zzso From the result of Index zzso the zzso showed significantly less stability than the other two zzso points zzso zzso zzso The zzso point showed best stability, especially in zzso zzso The zzso also showed good zzso Index S revealed the characteristic movement in zzso zzso zzso space coordinates at each zzso point and it showed clearly the stability of lateral zzso
