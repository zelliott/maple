zzso fluid flux can be zzso with coherent light, either from the contrast of zzso patterns, or from the moments of the power spectrum of intensity zzso We present a theory connecting these approaches for the general case of mixed zzso patterns of boiling zzso without prior assumptions regarding the particle zzso An expression is derived and tested relating the zzso contrast to the intensity power zzso Our theory demonstrates that in zzso contrast the concentration of moving particles dominates over the contribution of speed to the particle zzso Our theory provides a basis for comparison of both approaches when used for studying tissue zzso
