This paper describes an experiment that extends the zzso sensing approach to identify the three-dimensional location of an object in constant zzso zzso sensing has previously been successful in the identification of size and location of zzso placed zzso Here, a novel system is developed to measure balance or sway in zzso The experimental zzso consisted of a zzso structure positioned on a supported steel zzso Three low-cost zzso sensors were positioned under the plate with the resulting signals used as zzso to a neural network implemented on a zzso gate zzso The results show that the embedded system can accurately track the zzso position in real time with a mean tracking error of around 6 per cent in all three zzso This evidence indicates that the technique is sufficiently sensitive and could be implemented in a pragmatic zzso for discriminating between balance and zzso
