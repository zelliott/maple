zzso for target images in large volume imagery is a challenging problem and the rapid serial visual presentation zzso zzso is potentially a promising solution to the zzso zzso zzso is essentially a zzso computer vision technique that relies on zzso detection of zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso images are shown to a subject in a rapid serial zzso When a target image is seen by the subject, unique zzso characterized by zzso are zzso Thus, in zzso zzso accurate detection of such distinct zzso allows for fast searching of target images in large volume zzso The accuracy of the distinct zzso detection in zzso zzso depends on the feature extraction method, for which the common spatial pattern analysis zzso was used with limited zzso This paper presents a novel feature extraction method, termed common zzso pattern zzso which is critical for robust zzso detection of zzso Unlike the conventional zzso zzso only spatial patterns of zzso are considered, the present proposed method exploits spatial and zzso patterns of zzso zzso providing complementary spatial and zzso features for high accurate zzso zzso zzso zzso study using data collected from 20 subjects in zzso zzso experiments demonstrates that the proposed method offers significant performance improvement over the conventional zzso method zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso and other competing methods in the zzso This paper further shows that the main idea of zzso can be easily applied to other zzso
