In this work MD simulations of the native bovine pancreatic zzso inhibitor zzso and 16 zzso were done in vacuum in order to study memory effects in the zzso using principal component analysis zzso and the zzso range analysis zzso zzso Both zzso and the zzso range analysis support our previous proposition, based on zzso of zzso that the motions of a native protein are more correlated than those of zzso The methods are zzso the nature and applications of the rule and the role of the long-range correlations in MD time series zzso zzso are discussed in the context of collective zzso
