The aim of this study was to develop a model which describes the mechanical spinal response to small alternating pelvic stimulation induced by an active zzso movement of a normal zzso The rotary continuous passive motion zzso of the seat about a vertical axis of only zzso degrees resulted in an increased in spinal length as opposed to the normal daily zzso and back patients experienced pain zzso zzso and active zzso have been broadly applied for treating and healing spinal zzso A rigid body package zzso zzso was used to translate the stimulation of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The parameters of the model were set so that the values of the global zzso and geometry of the zzso discs could be zzso In zzso validation of the model was based on force and moment zzso using an internal zzso zzso The zzso of the model concerning natural frequency zzso in vertical direction and the zzso zzso response on small pelvic zzso are comparable with experimental zzso
