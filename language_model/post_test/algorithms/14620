Natural systems are a source of inspiration for computer zzso designed to solve zzso zzso Yet most zzso zzso take only superficial inspiration from biology, and little is known about how real biological systems solve difficult zzso Moreover, zzso zzso neural networks and similar methods are usually applied to zzso problems, whereas most biological systems have evolved to perform under zzso changing zzso We used the zzso of zzso puzzle to test whether Argentine zzso can solve a potentially difficult zzso zzso We also tested whether the zzso can adapt to dynamic changes in the zzso We mapped all possible solutions to the zzso of zzso on a single graph and converted this into a maze for the zzso to zzso We show that the zzso are capable of solving the zzso of zzso and are able to adapt when sections of the maze are blocked off and new sections zzso The presence of exploration zzso increased the efficiency of the resulting network and increased the zzso ability to adapt to changing zzso zzso to previous studies, our study shows that zzso zzso species such as the Argentine zzso can forage effectively in a dynamic zzso Our results also suggest that novel zzso zzso can benefit from stronger biological zzso
