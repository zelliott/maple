The extent of zzso exchange of the protein zzso in solution was monitored by mass zzso following zzso zzso zzso of the zzso In the absence of zzso approximately 115 zzso are exchanged for zzso after 60 zzso As the zzso is zzso with zzso the extent of exchange decreases significantly zzso by 24 zzso indicating zzso folding of the protein to a zzso less zzso zzso The extent of zzso exchange zzso to decrease when the amount of added zzso is sufficient to convert greater than zzso of the zzso to a form bound by four calcium zzso zzso a protein of similar molecular weight, does not show a significant decrease in the extent of zzso exchange as it binds to zzso indicating that the changes in zzso exchange for zzso reflect zzso structural change that occur upon binding with zzso
