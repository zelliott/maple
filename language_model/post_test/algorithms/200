The ability to map individual zzso accurately across zzso enables the study of relationships between dynamic changes in zzso zzso and gene zzso However, the highly zzso nature of zzso zzso across zzso and short zzso regions pose challenges in mapping zzso positions based on zzso zzso data of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Previous works rely on additional zzso and careful visual examination to detect zzso zzso which may exist in a zzso of zzso We propose a zzso zzso model based on first order differences of experimental data along zzso coordinates that zzso the need for local zzso and can automatically detect zzso positions of various occupancy zzso Our proposed approach is zzso to both low and high resolution zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso data, and is able to map zzso boundaries zzso This automated zzso is also zzso efficient and only requires a simple zzso zzso We provide several examples illustrating the pitfalls of existing methods, the difficulties of zzso the observed zzso signals and demonstrate the advantages of utilizing first order differences in detecting zzso zzso via simulations and case studies involving zzso and zzso data of zzso occupancy in zzso zzso zzso
