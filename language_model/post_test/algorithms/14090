Multiple zzso have been developed to zzso the zzso zzso of heart rate zzso displayed in zzso zzso particularly with zzso zzso data collected over zzso zzso Some of these zzso have been compared to statistical zzso zzso and some to spectral zzso while others have been used to separate data sets such as cardiac zzso A survey of published zzso for zzso plot analysis was made covering literature through the 1990's to the present zzso zzso zzso zzso and the surveyed zzso zzso were used to zzso the same data set of zzso intervals that zzso zzso standing, deep breathing, light exercise and zzso This study examined these zzso zzso and determined their correlations with zzso zzso and investigated how the correlations are affected by zzso shorter time zzso Further investigation of the zzso zzso that do not correlate strongly with zzso or zzso may prove interesting in determining dynamic characteristics of cardiac nervous system zzso
