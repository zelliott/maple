zzso chronic recordings have been used as important evidence in zzso studies to unveil the fundamental neural network mechanisms in the zzso Spike detection is the first step in the analysis of recorded neural zzso to decipher useful information and provide useful signals for zzso interface zzso The process of spike detection is to extract action zzso from the recordings, which are often compounded with noise from different zzso This study proposes a new detection zzso that zzso a technique from zzso image edge zzso It zzso the correlation between zzso zzso at different sampling scales to create a robust spike zzso The zzso has one tuning zzso which potentially reduces the zzso of detection zzso Both artificial benchmark data sets and real neural recordings are used to evaluate the detection performance of the proposed zzso Compared with other detection zzso the proposed method has a comparable or better detection zzso In this letter, we also demonstrate its potential for real-time zzso
