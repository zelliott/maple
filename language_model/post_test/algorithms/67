We applied our previously developed zzso equation to predict zzso index scores from the Centers for Disease Control and zzso Healthy Days measures for the New York City zzso adult population from 1995 to 2006 and compared these trends over time with the US general zzso Such scores enabled us to examine the burden of disease attributable to smoking and zzso at both the local and national zzso We employed the zzso equation to the zzso zzso zzso Factor Surveillance System zzso data to obtain zzso index scores for all survey respondents based on their age, zzso health status, and overall number of zzso zzso With the combination of mortality data, we calculated trends of zzso life years zzso life expectancy zzso and zzso life expectancy zzso as well as the percent of zzso and zzso lost contributed by smoking and zzso Mean zzso index scores for NYC adults decreased from zzso to zzso but, more recently, have increased to zzso The zzso of an 18-year-old living in NYC increased zzso years and zzso increased zzso zzso The contribution of smoking to the proportion of zzso lost decreased from zzso to zzso while the contribution of zzso to the proportion of zzso lost increased from zzso to zzso The proportion of zzso lost due to smoking decreased from zzso to zzso while the proportion of zzso lost due to zzso increased from zzso to zzso Because the Healthy Days measures have been included in the zzso since 1993, translating Healthy Days zzso to a zzso measure is a useful method for zzso tracking of population health at the local, state, and national zzso
