zzso have been carried out in a draft tube zzso bed zzso to study zzso of synthetic wastewater containing zzso The zzso employed in the study zzso zzso has been immobilized on solid support zzso Studies have been carried out at different feed zzso of zzso air flow rates and feed flow zzso The mass transfer zzso for zzso transfer from bulk phase to the surface of the zzso on the solid particle has been estimated from observed experimental data using the conservation zzso The mass transfer zzso was found to be in the range of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso m zzso It was found to increase with increase in feed zzso air flow rate and feed flow zzso A zzso correlation has been developed for the mass transfer zzso in terms of zzso Reynolds and Schmidt numbers, and the same has been compared with correlations available in zzso
