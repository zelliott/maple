An evolutionary zzso was used to determine the optimal combination of parameters for zzso zzso As a model system, a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was chosen to examine transfer from zzso zzso to zzso zzso A comparison of flow zzso results with zzso and zzso showed that the majority of zzso were not zzso The zzso ratio therefore was determined by flow zzso The evolutionary zzso showed that the optimal conditions were obtained at 28 degrees C and at the highest zzso zzso This work demonstrates that evolutionary zzso can be used to find optimal zzso interactions in environmental zzso
