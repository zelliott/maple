zzso zzso zzso commonly causes heart failure and shows extensive genetic zzso that may be amenable to newly developed next-generation DNA sequencing of the zzso In this study we report the successful use of zzso sequencing to identify a zzso zzso in the zzso gene using segregation analysis in a large zzso zzso zzso sequencing was performed on three distant relatives from a large family with a clear zzso zzso zzso nonsense, and zzso zzso were analyzed for segregation among the three affected family members and confirmed in other relatives by direct zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with all affected family members and was also detected in one additional zzso family in our zzso The inclusion of segregation analysis using distant family members markedly improved the zzso filtering process by removing from consideration zzso that were not shared by all affected zzso zzso analysis confirmed that the zzso found in both zzso families was located on two distinct zzso supporting the notion of independent zzso events in each zzso In conclusion, an zzso sequencing strategy that includes segregation analysis using distant affected relatives within a family represents a viable diagnostic strategy in a genetically zzso disease like zzso
