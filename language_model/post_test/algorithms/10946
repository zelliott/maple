We agree with zzso and zzso zzso zzso E 67, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso E 67, zzso zzso that mutual information zzso is a useful measure of dependence for electroencephalogram zzso data, but we show that the improvement seen in the performance of zzso on zzso dependence trends from zzso is more dependent on the type of zzso zzso rather than any embedding technique zzso In an independent study we conducted in search for an optimal zzso zzso and in particular for zzso applications, we examined the performance of a number of zzso zzso on the data set used by zzso zzso in their original study, where the performance of different dependence measures on real data was investigated zzso zzso E 65, zzso zzso We show that for zzso applications the best performance among the investigated zzso is achieved by zzso neighbors, which supports the conjecture by zzso zzso in zzso zzso E 67, zzso zzso that the nearest neighbor zzso is the most precise method for zzso zzso
