DNA zzso studies assemble zzso data from large samples of individuals and species, and have provided new kinds of data for evolutionary surveys of zzso An important goal of many such studies is to zzso zzso significant species units, especially in zzso surveys from environmental DNA zzso The zzso Mixed zzso zzso zzso method is a likelihood method for zzso species by fitting zzso and zzso branching models to reconstructed gene zzso Although the method has been widely used, it has not previously been described in detail or evaluated fully against simulations of alternative scenarios of true patterns of population variation and divergence between zzso Here, we present important zzso to the zzso method as originally zzso and demonstrate its zzso to a range of departures from its simplifying zzso The main factor affecting the accuracy of zzso is the mean population size of species relative to divergence times between zzso Other departures from the model zzso such as varying population sizes among species, alternative scenarios for zzso and zzso and population growth or subdivision within species, have relatively smaller zzso Our simulations demonstrate that support measures derived from the likelihood function provide a robust indication of when the model performs well and when it leads to inaccurate zzso Finally, the so-called zzso version of the method zzso the zzso version of the method on simulated zzso we argue that this might represent a fundamental limit due to the nature of evidence used to zzso species in this zzso Together with other studies comparing its performance relative to other methods, our findings support the zzso of zzso as a tool for zzso species when only zzso information is zzso
