Approximate zzso zzso is a statistic that zzso zzso in time series data, and this zzso has several features that make it attractive for analyzing zzso zzso In this study, zzso was used to detect zzso in the heart rate zzso patterns of 12 low-risk human fetuses between 38 and 40 zzso of zzso The fetal cardiac electrical signal was sampled at a rate of zzso zzso by using zzso zzso positioned across the mother's abdomen, and fetal R waves were extracted by using zzso signal processing zzso To test for zzso zzso for the original zzso time series was compared with zzso for three dynamic models: temporally zzso noise, zzso correlated noise, and zzso correlated noise with zzso zzso Each model had the same mean and zzso in zzso as the original time series, and one model also preserved the zzso power zzso We estimated that noise accounted for zzso of the total zzso zzso in zzso Nevertheless, zzso for the original time series data still differed significantly from zzso for the three dynamic models for both group comparisons and individual zzso We concluded that the zzso time series, in low-risk human zzso could not be modeled as temporally zzso noise, zzso correlated noise, or zzso filtering of zzso correlated zzso
