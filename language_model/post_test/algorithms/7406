The rapid zzso of zzso structures presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities in the analysis, comparison, zzso and prediction of zzso structures and zzso The 6th zzso zzso zzso Workshop zzso was held in Philadelphia on October 4, zzso This issue includes zzso papers selected from the work presented at the zzso of zzso In zzso atomic potential for modeling zzso binding zzso application to zzso binding energy zzso a zzso model of zzso was built to evaluate the binding between a protein and a zzso In zzso zzso sampling of protein loop zzso from zzso zzso a new zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso was proposed to generate unbiased zzso of closed protein zzso from zzso zzso In zzso of accuracy and efficiency for zzso secondary structure prediction by sequence zzso and zzso authors demonstrate an enhanced method by cutting a long zzso sequence into smaller chunks at zzso selected points, and distributing the tasks to multiple zzso In zzso zzso evolutionary search approach to the multiple zzso problem in de zzso protein structure zzso the authors present an evolutionary search zzso to obtain a discrete representation of the protein energy surface in terms of an ensemble of zzso representing local energy zzso In zzso loop length from zzso images at medium zzso the authors developed a zzso geometry method to simplify the points along the skeleton to measure loop length in zzso zzso The paper zzso conservation and rigidity based method for detecting critical protein zzso presents a method that combines the rigidity and the evolutionary conservation in detection of the critical zzso In zzso conservation and zzso guided zzso approach to refining zzso zzso zzso the authors introduce a refinement method that accepts complexes consisting of any number of zzso zzso In zzso the ensemble of zzso transitions in protein systems with a zzso zzso the authors present a zzso zzso method to sample zzso zzso pathways connecting diverse functional states in zzso zzso The paper zzso zzso analysis of many predicted structures to reduce errors in protein structure comparison caused by zzso zzso applies protein structure prediction zzso to enhance the zzso of zzso proteins according to their binding zzso In zzso A new zzso protocol for zzso large zzso an enhanced method was demonstrated for zzso large zzso The paper zzso protein zzso transitions by a combination of zzso normal mode analysis and zzso zzso presents an efficient approach involving zzso zzso
