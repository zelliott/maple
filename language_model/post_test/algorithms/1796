Several studies have shown that human motor behavior can be successfully described using optimal control theory, which describes behavior by zzso the zzso between the zzso effort and zzso This approach predicts that subjects reach the goal exactly at the final zzso However, another strategy might be that subjects try to reach the target position well before the final time to avoid the risk of missing the zzso To test this, we have investigated whether minimizing the control effort and maximizing the performance is sufficient to describe human motor behavior in zzso motor zzso In addition to the standard model, we zzso a new model which includes an additional cost criterion which penalizes zzso between the position of the zzso and the target throughout the trial, forcing arrival on target before the final zzso To investigate which model gives the best fit to the data and to see whether that model is zzso we tested both models in two different tasks where subjects used a zzso to steer a ball on a screen to hit a target zzso zzso or one of two targets zzso zzso before a final zzso Noise of different zzso was superimposed on the ball position to investigate the ability of the models to predict motor behavior for different levels of zzso The results show that a cost function representing only a zzso between effort and accuracy at the end time is insufficient to describe the observed zzso The new model correctly predicts that subjects steer the ball to the target position well before the final time is reached, which is in agreement with the observed zzso This result is consistent for all noise zzso and for both zzso
