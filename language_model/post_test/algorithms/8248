Selective attention improves perception and zzso zzso responses, but how zzso changes of cortical activity improve the processing of attended objects is an open zzso Changes in total signal strength or enhancements in zzso ratio have been proposed as putative zzso However, it is still not clear whether, and to what extent, these processes contribute to the large zzso zzso We studied the ability to discriminate states of activity in visual zzso evoked by differently shaped objects depending on selective attention in zzso We found that zzso activity from zzso and zzso contains a high amount of information about stimulus shape, which increases for zzso recordings considerably with attention in successful trials, but not in case of behavioral zzso This effect resulted from enhanced differences between the zzso zzso of power spectral zzso It could be explained neither by enhancements of zzso ratios, nor by changes in total signal zzso Instead our results indicate that attention causes underlying cortical network states to become more distinct for different zzso providing a new zzso explanation for improvements of behavioral performance by zzso The absence of the enhancement in zzso in trials with behavioral errors demonstrates the relevance of this novel neural mechanism for zzso
