In zzso zzso zzso there is the zzso zzso phenomenon where the sample zzso mode changes from the normal to zzso zzso zzso analysis by zzso requires understanding of the zzso transition phenomenon, particularly when the sample has a broad size distribution, for which the effect by combination of different modes may become complicated to zzso In this study, the zzso transition phenomenon in zzso flow zzso zzso was studied using polystyrene zzso latex zzso The retention ratio zzso gradually decreases as the particle size increases zzso zzso and reaches a minimum zzso at diameter around zzso after which R increases with increasing diameter zzso zzso It was found that the zzso selectivity zzso tends to increase as the channel thickness zzso zzso The retention behavior of zzso zzso called zzso department zzso zzso particles in zzso was investigated by varying experimental parameters including w and flow zzso zzso showed a good zzso in size determination of zzso particles with the relative standard zzso of zzso The reliability of separation obtained by zzso was evaluated by transmission electron zzso zzso
