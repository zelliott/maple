The human visual system is one of the most fascinating and complex mechanisms of the central nervous system that enables our capacity to zzso It is through the visual system that we are able to accomplish from the most simple task such as object recognition to the most complex visual zzso understanding and zzso Inspired by this sophisticated system, two models based on the properties of the human visual system are zzso These models are designed based on the concepts of receptive and zzso zzso The first model is a zzso neural network with lateral zzso called lateral zzso zzso neural zzso The second proposed model is a supervised image zzso system, called zzso and zzso based on receptive zzso This work shows that the combination of these two models is zzso and the results obtained are better than that of other state-of-the-art zzso
