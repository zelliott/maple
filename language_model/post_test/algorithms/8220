The authors propose a zzso enhancement pattern zzso for comprehensive characterization of breast tumors in zzso MR zzso By viewing serial zzso MR images as a single zzso image, they formulate the zzso as a combination of zzso dynamic enhancement and architectural features of a zzso and zzso the spatial variations of zzso zzso zzso Although the latter has been widely used by zzso for diagnostic purposes, it has rarely been employed for zzso zzso This article presents two major zzso First, the zzso features are introduced to capture zzso enhancement and its spatial zzso This is essentially carried out through the zzso transformation and zzso modeling of various zzso enhancement features, followed by the calculation of moment zzso and zzso texture zzso Second, for effectively zzso the zzso features from tumors, we develop a zzso based zzso zzso that aims at refining coarse manual zzso of zzso The zzso features are assessed through their diagnostic performance for zzso between benign and zzso tumors using a linear zzso (along with a simple zzso feature zzso in a zzso zzso zzso The experimental results for the proposed features exhibit superior performance, when compared to the existing approaches, with the area under the zzso curve approaching zzso
