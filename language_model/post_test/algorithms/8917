A hypothesis was proposed that the central nervous system controls force production by the fingers through hypothetical neural zzso The neural commands are scaled between values of 0 to 1, indicating no intentional force production or zzso voluntary contraction zzso force production, zzso A zzso of zzso connections zzso neural commands into finger zzso Two methods have been proposed to zzso the zzso connection zzso The first method uses only single finger zzso trials and zzso the zzso connection zzso by a gain zzso The second method uses a neural network model based on experimental zzso The performance of the two methods was compared on the zzso data and on a data set of zzso forces, collected over a range of total forces and moments of zzso The methods were compared in terms of zzso ability to predict finger forces, zzso accuracy of neural command zzso and zzso preserved zzso of force data for zzso force production zzso Both methods did a reasonable job of predicting the total force in zzso zzso zzso however, the neural network model performed better in regards to all other zzso Overall, the results indicate that for modeling zzso interaction the neural network method is zzso
