In dual chamber zzso zzso sensing performance is decisive for maintenance of zzso zzso zzso the efficacy of mode switching zzso during intermittent zzso zzso depends on the sensitive detection of low potential zzso zzso a high zzso sensitivity of zzso zzso commonly used in single lead zzso zzso was investigated for its efficacy and safety in zzso zzso Thirty patients received dual chamber zzso and bipolar zzso zzso leads for zzso zzso syndrome or zzso zzso 15 patients suffered from intermittent zzso zzso Pace makers were programmed to an zzso sensitivity of zzso zzso Two weeks, 3, 9, and 15 months after zzso P wave sensing threshold and T wave zzso thresholds for the native and paced T wave were zzso The zzso zzso thresholds were evaluated by zzso contraction of the zzso zzso Automatic mode switch to zzso pacing was activated when the mean zzso rate exceeded 180 zzso The patients were followed by 24-hour zzso zzso Two weeks after zzso mean zzso sensing threshold was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso without significant differences during further zzso Native T wave sensing threshold was zzso zzso zzso in all zzso In zzso of patients, paced T waves were perceived in the zzso channel at the highest zzso This T wave sensing could easily be avoided by programming a zzso zzso zzso period exceeding 300 zzso zzso zzso could not be provoked and zzso records showed no signs of sensing zzso During a zzso zzso zzso mode switch events were counted by zzso zzso zzso zzso of these events occurred during zzso zzso zzso mode switch was not zzso In zzso zzso bipolar zzso sensing with a very high sensitivity is efficient and zzso Using these sensitivity settings, zzso of the mode switch zzso almost completely avoids fast transmission of zzso rate to the zzso during zzso zzso
