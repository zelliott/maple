Fast reaching movements are an important component of our daily interaction with the world and are consequently under investigation in many fields of science and zzso Today, useful models are available for such studies, with tools for solving the inverse dynamics problem involved by these zzso These tools generally provide a set of model parameters that allows an accurate and locally optimal reconstruction of the original zzso Although the solutions that they generate may provide a data curve fitting that is sufficient for some pattern recognition applications, the best possible solution is often necessary in others, particularly those involving zzso and biomedical signal zzso To generate these solutions, we present a globally optimal zzso zzso for the zzso modeling of reaching movements based on the zzso zzso This zzso is used to test the impact of white noise on the zzso modeling of reaching movements and to benchmark the state-of-the-art locally optimal zzso Our study shows that, even with globally optimal solutions, zzso averaging is important for obtaining reliable zzso It concludes that zzso derived rules are necessary, in addition to global zzso to achieve meaningful zzso zzso which can be used to investigate the control patterns of these movement zzso
