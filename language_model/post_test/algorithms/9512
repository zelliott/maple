Three types of experiments for measuring zzso zzso long-range zzso zzso are examined and extended with state-of-the-art pulse sequence zzso The use of a zzso with corresponding zzso for accurate zzso determination is combined with the constant time technique and the conversion of zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments are examined in detail with respect to their zzso transfer zzso finally, the zzso experiment is introduced, a sequence derived from previously published alpha and beta selective zzso using a different spin state selection technique and a recently developed zzso zzso The experiments are characterized with their advantages and disadvantages and compared using zzso and zzso as standard zzso
