A fast crack profile zzso model in zzso testing is developed using an arrayed zzso current zzso The inverse problem is based on an zzso solving of the direct problem using genetic zzso In the direct problem, assuming a current zzso the incident field produced by all the coils of the arrayed sensor is obtained by the translation and zzso of the zzso zzso finite element results obtained for one zzso the zzso variation of each zzso due to the crack, is obtained by the zzso principle involving the zzso Green's zzso For the inverse problem, the surface of the crack is subdivided into zzso cells, and the objective function is expressed only in terms of the depth of each zzso The evaluation of the zzso Green's function zzso is made independently of the zzso zzso making the inversion very zzso
