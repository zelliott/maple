Cube mapping is widely used in many graphics applications due to the availability of hardware zzso However, it does not sample the zzso surface zzso Recently, a uniform zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso It exploits the zzso structure used in cube mapping and samples the zzso surface zzso Unfortunately, some zzso in zzso mapping are not zzso This zzso property may degrade the filtering zzso This paper proposes a novel zzso zzso namely zzso zzso It has the advantages of cube mapping zzso of hardware and zzso zzso and zzso mapping zzso sampling zzso In the zzso zzso mapping uses a simple function to modify the zzso zzso before the conventional cube map zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping fully exploits the cube map hardware for real-time filtering and zzso More importantly, its zzso partition structure allows a direct and real-time acquisition of the texture zzso This property zzso dynamic environment mapping in a real time zzso
