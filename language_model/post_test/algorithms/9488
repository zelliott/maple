A new approach is introduced to simultaneously detect resolved zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso using a standard zzso zzso pulse sequence with the zzso sequence timing zzso This approach exploits the dependence of the zzso zzso of the strongly coupled spin systems of zzso zzso and zzso on the echo time TE and the mixing time TM at 4 T to find an zzso sequence zzso set, zzso zzso zzso where the zzso of the zzso C4 zzso zzso around zzso zzso the zzso C4 zzso zzso around zzso zzso and the zzso C2 zzso resonance around zzso zzso are significantly suppressed and the three zzso become virtual zzso simultaneously and thus zzso zzso simulation and zzso were conducted to find the zzso sequence zzso and phantom and in zzso experiments (on normal human zzso one patient with traumatic brain injury, and one patient with brain zzso were carried out for zzso The results have demonstrated that the zzso zzso and zzso signals at zzso zzso can be well resolved using a standard zzso sequence with the zzso sequence timing parameters around zzso zzso zzso at 4 zzso while the other main zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are still preserved in the same zzso The technique can be easily implemented and should prove to be a useful tool for the basic and clinical studies associated with metabolism of zzso zzso and/or zzso
