Assessing locomotor behavior is a standard methodology to characterize the behavioral zzso of a genetic zzso Typically, levels of locomotor activity are measured using various methods that are based on the frequency of zzso breaks or distance traveled as assessed by zzso zzso zzso behavior, however, is zzso and reflects the combined influences of multiple zzso Here, we examine the number of independent dimensions of locomotor behavior in mice based on measures derived from a zzso zzso In addition, we test the hypothesis that locomotor behavior varies substantially across mouse zzso 84 mice were tested for 30 zzso in a 41 zzso 41 zzso zzso Based on previous investigations in rats, we also assessed the spatial and zzso aspects of locomotor behavior using the spatial zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso A principal component analysis and a one-way repeated measure zzso were zzso zzso mouse strains differ substantially from 129 mouse strains on almost all measures of locomotor zzso The principal component analysis revealed that two independent factors influence this set of zzso The first factor reflects the amount or level of locomotor activity, the second factor zzso the degree of spatial and zzso organization of zzso These strain differences and the existence of at least two independent dimensions when measuring locomotor behavior may help to parse the effects of gene zzso relative to strain differences in zzso zzso
