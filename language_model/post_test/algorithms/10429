zzso networks consist of multiple regulatory layers corresponding to the activity of global regulators, specialized zzso and zzso as well as proteins and zzso shaping the DNA zzso Such intrinsic complexity makes uncovering connections difficult and it calls for corresponding zzso which are adapted to the available zzso Here we present a new zzso method that predicts interactions between zzso factors and target genes using zzso of zzso gene expression data and documented interactions between genes and zzso zzso The proposed method, called zzso zzso of Regulatory Networks zzso is based on the concept of zzso association, and captures hidden geometric patterns of the network via zzso zzso We applied zzso to reconstruct zzso regulatory interactions on a zzso scale in the model bacteria zzso coli zzso zzso Application of the method not only yielded accurate predictions of verifiable zzso which outperformed on certain metrics comparable zzso but also demonstrated the utility of a geometric approach in the analysis of zzso biological zzso We also described possible applications of kernel embedding techniques to other function and network discovery zzso
