Animal models have been widely used to correlate in zzso changes in bone mineral density zzso with changes in disease state of zzso In small animal models, zzso the zzso suspension model of bone loss, a zzso assessment of zzso is zzso X-ray zzso has been surpassed in some cases by quantitative zzso zzso zzso and dual X-ray zzso zzso zzso However, there are drawbacks in using the computerized methods, especially for small zzso In this paper, we present zzso zzso to zzso determine bone area and mineral density in digitized zzso Image zzso is based on a zzso step wedge, and the zzso automatically detects the steps and zzso the zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrate how the zzso can accurately determine the cortical outline of the bone and provide reliable data and statistics for small animal zzso A downloadable zzso example for the popular zzso Image package is zzso
