Recent zzso in the zzso of residual zzso zzso zzso as a means of structure validation and zzso have demonstrated the need for, not only a more user friendly, but also a more powerful zzso analysis zzso In this paper, we introduce a software package named zzso zzso zzso Analysis zzso zzso designed to address the above zzso zzso is a zzso program with its zzso developed in zzso which is highly zzso Furthermore, the zzso engine behind this zzso is written in zzso and its zzso performance is therefore zzso The modular zzso of zzso zzso with separation of the zzso engine from the zzso engine allows for flexible and easy command line zzso This feature can be zzso for the design of automated data analysis zzso Furthermore, this software package is portable to Linux clusters for high zzso zzso In addition to basic utilities to solve for order zzso and back calculate zzso from a given order zzso and proposed structure, a number of improved zzso have been zzso These include the proper sampling of the zzso (when the system of linear equations is zzso more sophisticated filters for invalid zzso zzso error analysis for the identification of the problematic zzso and simulation of the effects of dynamic averaging zzso
