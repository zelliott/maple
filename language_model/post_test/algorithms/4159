In a wide range of studies, the emergence of orientation selectivity in primary visual zzso has been attributed to a complex interaction between zzso zzso input and zzso mechanisms at the level of zzso Although it is well known that layer 4 cortical zzso are highly sensitive to the timing of zzso zzso the role of the zzso timing of zzso zzso in cortical orientation selectivity is not well zzso Here we show that the synchronization of zzso firing contributes directly to the orientation tuned responses of primary visual zzso in a way that zzso the stimulus information per cortical zzso From the recorded responses of zzso zzso in the zzso cat, we zzso zzso zzso that would likely serve as the synaptic input to a common layer 4 cortical zzso based on anatomical zzso We used this synchronized input as the driving input to an zzso model of cortical responses and demonstrated that the tuning properties match closely to those measured in primary visual zzso By modulating the overall level of synchronization at the preferred orientation, we show that efficiency of information transmission in the zzso is zzso for levels of synchronization which match those reported in zzso recordings in response to zzso zzso a property which is relatively zzso to the orientation tuning zzso These findings indicate evidence for a more prominent role of the zzso zzso input in cortical feature selectivity based on zzso zzso
