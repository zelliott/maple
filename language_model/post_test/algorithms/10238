The zzso states of zzso coli zzso zzso undergoing zzso zzso while bound to a zzso DNA zzso were studied using zzso zzso zzso studies showed that zzso bound to zzso DNA can exist in open and closed zzso that differ in the orientation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso between eight zzso zzso zzso at different zzso and zzso zzso at the junction were conducted at each of the four zzso zzso The positions of zzso zzso based on crystal structure, and zzso zzso between these donor molecules and the zzso zzso at the DNA junction were used to predict the most likely position for the DNA junction using a zzso zzso These predicted junction positions are compared with the crystal structure to determine whether the open or closed zzso is more consistent with the zzso zzso Our data revealed that there are two distinct zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso states, an unexpected zzso The primary zzso is similar to that observed in zzso and zzso states, and the secondary zzso is a novel zzso where the duplex DNA and zzso zzso moved as a unit by zzso relative to the rest of the zzso The primary zzso found in all zzso states is consistent with the closed zzso of the crystal structure zzso the secondary zzso is a new zzso that has not been observed zzso We discuss the possible implications of this newly observed zzso
