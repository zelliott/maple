Creating chaotic zzso is the most efficient strategy to achieve mixing on zzso or in very viscous zzso In this paper, we present a quantitative theory of the long-time resonant mixing in zzso zzso zzso We use the flow between two zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso model, where multiple zzso on resonance result in mixing by causing the jumps of zzso zzso We improve the existing estimates of the zzso of the mixing zzso We show that the resulting mixing both on short and long time scales can be described in terms of a single zzso equation with a diffusion zzso depending on the averaged effect of multiple passages through zzso We discuss the exact location of the boundaries of the chaotic domain and show how it affects the properties of zzso
