zzso law asserts that in all natural languages the frequency of a word is zzso zzso to its zzso The significance, if any, of this result for language remains a zzso Here we examine a zzso hypothesis for the distribution of word zzso a so-called zzso word choice model, which is based on the assumption that the more a word is used, the more likely it is to be used zzso We argue that this model is equivalent to the neutral zzso model of population zzso and so the zzso of the different words zzso a sample of text is given by the celebrated zzso sampling formula zzso zzso zzso 3, 87 zzso which we show to produce an exponential distribution of word zzso
