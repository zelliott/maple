Color flow imaging has been well applied in clinical zzso For the high quality color flow images, clutter filter is important to separate the zzso signals from blood and zzso Traditional clutter zzso such as finite impulse response, infinite impulse response and zzso zzso were applied, which are based on the hypothesis that the clutter signal is stationary or tissue moves zzso However, in realistic clinic color flow imaging, the signals are zzso signals because of accelerated moving zzso For most related papers, simulated zzso signals are widely used without in zzso zzso zzso zzso in this paper, zzso zzso zzso zzso which is down mixing with instantaneous clutter frequency, was proposed based on in zzso carotid zzso signal in realistic color flow zzso To get the best performance, the optimal zzso order of zzso zzso filter and the optimal zzso order for zzso of instantaneous clutter frequency respectively were zzso Finally, compared with the mean blood zzso and quality of zzso color flow image, the experiment results show that zzso zzso zzso zzso which is down mixing with instantaneous clutter frequency, can significantly enhance the mean blood zzso and get high quality zzso color flow zzso
