Gene expression levels zzso even under constant external zzso Much emphasis has usually been placed on the components of this noise that are due to randomness in zzso and zzso Here we focus on the role of noise associated with the zzso to zzso zzso in particular, we analyze the effects of random arrival times and binding of zzso factors to their target sites along the zzso This contribution to the total noise sets a fundamental physical limit to the reliability of genetic control, and has clear signatures, but we show that these are easily obscured by experimental limitations and even by conventional methods for plotting the zzso zzso mean expression zzso We argue that simple, universal models of noise dominated by zzso and translation are inconsistent with the embedding of gene expression in a network of regulatory zzso Analysis of recent experiments on zzso control in the early zzso zzso shows that these results are zzso consistent with the predicted signatures of input noise, and we discuss the experiments needed to test the importance of input noise more zzso
