In this paper, a kind of surface zzso zzso zzso with three circular air zzso is zzso Based on the zzso zzso zzso method, dependence of the distribution of energy flux density, effective index, propagation length and mode area of the fundamental mode on the geometrical parameters and the working zzso is analyzed zzso Then, comparison with the zzso which was proposed in our previous work has been carried zzso zzso show that this kind of three zzso structure has better propagation properties than the double zzso zzso To investigate the relative advantages of this kind of zzso over other previous reported zzso comparison with the zzso with a single wedge has been carried zzso zzso show that this kind of zzso has shorter propagation length and larger mode zzso Finally, the possibility to overcome the large propagation loss by using a gain medium as core material is zzso Since the propagation properties can be adjusted by the geometrical and electromagnetic zzso this kind of surface zzso zzso can be applied to the field of zzso components in the integrated optical circuits and zzso
