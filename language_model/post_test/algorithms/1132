zzso receptive fields are frequently zzso a neural response to a stimulus can change over time as a result of zzso We developed an zzso point process filtering zzso that allowed us to estimate the dynamics of both the spatial receptive field zzso intensity zzso and the zzso zzso structure zzso intensity zzso of neural spike trains on a zzso time scale without zzso over time or zzso We applied this zzso to both simulated data and recordings of putative zzso zzso from the zzso region of the zzso and the deep layers of the zzso zzso zzso of awake, behaving zzso Our simulation results demonstrate that the zzso accurately tracks simultaneous changes in the spatial and zzso structure of the spike zzso When we applied the zzso to experimental data, we found consistent patterns of plasticity in the spatial and zzso intensity functions of both zzso and deep zzso zzso These patterns tended to be opposite in sign, in that the spatial intensity functions of zzso zzso showed a consistent increase over time, whereas those of deep zzso zzso tended to decrease, and the zzso intensity functions of zzso zzso showed a consistent increase only in the zzso zzso zzso region, whereas those of deep zzso zzso decreased in the region between 20 and 75 zzso In addition, the minority of deep zzso zzso whose spatial intensity functions increased in area over time fired in a significantly more zzso specific manner than zzso deep zzso zzso We zzso that this subset of deep zzso zzso may receive more direct input from zzso and may be part of a neural circuit that zzso information about the zzso location to the zzso
