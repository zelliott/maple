In this paper, we propose a novel method for the registration of zzso images of the brain that zzso the alignment of both cortical and zzso zzso In order to achieve this, relevant geometrical information is extracted from a zzso zzso and diffused into the volume using the zzso operator of zzso resulting in a zzso zzso that zzso cortical folding zzso This zzso field is then refined with an intensity driven optical flow procedure that registers zzso regions, while preserving the cortical zzso The result is a combined surface and volume zzso zzso that accurately registers both cortical and zzso regions, establishing a single coordinate system suitable for the entire zzso
