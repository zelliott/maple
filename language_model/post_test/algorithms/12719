zzso zzso are structured zzso communities involved in a broad range of zzso Knowing how zzso bacteria adapt their zzso mechanisms near surfaces is crucial for understanding the transition between zzso and zzso zzso By translating zzso movies into zzso databases of bacterial behavior, we identified fundamental type IV zzso mechanisms for zzso zzso surface zzso involved in distinct zzso zzso zzso stood upright and zzso with zzso zzso for two-dimensional surface zzso zzso orientation facilitated surface detachment and could influence zzso zzso
