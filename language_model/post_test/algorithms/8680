Modern zzso zzso are often required to accurately measure the absorbed dose in a wide range of radiation zzso While programs are commonly developed around the fields tested as part of the National Voluntary Accreditation Program zzso the actual fields of application may be significantly zzso zzso zzso designed to meet the zzso standard, which emphasizes photons and zzso beta radiation, may not be capable of the zzso discrimination necessary for accurate assessment of absorbed dose in the work zzso To address this problem, some processors use one zzso for zzso testing and one or more different zzso for the work zzso After several years of experience with a multiple zzso approach, the zzso Services Group of Yankee Atomic Electric Company zzso developed a zzso system for use with a zzso zzso badge using zzso and zzso zzso The design of the dosimeter allows the measurement of the effective energies of both zzso and beta components of the radiation field, resulting in excellent zzso zzso The zzso was successfully tested in all of the zzso zzso and beta fields, as well as several zzso fields representative of the work zzso The work environment fields, including low- and zzso beta radiation and mixed fields of low-energy photons and beta zzso are often more demanding than the zzso zzso This paper discusses the development of the zzso as well as some results of the system testing zzso zzso zzso angular response, and a unique test to demonstrate the stability of the zzso An analysis of the uncertainty of the reported doses under various zzso conditions is also zzso
