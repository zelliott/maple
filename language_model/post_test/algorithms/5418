We present functional ultrasound zzso a method for imaging transient changes in blood volume in the whole brain at better zzso resolution than with other functional brain imaging zzso zzso uses zzso zzso at high frame rate and can measure blood volumes in smaller vessels than previous ultrasound zzso zzso identifies regions of brain zzso and was used to image zzso cortical and zzso responses and the propagation of zzso zzso in the rat zzso
