We have developed a mathematical model in concert with an zzso that allows us to calculate zzso zzso flux and zzso through a single zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with just a few functional zzso from zzso coli were loaded with 250 zzso zzso and suspended in a low zzso zzso The pH of the zzso zzso external solution was recorded during sequential treatment with the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso cyanide zzso and zzso From these pH traces and separate zzso of zzso size and zzso concentration we calculate the zzso zzso through a single zzso zzso This methodology is sensitive enough to detect small zzso zzso zzso We find that zzso zzso has a zzso flux of zzso zzso 500 zzso at a zzso potential of 106 zzso zzso degrees C and pH zzso This zzso to a zzso zzso of zzso zzso
