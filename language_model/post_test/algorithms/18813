DNA zzso is a type of chemical modification of DNA that adds a zzso group to DNA at the fifth carbon of the zzso zzso zzso In normal cells, zzso of zzso zzso is extensively found across the zzso However, specific DNA regions known as the zzso islands, short zzso zzso stretches zzso zzso - zzso are commonly zzso During zzso on the other hand, global zzso and zzso island zzso are widely zzso De zzso zzso at zzso zzso is typically associated with loss of expression of zzso zzso thus it is believed to be an alternative to zzso and deletion in the zzso of tumor zzso zzso In this paper, we report that sequences zzso zzso sites can be used for predicting DNA zzso zzso DNA zzso levels were measured by utilizing a new high zzso sequencing technology zzso to sequence zzso treated DNA from four types of primary leukemia and zzso cells and normal peripheral blood zzso After measuring zzso levels at each zzso site, we used 30 zzso zzso sequences to characterize zzso zzso in terms of character compositions and built zzso models for DNA zzso zzso achieving up to zzso prediction accuracy in zzso cross validation zzso Our study is first of its kind to build zzso models for zzso zzso by utilizing zzso site specific zzso zzso
