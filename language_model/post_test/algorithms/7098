This paper attempts to introduce an improved acoustic zzso zzso zzso method to zzso zzso rubbing fault in rotating zzso To investigate the propagation characteristics of acoustic zzso signals in zzso shell plate of rotating machinery, the plate wave theory is used in a thin zzso A simulation is conducted and its result shows the zzso accuracy of zzso depends on zzso zzso zzso and array zzso In order to reduce the effect of propagation characteristics on the source zzso an zzso signal zzso method is introduced by combining plate wave theory and zzso packet zzso And the revised zzso zzso to reduce effect of array size is zzso The accuracy of rubbing zzso based on zzso and the improved method of present paper are compared by the rubbing test carried on a test table of rotating zzso The results indicate that the improved method can zzso rub fault zzso
