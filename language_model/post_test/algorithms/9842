The objective of this study is to develop a minimal invasive zzso imaging method to determine the zzso level of an internal zzso In this method, the tissue is illuminated using an optical fiber by several zzso in the visible and zzso zzso Each wavelength is absorbed by the tissue and thus causes increase in its zzso The temperature increase is observed by a coherent zzso bundle in the zzso zzso The zzso imaging of the tissue is done using a zzso camera through the coherent zzso zzso the temperature rise allows zzso the tissue composition in general, and specifically the zzso zzso Such a system enables imaging of the temperature within body cavities through a commercial zzso As an intermediate stage, the method is applied and tested on exposed skin zzso A zzso zzso is used to find the most suitable zzso value affecting the temperature zzso The zzso is tested on a theoretical tissue model with various zzso implemented for this study, and on zzso phantom zzso The calculated zzso values are in agreement with the real zzso zzso
