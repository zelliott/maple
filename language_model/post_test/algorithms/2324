To evaluate the therapeutic and financial benefits of protocol therapy for acute asthma using standard zzso 

This study employed a sequential design in which the influence of an asthma care path on hospital admissions, length of stay zzso in the emergency department, and return visits were evaluated for 1 zzso This information was contrasted with similar data obtained from the 8 months immediately before the protocol was implemented zzso and a 12-month period after strict adherence to it had declined zzso 

In all, 526 acute zzso of asthma were treated with the care path, and zzso and zzso episodes were evaluated during the zzso and zzso zzso zzso There were no significant differences between the presenting clinical or zzso features of any zzso With the zzso zzso of the patients resolved their symptoms within zzso zzso zzso zzso of arrival in the emergency department with a zzso return rate within 24 zzso The zzso used quickly identified those needing zzso Patients not meeting the criteria for discharge after receiving the treatments employed typically did not resolve their symptoms for days zzso hospital stay zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared with the zzso period, the care path significantly reduced the LOS by 50 minutes, the number of urgent and intensive care unit admissions by zzso and zzso respectively, and the frequency of return visits within 24 hours by zzso zzso to patients and third-party zzso decreased zzso When adherence to the protocol diminished, zzso admissions, and returns rose significantly toward zzso values and the financial benefits were zzso 

zzso protocol therapy, based primarily upon aggressive use of zzso in association with serial monitoring of key zzso of improvement, provides prompt and efficient relief for acute zzso of zzso Such an approach yields significant financial benefit while quickly identifying individuals who require zzso and it also detects physician practice patterns that can have potentially zzso impacts on patient zzso
