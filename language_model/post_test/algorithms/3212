zzso focusing of zzso zzso has been shown to enable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this process, an entire plane in the sample is selectively excited by introduction of geometrical zzso to an zzso zzso Many applications, such as zzso zzso zzso or zzso imaging, require, however, zzso patterns which significantly differ from homogeneous zzso of an entire plane in the zzso Here we consider the effects of such spatial zzso of a temporally focused zzso pattern on both the generated zzso pattern and on its zzso zzso The transition in the zzso response between line zzso and zzso zzso is characterized both theoretically and zzso For zzso zzso we show that in the case of zzso zzso the zzso response is generally similar to that of zzso zzso while for zzso zzso the zzso response slightly zzso when the phase variation is zzso a regime which is shown to be relevant to zzso by beams shaped using spatial light zzso Finally, general guidelines for the use of zzso modulated temporally focused zzso are zzso
