This work presents a method that allows for the assessment of zzso zzso zzso motion in zzso at microscopic zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso at zzso T was applied to map zzso motion in healthy mice along three zzso zzso zzso zzso maps were acquired at three different levels in the zzso zzso with an zzso resolution of 98 zzso a slice thickness of zzso zzso and a zzso resolution of 6 zzso The applied zzso method was validated with phantom experiments that confirmed the correctness of the method with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined for the healthy zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were zzso zzso data was also used to calculate the zzso twist angle during zzso at different slices in the zzso zzso
