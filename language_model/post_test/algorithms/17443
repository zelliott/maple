A zzso Carlo zzso zzso in the program zzso has been developed and tested for the purpose of positioning large molecular fragments or small flexible molecules in electron density zzso The search performed by the zzso appears to be sufficiently thorough to accurately position a small flexible zzso in zzso density while remaining sufficiently random to offer interesting alternate suggestions for density representing zzso binding modes of a zzso Furthermore, the zzso is shown to be efficient enough to accurately position large rigid molecular zzso In the first of the test cases with large molecular fragments, zzso was surprisingly effective in positioning a zzso model of a zzso domain in poor electron density resulting from molecular replacement with a partial zzso At zzso A resolution the domain was positioned consistently within zzso A of its zzso determined zzso Even at zzso A resolution zzso could consistently position the domain to within zzso A of its actual zzso A second set of tests with large molecular fragments revealed that zzso could correctly position large molecular fragments with quite significant zzso from the actual zzso In this test case, fragments ranging from a zzso protein domain with a zzso A zzso zzso from the actual structure to a zzso pair ideal zzso DNA duplex were positioned accurately in a zzso A electron density map derived from multiple zzso replacement zzso Even when decreasing the quality of the zzso from a figure of merit of zzso to as low as zzso 35, zzso could still effectively position the large protein domain and the DNA zzso Since it is efficient, can handle large molecular fragments, and works in poor and low resolution zzso zzso could be a useful tool for interpreting electron density maps in de zzso structure zzso and in molecular replacement zzso zzso zzso
