zzso factors and the short, often zzso DNA sequences they recognize are central regulators of gene zzso but their regulatory code is challenging to dissect zzso Thus, zzso approaches have long been used to identify putative regulatory elements from the patterns in promoter zzso Here we present a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for identifying regulatory sequence zzso specifically developed to address two common shortcomings of existing zzso First, zzso uses the zzso enrichment of regulatory elements near zzso start sites to significantly increase sensitivity, while providing new information about the preferred zzso of those zzso Second, zzso zzso position weight zzso for a discrete motif representation that appears more resistant to zzso We apply this zzso to discover sequences related to zzso high-level gene expression in the model plant zzso zzso and then zzso validate the importance of those elements by systematically mutating two zzso promoters and measuring the effect on gene expression zzso This provides a foundation for future efforts to rationally engineer gene expression in plants, a problem of great importance in developing biotech crop zzso
