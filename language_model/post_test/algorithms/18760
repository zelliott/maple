Advanced zzso cochlear implants have independent current sources that can share stimulation current between 2 contacts zzso zzso By stimulating 2 adjacent zzso with different zzso different pitches can be zzso allowing to increase the number of processing zzso 

A zzso crossover design was used to compare 3 different current steering zzso to the clinical zzso zzso 

The study was a zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The study group consisted of 8 zzso deaf subjects with a minimum of 12-month experience in zzso 

The following programs were zzso 1) a Fast zzso Transformation zzso current steering zzso with 120 stimulation zzso 2) the same current steering zzso but with 16,000 stimulation zzso and 3) a current steering zzso based on a zzso decomposition of the original signal with 16,000 stimulation zzso 

Speech perception tests in quiet and in zzso zzso International zzso et zzso zzso noise, as well as with competing zzso an zzso test of the frequency difference zzso a Quality Assessment zzso 

Current results do not show any improvement in speech perception for a certain current steering strategy compared with zzso However, when selecting the optimal current steering strategy, subjects could achieve a significant benefit compared with the clinical zzso In addition, the frequency difference zzso could be reduced significantly at zzso zzso 

Current steering seems to have the potential to improve both understanding in adverse listening situations and frequency zzso However, the optimal zzso needs further zzso
