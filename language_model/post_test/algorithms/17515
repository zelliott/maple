The aim of this study was to propose and validate a zzso correction method to obtain zzso power values taking into account inertia of the zzso during zzso on zzso cycle zzso This correction method was obtained from a basic zzso of linear zzso evolution during the initial phase (until zzso power) of a sprint and included simple parameters as zzso inertia, zzso zzso time to reach zzso zzso and friction zzso The zzso of this model was tested by comparing measured and calculated zzso power values for 19 sprint bouts performed by five subjects against zzso N zzso friction zzso zzso differences between measured and calculated zzso power zzso zzso zzso zzso and a mean error index of zzso zzso from zzso to zzso showed the zzso of this zzso Furthermore, the differences between measured zzso power and power zzso inertia zzso ranging from zzso to zzso emphasized the usefulness of power correcting in studies about zzso power which do not include inertia, and also the interest of this simple zzso zzso
