zzso zzso is widely used to treat symptomatic zzso zzso zzso zzso to drug zzso and can be facilitated by a number of different zzso 

To evaluate our performance as a new zzso for zzso zzso and to evaluate the efficacy of different zzso zzso zzso 

We employed three techniques in zzso zzso the three-dimensional zzso mapping approaches zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vein zzso zzso zzso The immediate restoration of zzso rhythm was considered as acute zzso while success at 6 months was determined by the maintenance of zzso rhythm on zzso zzso 

Between March 2008 and March 2010, 109 patients underwent zzso zzso zzso age: 58 years; zzso zzso zzso success rates did not differ significantly between zzso and zzso zzso vs zzso zzso but the zzso group achieved greater success than the two zzso groups combined zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso patients demonstrated greater zzso success than persistent zzso patients zzso and although the ratio of zzso to persistent zzso patients was slightly higher among the zzso group, zzso zzso confirmed zzso and zzso zzso as zzso of zzso zzso success at 6 months was zzso Including zzso some performed beyond the study period, our overall success rate at 6 months was zzso Four patients experienced zzso but there were no zzso 

Despite being a new zzso with relative zzso we achieved success rates comparable to those of established zzso zzso zzso performed significantly better than the two zzso zzso
