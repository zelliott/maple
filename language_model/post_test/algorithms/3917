Using a zzso zzso zzso zzso optical zzso zzso zzso system, we investigate the degree of polarization zzso of light zzso from the retinal nerve fiber layer zzso in normal human zzso zzso for processing data were developed to analyze the zzso in phase zzso and intensity of zzso light in directions parallel and perpendicular to the nerve fiber axis zzso and slow axes of zzso Considering superior, inferior, and zzso zzso we observe the strongest degradation in the zzso with increasing zzso depth in the zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso in normal human subjects are known to have the smallest diameter in the zzso zzso and the greater degradation observed in the zzso suggests that higher zzso noise may be associated with neural structure in the zzso zzso The association between depth degradation in the zzso and zzso structural properties may broaden the utility of zzso as a functional imaging zzso
