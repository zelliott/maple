We show for the first time, to our knowledge, that zzso can measure the size of potential nest zzso Nest size assessment is by individual zzso Such zzso always make more than one visit to a potential nest before initiating an zzso of their nest zzso and they deploy zzso trails within the potential new nest on their first zzso We test three alternative hypotheses for the way in which zzso might measure zzso zzso indicated that individual zzso use the intersection frequency between their own paths to assess nest zzso These results are consistent with zzso using a zzso needle zzso to assess nest zzso
