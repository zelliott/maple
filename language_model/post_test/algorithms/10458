In this paper, a new zzso extraction technique that jointly extracts four zzso parameters from zzso zzso data collected as a function of zzso energy is zzso The extraction technique is based on zzso artificial neural networks zzso where the ANN is trained to learn the inherent relationship between the input parameters zzso zzso zzso diffusion length zzso dead layer thickness zzso and relative quantum efficiency zzso and the output zzso zzso intensity versus electron beam zzso After the training of the zzso it is possible to observe the reverse process and extract the four parameters from any zzso curve using an exhaustive search zzso One of the main advantages of the proposed method is that the optimum set of values for the four parameters zzso zzso zzso zzso are obtained because the exhaustive search is performed in the search space spanned by all four zzso zzso results on an zzso zzso free zzso semiconductor sample show that a unique set of zzso values with errors less than zzso from the nominal values can be obtained for each set of the experimental data points using the proposed zzso
