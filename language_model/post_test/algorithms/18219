zzso zzso is a very useful tool for understanding various chemical and physical phenomena in complex zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of Nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso Press, Oxford, zzso experiment is an easy and quick way to obtain zzso relaxation constant zzso in low zzso Most of the samples usually have a distribution of zzso zzso zzso of this distribution of zzso from the noisy zzso data is essentially an zzso inverse zzso Various inversion approaches have been used to solve this problem, to zzso A major issue in using an inversion zzso is determining how accurate the zzso distribution zzso A systematic analysis of an inversion algorithm, zzso zzso zzso zzso Brown, zzso zzso zzso inversion of zzso zzso data, Journal of zzso zzso 132 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Brown, zzso zzso zzso inversion of zzso zzso data zzso Data zzso zzso data, systematic data zzso and zzso Journal of zzso zzso 147 zzso zzso was performed by means of simulated zzso data zzso Through our simulation technique and statistical zzso the effects of various experimental parameters on the zzso distribution were zzso We zzso to the true distribution by matching up the inversion results from a series of true zzso data and a noisy simulated zzso In addition to simulation studies, the same approach was also applied on real experimental data to support the simulation zzso
