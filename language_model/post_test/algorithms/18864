This paper presents a new application of the dynamic zzso rippled noise zzso zzso by generating dynamic pitch contours representative of those that occur in natural speech in the context of zzso and the frequency following response zzso Besides zzso steady state and linear rising zzso zzso rising stimuli were modeled after pitch contours of natural productions of Mandarin zzso zzso zzso data on pitch representation at the level of the zzso as reflected in zzso were evaluated for all zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso were observed corresponding to the fundamental period zzso as well as spectral bands at the fundamental and its zzso for both a low and a high iteration zzso At the higher iteration step, both spectral and zzso zzso representations were more zzso indicating that both acoustic properties may be zzso for pitch extraction at the level of the zzso By applying zzso zzso stimuli to elicit zzso we can evaluate the effects of zzso degradation on 1) the neural representation of zzso pitch features in a target population zzso cochlear zzso and 2) the efficacy of signal processing schemes in conventional hearing aids and cochlear implants to recover these zzso
