This study describes a method to determine the lowest possible thresholds for volume zzso zzso dose index zzso and maximum tolerable zzso noise zzso values for coronary calcium scanning while maintaining accurate zzso score zzso The method was applied to a comparison between the zzso reconstruction zzso and filtered zzso zzso image reconstruction zzso in a phantom zzso 

An zzso zzso phantom with a zzso insert for the zzso of coronary zzso containing zzso 400, and 800 zzso zzso of calcium mass spheres of 1, 3, and 5 zzso diameter zzso zzso zzso zzso was scanned without zzso and with zzso an additional 2 zzso wrap of zzso zzso zzso simulated volume scans were performed on a zzso zzso zzso scanner zzso zzso Toshiba Medical Systems, zzso Japan) set to 120 zzso peak zzso and 10 to 580 zzso variations in 21 zzso For the zzso the zzso zzso zzso Reduction zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso scores were calculated zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso tests to assess the accuracy of the zzso scores were performed to determine the zzso thresholds and the associated maximum zzso noise zzso for zzso and zzso from identical raw zzso The inclusion tests were as zzso zzso the semiautomatic identification of the 1 zzso sphere with 800 zzso zzso zzso the exclusion of zzso zzso and zzso a statistical zzso zzso zzso differences between the zzso score means from both image reconstruction zzso were evaluated using the paired zzso zzso 

All zzso scores using both reconstruction methods were normally distributed zzso zzso zzso For zzso and zzso the mean zzso zzso of zzso score, zzso and zzso respectively, were determined as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso unit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso scores obtained using zzso (both with and without the additional 2 zzso muscle zzso were slightly zzso zzso but significantly lower zzso zzso zzso than those obtained using zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso Reduction zzso zzso zzso shows potential to reduce dose exposure by approximately zzso in comparison with the dose currently applied with zzso image zzso On the basis of phantom zzso a target noise of 20 zzso for the application of this method in coronary calcium scanning is recommended to avoid loss in zzso
