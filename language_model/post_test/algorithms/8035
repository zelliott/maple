We study zzso navigation (the search of a target in a zzso zzso where each site is connected to one other random site at distance zzso with probability approximately zzso by means of an exact master equation for the zzso We show that the zzso zzso behavior for the delivery time T to a target at distance L scales as T approximately zzso when zzso and otherwise as T approximately zzso with zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso These values of zzso exceed the rigorous lower bounds established by zzso We also address the situation where there is a finite probability for the message to get lost along its way and find short delivery times zzso upon zzso for a wide range of zzso
