We demonstrate enhanced three-dimensional zzso imaging behind a scattering material by increasing the zzso in the ultrasound zzso zzso We enhance the optical intensity using zzso shaping before the zzso The zzso signal induced by an object placed behind the scattering medium serves as feedback to zzso the zzso enabling one order of magnitude enhancement of the zzso zzso Using the enhanced optical intensity, we scan the object in zzso before zzso of the data to reconstruct the zzso The zzso profile of the zzso signal provides the information used to reconstruct the third zzso
