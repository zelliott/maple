Multiple zzso of the zzso mosaic virus zzso promoter zzso are used to drive the expression of zzso in genetically modified plants, for both research purposes and commercial zzso The genetic organization of the densely packed zzso of this virus results in sequence overlap between zzso and viral gene zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso The present paper investigates whether introduction of zzso zzso by genetic transformation is likely to result in the expression of functional zzso of the zzso protein and in potential impacts in transgenic zzso A zzso analysis was performed to assess the safety for human and animal health of putative translation products of gene VI overlapping zzso No relevant similarity was identified between the putative peptides and known zzso and zzso using different zzso From a literature study it became clear that long zzso of the zzso do contain an open reading frame, when zzso might result in unintended zzso zzso A zzso is proposed to evaluate possible unintended effects in plant zzso based on the DNA sequence actually introduced and on the plant zzso taking into account the known effects of zzso expressed zzso zzso in model zzso
