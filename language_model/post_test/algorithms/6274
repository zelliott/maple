In this paper, we present a zzso ascent learning method of the zzso neural network for zzso zzso zzso The method is intended to provide a zzso parallel zzso for solving the zzso zzso zzso To do this we use the zzso neural network to get a zzso zzso zzso and increase the energy by zzso weights in a zzso ascent direction of the energy to help the network escape from the state of the zzso zzso zzso to the state of the maximum zzso zzso or better zzso A large number of instances are simulated to verify the proposed method with the simulation results showing that the solution quality is superior to that of best existing parallel zzso We also test the learning method on total coloring zzso The simulation results show that our method finds optimal solution in every test zzso
