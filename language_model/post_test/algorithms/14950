zzso were carried out for an zzso zzso with the sequence zzso zzso with explicit consideration of the zzso between the zzso of the zzso and the zzso zzso at a given zzso The available zzso experimental data indicate a high preference for the zzso zzso zzso form of zzso at intermediate pH zzso 6) and a zzso of the zzso form at both high zzso 9) and low zzso 3) zzso In order to identify the source of the stability of the zzso of this zzso as a function of zzso zzso Carlo simulations were used to generate an ensemble of low-energy zzso at different pH values zzso 3, 6 and zzso The total free energy function used in these calculations includes terms that account for the zzso free energy and free energy of zzso These terms are evaluated by means of a fast zzso boundary element zzso zzso In good qualitative agreement with the experiments, our results indicate that the zzso averaged population of the zzso zzso form of the zzso has a maximum zzso zzso at pH 6 and is significantly smaller zzso % and 23 zzso for higher and lower pH values, respectively, following the trend of the experimental zzso Also, the degree of charge for the zzso zzso as well as the contribution of zzso interactions to the stability of the preferred zzso vary widely at the different pH zzso Different kinds of packing of the aromatic zzso of zzso and zzso against the zzso ring are observed at different pH values, indicating that their contribution to the stability of the low-energy zzso is also zzso In zzso our results provide a basis for discussing the nature of the interactions that stabilize zzso zzso of the zzso zzso as a function of zzso
