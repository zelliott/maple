For zzso irritation from volatile zzso a version of zzso rule zzso zzso zzso can model the zzso between concentration zzso and duration of exposure zzso to achieve a fixed sensory impact, zzso zzso irritation or a fixed zzso zzso The term k is a zzso The zzso zzso represents how well the system zzso over zzso An zzso of 1 indicates complete zzso zzso an zzso increase in stimulus duration exactly compensates for cutting the concentration zzso An zzso greater than 1 indicates incomplete zzso zzso more than an zzso increase in duration is zzso In a previous study of zzso zzso zzso varied systematically with number of zzso zzso integration became more complete as the length of the carbon chain zzso To explore the zzso of this finding, we tested zzso zzso that differ in the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to measure irritation zzso Human subjects received a fixed concentration of a single compound within each experimental zzso zzso duration was varied to find the zzso stimulus that caused zzso zzso Concentration and compound varied across zzso zzso with results with zzso integration became more complete as the number of zzso units zzso zzso zzso varies with chain zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso may play a role in the dynamics of zzso Further, preliminary analyses suggest that, for data pooled across both chemical series, zzso varies systematically with molecular parameters related to zzso and zzso
