We introduce a new method for zzso sites prediction based on the theory of support zzso machines zzso The zzso represents a new approach to supervised pattern zzso and has been successfully applied to a wide range of pattern recognition zzso In the process of zzso sites zzso the statistical information of zzso secondary structure in the vicinity of zzso sites, zzso donor and zzso sites, is introduced in order to compare recognition ratio of true positive and true zzso From the results of comparison, addition of structural information has brought no significant benefit for the recognition of zzso sites and had even lowered the rate of zzso Our results suggest that, through three cross zzso the zzso method can achieve a good performance for zzso sites zzso
