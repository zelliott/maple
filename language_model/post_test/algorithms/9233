zzso functional theory calculations at the zzso level have been performed to zzso the mechanism and reaction zzso for the reduction of hydrogen zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and their sulfur zzso The effects of zzso have been included with the zzso model, and in the case of the zzso zzso reaction, diffuse functions were used on heavy atoms for the geometry zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of the electron density in each system was investigated using the quantum theory of atoms in zzso and a detailed interpretation of the electronic charge and population data as well as the atomic energies is zzso zzso free energy barriers for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, in good qualitative agreement with zzso It is demonstrated that the oxidized zzso atom is significantly zzso in all cases and that the zzso of the reactions is attributed to the zzso oxygen atoms via zzso The lower barrier to zzso exhibited by the zzso is largely due to zzso effects in the zzso zzso
