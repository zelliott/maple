This paper presents an intensive zzso study of the resonance scattering of zzso breast cancer zzso The three-dimensional electromagnetic model, based on the zzso zzso is used to obtain induced electric and magnetic currents on breast and tumor zzso The results show that the zzso zzso tumor can be zzso based on its zzso regardless of orientation, incident zzso or incident or scattered zzso The zzso of the tumor depend solely upon its physical characteristics zzso shape and electrical zzso however, their locations are not functions of the depth of the tumor beneath the breast zzso This paper can be a guide in the selection of the frequency range at which the tumor resonates to produce the maximum signature at the zzso
