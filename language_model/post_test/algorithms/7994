The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of relative sensitivity zzso without zzso detection zzso vs zzso zzso and reading mode on reader performance when using zzso zzso 

Two sets of 100 images zzso and zzso zzso were created by adding zzso or zzso simulated masses to random locations in 100 normal zzso This produced a relative sensitivity, substantially less for the zzso set and similar for the zzso zzso Seven readers reviewed every image in each set and specified location and probability scores using three reading modes (without zzso second read with zzso and concurrent read with zzso Reader detection accuracy was analyzed using areas under zzso receiver operating characteristic curves, sensitivity, and the number of zzso findings per zzso 

For the zzso set, average differences in areas under zzso receiver operating characteristic curves, sensitivity, and zzso findings per image without zzso were zzso zzso and zzso respectively, compared to second read and zzso zzso and zzso (not statistically zzso respectively, compared to concurrent zzso For the zzso set, average differences were zzso (not statistically zzso zzso and zzso respectively, compared to second read and zzso (not statistically zzso zzso and zzso (not statistically zzso respectively, compared to concurrent read (all differences were statistically significant except as zzso zzso were greater in the zzso set than the zzso zzso zzso between second read and concurrent read were not zzso 

Relative sensitivity is a critical factor that determines incremental improvement in reader performance when using zzso and appears to be more important than reading zzso Relative sensitivity may determine the clinical usefulness of zzso in different clinical applications and for different types of zzso
