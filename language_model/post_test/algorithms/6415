The solution structure of zzso zzso the zzso zzso analogue in which the zzso zzso zzso zzso is replaced by zzso has been determined by zzso molecular zzso A two-state model, in which a zzso with the zzso zzso over the southern zzso of the zzso and a zzso with the zzso zzso over the eastern zzso of the zzso are both populated at room temperature, was required by the zzso zzso A rotation profile and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the eastern zzso is the more stable, in contrast to zzso itself in which the southern zzso is zzso Consensus structures of the two zzso show that the zzso zzso bond is slightly shorter and the zzso ring is less folded in zzso than in zzso A study of the zzso of zzso in zzso solution zzso degrees zzso revealed competing zzso and zzso pathways as for zzso but with zzso being zzso faster and zzso being zzso slower at 100 degrees C than for zzso zzso of the zzso for the zzso zzso reaction and for the detached zzso zzso as a function of temperature permitted correction of the zzso and zzso rate zzso for the zzso presence of the zzso species of zzso zzso analysis of the resulting rate zzso for the zzso species show that the zzso of zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is identical with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The opposite effect is seen for zzso where the zzso of zzso are identical but the zzso of zzso is 5 zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso less negative for zzso zzso to 37 degrees C provides a rate constant for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso smaller than for zzso Combined with earlier results for the zzso zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso the zzso efficiency of the zzso for zzso of zzso at 37 degrees C can be calculated to be zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso smaller than for zzso Thus, the bulky zzso zzso makes at best a zzso zzso zzso contribution to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
