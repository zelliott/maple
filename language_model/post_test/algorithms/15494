zzso methods began their evolution in the early 1920s with R A Fisher, and have developed into a rich framework for zzso zzso This framework offers tools for the analysis of the differential geometry of the full likelihood function based on observed zzso We examine likelihood functions derived from inverse zzso zzso probability density models of cortical ensemble responses of single zzso Specifically, we investigate the problem of sound zzso from the observation of an ensemble of neural responses recorded from the primary (Al) field of the auditory zzso The problem is framed as a zzso inverse problem with multiple sources of zzso zzso and expected Fisher information are defined for the zzso cortical ensemble likelihood zzso zzso field functions of multiple acoustic parameters are constructed and linked to the zzso zzso The impact of zzso multiple acoustic parameters related to the direction of a sound is discussed, and the implications of eliminating nuisance parameters are zzso We examine the degree of acuity afforded by a small ensemble of cortical zzso for locating sounds in space, and show the predicted patterns of zzso zzso which tend to follow zzso zzso
