We have compared commonly used sequence comparison zzso scoring zzso and gap penalties using a method that identifies statistically significant differences in zzso Search sensitivity with either the zzso zzso or zzso is significantly improved by using modern scoring zzso such as zzso and zzso gap penalties instead of the conventional zzso zzso More dramatic improvement can be obtained by zzso similarity scores by the zzso of the length of the library sequence zzso With the best modern scoring zzso zzso or zzso and optimal gap penalties zzso for the first zzso in the gap and zzso for additional zzso zzso and zzso performed significantly better than zzso With zzso and optimal scoring zzso zzso or zzso and gap penalties zzso zzso the rigorous zzso zzso performs better than either zzso and zzso although with the zzso zzso the difference with zzso was not zzso zzso performed better than zzso based on other simple functions of library sequence zzso zzso also performed better than scores based on zzso zzso but the differences were not statistically significant for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso scoring zzso and gap penalties are reported for zzso and zzso using conventional or zzso similarity zzso zzso with no penalty for gap extension, or no penalty for gap zzso or an infinite penalty for gaps performed significantly worse than the best zzso zzso in performance between zzso and zzso were not significant when partial query sequences were zzso However, the best performance with complete query sequences was obtained with the zzso zzso and zzso
