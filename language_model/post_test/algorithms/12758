zzso zzso zzso zzso French for zzso Controlled zzso zzso was performed on laboratory apparatus as well as on a pilot plant for proving its zzso and identifying the zzso processing conditions and recognizing the energy consumption and the quantity of water used for such an zzso zzso and zzso analysis of the extracts and zzso material were carried out to assess the extracts and solid zzso The zzso essential oils obtained by using the new zzso extraction process was zzso modeled and zzso and zzso compared to the conventional zzso zzso The most important differences between the two essential oils were reflected in the yields, with zzso as against zzso g zzso g of raw matter, and in the extraction time, with zzso s as against some hours for respectively the zzso and the zzso zzso These differences have been previewed through the fundamental zzso They can normally explain the great decreasing of energy consumption to be zzso zzso of raw zzso The amount of water to be added was about 42 zzso zzso of raw zzso
