zzso imaging, originating from the field of earth remote zzso is a powerful tool that is being increasingly used in a wide variety of applications for material zzso Several workers have used techniques like linear spectral zzso zzso to discriminate materials in images derived from spectral zzso However, many spectral analysis zzso rely on assumptions that are often violated in zzso zzso This study explores zzso originally developed as improvements on early earth imaging techniques that can be easily translated for use with spectral zzso 

To best demonstrate the application of earth remote sensing spectral analysis tools to spectral zzso data, earth imaging software was used to analyze data acquired with a zzso zzso microscope with mechanical spectral zzso For this study, spectral training signatures zzso referred to as zzso were selected with the zzso zzso Visual Information zzso Boulder, zzso zzso zzso processing flow, a series of tools that use the zzso zzso nature of zzso data to find the most zzso pure (or zzso zzso zzso within the data zzso This set of zzso signatures was then used in the full range of mapping zzso available in zzso to determine locations, and in some cases zzso zzso of zzso 

zzso and abundance images showed a broad agreement between the spectral analysis zzso supported through visual assessment of output zzso images and through statistical analysis of the distribution of zzso within each zzso zzso 

The powerful spectral analysis zzso available in zzso software, the result of decades of research in earth imaging, are easily translated to new sources of spectral zzso Although the scale between earth imagery and spectral zzso is radically different, the problem is the same: mapping material locations and zzso based on unique spectral zzso
