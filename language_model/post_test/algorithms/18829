zzso representations of signals have drawn considerable interest in recent zzso The assumption that natural signals, such as images, admit a sparse decomposition over a redundant dictionary leads to efficient zzso for handling such sources of zzso In particular, the design of well adapted zzso for images has been a major zzso The zzso has been recently proposed for this task and shown to perform very well for various zzso image processing zzso In this paper, we address the problem of learning zzso for color images and extend the zzso zzso image zzso zzso that appears zzso This work puts forward ways for handling zzso noise and missing information, paving the way to state-of-the-art results in applications such as color image zzso zzso and zzso as demonstrated in this zzso
