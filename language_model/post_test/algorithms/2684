Traditional optical projection zzso zzso acquires a single image at each rotation angle, thereby suffering from limitations in zzso dynamic zzso this conventional usage cannot resolve features in samples with highly zzso zzso such as in small animals with zzso of varying zzso We present a novel technique, applying zzso high dynamic range zzso imaging to zzso and demonstrate its ability to resolve fine details in zzso zzso without complicated chemical zzso We implement the zzso reconstruction zzso on the zzso yielding a performance increase of two orders of zzso These features give our method potential application in zzso high-resolution in zzso zzso zzso
