To restore hearing sensation, cochlear implants deliver electrical zzso to the auditory nerve by relying on sophisticated signal processing zzso that convert acoustic zzso to electrical zzso Although individuals fitted with cochlear implants perform well in quiet, in the presence of background noise, the speech zzso of cochlear implant listeners is more susceptible to background noise than that of normal hearing zzso Traditionally, to increase performance in noise, zzso noise reduction strategies have been zzso More recently, a number of approaches have suggested that speech zzso in noise can be improved further by making use of two or more zzso zzso zzso strategies based on multiple microphones can better exploit the spatial diversity of speech and noise because such strategies rely mostly on spatial information about the relative position of competing sound zzso In this article, we identify and zzso the most significant theoretical aspects that zzso zzso and zzso noise reduction strategies for cochlear zzso More zzso we focus on strategies of both types that have been shown to be promising for use in zzso implant zzso We present data from past and more recent studies, and zzso we outline the direction that future research in the area of noise reduction for cochlear implants could zzso
