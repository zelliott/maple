The effects of zzso on the structure, function and mechanics of the zzso zzso zzso have been studied by molecular dynamics zzso The zzso zzso and geometrical properties of the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso juxtaposition of two zzso zzso have been compared with those of three protein zzso described by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso where the core of the native protein has been systematically zzso using a zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso The results showed that it was possible to readily distinguish the inactive protein zzso from the other functionally active systems based on zzso and zzso structure zzso zzso properties such as native secondary structure content did not correlate with biological zzso Biological activity was related in part to the relative arrangement of the zzso within the binding zzso But, more global aspects, related to the overall zzso of the zzso zzso accounted for the small functional differences between zzso and zzso zzso the zzso absorbed core zzso by altering the local structure at the sequence zzso and in the turns that join the two zzso of each zzso and by changing the overall orientation and separation of the extremely rigid zzso zzso zzso
