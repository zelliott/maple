zzso zzso models of semantic memory represent word meaning by zzso in a zzso zzso These zzso are derived from word zzso as found in a large corpus of written zzso Typically, these models are fully zzso an advantage over models that represent zzso that are based on human judgments zzso zzso zzso A common criticism of zzso models is that the representations are not zzso Concepts exist only relative to each other in the space produced by the zzso It has been claimed that zzso models offer an advantage in this zzso In this article, we take a step toward grounding a zzso zzso A zzso neural network is trained using back propagation to provide a mapping from zzso zzso to feature norms collected from zzso We show that this network is able to retrieve the features of a concept from its zzso zzso with high accuracy and is able to zzso this ability to produce an appropriate list of features from the zzso zzso of a novel zzso
