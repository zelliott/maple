zzso geometry methods have been used extensively to build models of molecules of various sizes, including small zzso zzso and zzso These methods are often overlooked as tools for zzso analysis, even though they often perform as well as other zzso sampling zzso We have implemented two new distance geometry approaches in the zzso zzso In the first new method, the traditional embedding zzso is replaced with a procedure that generates random zzso coordinates for each zzso followed by refinement of these coordinates into zzso using the distance geometry error zzso The zzso sampling produced by this method is comparable to that obtained with partial zzso and superior to that obtained with the original embedding zzso In the second method, a molecular dynamics step is included in the refinement zzso Although this method can be applied to any embedding algorithm, substantial improvements in sampling are seen primarily with the original embedding zzso
