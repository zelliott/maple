A data set of zzso intervals recorded for at least 15 zzso in 141 healthy individuals of different ages and under two different conditions zzso and zzso zzso has been zzso The data have been subjected to spectral analysis by fast zzso transform methods and considered in view of the possibility to work out a model in which the zzso and cardiac age could be zzso zzso the results was greatly facilitated by 1) working out a number of derived variables from the original ones to highlight the presence of small but zzso important zzso zzso 2) extraction of the principal components from the original as well as from the derived variables to exclude redundancies and correlation zzso and 3) automatic zzso of the subjects in age classes, which allowed removal of individual zzso within each zzso The main conclusion is that, within the examined individuals, cardiac and zzso ages do not match for ages higher than approximately 50 years; this could reflect the presence of subtle (and zzso biases in the data analysis or a real zzso The latter hypothesis should be confirmed by similar observations in different systemic zzso The use of a simple equation relating zzso and cardiac age, derived from a careful zzso analysis on our data set and of general use for screening purposes, is zzso
