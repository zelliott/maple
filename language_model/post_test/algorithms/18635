Imaging of zzso resonance energy transfer zzso between suitable zzso is increasingly being used to study cellular processes with high zzso zzso The genetically zzso zzso zzso and Yellow zzso zzso of Green Fluorescent zzso have become the most popular donor and zzso pair in cell zzso zzso between these zzso can be zzso by detecting zzso zzso This technique, for which zzso is excited and transfer is detected as zzso of zzso is sensitive, fast, and straightforward, provided that proper corrections are zzso In this study, the detection of zzso zzso between zzso and zzso by zzso zzso is zzso It is shown that this zzso pair is best excited at 430 zzso We identify major sources of error and zzso in zzso zzso acquisition including chromatic aberrations and instability of the zzso zzso We demonstrate that a novel correction zzso that employs online corrective zzso yields reliable estimates of zzso efficiency, and it is also shown how the effect of other error sources can be zzso
