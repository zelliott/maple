zzso practice in predicting zzso structures of zzso complexes is employment of various zzso methods when the structures of separate zzso are known a zzso The alternative approach, zzso the zzso prediction with pure sequence information as a starting point, is still considered as being inferior mostly due to presumption that the pool of available structures of zzso complexes, which can serve as putative templates, is not sufficiently zzso Recently, however, several labs have developed databases containing thousands of zzso structures of zzso complexes, which enable statistically reliable testing of zzso zzso In this paper we report the results on zzso modeling of zzso structures of protein complexes using alignments of modified sequence zzso The method, called zzso zzso zzso zzso has two distinctive features: zzso extra weight on aligning zzso zzso in the zzso programming algorithm, and zzso increased gap penalties for the zzso zzso The method was tested against our recently developed zzso database and against the Boston University zzso zzso In both cases, models generated were compared to the models built on basis of zzso protein structure initiative zzso sequence zzso It was found that existence of zzso (by the means of zzso templates zzso of zzso enables both methods to produce models of good quality, with the profiles method outperforming the zzso models (with respect to the percentage of correctly predicted zzso on the complex interface and fraction of native zzso zzso The models were evaluated according to the zzso assessment criteria and about two thirds of the models were found to fall into acceptable and zzso zzso The same comparison of a larger set of 463 protein complexes showed again that profiles generate better zzso We further zzso using our zzso database, the suitability of the profile alignment zzso in detecting remote zzso between query and template zzso where the zzso method zzso
