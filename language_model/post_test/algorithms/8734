zzso and differences between zzso acids define the rates at which they substitute for one another within protein sequences and the patterns by which these sequences form protein zzso However, there exist many ways to measure zzso whether one considers the molecular attributes of individual zzso zzso the roles that they play within zzso or some nuanced contribution of zzso One popular approach to representing these relationships is to divide the 20 zzso acids of the standard genetic code into groups, thereby forming a simplified zzso acid zzso Here, we develop a method to compare or combine different simplified zzso and apply it to 34 simplified zzso from the scientific zzso We use this method to show that while different suggestions vary and agree in zzso ways, they combine to reveal a consensus view of zzso acid similarity that is clearly rooted in zzso
