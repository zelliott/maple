Some optical properties of a highly scattering zzso such as zzso can be reconstructed zzso by diffuse optical zzso zzso Since the inverse problem of zzso is severely zzso and zzso zzso methods that update Green's function have been widely used to recover accurate optical zzso However, recent research has shown that the joint sparse recovery principle can provide an important clue in achieving reconstructions without an zzso update of Green's zzso One of the main limitations of the previous work is that it can only be applied to zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we extended this theory to estimate the zzso and scattering parameters simultaneously when the background optical properties are zzso The main idea for such an extension is that a joint sparse recovery step gives us unknown zzso on the estimated support set, which eliminates the zzso in an integral equation for the simultaneous zzso of the optical zzso Our zzso results show that the proposed zzso reduces the zzso artifacts between the parameters and provides improved reconstruction results compared to existing zzso
