In a previous study, the early stages of zzso in zzso materials were explored by zzso a kinetic zzso analysis with a zzso zzso theory zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Recent experimental results on the zzso stages of zzso assembly and protein zzso formation have suggested a new study, presented here, in which the zzso of a zzso on the existing surface of a structured zzso is similarly zzso A model is designed which allows the zzso of factors affecting zzso zzso principal among these is the structure of the template itself, which here is assumed to be either zzso or zzso into terraces and zzso Going beyond our earlier study (in which diffusion was restricted to zzso zzso the diffusion space here is enlarged to consider both zzso and zzso zzso zzso By expanding the external diffusion space zzso we are able to document the consequences (as regards zzso zzso of zzso flows in the near neighborhood of a developing zzso versus zzso zzso Particularly in regimes where the barriers to surface diffusion are high, and/or the probability of zzso zzso we find that zzso zzso processes (leading to a zzso zzso can compete zzso with zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso model studied here is simple, it can be zzso distorted into a zzso of possible zzso in zzso with the classical theory of corresponding states, we argue that the familial relationship among these structures suggests that the generic results obtained provide a zzso correct description of the zzso of zzso on structured zzso
