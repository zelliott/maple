It is generally accepted that zzso disease zzso by a series of bursts that are zzso by periods of stability or even gain of zzso In order to analyze zzso data on a patient's disease experience, it is necessary to use models which accommodate serial zzso zzso between the results of a series of zzso examinations over time can be modeled using a zzso zzso This model describes zzso changes in patients' levels of disease in terms of transition zzso which allow for both zzso and progression of the zzso The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the use of a zzso chain model to analyze data from a zzso study investigating the progression of zzso disease in an adult zzso 

The study population consisted of 504 zzso however, only 456 were included in the analysis because the remaining 48 subjects did not give consecutive zzso zzso were examined at zzso 6 months, and 1, 2, and 3 zzso zzso depths zzso were recorded using an automated zzso Disease was defined as four or more sites with zzso zzso or zzso 4 zzso zzso chain modeling was used to determine the effect of age, zzso and smoking on the natural progression and zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

Smoking and increasing age had no effect on the progression of disease in this population, but did have a significant effect zzso values zzso or zzso zzso in reducing the zzso of zzso zzso their effect on disease appears to be zzso of the natural healing zzso Gender had no significant zzso 

These results demonstrate how zzso modeling of zzso data can reveal effects that may not be immediately apparent from the data, with smoking and increasing age being seen to inhibit the healing process rather than promote disease zzso
