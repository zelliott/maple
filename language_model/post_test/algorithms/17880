The application of neural networks to solve a problem involves tasks with a high zzso cost until a suitable network is found, and these tasks mainly involve the selection of the network zzso and the training zzso We usually select the network structure by means of a zzso zzso and we then train the zzso In the case of zzso neural networks zzso the lack of suitable training zzso sometimes zzso these procedures due to vanishing zzso zzso This paper addresses the simultaneous training and zzso zzso of zzso using zzso hybrid zzso The proposal is based on the zzso and zzso zzso for making hybrid methods using the zzso zzso zzso We also study the effects of the selection of the zzso zzso and zzso in the diversity during zzso The proposals are tested in the experimental section to train and zzso the networks in the competition on artificial zzso zzso zzso
