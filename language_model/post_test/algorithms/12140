This paper deals with the problem of badly posed image zzso Although underestimated in practice, zzso is likely to affect many real-world image zzso tasks, where reference samples are difficult to collect zzso in remote sensing zzso image zzso and/or spatial zzso is zzso In an image zzso context affected by a lack of reference samples, an original zzso learning zzso image zzso termed zzso zzso expectation zzso zzso is zzso The rationale behind zzso is to combine useful complementary properties of two alternative data mapping procedures recently published outside of image processing literature, zzso the zzso modified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso expectation zzso zzso zzso To demonstrate its potential utility, zzso is compared against zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and the zzso contextual zzso zzso zzso besides against well-known standard zzso in two zzso image zzso problems featuring few reference samples and modestly useful texture zzso These experiments yield weak zzso but numerous quantitative map quality indexes that are consistent with both theoretical considerations and qualitative evaluations by expert zzso According to these quantitative results, zzso is competitive in terms of overall image mapping performance at the cost of a zzso overhead three to six times superior to that of its most interesting rival, zzso More in general, our experiments confirm that, even if they rely on heavy zzso normal distribution assumptions that may not be true in many real-world problems zzso in highly zzso zzso zzso zzso based on the zzso expectation zzso zzso mixture model solution can be very powerful in practice zzso 1) there is a lack of reference samples with respect to the zzso complexity and 2) texture information is considered negligible zzso a zzso constant image model zzso
