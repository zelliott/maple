zzso zzso joint contact forces is important for understanding the initiation and progression of knee zzso However, zzso contact force predictions are influenced by many factors including muscle forces and anatomical representations of the knee zzso This study aimed to investigate the influence of zzso geometry and knee joint zzso on the prediction of zzso contact forces using a zzso zzso zzso model of the zzso One participant fitted with an zzso total knee replacement walked at a self-selected speed while zzso and lateral zzso contact forces, ground reaction forces, zzso zzso and zzso muscle activity were simultaneously zzso The combination of generic and zzso knee joint geometry and zzso resulted in four different zzso models used to estimate zzso lengths and moment zzso The zzso geometric model was created from CT scans and the zzso knee joint zzso representing the translation of the zzso relative to the zzso was obtained from zzso The zzso model was zzso using one walking trial, but with three different cost functions that tracked the knee zzso moments with and without constraint over the estimated joint contact zzso The zzso models then predicted the zzso and lateral zzso contact forces for five other different walking zzso The use of zzso models with zzso of the peak zzso contact forces improved the accuracy of zzso contact forces by zzso and lateral contact forces by zzso respectively compared with the use of generic musculoskeletal zzso
