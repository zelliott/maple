The proportion of surgery performed as a day case varies greatly between zzso Low rates suggest a large growth potential in many zzso zzso the potential development of one day surgery should be grounded on a comprehensive list of eligible procedures, based on a zzso criteria, independent of local zzso We propose an zzso method, using only routinely available hospital data to identify surgical zzso that could have been performed as one day zzso 

Moving zzso surgery to one day surgery was considered feasible if at least one surgical intervention was eligible for one day surgery and if none of the following criteria were present: intervention or affection requiring an zzso stay, patient transferred or died, and length of stay greater than four zzso The eligibility of a procedure to be treated as a day case was mainly established on three a zzso criteria: surgical access zzso or not), the zzso of the procedure and the size of the operated zzso Few zzso of these criteria occurred when procedures were associated with risk of immediate zzso slow zzso recovery or pain treatment requiring hospital zzso The zzso was applied to a random sample of one million zzso US stays and more than 600 thousand Swiss zzso zzso in the year zzso 

The zzso of our method was demonstrated by the few discrepancies between the a zzso criteria based list of eligible procedures, and a state list used for reimbursement purposes, the low proportion of zzso eligible for one day care found in the US sample zzso versus zzso in the Swiss zzso and the distribution of the zzso procedures found eligible in Swiss hospitals, well supported by the zzso There were large variations of the proportion of candidates for one day surgery among zzso surgical zzso between Swiss hospitals (3 to zzso 

The proposed approach allows the monitoring of the proportion of zzso stay candidates for one day zzso It could be used for infrastructure planning, resources negotiation and the surveillance of appropriate resource zzso
