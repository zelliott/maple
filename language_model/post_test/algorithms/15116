This paper examines the effect of water content, water activity, and glass transition temperature zzso on the zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at 50 degrees zzso The rate of zzso zzso increases with increasing water content or water activity and, zzso decreasing zzso The rate of zzso is more sensitive to changes in these parameters in zzso than in zzso zzso is clearly evident in the glassy state in both zzso In the glassy state, the zzso is more stable in zzso than in zzso zzso but is less stable in the zzso zzso No single variable zzso content, water activity, or zzso could account for the variation in zzso rates in zzso and zzso zzso zzso rates were correlated with the degree of zzso by water zzso of zzso from the dry intrinsic glass transition zzso zzso zzso for the two zzso were obtained with this zzso zzso in zzso and zzso was closely correlated with the extent of zzso zzso experienced by the zzso relative to its glass transition at 50 degrees C, suggesting that the physical state of zzso could be used to predict chemical zzso
