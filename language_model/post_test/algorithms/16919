In zzso zzso zzso zzso a typical reconstruction zzso relies on a method to estimate and subtract the scatter from the net zzso zzso The remaining zzso zzso are then used to reconstruct an image of the original activity zzso The introduction of zzso zzso PET opens the possibility to change this zzso and use the spatial information carried by the scattered events for the zzso The combined knowledge of zzso difference and detected zzso energy provides spatial information on the position of the source even after single zzso and can be used for the reconstruction of scattered zzso using a zzso back zzso in addition to the conventional zzso back zzso In the scatter back zzso the scattering angle is derived from the energy of the scattered zzso through Compton zzso and this identifies a set of possible scattering zzso or zzso line of response zzso The zzso information zzso the position of the source along the set of broken zzso The advantages of this proposed method are twofold: including the spatial information about the origin of the scattered pairs could improve the image quality particularly in low count zzso and the threshold of the energy window can be lowered to include more zzso thus increasing zzso In this work, this novel approach to scatter in PET is introduced, different zzso are discussed, and the performance of a preliminary version of the zzso back zzso is zzso
