We outline the use of zzso modeling for zzso about the categorization of subjects into zzso and zzso classes when the true status of the subject is zzso zzso If uncertainty of zzso is ignored during analysis, then statistical zzso may be zzso An important advantage of zzso modeling is that it zzso the correct modeling of the hidden variable in terms of predictor variables and hypothesized biological zzso This allows researchers to formalize zzso that can address questions about why some subjects respond and others do zzso We illustrate our approach using a recent study of zzso zzso in female marathon runners zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
