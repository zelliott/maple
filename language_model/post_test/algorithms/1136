A new strategy for identifying proteins by zzso zzso mapping is zzso In contrast to current approaches, the strategy does not rely on a good relative or absolute mass accuracy as the criterion that discriminates false positive zzso The protein sequence database is first searched for all proteins that match a minimum five of the submitted masses within the maximum expected relative errors when the default or zzso determined zzso zzso are used, for instance, zzso zzso Typically, this search zzso many thousand candidate zzso Assuming initially that each of these is the correct zzso the relative errors of the matching zzso masses are calculated for each candidate zzso Linear zzso analysis is then performed of the calculated relative errors as a function of zzso for each candidate zzso and the standard zzso to the zzso is used to distinguish the correct sequence among the zzso We show that this zzso is independent of whether the mass zzso data were internally or zzso zzso The result is a search engine that renders internal spectrum zzso unnecessary and adapts to the quality of the raw data without user zzso This is made possible by a dynamic scoring algorithm, which takes into account the number of matching zzso masses, the percentage of the zzso sequence covered by these peptides and, as new zzso the determined standard zzso The lower the standard zzso the less zzso peptides are required for identification and vice zzso Performance of the new strategy is demonstrated and zzso All necessary computing has been implemented in a computer program, free access to which is provided in the zzso
