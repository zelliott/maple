To assess zzso the clinical accuracy of an magnetic resonance zzso robotic prostate biopsy system that has been used in the US National Cancer Institute for over 6 zzso 

Series of zzso zzso zzso MR image slices of the prostate both zzso zzso zzso and post zzso needle insertions were used to evaluate biopsy zzso A zzso registration zzso consisting of an initial zzso rigid registration followed by a zzso zzso alignment was developed to capture prostate motion during zzso The target displacement zzso between planned and actual biopsy zzso needle placement error zzso from planned biopsy target to needle zzso and biopsy error zzso from actual biopsy target to needle zzso were calculated as accuracy zzso 

A total of 90 zzso from 24 patients were zzso The registrations were validated by checking prostate zzso alignment using image zzso and the results were accurate to within 2 zzso The mean target zzso needle placement error, and clinical biopsy error were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The biopsy error reported suggests that quantitative imaging techniques for prostate registration and motion compensation may improve prostate biopsy targeting zzso
