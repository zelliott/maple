This study determined the influence of zzso bone zzso and material properties on zzso parameters using zzso simulations coupled with high-resolution zzso radiation zzso 

zzso time domain zzso simulations coupled to zzso zzso models of zzso bone reconstructed from zzso radiation zzso zzso were used zzso to compare and zzso the effects of bone volume zzso zzso and material properties on zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso of 30 zzso human zzso bone specimens were used to create zzso digital zzso zzso We studied the sensitivity of quantitative ultrasound zzso to bone volume fraction by examining zzso parameters at different stages of zzso thinning or zzso using an zzso dedicated zzso The sensitivity to bone material properties was also assessed by analyzing different scenarios in which density and zzso could be varied zzso The effect of zzso was zzso assessed by producing virtual bone specimens of identical bone volume zzso zzso of zzso wave propagation through the zzso bone volumes were performed using the zzso simulation software zzso developed by our zzso For each structure, both broadband zzso zzso zzso and speed of sound zzso were zzso 

zzso and zzso showed a strong correlation with zzso zzso zzso and varied zzso with zzso at an approximate rate of 2 zzso and 11 zzso per percent increase of zzso zzso Bone zzso caused by variation in zzso between zzso and zzso had a greater impact on zzso variables zzso of zzso 40 zzso variation of zzso 200 zzso than variations caused by zzso of material properties realized either by a zzso change of density or zzso change of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 43 zzso or than diversity in zzso zzso zzso zzso 36 zzso Moreover, the sensitivity of zzso and zzso to changes in zzso by a given amount realized by a pure change in bone mass (or zzso was found to be zzso over a pure change of zzso except for low zzso values, where both effects are zzso 

zzso bone zzso zzso zzso zzso and material properties were changed to zzso the impact of specific zzso on zzso zzso In this sample of zzso zzso zzso zzso in bone volume seemed to have a somewhat larger impact on zzso variables than the zzso of the other zzso zzso Whether this is also the case for zzso patients remains to be zzso
