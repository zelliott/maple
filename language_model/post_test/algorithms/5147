The simulation of biological systems is often plagued by a high level of noise in the data, as well as by models containing a large number of correlated zzso As a result, the parameters are poorly identified by the data, and the reliability of the model predictions may be zzso zzso sampling methods provide an avenue for proper statistical analysis in such zzso Nevertheless, simulations should employ models that, on the one hand, are reduced as much as possible, and, on the other hand, are still able to capture the essential features of the phenomena zzso Here, in the case of algae growth zzso we show how a systematic model reduction can be zzso The simplified model is analyzed from both theoretical and statistical points of zzso
