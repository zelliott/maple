The combination of zzso contribution dynamic selection and various mating schemes was investigated over seven generations for a typical tree breeding zzso The allocation of zzso was zzso using a simulated zzso zzso for various object functions including random mating zzso positive zzso mating zzso and zzso of zzso zzso between zzso zzso all combined with zzso of zzso in family size and zzso The present study considered two levels of zzso zzso and zzso two restrictions on zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso and two maximum permissible numbers of crosses in each generation zzso and zzso The zzso genetic model was used to simulate the genetic architecture of the trait that was the subject of zzso A framework of the long term genetic contribution of ancestors was used to examine the impacts of the mating schemes on population zzso 

zzso schemes produced on average, an increased rate of genetic gain in the breeding population, although the difference between schemes was small but significant after seven generations (up to zzso more than obtained with zzso In addition, zzso reduced the level of zzso by as much as 37% compared with zzso although the rate of zzso was similar after three generations of zzso zzso schemes yielded levels of genetic gain similar to those produced by zzso but the increase in the level of zzso was substantial (up to zzso 

The main reason why zzso schemes yielded higher genetic gains was the improvement in managing the long term genetic contribution of founders in the population; this was achieved by connecting unrelated zzso In addition, the zzso of zzso was reduced by zzso schemes since the zzso in long term genetic contributions of founders was smaller than in the other zzso zzso by combining an zzso scheme with an zzso that zzso contributions of the selected individuals, a higher long term response is obtained while reducing the risk within the breeding zzso
