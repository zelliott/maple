Low back pain is a significant problem in the zzso zzso Diagnosis of the underlying causes can be extremely zzso Since mechanical factors often play an important role, it can be helpful to study the motion of the zzso Digital zzso has been developed for this study and it can provide image sequences with many zzso but which often suffer due to noise, exacerbated by the very low radiation zzso Thus, determining vertebra position within the image sequence presents a considerable zzso There have been many studies on zzso image zzso but problems of zzso zzso and zzso motion zzso In this paper, we show how the zzso transform zzso can be used to solve these zzso Here, zzso zzso were used to describe the zzso body zzso This description was incorporated within our zzso zzso from which we can obtain zzso transform zzso zzso scale, rotation and center zzso The method has been applied to images of a zzso model and to images from two sequences of moving human zzso zzso The results show promise and potential for object extraction from poor quality images and that models of spinal movement can indeed be derived for clinical zzso
