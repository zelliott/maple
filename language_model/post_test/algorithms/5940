Pulmonary zzso pressure zzso is the zzso force that drives fluid out of the pulmonary zzso into the zzso zzso zzso zzso pressure is directly zzso to the zzso zzso zzso rate, and in the extreme leads to pulmonary zzso In the pulmonary zzso blood flow arises from the zzso pressure zzso defined as the difference between pulmonary artery zzso pressure and left zzso zzso The resistance across the pulmonary zzso consists of zzso and zzso zzso which interact with the zzso of the zzso pulmonary zzso In pathological states such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, zzso and high altitude or zzso lung zzso the zzso distribution of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso resistance zzso zzso the relationship between zzso and pulmonary artery zzso pressure zzso is greatly variable and zzso can no longer be predicted from zzso In clinical practice, zzso is commonly used to guide fluid therapy, and zzso as a zzso target is rarely zzso This approach is potentially zzso In the presence of a normal zzso and an increased pressure zzso between zzso and zzso the tendency for fluid leakage in the zzso and subsequent zzso development may substantially be zzso zzso validated methods have been developed to assess zzso in zzso At the zzso measurement of zzso can easily be determined by analyzing a pressure transient after an acute pulmonary artery zzso with the balloon of a zzso zzso
