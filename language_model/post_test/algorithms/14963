The stability of the interface between neural tissue and chronically implanted zzso is very important for obtaining reliable control signals for zzso zzso zzso is also crucial for chronic zzso of the cerebral zzso However, changes of the zzso interface can be caused by a variety of zzso In the present study, zzso zzso zzso were implanted into the zzso zzso of cats and neural activities were recorded on a regular basis for several zzso An zzso based on cluster analysis and zzso zzso analysis was developed to sort the zzso action zzso into single zzso We tracked these units based on their zzso and their response to zzso stimulation or stereotypical movements by the zzso Our results indicate that, after zzso the zzso interface may change from day-to-day over the first 1-2 weeks, zzso for 1-2 months, and become quite stable zzso A stability index is proposed to zzso the stability of the zzso zzso The reasons for the pattern of changes are zzso
