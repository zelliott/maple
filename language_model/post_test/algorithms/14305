Image zzso can be defined as the registration of two or more images that are then combined into a single zzso Once the images have been registered to a common coordinate system, the problem amounts to the definition of a selection rule to output a unique value for all those zzso that are present in more than one zzso This process is known as image zzso In this paper, we propose a zzso procedure based on mathematical zzso and its zzso zzso zzso Its scope is to position zzso along salient image structures so as to diminish their visibility in the output mosaic even in the absence of zzso corrections or blending zzso We also show that it is suited to the seamless zzso of zzso transient objects occurring in the regions where two or more images zzso The proposed methodology and zzso are illustrated for the composition of satellite images minimizing cloud zzso
