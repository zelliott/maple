The present research is based on the hypothesis that leaky zzso zzso zzso are able to provide sustained input for drugs that have an zzso window, such as zzso zzso without jeopardizing their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are defined as zzso zzso that allow some of the drug to be released from the zzso in gastric zzso Different approaches to making leaky zzso zzso were investigated using zzso followed by spray zzso zzso enteric coats were formulated using a commonly used enteric zzso zzso L 30 zzso combined with soluble compounds including zzso zzso 8000 and zzso zzso 60 zzso or zzso 80 zzso The rate of drug release from the zzso in simulated gastric fluid can be tailored by varying the zzso amount or zzso All leaky zzso zzso studied completely released the drugs within 30 zzso after changing dissolution medium to zzso zzso pH zzso zzso of plasma zzso profiles of the model drug zzso zzso from leaky zzso zzso in zzso conditions and from zzso zzso were performed using computer zzso zzso results are consistent with a hypothesis that leaky zzso zzso zzso provide sustained input for drugs shown to have an zzso window without decreasing zzso The sustained input results from the combined effects of the zzso and zzso transit effects on zzso The present research demonstrates a new application of knowledge about gastrointestinal transit effects on drug zzso It also shows that zzso zzso have new applications in areas other than the usual zzso zzso The hypothesis that a leaky zzso zzso zzso may maintain or increase the zzso of drugs that have a window of zzso is still to be confirmed by further in zzso zzso
