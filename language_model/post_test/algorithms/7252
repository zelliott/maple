A theoretical calculation of the zzso zzso zzso spectrum from zzso is carried out for zzso and zzso using a transition zzso moment surface expanded up to second zzso The zzso form of these operators is obtained using symmetry zzso The zzso zzso levels are calculated using Van zzso zzso theory, and the latter is used to adjust harmonic zzso of the potential to match experimental zzso The zzso fit force field is tested on zzso For both molecules the transition energies are well zzso but there are systematic differences between experimental and theoretical zzso The origins of these differences are zzso
