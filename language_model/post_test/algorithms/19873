zzso is one of the most common neurological disorders - approximately one in every 100 people worldwide are suffering from zzso The electroencephalogram zzso is the most common source of information used to zzso diagnose and manage neurological disorders related to zzso Large amounts of data are produced by zzso monitoring devices, and analysis by visual inspection of long recordings of zzso in order to find traces of zzso is not routinely zzso zzso automated detection of zzso has been a goal of many researchers for a long zzso This paper presents a novel method for automatic zzso seizure zzso An zzso sample zzso zzso zzso is proposed and combined with extreme learning machine zzso to identify the zzso signals regarding the existence of seizure or zzso To the knowledge of the authors, there exists no similar work in the zzso A public zzso was zzso for evaluating the proposed zzso zzso show that the proposed zzso detection approach achieves not only high detection accuracy but also a very fast zzso speed, which demonstrates its huge potential for the real-time detection of zzso zzso
