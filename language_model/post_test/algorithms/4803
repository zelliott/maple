We prove that the zzso zzso field theory for the freezing transition of the secondary structure of random zzso is zzso to all orders in zzso zzso The proof relies on a zzso of the model in terms of random walks and on the use of the zzso operator product zzso zzso allows us to work in the simpler scheme of open zzso and to obtain the critical zzso at zzso zzso It also allows us to prove some exact zzso zzso zzso by zzso
