We present a novel zzso power spectral density zzso zzso zzso for zzso signals based on a Kalman filter with variable number of zzso zzso The zzso signals under consideration are modeled as zzso zzso zzso zzso The proposed zzso uses a block of zzso to estimate the zzso zzso zzso and zzso high-resolution zzso zzso The intersection of confidence intervals zzso rule is incorporated into the zzso to generate a zzso with zzso window size from a series of zzso with different number of zzso We report the results of a quantitative assessment study and show an illustrative example involving the application of the zzso to zzso pressure signals zzso from patients with traumatic brain injury zzso
