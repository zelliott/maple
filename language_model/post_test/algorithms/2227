The discharge pattern of two zzso zzso was recorded from a conscious monkey performing voluntary movements about the wrist zzso The zzso discharge was displayed as a zzso zzso on movement of the zzso The discharge patterns of both zzso was very strongly correlated with zzso Three experienced researchers were asked to examine the data and to zzso every part of each trial as background zzso zzso zzso firing zzso or zzso zzso or zero firing zzso and to mark the times that zzso discharge changed zzso A zzso zzso was made from these zzso A zzso artificial zzso Network (the Network) was used to model the standard output and cumulative sums zzso and maximum likelihood was then performed on the data and compared with the zzso There was a high correlation between the output of each observer zzso zzso zzso and the standard output and between the Network and the standard output zzso zzso zzso However the correlation between standard output and zzso zzso zzso zzso and standard output and maximum likelihood zzso zzso zzso was much zzso The Network could be trained with as few as 12 trials, indicating a high degree of constancy in the methods employed by the zzso The Network was also highly efficient at detecting changes in state of zzso activity zzso zzso zzso In zzso when used on single trial data, visual inspection is a reliable method for detecting timing of change zzso discharge and is superior to zzso and maximum zzso As well it is capable of detecting zzso discharge state: that is whether firing rate is increased, normal or zzso zzso Networks promise to be a useful method of confirming the consistency of visual inspection as a means of detecting changes in zzso discharge zzso
