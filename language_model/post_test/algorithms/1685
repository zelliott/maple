This paper applies the mathematics of chaos to the task of designing indoor zzso zzso zzso variation has been used to great advantage on music and dance, but the challenges here are quite different, beginning with the zzso We present a zzso system for zzso rock climbing problems and then describe a variation generator that is designed to support human zzso in designing new and interesting climbing zzso This variation zzso termed strange zzso uses chaos to introduce zzso We validated this approach with a large blinded study in a commercial climbing gym, in cooperation with experienced zzso and expert route zzso The results show that strange beta can help a human zzso produce routes that are at least as good as, and in some cases better than, those produced in the traditional zzso
