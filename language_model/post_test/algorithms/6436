Work in zzso controlled zzso systems has concentrated on decoding natural behaviors from neural activity, with the idea that if the behavior could be fully zzso it could be duplicated using an artificial zzso zzso estimates from this approach suggested that a zzso signal comprised of many hundreds of zzso would be required to control a zzso system zzso However, recent studies are showing hints that these systems can be controlled effectively using only a few tens of zzso zzso to decode the pre-existing relationship between neural activity and natural behavior is not nearly as important as choosing a decoding scheme that can be more readily deployed and trained to generate the desired actions of the artificial zzso These artificial systems need not resemble or behave similarly to any natural biological zzso zzso matching of discrete and continuous neural command signals to appropriately configured device functions will enable effective control of both natural and abstract artificial systems using compatible thought zzso
