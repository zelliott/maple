Heart rate zzso is a recognized zzso for assessing autonomous nervous system zzso zzso zzso the most commonly used method to analyze zzso does not offer an easy assessment of its dynamics because of limitations inherent in its stationary zzso zzso zzso transform allows analysis of zzso zzso We compared the respective yields of zzso and zzso zzso in analyzing heart rate zzso during dynamic changes in autonomous nervous system balance induced by zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso were applied to sequences of heart rate intervals in six subjects receiving increasing doses of zzso and zzso At the lowest doses of zzso zzso heart rate zzso increased, followed by a progressive decrease with higher zzso With the first dose of zzso there was a significant increase in heart rate zzso which progressively disappeared after the last zzso zzso transform gave significantly better quantitative analysis of heart rate zzso than did zzso transform during autonomous nervous system adaptations induced by both agents and provided novel temporally localized zzso
