In radiation therapy with highly energetic heavy zzso the zzso zzso of a zzso can be achieved by using their advantageous features such as the good dose zzso and the high relative biological effectiveness around their mean zzso For effective zzso of such properties, it is necessary to evaluate the range of incident zzso and the deposited dose distribution in a patient's zzso Several methods have been proposed to derive such physical zzso one of them uses zzso zzso generated through zzso fragmentation reactions of incident zzso with target zzso We have proposed the application of the maximum likelihood zzso zzso method to a detected zzso zzso distribution for determination of the range of incident zzso in a target and we have demonstrated the effectiveness of the method with computer zzso In this paper, a water, a zzso and a zzso zzso target were each zzso with stable zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Except for a few combinations of incident beams and targets, the zzso method could determine the range of incident zzso zzso with a difference between zzso and the experimental range of less than zzso zzso under the circumstance that the measurement of zzso gamma rays was started just after the zzso of zzso s and lasted for 500 zzso In the process of evaluating the range of incident zzso with the zzso method, we must calculate many physical quantities such as the zzso and the energy of both primary zzso and fragments as a function of depth in a zzso zzso by using them we can obtain the dose zzso Thus, when the mean range of incident zzso is determined with the zzso method, the zzso zzso distribution and the deposited dose distribution can be derived zzso The derived dose zzso in water for the zzso zzso beams of four species were compared with those measured with an zzso zzso The good agreement between the derived and the measured zzso implies that the deposited dose distribution in a target can be estimated from the detected zzso zzso distribution with a zzso zzso
