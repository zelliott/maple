zzso is an ultrasound image of the heart that demonstrates the size, motion and composition of cardiac structures and is also used to diagnose various abnormalities of the heart including abnormal chamber size, shape and zzso heart zzso zzso provides important zzso and functional details of the zzso Most of the presented automatic cardiac disease recognition systems that use zzso based on defective anatomical region zzso In this paper we present a simple technique for cardiac geometry detection via zzso images which zzso these borders and exploits cues from cardiac zzso To demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique, we present results for cardiac geometry detection through difference intensity of zzso zzso We have developed a simple program code for the prediction of cardiac geometry using difference intensity of zzso zzso With this code, users can generate zzso or point for detection of cardiac geometry as zzso and atrium in size, shape and zzso
