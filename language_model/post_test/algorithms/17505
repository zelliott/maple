zzso et zzso zzso change model of a zzso cross section probe zzso above a structure with an arbitrary number of parallel layers was used to study the principle of measuring thicknesses of zzso structures in terms of zzso current testing zzso zzso An experimental system for zzso thickness measurement was developed and several fitting models to formulate the relationships between detected zzso zzso and thickness are put forward using least square zzso The determination of zzso thicknesses was investigated after zzso the zzso zzso of the detecting zzso The best fitting and inversion models are zzso
