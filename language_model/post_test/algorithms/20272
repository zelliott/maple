The potential contribution of zzso and zzso cues for the detection of a tone added to narrow bands of noise was assessed in two zzso In the first experiment, three zzso zzso 40, zzso and 360 zzso and three center zzso zzso 1800, and zzso zzso were zzso For the zzso detection task, the signal to be detected was a tone with a frequency equal to the center frequency of the noise zzso The level of the added tone was adjusted so as to generate d' scores of approximately 2 in a zzso zzso zzso Then, the zzso of zzso changes in level were zzso The distribution of differences in level was applied to either the zzso or the zzso zzso allowing the measurement of sensitivity to changes in level for a zzso zzso intensity discrimination zzso For one of the four observers, there was a good correspondence between the d' values obtained in the zzso task and the d' values obtained in the intensity discrimination zzso For the other three observers, the zzso of changes in intensity could not account for the detection of a tone added to zzso In order to estimate sensitivity to zzso cues, the zzso and zzso zzso were scaled so as to present no reliable differences in level, and observers again detected which stimulus contained the added zzso zzso led to d' scores smaller than those obtained in the initial zzso discrimination task, but performance levels did not fall to zzso For three of the four observers, the detection of a tone added to noise appeared to depend on both level and zzso zzso In a second experiment, zzso functions were obtained for the detection of a tone added to noise, for the detection of changes in level associated with the zzso and the zzso zzso and for the detection of a tone added to noise using zzso and zzso zzso with no reliable differences in zzso The zzso were centered at zzso zzso and zzso of 40 and 100 zzso were zzso Individual differences in detection strategy were zzso Two observers appeared to rely on changes in level, one observer appeared to rely on zzso cues, and the remaining four observers appeared to adopt a decision strategy that integrated level and zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
