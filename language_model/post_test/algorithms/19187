An artificial neural network model was designed to test the threat detection hypothesis developed in our experimental studies, where threat detector activity in the zzso association areas is monitored by the zzso prefrontal cortex, which signals the lateral prefrontal zzso to redirect attention to the zzso As in our experimental studies, simulated zzso zzso of all three brain areas were larger when the zzso target stimulus was unattended than attended, and the increase in behavioral reaction times when the target stimulus was unattended was smaller for threatening than zzso zzso The model also generated a number of novel predictions, for example, the effect of threat on reaction time only occurs when the target stimulus is zzso and the zzso indexes prefrontal zzso activity involved in zzso attention toward response processes on that trial and sensory processes on subsequent zzso
