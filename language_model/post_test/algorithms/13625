zzso false discovery rate zzso procedures, which offer greater power than the original zzso procedure of zzso and zzso are often applied to statistical maps of the zzso When a large proportion of the zzso hypotheses are false, as in the case of widespread effects such as cortical thinning throughout much of the brain, zzso zzso methods can surprisingly reject more zzso hypotheses than not accounting for multiple testing at zzso using zzso zzso A straightforward mathematical argument is presented to explain why this can occur with the zzso method of zzso and colleagues, and a simulation study shows that it can also occur, to a lesser extent, with a zzso zzso procedure due to zzso and zzso We demonstrate the phenomenon with reference to a published data set documenting cortical thinning in attention zzso zzso The paper concludes with recommendations for how to proceed when zzso zzso results of this kind are encountered in zzso
