In this paper, a neural network based generalized software system is presented for automatic analysis of zzso zzso The proposed system is capable of intuitively diagnosing the disease from the zzso using the knowledge acquired from the zzso A modified decision based neural network which zzso in a finite amount of time is zzso The training procedure used automatically varies the size of the zzso The system is capable of being trained even without an zzso zzso The physician can correct the network as and when a zzso occurs, thus making the system less zzso as time zzso The proposed system has been tested using an zzso data base representing different zzso conditions such as bundle branch blocks and zzso The system is capable of detecting different types of zzso zzso
