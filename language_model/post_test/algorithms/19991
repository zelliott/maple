We present a new model of opinion changes dependent on the agents emotional state and their information about the issue in zzso Our goal is to construct a simple, yet zzso and flexible representation of individual attitude dynamics for agent based simulations, that could be used in a variety of social zzso The model is a discrete version of the cusp catastrophe model of opinion dynamics in which information is treated as the normal factor while emotional zzso zzso level determining agent zzso and zzso is treated as the splitting zzso Both variables determine the resulting agent opinion, which itself can be in favor of the studied position, against it, or zzso Thanks to the flexibility of implementing communication between the agents, the model is potentially zzso in a wide range of zzso As an example of the model application, we study the dynamics of a set of agents zzso among themselves via zzso In the example, we chose the zzso fully connected communication zzso to focus on the effects of the individual opinion zzso and to look for stable final zzso of agents with different emotions, information and zzso Even for such simplified system, the model shows complex behavior, including phase transitions due to symmetry breaking by external zzso
