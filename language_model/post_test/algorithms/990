Recent studies in zzso zzso zzso mobility zzso zzso have zzso on employing different drift gases to alter separation efficiency for some zzso This study investigates four structurally similar classes of molecules zzso and zzso zzso zzso and small zzso to determine the effect of structure on relative mobility changes in four drift gases zzso zzso zzso carbon zzso zzso cross sections were plotted against drift gas zzso and a linear relationship was found for the zzso compounds evaluated in the zzso Based on the reduced mobility database, all zzso compounds could be separated in one of the four drift zzso however, the drift gas that provided optimal separation was specific for the two zzso
