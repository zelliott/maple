In this work, the zzso activity of zzso zzso derivatives against human severe acute respiratory syndrome zzso is predicted in terms of quantitative zzso relationship zzso zzso These models were developed with the aid of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso system zzso combined with zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso is zzso to select the most important variables in zzso modeling and then these variables were used as zzso of zzso to predict SARS zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso A data set of 119 zzso compounds was coded with over hundred calculated meaningful molecular zzso The best zzso describing the zzso mechanism were zzso connectivity index, length to breadth ratio, relative negative charge, harmonic zzso of aromatic index, average molecular weight and total path zzso These parameters are among zzso zzso geometric, constitutional and zzso zzso The statistical parameters of zzso and root mean square error zzso are zzso and zzso zzso The accuracy and zzso of zzso zzso model in predicting zzso behavior of zzso zzso derivatives zzso was illustrated using zzso and zzso zzso techniques and also by zzso zzso of the results of the proposed model with those of zzso shows that the zzso zzso model is superior and can be considered as a tool for predicting the zzso behavior of SARS zzso zzso
