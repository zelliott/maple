A wide variety of stem cells has been reported to exist and renew several adult zzso raising the question of the existence of a zzso zzso is, a common molecular program of zzso To detect such a signature, we applied a data integration zzso on several DNA zzso zzso generated by the Stem Cell Genome Anatomy Project zzso zzso on several mouse and human zzso to generate a zzso compendium that we submitted to a single layer artificial neural network zzso trained to attribute differentiation zzso zzso stem cells to differentiated ones (five labels in total were zzso The inherent architecture of the system allowed zzso the biology behind stem cells differentiation stages and the ANN isolated a 63 gene zzso zzso This chapter presents technological details on DNA zzso integration, ANN training through zzso zzso and independent testing on zzso adult zzso by automated detection of differentiation capabilities on human prostate and mouse stomach zzso All scripts of the Stem Cell Analysis and characterization by zzso Networks zzso project are available on the zzso Web zzso zzso
