Driving laser jitter is one of the main factors affecting the zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso phase zzso jitter and the pulse energy jitter on the zzso pulse characterization is studied in this zzso We have theoretically calculated and zzso confirmed that zzso jitter could result in a symmetry trace in the zzso zzso while the intensity jitter could result in a slight shift and broadening of the zzso Both of them can lead to an underestimate of the retrieved zzso pulse zzso
