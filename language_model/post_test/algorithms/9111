We evaluated the influence of zzso zzso reconstruction zzso on the coronary artery calcium zzso score by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients underwent zzso imaging by zzso zzso zzso zzso volume, mass and zzso score were calculated from images reconstructed by filtered back projection zzso without and with incremental degrees of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We used the repeated measuring test and the zzso test for multiple comparisons of values and the difference ratio among different zzso groups using the zzso as zzso 

The median zzso score zzso decreased with incremental zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for 0 % zzso 10 zzso 20 zzso 30 zzso 40 % and 50 % zzso respectively zzso In comparison with zzso zzso volume (from zzso % to zzso zzso zzso mass (from zzso % to zzso zzso and zzso zzso score (from zzso % to zzso zzso all decreased with increasing zzso from 10 % to 50 zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso resulted in the disappearance of zzso calcium in three cases with low calcium zzso 

zzso noise reduction techniques significantly affected the zzso which potentially alters perceived cardiovascular zzso
