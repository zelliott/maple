Because the zzso function is usually related to its zzso zzso the ability to predict zzso zzso directly from protein sequences will be useful for zzso protein zzso Recent years have seen a surging interest in the development of novel zzso tools to predict zzso zzso At present, these approaches, based on a wide range of zzso have achieved varying degrees of success for specific organisms and for certain zzso zzso A number of authors have noticed that sequence similarity is useful in predicting zzso zzso For example, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso have carried out extensive analysis of the relation between sequence similarity and identity in zzso zzso and have found a close relationship between them above a certain similarity zzso However, many existing benchmark data sets used for the prediction accuracy assessment contain highly zzso zzso data sets zzso sequences up to zzso sequence zzso Using these benchmark test data will surely lead to zzso of the performance of the methods zzso Here, we develop an approach based on a zzso support zzso machine zzso system: the first level comprises a number of zzso zzso each based on a specific type of feature zzso derived from zzso the second level zzso zzso functions as the jury machine to generate the probability distribution of decisions for possible zzso We compare our approach with a global sequence alignment approach and other existing approaches for two benchmark data zzso zzso zzso sequences and the other zzso zzso Furthermore, we carried out zzso sequence alignment for several data sets to investigate the relationship between sequence zzso and zzso zzso Our results, which are consistent with previous studies, indicate that the zzso search approach performs well down to zzso sequence identity, although its performance zzso considerably for sequences sharing lower sequence zzso A data set of high zzso levels will undoubtedly lead to biased assessment of the performances of the zzso zzso those relying on zzso search or sequence zzso Our zzso zzso system based on zzso does not rely on zzso zzso therefore, its performance remains relatively unaffected by sequence zzso When compared with other approaches, our approach performed significantly zzso Furthermore, we also develop a practical hybrid method, which combines the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso search method, as a general tool for the sequence zzso of zzso zzso
