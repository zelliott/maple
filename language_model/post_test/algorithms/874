zzso phase zzso zzso is a recently developed zzso approach that provides quantitative phase zzso of zzso images obtained under zzso conditions without zzso or zzso zzso To perform zzso an zzso zzso image is acquired, together with one positive and one negative zzso zzso An zzso is then applied to produce a zzso phase zzso In this investigation we demonstrate that manipulation of the phase map intensity zzso using novel, zzso zzso and zzso methods provides enhanced zzso of cells in zzso zzso was zzso to measure the growth zzso of cultured airway smooth muscle cells over a zzso zzso There was a high degree of correlation between parallel zzso zzso zzso and zzso counts of airway smooth muscle cells over this time zzso Using zzso translucent cells can be zzso with improved cell boundary definition allowing precise and zzso zzso of cell culture zzso zzso phase imaging provides a zzso zzso simple and zzso approach for measurement of cellular zzso Further development of the zzso analysis methodology has the potential to provide even more refined measures of cellular zzso
