zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso often fire in an zzso single spike mode in zzso and a similar firing pattern can be observed in zzso when small zzso zzso zzso channel zzso are applied to the zzso It is not clear whether the irregular firing is due to zzso processes or zzso deterministic zzso A previous study zzso 104 (2001) zzso used zzso forecasting methods applied to a continuous function derived from the zzso zzso zzso data from zzso firing zzso zzso to show that the predictability scaled zzso with forecast horizon and was consistent with zzso deterministic zzso However, we show here that the observed exponential zzso is also consistent with a zzso process, because it did not differ significantly from that of shuffled surrogate zzso On the other hand, zzso forecasting directly from the zzso data using the package zzso provided some evidence for zzso deterministic structure in four of five records obtained in zzso and in two of nine records obtained in zzso Although we cannot rule out a role for zzso chaotic dynamics in structuring the firing pattern, we suggest an alternate hypothesis that includes a mechanism by which the firing pattern can become more variable in the presence of a constant level of background zzso
