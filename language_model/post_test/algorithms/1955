The problem of metal artifact reduction zzso is almost as old as the clinical use of zzso zzso zzso When metal implants are present in the field of zzso severe artifacts degrade the image quality and the diagnostic value of CT zzso Up to now, no generally accepted solution to this issue has been zzso In this work, a method based on a new zzso concept is zzso frequency split metal artifact reduction zzso It ensures efficient reduction of metal artifacts at high image quality with enhanced preservation of details close to metal zzso 

zzso combines a raw data zzso zzso method with an zzso frequency split zzso Many typical methods for metal artifact reduction are zzso zzso methods and simply replace unreliable parts of the projection data, for example, by linear zzso zzso split approaches were used in CT, for example, by combining two reconstruction methods in order to reduce zzso zzso zzso combines the high zzso of an zzso image, where all available data were used for the reconstruction with the more reliable low zzso of an image which was corrected with an zzso zzso zzso The zzso is tested in combination with zzso metal artifact reduction zzso and with a standard zzso zzso zzso zzso is a more sophisticated zzso zzso method, which introduces less new artifacts which may result from zzso zzso A quantitative evaluation was performed using the examples of a simulation of the zzso phantom and a scan of a spine zzso Further evaluation includes patients with different types of metal zzso hip zzso dental fillings, zzso and spine zzso which were scanned with a modern clinical dual source CT zzso 

zzso ensures sharp edges and a preservation of anatomical details which is in many cases better than after applying an zzso zzso method zzso In contrast to other zzso methods, zzso yields images without the usual blurring close to zzso 

zzso should be used together with zzso a combination which ensures an accurate correction of both high and low zzso The zzso is zzso inexpensive compared to zzso methods and methods with complex zzso zzso No parameters were chosen zzso it is ready for an application in clinical zzso
