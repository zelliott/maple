Since visual zzso computer vision applications have gained popularity, ever more complex, biologically inspired models seem to be needed to predict salient locations (or interest points) in zzso zzso In this paper, we explore how far one can go in predicting eye movements by using only basic signal processing, such as image representations derived from efficient coding principles, and machine zzso To this end, we gradually increase the complexity of a model from simple zzso zzso maps zzso on zzso videos to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using a large collection of eye movements on high-resolution videos, supervised learning techniques fine-tune the free parameters whose addition is inevitable with increasing zzso The proposed model, although very simple, demonstrates significant improvement in predicting salient locations in zzso videos over four selected baseline models and two distinct data labeling zzso
