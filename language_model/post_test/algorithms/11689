This paper considers the problem of measuring the strain field in zzso loaded elastic zzso such as soft biological zzso zzso of intrinsic or applied zzso patterns were used to calculate the zzso zzso of small regions on the surface of a zzso zzso This method was able to resolve zzso zzso to within a zzso of a zzso A zzso model with zzso zzso was used to represent the geometry of the membrane in the zzso zzso This model was fitted to the measured zzso to obtain the geometry of the membrane in the zzso state, and the strain field was calculated from the change in zzso The strain fields were measured in both an zzso zzso rubber membrane and a section of sheep zzso
