Recent work has shown the effectiveness of zzso methods in solving difficult zzso zzso The zzso protein structure modeling suite can aid in the solution of difficult zzso problems using templates from 15 to zzso sequence zzso zzso refinement guided by noisy density has consistently led to solved structures where other methods zzso In this paper, an overview of the use of zzso for these difficult zzso problems is provided and new modeling developments that further improve model quality are zzso Several variations to the method are introduced that significantly reduce the time needed to generate a model and the sampling required to improve the starting zzso The improvements are zzso on a set of nine difficult cases and it is shown that this improved method zzso consistently better models in less running zzso Finally, strategies for best using zzso to solve difficult zzso problems are presented and future directions for the role of zzso methods in zzso are zzso
