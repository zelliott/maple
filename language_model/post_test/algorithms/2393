In a recent study, zzso focusing patterns were classified with a neural network using the zzso zzso zzso In order to further study the zzso process and to zzso the presentation of zzso patterns, zzso zzso feature maps zzso were applied in this zzso Although these feature maps are very efficient in many pattern recognition tasks, our data proved to be too complex for zzso with an zzso zzso zzso a second supervised network on top of the feature map was zzso As in zzso a zzso network trained by the zzso zzso was zzso The final system allows us to correctly zzso zzso of all wheat zzso Moreover, the system proved to be reliable, reasonable in training time and shows the same accuracy in different experimental zzso
