Compared evaluation of different methods is presented for zzso missing values in zzso zzso weighted zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso methods such as local least squares zzso zzso and partial least squares zzso zzso and zzso principal component analysis zzso The influence in prediction accuracy of some factors, such as zzso zzso type of data relationships used in the zzso process zzso zzso zzso or zzso missing rate and pattern and type of experiment zzso series zzso zzso series zzso or mixed zzso zzso is zzso zzso based on the zzso use of data zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso the need to perform initial zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the type of relationships employed zzso zzso zzso and alternating zzso are zzso Overall, it is shown that data set properties zzso of experiment, missing rate and zzso affect the data similarity structure, therefore influencing the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are preferable in the presence of data with a stronger similarity structure zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso methods zzso zzso and zzso are preferable when zzso zzso missing zzso
