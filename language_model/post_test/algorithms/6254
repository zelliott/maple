In this paper, an zzso based on independent component analysis zzso for zzso the fetal heart rate zzso from maternal abdominal zzso is zzso Three abdominal zzso channels are used to extract the zzso in three steps: first zzso procedures such as DC cancellation and zzso filtering are applied to remove zzso Then the zzso for multiple unknown source extraction zzso zzso is fed to extract the sources from the observation signals include fetal zzso zzso Finally, zzso is extracted from zzso The method is shown to be capable of completely revealing zzso zzso from observation leads even with a zzso using zzso zzso
