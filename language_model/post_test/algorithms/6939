Because of the increase in the size of zzso sequence databases, the importance of indexing the sequences for fast queries zzso zzso trees and zzso zzso are used for simple zzso However these are not suitable for complicated queries from huge amount of sequences because the zzso are stored in disk which has slow access zzso We propose storing the zzso in memory in a compressed zzso We use the compressed zzso zzso It zzso stores the zzso array at the cost of theoretically a small slowdown in access zzso We zzso show that the overhead of using the compressed zzso array is reasonable in zzso We also propose an approximate string matching zzso which is suitable for the compressed zzso zzso Furthermore, we have constructed the compressed zzso array of the whole human zzso Because its size is about zzso zzso a zzso can handle the search index for the whole data in main memory, which will accelerate the speed of solving various problems in zzso zzso
