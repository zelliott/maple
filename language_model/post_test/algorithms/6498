zzso zzso zzso offers a powerful means of zzso parameters in complex zzso zzso We illustrate the application of these ideas in the setting of a natural history model for breast zzso Our model assumes that the tumor growth process follows a geometric zzso zzso parameters are estimated from the zzso zzso Our discussion focuses on the use of simulation for computing the maximum likelihood zzso for this class of zzso The analysis shows that simulation provides a straightforward means of computing such zzso for models of substantial zzso
