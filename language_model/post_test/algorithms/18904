The process of second harmonic generation zzso has a unique property of forming a sharp optical contrast between zzso zzso materials and other types of material, which is a highly valuable asset for contrast zzso The coherent signal obtained through zzso also allows for the recording of zzso at high spatial and zzso resolution, enabling zzso zzso zzso for highly dynamic zzso and zzso Here we describe a new holographic principle, harmonic zzso zzso which records zzso between independently generated second harmonic signals and zzso We zzso demonstrate this technique with digital holographic recording of second harmonic signals zzso from an ensemble of second harmonic generating zzso clusters under zzso laser zzso Our results show that harmonic zzso is uniquely suited for zzso zzso contrast zzso
