In this paper, a zzso boundary element zzso for prediction of zzso of zzso from zzso test is zzso BE contact zzso is zzso The initial strain zzso and von zzso yield criteria are employed to cover plastic zzso The zzso is assumed to be zzso zzso and zzso plastic zzso The load versus displacement is obtained during zzso sequence for different yield strength and elastic zzso zzso and equivalent residual stresses are plotted for different elastic zzso depending on yield zzso BE method is shown to be an alternative accurate zzso tool for simulated zzso zzso
