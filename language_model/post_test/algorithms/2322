zzso burst zzso zzso in the monkey superior zzso zzso have been hypothesized to provide the zzso zzso burst generator with the dynamic error signal and the movement initiating trigger zzso To test this claim, we performed two sets of zzso simulations on a burst generator model with the local feedback disconnected using zzso obtained zzso activity as both the driving and trigger signal zzso to the zzso First, using neural data obtained from cells located near the middle of the zzso to zzso extent of the zzso the internal parameters of the model were zzso by means of a zzso zzso zzso to produce an zzso zzso The zzso values obtained from the zzso were then fixed and additional simulations were done using the experimental data from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and from more zzso zzso zzso zzso the model generated realistic zzso matching both position and zzso profiles of real zzso to the centers of the movement fields of all these zzso Second, the model was driven by zzso activity affiliated with interrupted zzso the resumed eye movements observed following electrical stimulation of the zzso zzso Once again, the model produced eye movements that closely resembled the interrupted zzso produced by such simulations, but minor readjustment of parameters reflecting the weight of the projection of the trigger signal was zzso Our study demonstrates that a model of the burst generator produces reasonably realistic zzso when driven with actual samples of zzso zzso
