In this paper, we present an efficient method to estimate changes in zzso body surface potential maps zzso caused by variations in tissue zzso For blood, skeletal muscle, zzso and fat, the influence of zzso variations was analyzed using the principal component analysis zzso For each single zzso we obtained the first zzso zzso from seven sample simulations with zzso between zzso of the default zzso We showed that this zzso was sufficient to estimate the signal over the whole zzso range of zzso By aligning the origins of the different zzso coordinate systems and zzso the single tissue effects, it was possible to estimate the zzso for combined zzso variations in all four zzso Furthermore, the method can be used to easily calculate confidence intervals for the zzso zzso the minimal and zzso possible zzso for given zzso zzso In addition to that, it was possible to determine the most probable zzso values for a given zzso zzso This was achieved by probing hundreds of different zzso combinations with a zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, our method allows to efficiently predict zzso zzso over a wide range of zzso values from few sample zzso
