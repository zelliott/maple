zzso from eye movements and blinks can be orders of magnitude larger than zzso electrical zzso and are one of the main sources of artifacts in zzso zzso zzso zzso contaminated trials causes substantial data loss, and restricting eye zzso limits the experimental designs possible and may impact the cognitive processes under zzso This article presents a method based on blind source separation zzso for automatic removal of zzso artifacts from zzso zzso zzso is a zzso methodology that includes independent component analysis zzso In contrast to previously explored zzso methods for artifact zzso this method is zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso described zzso can isolate correlated zzso components with a high degree of zzso Although the focus is on eliminating zzso artifacts in zzso data, the approach can be extended to other sources of zzso contamination such as cardiac signals, environmental noise, and zzso zzso and adapted for use with zzso zzso data, a magnetic correlate of zzso
