Human cancer is caused by the zzso of genetic zzso in zzso Of special importance are changes that occur early during zzso transformation because they may result in zzso addiction and represent promising targets for therapeutic zzso Here we describe a zzso approach, called zzso the zzso Steps in Cancer zzso to deduce the zzso sequence of genetic events during zzso from zzso zzso data of tumors at their fully transformed zzso When applied to a zzso of 70 advanced zzso zzso our zzso accurately predicts the sequence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso previously defined by analyzing tumors at different stages of colon cancer zzso We further validate the method with zzso and leukemia sample data and then apply it to complex integrated zzso databases, finding that high-level zzso amplification appears to be a late event in primary zzso zzso represents the first evolutionary mathematical approach to identify the zzso sequence of zzso driving zzso and may be useful to guide the validation of candidate genes emerging from cancer zzso zzso
