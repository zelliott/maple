zzso zzso imaging of fully conscious zzso represents an important paradigm shift for zzso zzso In such studies, if motion tracking is performed through a transparent zzso containing the awake animal, light refraction at the interface will introduce errors in stereo pose zzso We have performed a thorough investigation of how this impacts the accuracy of pose estimates and the resulting motion zzso and developed an efficient method to predict and correct for zzso zzso The refraction model underlying this study was validated using a state-of-the-art motion tracking zzso zzso error was shown to be dependent on tracking marker size, working distance, and interface thickness and zzso zzso for refraction error improved the spatial resolution and quantitative accuracy of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Since the methods are general, they may also be useful in other contexts where data are corrupted by refraction zzso
