zzso methods are used to identify a subset of genes that are zzso in a subset of experimental conditions in zzso gene expression zzso Many zzso zzso rely on zzso mean squared zzso to discover zzso from a gene expression zzso Recently it has been proved that mean squared zzso is only good in capturing constant and shifting zzso However, zzso zzso cannot be detected using this zzso In this article, a new zzso measure called zzso mean squared zzso zzso is zzso zzso it has been proved that the proposed new measure is able to detect the zzso patterns effectively and it is zzso to local or global zzso of the input zzso The effectiveness of the proposed zzso measure in detecting zzso patterns has been demonstrated zzso on artificial and real-life benchmark gene expression zzso Moreover, biological significance tests have been conducted to show that the zzso identified using the proposed measure are composed of functionally enriched sets of zzso
