Previous investigators have zzso fatigue during short zzso cycling trials ( approximately 30 zzso by calculating a fatigue zzso Other investigators have reported a zzso zzso rate relationship during short zzso zzso cycling trials zzso zzso During zzso trials, zzso rates may change with zzso zzso of fatigue using fatigue index is therefore complicated by the zzso rate zzso 

The purpose of this study was to zzso fatigue while accounting for the effects of zzso rate on zzso 

Power and zzso rate were recorded during Union zzso zzso sanctioned zzso time trials by eight male zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso world-class sprint zzso with zzso power meters and zzso track zzso Data from the initial portion of zzso acceleration were used to establish zzso zzso rate zzso zzso was zzso three ways: 1) traditional fatigue index, 2) fatigue index modified to account for the zzso rate relationship zzso fatigue zzso and 3) work deficit, the difference between actual work done and work that might have been accomplished without zzso 

zzso index zzso zzso zzso was significantly greater than net fatigue index zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso indicating that the zzso rate relationship accounted for zzso zzso zzso of the traditional fatigue index zzso Work deficit zzso zzso zzso was significantly less than either measure of fatigue zzso zzso zzso 

Net fatigue index and work deficit account for the zzso rate relation and therefore more precisely zzso fatigue during variable zzso zzso These measures can be used to compare fatigue during different fatigue zzso including world-class sprint cycling zzso zzso zzso of fatigue during elite cycling competition may improve evaluation of training status, gear ratio selection, and fatigue zzso
