We apply the linear response theory developed by zzso zzso zzso zzso 95, zzso zzso to analyze how a periodic signal of weak zzso superimposed upon a chaotic background, is transmitted in a network of zzso interacting zzso We zzso zzso the complex zzso and show the existence of specific poles zzso zzso corresponding to the response to zzso zzso to the zzso zzso to the poles of correlation functions they depend on the pair zzso zzso This dynamic zzso induced by zzso exhibits the different ability that units have to transmit a signal in this zzso
