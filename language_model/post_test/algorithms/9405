A novel method, zzso extraction zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso followed by gas zzso zzso zzso for determination of trace amounts of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in human zzso is zzso The method involved correction by use of stable zzso labeled internal standards zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A human urine sample to which zzso had been added was extracted for 90 zzso at 37 degrees C using a stir bar coated with a zzso layer of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso becoming free zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso were then extracted with the zzso stir bar and the stir bar was subjected to TD with zzso zzso this was followed by zzso in zzso zzso zzso To zzso the conditions for zzso with zzso zzso and to test recovery, zzso and zzso were zzso by a zzso technique in our zzso Average zzso from human urine samples spiked with zzso and zzso were between zzso and zzso with correction using the added surrogate zzso Limits of detection were zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso We also measured background levels of zzso and zzso in six urine samples from healthy zzso zzso and zzso were detected in the samples at zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
