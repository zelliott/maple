The zzso capacity of the zzso zzso is a critical zzso zzso yet the currently accepted clinical model zzso assumes a zzso zzso region, and a constant DL independent of zzso volume, VA, despite experimental evidence to the zzso We have formulated a new mathematical model zzso zzso Wilson, zzso George, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that considers variable zzso mixing through a single zzso k zzso and a DL that is a positive function of VA zzso or zzso The goal of this study is to determine the suitability of this model to determine the unknown parameters zzso zzso zzso zzso and k from experimental data in normal zzso The model predicts that the normal lung zzso in part, zzso zzso The following average values in all seven subjects were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso where VA is expressed in L zzso We conclude that the mathematical model is suitable for identifying the unknown parameters and thus can be used to characterize the degree of zzso mixing (or sequential zzso as well as the volume dependence of zzso
