zzso approximations have in recent years become a popular means to estimate the mean zzso and the zzso and zzso of the concentration fluctuations of species involved in zzso chemical zzso such as those inside zzso The typical assumption behind these methods is that all zzso of the probability distribution function solution of the chemical master equation which are higher than a certain order are zzso small and hence can be set to zzso These approximations are ad hoc and hence the reliability of the predictions of these class of methods is presently zzso In this article, we study the accuracy of the two moment approximation zzso zzso and higher order zzso are zzso and of the three moment approximation zzso zzso and higher order zzso are zzso for chemical systems which are zzso and composed of zzso and zzso zzso We use the zzso expansion, a systematic method of solving the chemical master equation for zzso reaction systems, to calculate in the limit of large reaction volumes, the zzso and zzso corrections to the mean concentration prediction of the rate equations and the zzso correction to the zzso and zzso predictions of the zzso zzso We also zzso these corrections using the zzso and the zzso zzso of the latter results with those of the zzso expansion shows that: zzso the zzso accurately captures the zzso correction to the rate equations but its zzso correction to the zzso approximation exhibits the wrong dependence on the rate zzso zzso the zzso accurately captures the zzso and zzso corrections to the rate equation predictions and the zzso correction to the zzso zzso Hence while both the zzso and the zzso are more accurate than the rate zzso only the zzso is more accurate than the zzso approximation across all of zzso zzso The zzso results are zzso validated for zzso and zzso zzso
