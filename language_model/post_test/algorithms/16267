zzso tailing in breakthrough zzso in porous media with two distinct zzso is analyzed in terms of the dynamic responses of experimental fixed bed columns filled either with solid or porous zzso The flow is fast in the column zzso space between beads (for both solid and porous zzso but slow within the porous beads that act as controlled zzso zzso an immobile zzso The transport is zzso using a Continuous Time Random Walk zzso zzso which accounts for zzso with controlled structural and flow zzso associated with two distinct spatial and time zzso We first demonstrate that breakthrough zzso for a column containing solid glass beads exhibit zzso zzso quantifiable both in fitting and validation mode by a zzso based on a power law transition time zzso We then examine breakthrough zzso in the porous zzso case, obtaining fits with a zzso zzso model that accounts explicitly for the two time zzso Because the porous beads are uniform, zzso zzso within them is described by a simple zzso approximation trap model, with relatively weak capture and relatively faster release zzso The extent of tailing apparent in the porous zzso breakthrough curves, due to the zzso can be zzso distinguished from the contribution to tailing due to mobile zone zzso zzso A zzso study of the zzso zzso adds further insight into the dynamics of the process, showing the interaction between the zzso zzso transport and the mass exchange to immobile zzso
