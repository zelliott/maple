zzso has become one of the most popular and useful models in cell biology, development, and drug zzso Because zzso zzso is transparent and can be observed under microscope without zzso it is increasingly used in zzso zzso The small size of zzso zzso allows users to image them in a zzso or zzso plate under various conditions, in turn, generating such a large amount of images that only automated analysis is feasible for processing and zzso We focus on developing an image processing zzso to automatically zzso gene expression on zzso zzso that have been treated by various zzso The challenge in this type of application includes aligning zzso of different zzso and automatically creating regions of interest zzso to zzso specific areas in the head and torso of zzso The image processing pipeline consists of zzso zzso creation and zzso of zzso We test the zzso using zzso images of zzso zzso obtained from an experiment screening compounds that may affect zzso in Alzheimer's disease and results show that automated analysis can achieve satisfactory performance in a much shorter amount of time with a high level of zzso
