Bone zzso is a common biological process zzso for example, during fracture healing or zzso of zzso Computer simulation of bone zzso is difficult to carry out because it is a complex sequence of zzso processes regulated by zzso zzso An zzso to predict the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso has been zzso The zzso assumes that there are precursor cells in the zzso tissue and that these cells differentiate into either zzso (to form zzso zzso zzso zzso (to form zzso zzso or zzso (to form zzso based on a combination of zzso stimuli derived from strain in the zzso zzso and flow of the zzso zzso Both these stimuli are known to zzso the precursor cells, and the authors zzso that this causes zzso of cell differentiation zzso The observation that precursor cells take time to spread throughout the fracture callus has been included in the zzso The zzso was tested in an investigation of the fracture healing of a long bone using an zzso finite element zzso The zzso sequence of tissue zzso that appear in the course of fracture healing was successfully zzso Furthermore, the origin of the precursor cells zzso surrounding muscle, bone zzso or zzso was predicted to have a fundamental effect on the healing pattern and on the rate of reduction of the zzso strain zzso The initial zzso zzso zzso drops to zzso within seven zzso if cells originated from the surrounding soft zzso but took more than 50% longer if cells originated in the inner zzso layer of the zzso and four times longer if precursor cells originated from the bone zzso zzso
