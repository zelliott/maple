The purpose of this study was to identify zzso zzso features that correlate with zzso zzso interface zzso zzso performance in people with zzso lateral sclerosis zzso Twenty people with ALS used a zzso zzso spelling application in zzso zzso Three types of zzso features were found to be good zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso the negative peak zzso of the zzso potential to target stimuli (target zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso frequency zzso zzso power at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A statistical prediction model that used a subset of these features accounted for zzso of the zzso in zzso performance zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso The correlations reflected zzso rather than zzso zzso The results enhance understanding of performance differences among zzso zzso zzso The zzso found in this study might help in: zzso identifying suitable candidates for long-term zzso zzso zzso zzso assessing performance zzso Further work on zzso effects needs to be done to establish whether zzso zzso user performance could be improved by zzso one or more of these zzso zzso
