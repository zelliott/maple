Certain zzso tools allow an efficient way to provide valuable data to evaluate the retention behavior of zzso in liquid zzso In this study of the retention behavior of zzso zzso the experimental design was applied in combination with artificial neural networks zzso Three potentially significant factors zzso content, pH of the mobile phase and column zzso were incorporated in the plan of experiments, defined by central composite zzso As the system zzso the retention factors of all six investigated substances zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The pattern for the analyzed behavior of the system was created by employing zzso The final, zzso zzso of the highly zzso network was zzso Twelve experiments were used in a training set, whereas a zzso zzso was optimal for network zzso The ability of the defined network to predict the retention of the investigated zzso was confirmed by correlations higher than zzso for all zzso The presented approach allowed the adequate prediction of the retention behavior of zzso in addition to the extraction of important information for a better understanding of the analyzed zzso
