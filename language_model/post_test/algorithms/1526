The aim of the study was to investigate the dynamic characteristics of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso ambulatory zzso zzso pH monitoring was performed in 19 zzso zzso disease patients zzso zzso zzso and in 19 healthy volunteers zzso zzso zzso The pH was recorded at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 zzso from the lower zzso zzso zzso using a sample frequency of 4 zzso for each zzso zzso analysis included calculation of the ascending zzso of the zzso and duration and extent zzso above the zzso of all individual zzso zzso 

In the patients more upright zzso episodes reached the zzso sensor than in the controls zzso and zzso respectively, P zzso zzso The duration of the zzso episodes zzso at 3 zzso above the zzso was longer in the patients than in controls zzso zzso zzso This effect was independent of the zzso extent of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of upright acid zzso were higher in controls zzso to zzso zzso than in patients zzso to zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

The dynamic characteristics of zzso zzso differ significantly from those of zzso zzso
