Large files produced by standard zzso zzso slow down spread of digital and zzso We validated zzso video high-grade zzso with the new Motion Pictures Expert Groups zzso zzso with a zzso zzso 

Seven expert zzso blindly scored zzso zzso 165 zzso and compressed zzso and color zzso video clips, based on combined diagnostic content and image quality zzso files as zzso One digital video and 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used, the latter at 3 zzso levels zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso file sizes decreased from 12 to 83 zzso to zzso to zzso zzso zzso reduction zzso Mean zzso of differences was zzso for zzso zzso zzso and digital video zzso Compared with zzso files, only the zzso mean score at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly zzso At zzso analysis, these differences were still significant for zzso and fundamental imaging but not for color or second harmonic tissue zzso Original image quality, session zzso zzso grade, and zzso were all independent zzso of mean zzso 

Our study supports use of zzso zzso to greatly reduce zzso file sizes, thus zzso zzso and zzso Quality evaluation studies should account for the many independent variables that affect image quality zzso
