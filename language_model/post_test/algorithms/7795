During reaching or drawing, the zzso zzso carries information about the current and upcoming position of the zzso Researchers have zzso hand position, zzso and acceleration during zzso reaching or drawing tasks from neural recordings acquired zzso at the zzso and zzso zzso Here we report that we can continuously decode information about hand zzso at the zzso level from zzso zzso data acquired from the scalp during a zzso drawing task with an imposed zzso zzso The grand mean zzso correlation zzso zzso between measured and zzso zzso profiles were zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the horizontal dimension of movement and zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the vertical dimension of movement where the order of the zzso indicates zzso zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso By projecting the sensor contributions to decoding onto zzso scalp zzso we found that a zzso zzso network carries information about detailed hand zzso and that contributions from sensors over central and zzso scalp areas change due to adaptation to the rotated zzso Moreover, a 3-D linear zzso of distributed current sources using standardized zzso brain electromagnetic zzso zzso permitted a more detailed investigation into the cortical network that encodes for hand zzso in each of the adaptation zzso zzso implications of these findings include a zzso methodology to examine the neural zzso of behavior on a zzso with high zzso resolution and the potential to provide zzso complex control of a zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso
