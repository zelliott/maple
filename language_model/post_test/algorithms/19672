In this paper, the zzso of a general class of zzso delayed neural networks zzso is formulated and zzso Several sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure zzso zzso can have zzso periodic orbits and these periodic orbits are locally zzso In addition, we give the conditions for a periodic orbit to be locally or globally attractive when the periodic orbit locates in a designated zzso As two typical representatives, the zzso neural network and the cellular neural network are examined in zzso These conditions improve and extend the existing stability results in the zzso zzso results are also discussed in three illustrative zzso
