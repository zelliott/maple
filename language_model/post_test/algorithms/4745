zzso spines are small, bulbous cellular compartments that carry zzso zzso have been studying the zzso pathways by examining the zzso and statistical changes of the zzso spines at the zzso zzso In this paper a novel approach is presented for automated detection of zzso spines in zzso zzso The zzso spines are recognized as small objects of variable shape attached or detached to multiple zzso zzso in the zzso projection of the image stack along the optical zzso We extend the zzso structure detector to extract the boundaries as well as the zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso We further build a zzso using Linear zzso Analysis zzso to zzso the attached spines into valid and invalid types to improve the accuracy of the spine zzso We evaluate the proposed approach by comparing with the manual results in terms of backbone zzso spine number, spine zzso and spine zzso
