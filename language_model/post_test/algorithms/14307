zzso zzso automotive driver assistance systems aiming to alert drivers about driving zzso and possible collision with other vehicles has attracted a lot of attention zzso In these systems, robust and reliable vehicle detection is a critical zzso This paper presents a review of recent zzso zzso vehicle detection zzso Our focus is on systems where the camera is mounted on the vehicle rather than being fixed such as in zzso monitoring zzso First, we discuss the problem of zzso vehicle detection using optical sensors followed by a brief review of intelligent vehicle research zzso Then, we discuss active and passive sensors to set the stage for zzso vehicle zzso zzso aiming to quickly zzso the location of vehicles in an image as well as to verify the hypothesized locations are reviewed zzso zzso detection with tracking is also reviewed to illustrate the benefits of exploiting zzso continuity for vehicle zzso Finally, we present a critical overview of the methods discussed, we assess their potential for future deployment, and we present directions for future zzso
