Scroll waves in excitable media, described by the Barkley model, are zzso In the zzso region of weak zzso negative tension of wave filaments is zzso It leads to expansion of scroll rings and instability of wave zzso A circular filament tends to stretch, zzso loop, and produce an expanding tangle that fills up the zzso The filament does not undergo fragmentation before it touches the zzso zzso properties of such zzso turbulence of scroll waves are zzso zzso
