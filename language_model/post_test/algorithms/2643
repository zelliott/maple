A joint model of zzso video coding zzso uses exhaustive mode and motion searches to select the best prediction mode and motion zzso for each zzso zzso with high coding efficiency at the cost of zzso zzso If major characteristics of a coding zzso such as the complexity of the prediction mode and the motion property can be identified and used in adjusting motion zzso zzso one can design an zzso that can adapt coding parameters to the video zzso This way, unnecessary mode and motion searches can be zzso In this paper, we propose a zzso ME for zzso including analyses of mode complexity and motion property to assist mode and motion zzso An experimental analysis is performed to study zzso and spatial correlations in the coding zzso Based on the zzso the motion and mode characteristics of the current zzso are identified and zzso to adjust each step of ME at the enhancement layer including mode decision, zzso selection, and prediction direction zzso Experimental results show that the proposed zzso can significantly reduce the zzso complexity of zzso while maintaining nearly the same rate distortion performance as the original zzso
