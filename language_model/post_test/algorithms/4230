Relative absorbed dose energy response zzso zzso for various zzso films in water phantom is calculated by the use of the zzso zzso zzso code system for high energy zzso sources zzso zzso zzso and zzso The corrections are calculated along the zzso axis of the sources zzso zzso The zzso films investigated are zzso zzso zzso zzso and lot zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso For the zzso source, the value of R is about unity and is independent of distance in the water phantom for films other than zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso films showed distance dependent R values for this source (the values of R at 15 zzso from the source in water are zzso and zzso for the films zzso and zzso zzso In the case of zzso and zzso sources, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and HS films showed zzso R zzso The rest of the films showed no energy dependence zzso film showed R values less than unity by about zzso whereas the other films showed R values higher than zzso In the case of zzso source, the zzso film showed no energy dependence and zzso film zzso zzso showed a zzso R value of zzso The rest of the films showed zzso R values zzso with distance for the films other than zzso The solid zzso zzso and polystyrene enhance the R values for some films when compared the same in the water zzso
