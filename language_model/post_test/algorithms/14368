This paper proposes a comprehensive evaluation of a zzso zzso zzso registration zzso allowing zzso preservation in zzso This article is to be considered as the companion of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3-D zzso image registration: a zzso preservation scheme based on zzso deformation models and zzso analysis zzso zzso Transactions on Image zzso 14 zzso zzso where this algorithm, based on the zzso of an objective function, was introduced and zzso zzso assessment is based on the zzso of synthetic deformation fields, on average brain construction, on zzso zzso and on landmark zzso The influence of the model parameters is zzso zzso between several objective functions is carried out and impact of their zzso is pointed zzso An original intensity zzso scheme is also introduced, leading to significant improvements of the registration zzso The comparison benchmark is the popular demons zzso zzso zzso zzso Image matching as a diffusion process: an zzso with Maxwell's zzso Medical Image zzso 2 zzso zzso that exhibited best results in a recent comparison between several zzso 3-D registration methods zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Le zzso zzso Collins, zzso Evans, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Christensen, zzso Johnson, zzso zzso zzso evaluation of zzso brain zzso zzso Transactions on Medical Imaging, 22 zzso zzso The zzso preserving zzso method proved to outperform the commonly available zzso zzso of the demons zzso on many zzso Some limits of zzso registration methods are also highlighted through this zzso
