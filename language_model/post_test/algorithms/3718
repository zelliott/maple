This paper introduces the zzso zzso framework zzso aimed at guiding zzso zzso through reaction additions and zzso of microbial networks for the overproduction of targeted zzso These compounds may range from electrons or hydrogen in zzso cell and environmental applications to complex drug precursor zzso A comprehensive database of zzso referred to as the Universal database (with zzso zzso is compiled and regularly updated by downloading and zzso reactions from multiple zzso database zzso zzso zzso is then used to zzso the zzso of non-native zzso extracted from this Universal database, to add to the examined production host for enabling the desired product zzso zzso competing zzso that divert flux away from the targeted product are identified and removed to ensure higher product yields coupled with zzso This work represents an advancement over earlier efforts by establishing an integrated zzso framework capable of constructing zzso balanced zzso imposing maximum product yield requirements, zzso the optimal zzso and evaluating different microbial zzso The range and utility of zzso are demonstrated by addressing two very different product zzso The hydrogen case study zzso reaction elimination strategies for improving hydrogen yields using two different zzso for three separate production zzso In contrast, the zzso study primarily showcases which non-native pathways need to be added into zzso zzso In zzso zzso provides a useful tool to aid microbial strain design and, more importantly, it establishes an integrated framework to accommodate future modeling zzso
