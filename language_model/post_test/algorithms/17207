A novel zzso for the reconstruction of dynamic images using zzso zzso has been zzso The zzso is specifically designed to image zzso changes in the brain using boundary data obtained from scalp zzso by incorporating a zzso zzso The a zzso information is obtain by solving the forward problem using a zzso model zzso which includes the zzso of the skull zzso The advantages with this new approach are that the sensitivity and accuracy of the location of the zzso changes are improved compared to methods based on adjacent zzso
