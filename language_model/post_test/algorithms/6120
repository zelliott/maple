zzso context zzso for minimum conditional zzso can be constructed by dynamic programming in the probability zzso zzso The main difficulty, zzso is the resulting complex zzso mapping function in the context space, in which the conditional zzso coding is zzso To overcome this difficulty, we propose new zzso for designing context zzso in the context space based on the zzso Fisher zzso and the kernel Fisher zzso zzso In particular, the zzso can describe zzso zzso zzso cells by projecting input context zzso onto a zzso curve, in which these cells become better zzso The new zzso outperform the previous linear Fisher zzso method for context zzso They approach the minimum empirical conditional zzso context zzso designed in the probability zzso space, but with a practical zzso that employs a simple zzso zzso mapping function rather than a large zzso zzso
