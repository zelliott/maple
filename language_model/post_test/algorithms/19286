zzso zzso over a zzso a three-dimensional zzso community of zzso immobilized at a zzso were made using an acoustic microscope operating at zzso up to 70 zzso The microscope scanned a zzso by zzso region of a living zzso having a nominal thickness of 100 zzso zzso variation of surface zzso zzso interior structure, and biomass were zzso zzso was estimated as the product of the speed of sound of the medium and the interim between the highest signal peak and that of the zzso plane without zzso The thickest portions of zzso were 145 zzso however, slender structures attributed as zzso extended above, with one obtaining a zzso height above the zzso zzso zzso of zzso were used to estimate the internal structure of the zzso zzso zzso was examined at five zones of increasing height from the zzso to examine biomass zzso zzso estimates of thickness were zzso with optical zzso The experimental acoustic and optical systems, methods used to estimate zzso properties, and potential applications for the resulting data are zzso
