We used an artificial neural network zzso to detect correlations between event sequences and zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso The layered zzso neural network, given a series of events as zzso and the zzso signal as a supervised zzso performed a zzso zzso zzso This type of ANN is capable of zzso any continuous function, and thus this analysis method can detect any zzso signals that correlated with corresponding zzso Because of the flexible nature of zzso fitting to zzso noise is a problem in zzso zzso We avoided this problem by using zzso and an early stopping zzso The results showed that the ANN could detect various responses with different time zzso The simulation analysis also indicated an additional advantage of ANN over zzso methods in detecting zzso modulated responses, zzso it can detect various types of zzso zzso without a zzso zzso The ANN zzso analysis is therefore beneficial for exploratory zzso analyses in detecting continuous changes in responses modulated by changes in input zzso
