We examined whether zzso testing using a rapid zzso increases the proportion of pregnant women obtaining zzso results and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso women attending public health clinics in Nairobi were offered voluntary zzso and testing for zzso zzso women were randomly assigned to receive either rapid or conventional zzso zzso Women randomly assigned to rapid testing were allowed to receive zzso results or to return zzso The results for women randomly assigned to conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso testing were available after 7 zzso zzso women were referred for zzso prophylaxis to prevent zzso transmission of zzso 

Among zzso women offered voluntary zzso testing and zzso zzso accepted testing, of whom zzso were randomly assigned to rapid testing and zzso to conventional zzso The median duration between testing and obtaining results was 0 days for women who received rapid testing compared with 11 days for women who received conventional zzso The percentage receiving zzso results was significantly higher among women who received rapid testing compared with conventional zzso Of 161 zzso women, only 24 received zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso interventions did not differ between zzso women randomly assigned to rapid testing or conventional zzso zzso 

Rapid zzso testing significantly increased the proportion of women receiving zzso results, which is important for sexual and zzso zzso zzso The challenge remains to improve the zzso of zzso zzso interventions among zzso zzso
