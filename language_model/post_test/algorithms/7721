zzso zzso infection zzso is a serious problem in hospitalized zzso Rapid and accurate laboratory diagnosis is the key to reducing of zzso The zzso sensitivity and specificity of many commercial zzso zzso have limited their zzso The aim of this study was analysis of zzso samples obtained from patients with clinical evidence of zzso with zzso or questionable result of toxins zzso zzso zzso recognized by toxins zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso for zzso of zzso zzso infection zzso in patients with zzso or questionable result of toxins zzso zzso zzso confirmed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso II, zzso zzso was zzso Sixty nine zzso samples obtained from patients with zzso zzso were zzso All zzso samples were cultured on selective medium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The positive samples on selective medium were tested by using Real zzso zzso CD zzso zzso zzso CA, zzso zzso CD zzso is a real time multiplex zzso that can be used to detect zzso zzso zzso strains and differentiate the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All results when zzso samples were negative in culture growth on selective medium and result of zzso test were questionable was confirmed by use a zzso zzso 

Among 69 zzso samples 56 were negative for toxins zzso using zzso test and 13 gave questionable zzso By zzso culture 60 of 69 specimens yielded zzso zzso zzso Among 69 zzso samples 55 were positive using zzso Thirty four zzso of patients was infected by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso testing by use of culture and Real Time zzso zzso increases diagnostic yield in a hospital patients with zzso or low level of toxins zzso in stool samples of patients infected by zzso zzso zzso strains including zzso zzso zzso zzso
