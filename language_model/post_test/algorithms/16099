In this paper, we present a new zzso complex detection and characterization zzso that consists of two zzso the first is a mathematical modeling of the zzso segment after zzso complex; the second uses classic threshold comparison techniques, over the signal and its first and second zzso to determine the significant points of each zzso Later, both T and U waves are zzso zzso zzso the principal innovations of this zzso is the inclusion of zzso characterization and a mathematical modeling stage, that avoids many of the problems of classic techniques when there is a low zzso ratio or when wave zzso is zzso The results of the zzso validation with the recently appeared zzso database are also zzso For T waves these results are better when compared to other existing zzso zzso results cannot be contrasted with other zzso as, to our knowledge, none are zzso Examples showing the causes of principal discrepancies between our zzso and the zzso database zzso are also given, and some ways of attempting to improve and benefit from the proposed zzso are zzso
