A zzso zzso zzso to predict class II zzso zzso on the basis of their structural similarity to an zzso zzso in zzso also predicted peptides which were presented to zzso zzso by class I zzso zzso This zzso ranked peptides according to mean zzso zzso values of zzso acids at positions zzso zzso + 4, zzso + 7, zzso + 11, zzso + 14 and zzso + 18 in a sequence which when coiled as a putative zzso had the indicated zzso in an zzso strip along one side of the zzso zzso selected for highly scoring, zzso strips were required to have at least 1 of the 4 adjacent strips scoring more zzso than zzso in the zzso zzso index and the entire sequence could contain no zzso This zzso predicted the class I zzso zzso peptides in sequences of 4 proteins from which some class I zzso zzso sequences had been zzso zzso Since both class I and class II zzso peptides could be identified with this algorithm, one can propose that: zzso foreign zzso sites zzso of the class I and class II zzso molecules are structurally zzso and zzso any one zzso zzso can be presented by some specific zzso of both a class I and a class II zzso zzso
