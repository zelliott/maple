zzso zzso is zzso and has been shown to be altered in both zzso and zzso zzso The identification and characterization of such zzso have been challenging, partially because of the low zzso of insulin during zzso and its short zzso zzso pulse detection zzso used to identify insulin zzso either cannot separate hormone zzso into their zzso burst and clearance zzso or have been limited by both the zzso nature of initial peak selection and a lack of statistical zzso of zzso 

To address these concerns, we have developed zzso a novel zzso computer zzso 

zzso was applied to synthetic insulin zzso series modeled on data derived from normal zzso subjects and simulated to reflect several sampling zzso sampling zzso and zzso zzso The operating characteristics of zzso were compared to those obtained with zzso a standard pulse detection zzso zzso performed considerably better than zzso with regard to sensitivity and zzso burst detection rates for true zzso false zzso and false zzso As expected, given the short zzso of insulin, sampling at 30-second intervals is required for optimal zzso zzso The choice of sampling duration is more flexible and relates to the number of replicates zzso 

zzso represents a viable alternative to standard pulse detection zzso for the appraisal of zzso insulin zzso
