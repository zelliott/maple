In this paper, we consider the problem of zzso a zzso in zzso based on its apparent motion in a stationary zzso zzso A thorough theoretical analysis is developed, from which we establish the minimum conditions for the existence of a unique zzso The theoretical results obtained have important implications for applications involving zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, and the use of a local zzso method is justified by detailed examination of the local zzso structure of the cost zzso The potential of this approach is validated by experimental zzso
