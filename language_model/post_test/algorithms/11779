The DNA zzso technology is about to bring an explosion of gene expression data that may dwarf even the human sequencing zzso Researchers are motivated to identify genes whose expression levels rise and fall zzso under a set of experimental zzso that is, they exhibit fluctuation of a similar shape when conditions zzso In this paper, we show that queries based on pattern correlations against large-scale zzso databases can be supported by the zzso model, an index structure designed for sequence zzso A zzso is a two-dimensional structure where each element in the sequence is associated with a zzso We transform the DNA zzso data, as well as zzso queries, into zzso and use zzso matching zzso to retrieve from the database all genes that match the query zzso We zzso using both synthetic and real-world data sets, that our method is effective and zzso
