In doubly censored failure time data, the survival time of interest is defined as the elapsed time between an initial event and a subsequent event, and the zzso of both events cannot be observed zzso Instead, only zzso or zzso observations on the occurrence times are zzso For the analysis of such data, a number of methods have been proposed under the assumption that the survival time of interest is independent of the occurrence time of the initial zzso This article investigates a different situation where the independence may not be true with the focus on zzso analysis of doubly censored zzso Cox frailty models are applied to describe the effects of zzso and an zzso zzso is developed for zzso zzso studies are performed to investigate finite sample properties of the proposed method and an illustrative example from an acquired immune zzso syndrome zzso cohort study is zzso
