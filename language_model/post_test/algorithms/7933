We present a novel zzso technique to measure the scattered zzso zzso from an zzso transparent microscopic zzso The complex zzso is zzso via phase stepping in a zzso zzso enabling high mechanical zzso We demonstrate theoretically and practically that the incoherent zzso of multiple zzso directions into a single image increases the resolving power and zzso image reconstruction in zzso zzso We propose a zzso zzso extraction zzso entirely based in real space in combination with ordinary zzso Thereby the zzso complexity affiliated with zzso methods is significantly zzso Using the first order Born approximation for zzso scattering objects it is possible to obtain estimates of the scattering density from the zzso
