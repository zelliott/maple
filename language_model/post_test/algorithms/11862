This paper proposes a method for the reconstruction of zzso reaction forces from force platform recordings of two consecutive zzso The reconstruction zzso uses zzso criterion zzso zzso to detect zzso foot contacts and zzso zzso forces from the combined zzso curve in order to reconstruct zzso zzso Experimental results suggest that the method can be applied to separate accurately zzso gait forces from corrupted zzso data as a result of incorrect stepping on a force zzso
