Many tasks in different sectors of zzso are very complex and highly sensitive to changes in the radiation zzso Often, only the simulation of radiation transport is capable of describing the radiation field zzso Down to zzso dimensions the energy deposition by zzso of secondary electrons is the main zzso for damage induction in zzso A large number of interactions take place until such electrons are slowed down to zzso zzso Also for some problems of zzso transport a large number of zzso histories need to be zzso Thus the efficient zzso zzso Carlo program, zzso has been developed for zzso and electron zzso Various applications and benchmarks are presented showing its zzso For zzso purposes the radiation field of a zzso source is calculated according to the American Association of Physicists in Medicine Task Group Report 43 zzso As additional examples, results for the detector efficiency of a zzso zzso zzso detector and a dose zzso for an X-ray shielding for radiation protection are zzso
