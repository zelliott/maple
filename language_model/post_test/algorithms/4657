In recent years, zzso zzso has become a powerful tool for drug zzso Although several approaches suitable for high zzso screening are available, there is a need for methods able to identify binding modes with high zzso This accuracy is essential to reliably zzso the binding free energy of the zzso Such methods are needed when the binding mode of lead compounds is not determined zzso but is needed for zzso lead zzso We present here a new zzso software, called zzso that aims at this zzso It uses an hybrid evolutionary zzso with two fitness functions, in combination with a sophisticated management of the zzso zzso is zzso with the zzso package for energy calculations and coordinate zzso A validation was carried out on 37 zzso zzso complexes featuring 11 different zzso The search space was defined as a sphere of 15 A around the center of mass of the zzso position in the crystal structure, and on the contrary to other zzso our zzso was fed with zzso zzso positions up to 10 A root mean square zzso zzso from the crystal structure, excluding the zzso This validation illustrates the efficiency of our sampling strategy, as correct binding zzso defined by a zzso to the crystal structure lower than 2 A, were identified and ranked first for zzso of the zzso The success rate increases to zzso when considering the five best ranked zzso and zzso when all clusters present in the last generation are taken into zzso Most failures could be explained by the presence of crystal contacts in the experimental zzso Finally, the ability of zzso to accurately predict binding modes on a real application was illustrated by the successful zzso of the zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso starting far away from the binding zzso
