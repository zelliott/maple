zzso and zzso zzso is a time-consuming task in zzso zzso The development of automated zzso tools remains problematic, because of pelvic organ shape zzso We evaluate a three-dimensional zzso zzso approach and a seeded zzso zzso for automatic zzso of the prostate and zzso on magnetic resonance zzso 

Manual and automatic zzso were compared in 24 patients using a zzso zzso zzso zzso spin echo zzso sequence and an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso echo zzso or zzso zzso For automatic prostate zzso an organ zzso method was zzso zzso without seminal zzso were delineated as the clinical target volume zzso For automatic zzso and zzso zzso a seeded zzso method was zzso Manual zzso was considered the reference zzso The following parameters were zzso volume ratio zzso zzso volume overlap zzso zzso of the volume of intersection to the volume of zzso optimal value zzso 1), and correctly delineated volume zzso zzso ratio of the volume of intersection to the manually defined zzso optimal value zzso zzso 

For the zzso the zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso For the zzso the zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso For the zzso the zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our results show that the zzso method is zzso and results in zzso prostate zzso with minor interactive zzso For automatic zzso and zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso contrast enables the use of zzso zzso
