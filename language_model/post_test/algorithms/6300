Resistance testing is increasingly accepted as a tool in guiding the selection of human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso therapy in zzso infected individuals who fail their current zzso 

To descriptively compare the correlation between zzso treatment response and results using three zzso zzso drug resistance interpretation zzso the zzso zzso Resistance zzso zzso system and two zzso interpretation zzso 

zzso from zzso zzso subjects, either starting zzso or switching to zzso a regimen of three or four zzso drugs, were collected zzso at baseline and after 3 months of uninterrupted zzso The correlation between viral load change and the number of predicted active drugs in the treatment regimen was zzso An interpretation zzso was recently developed to process zzso zzso Resistance zzso zzso zzso The number of active drugs predicted using this zzso was rank correlated with the viral load change over a zzso treatment zzso For comparison, a similar calculation was made using two zzso zzso zzso version zzso and zzso zzso Rules zzso both applied on the same zzso 

zzso significant zzso correlation zzso for each of the three zzso drug resistance interpretation systems were observed in the zzso subjects on a zzso regimen zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as on a zzso regimen zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, no significant correlation was observed in zzso subjects, probably due to the very low frequency of drug resistance in these zzso 

All three zzso drug resistance interpretation systems zzso version 1, zzso version zzso and zzso zzso Rules zzso were statistically significantly correlated with zzso therapy response as measured by viral load zzso
