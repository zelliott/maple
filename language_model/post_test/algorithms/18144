We develop a general theory of zzso zzso mathematical zzso for zzso images in the zzso zzso The basic zzso zzso operators zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso opening and zzso zzso are zzso We demonstrate the ubiquity of zzso zzso operators by providing a zzso kernel representation of increasing zzso The latter representation is a zzso of zzso representation zzso of increasing and zzso zzso The zzso kernel representation is zzso in the sense that a smaller subset of the zzso kernel is sufficient for the representation of increasing zzso We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of the minimal basis representation in terms of zzso in the hit-or-miss zzso The latter minimal basis representation is a zzso of zzso minimal basis representation for increasing and zzso zzso Moreover, we investigate the zzso property of the basic zzso zzso zzso Several examples are used to demonstrate that the theory of zzso mathematical zzso provides a general framework for the unification of various zzso schemes based on zzso geometrical structuring elements zzso zzso zzso and motion zzso zzso results illustrate the theory of the proposed zzso zzso framework and show its potential power in various image processing zzso
