The application of zzso zzso theory to zzso zzso data has been a recent focus for data zzso It has been shown that the zzso zzso zzso captures the shape of the signal response to concentration of zzso zzso We demonstrate that existing linear fit methods for zzso gene expression measures are not well adapted for the effect of zzso resulting from surface zzso zzso In contrast to the most popular methods, we fit background and concentration parameters within a single global fitting routine instead of zzso the background before obtaining gene expression zzso We describe a zzso zzso model of the perfect match signal that effectively allows for the separation of specific and zzso components of the zzso signal and avoids zzso bias in the high-intensity zzso zzso zzso incorporated within the fitting routine, allows a quantitative selection of the model that best describes the observed zzso The performance of this method is evaluated on publicly available zzso and comparisons to popular zzso are zzso
