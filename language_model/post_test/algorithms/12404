Some zzso acids clearly show preferences over others in zzso zzso These preferences, or so-called interface zzso can be used for a zzso interface zzso We investigated whether the prediction accuracy could be improved by considering not single but pairs of zzso in an zzso Here we present the first systematic analysis of zzso surface contacts in interface zzso 

We show that preferences do exist for contacts within and around an interface region within one zzso specific pairs of zzso acids are more often occurring than zzso Using zzso contact zzso in a blind test, higher average scores were assigned to interface zzso than to zzso zzso This effect persisted as small but significant when the contact zzso were corrected to eliminate the influence of single zzso acid interface zzso This indicates that zzso contact zzso may replace interface zzso in zzso interface zzso
