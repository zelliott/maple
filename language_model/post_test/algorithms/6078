zzso anatomical brain scans are routinely used in zzso studies, for example, as anatomical reference for functional data and in brain zzso zzso zzso motion can degrade the quality of these zzso An additional problem is the occurrence of signal dropouts in the case of long echo times and low receiver zzso These problems are addressed in two different zzso In the first study, it is shown that the high scalp zzso which results from the low zzso value of fat, may cause a typical ringing zzso in the presence of head zzso This problem may be enhanced if phased array coils are used for signal reception due to their increased sensitivity in the peripheral head zzso It is shown that this zzso can be avoided by combining certain fat suppression techniques that reduce the scalp zzso In the second study, it is shown that signal dropout affects mainly the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and that a bandwidth of 100 zzso should be chosen for the investigation of these areas to avoid signal losses while maintaining an acceptable zzso zzso Experimental results are based on the zzso sequence but can be applied to other zzso sequences like zzso and zzso Furthermore, the presented methods for improving the image quality can be combined with other zzso reduction zzso
