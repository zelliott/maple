Despite the well-known benefits of zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging in lung cancer diagnosis and staging, the poor spatial resolution of PET has limited its use in zzso zzso zzso used for zzso tumor from normal zzso such as threshold boundaries using a fraction of the standardized zzso value zzso are subject to zzso The issue of respiratory motion in the zzso confounds the problem of accurate target zzso In this work, we evaluate how changing the zzso target volume by varying the threshold value in the zzso process impacts target and normal lung tissue zzso For each of eight lung cancer patients we zzso generated multiple zzso zzso each target volume zzso to those zzso with zzso above a given threshold level, defined by a percentage of the maximum zzso zzso zzso targets were compared to those from CT; CT targets comprise a composite volume generated from zzso inhale and exhale zzso the CT zzso therefore also includes the zzso of tumor zzso Treatment plans using zzso Carlo dose calculation were generated for all zzso the dose uniformity was approximately zzso within the internal target volume zzso zzso by a uniform zzso expansion of the composite gross target volume zzso In all cases differences were observed in the generalized equivalent uniform doses zzso to the targets and in the mean lung doses zzso and normal tissue complication probabilities zzso to the normal lung zzso The zzso of the dose differences were found to depend on the target volume, location, and amount of zzso normal lung zzso and in many instances were clinically meaningful zzso than a single 2 zzso zzso For those patients zzso results indicate that accurate zzso using PET volumes is highly dependent on accurate target zzso Further study with correlation to clinical outcome will be helpful in determining how to apply these various PET and CT volumes in treatment planning, to potentially improve local tumor control and reduce normal tissue zzso
