Conventional zzso zzso yield approximately zzso of zzso zzso Our aim was to check whether zzso dynamics methods might be useful in the zzso of zzso zzso 

We extracted 190 consecutive zzso files zzso zzso zzso intervals zzso from the zzso of 70 patients zzso with coronary artery disease, 8 with zzso zzso 19 with zzso zzso and 7 with other zzso The zzso phase space zzso in delay zzso window pattern zzso and zzso complexity of the zzso intervals were examined within a 50 beat sliding zzso Data were not filtered for zzso and zzso Of the 83 recordings with appropriate interventions 79 were correctly zzso in a blind zzso Two interventions were not identified in patients with fast zzso zzso and two in cases of complex and frequent forms of zzso There were nine zzso zzso In all except one case zzso zzso with a fast zzso zzso the analysis by zzso methods showed that the intervention was not zzso All of the 98 control recordings were correctly identified in the blind zzso 

The results show that zzso dynamics methods may be used to supplement the existing zzso detection zzso to enhance the detection success zzso
