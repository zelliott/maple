The three-dimensional fold of a protein is described by the organization of its secondary structure elements in zzso space, zzso its zzso We find that the protein zzso can be recognized from the ID sequence of secondary structure states of the zzso zzso zzso recognition is facilitated by use of hidden zzso models zzso to represent zzso families of zzso Such models can be trained on the zzso observed secondary structure sequences of family members using well established zzso Here, we model various zzso groups in the alpha class of proteins and zzso from a large database, those proteins having the zzso described by each zzso The correct zzso family for protein secondary structure sequences could be recognized 12 out of 14 zzso When the observed secondary structure sequences are replaced with predicted sequences recognition is still achievable 8 out of 14 zzso The success rate for observed sequences indicates that our approach will become increasingly useful as the accuracy of secondary prediction zzso is zzso Our study indicates that the zzso are useful for protein zzso recognition even when no zzso primary zzso acid sequence similarity is zzso To illustrate the potential utility of our method, protein zzso recognition is attempted on zzso the obese gene product, and the human zzso zzso for which fold predictions have been previously zzso
