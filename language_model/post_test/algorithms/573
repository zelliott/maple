zzso zzso is a cell zzso process of major biological and technological zzso The zzso and downstream processing of proteins by zzso cells is of great commercial zzso The zzso zzso zzso is considered a promising host for zzso protein zzso Because zzso naturally do not zzso as many proteins as zzso zzso they can produce zzso zzso proteins with few zzso in the zzso An ideal system to address the zzso of a desired protein could be exploited among the native proteins in certain zzso zzso By applying zzso to the completed zzso zzso zzso zzso such a system could be zzso To this end, we predicted protein zzso locations and correlated the resulting zzso zzso with the zzso factors that zzso the cellular response to a particular environmental zzso 

To explore the potential zzso zzso zzso zzso four zzso prediction zzso were applied to zzso predicted zzso zzso proteins from the zzso zzso zzso zzso identified zzso proteins with zzso signal zzso From these zzso zzso the zzso zzso predicted that 176 proteins have no zzso zzso and the zzso zzso identified 150 proteins as having no zzso zzso modification zzso zzso zzso predicted that the zzso zzso zzso consists of 109 putative zzso excluding zzso zzso The zzso regulators of the putative zzso proteins were investigated by searching for DNA binding sites in their putative zzso The conditions to favor expression were obtained by searching Gene zzso terms and using graph zzso 

A public database of zzso zzso zzso proteins and their zzso factors are zzso It consists of 109 zzso and 23 zzso zzso A graph created from this database shows zzso zzso and zzso edges, suggesting a vast number of relationships to be validated zzso Most of the zzso factors are related to responses to stress such as drug, acid and heat resistance, as well as nitrogen zzso and may be useful for inducing zzso expression of potential zzso zzso
