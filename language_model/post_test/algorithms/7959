zzso zzso imaging zzso based on the zzso contrast analysis is a simple and robust technique for imaging of zzso zzso zzso finds frequent application for zzso mapping of cerebral blood flow, as it features high spatial and zzso zzso However, the quantitative interpretation of the acquired data is not straightforward for the common case of a zzso field formed by both by moving and localized zzso such as blood cells and bone or zzso Here we present a novel processing zzso we call dynamic laser zzso imaging zzso that can be used to correctly extract the zzso correlation parameters from the zzso contrast measured in the presence of a zzso or zzso zzso The zzso light contribution is derived from the zzso by zzso sequential zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging experiments performed in the zzso brain demonstrate that zzso leads to improved zzso The cerebral zzso response observed through the zzso and intact skull are more pronounced in the zzso images as compared to the standard zzso contrast zzso The proposed method also yields benefits with respect to the quality of the zzso images by suppressing contributions of zzso distributed zzso zzso
