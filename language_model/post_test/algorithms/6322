We successfully acquire the in zzso zzso spectrum of zzso from human skin using a rapid zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso signals of in zzso zzso zzso are similar to those observed from natural and synthetic zzso The zzso zzso spectrum is dominated by two intense and broad zzso at about zzso and zzso zzso which can be interpreted as originating from the zzso stretching of the aromatic rings and the linear stretching of the zzso bonds within the rings, along with some contributions from the zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso Variations in the peak zzso and zzso of these two zzso signals due to differing biological environments have been observed in zzso from different zzso The ability to acquire these unique in zzso zzso signals suggests that zzso zzso may be a useful clinical method for zzso in zzso analysis and diagnosis of the zzso
