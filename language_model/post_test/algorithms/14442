In three-dimensional medical imaging, zzso of specific anatomy structure is often a zzso step for zzso zzso zzso purposes, and its performance has a significant impact on diagnosis of diseases as well as objective quantitative assessment of therapeutic zzso However, the existence of various diseases, image noise or artifacts, and individual anatomical variety generally impose a challenge for accurate zzso of specific zzso To address these problems, a shape analysis strategy termed zzso is presented in this study to facilitate automated medical image zzso Similar to surface approximation using a limited number of control points, the basic idea is to remove problematic regions and then estimate a smooth and complete surface shape by representing the remaining regions with high zzso as an implicit zzso The innovation of this shape analysis strategy is the capability of solving challenging medical image zzso problems in a unified zzso regardless of the zzso of anatomical structures in zzso In our zzso principal zzso analysis is used to identify and remove the problematic regions and zzso basis function zzso based implicit surface fitting is used to achieve a closed (or zzso surface zzso The feasibility and performance of this strategy are demonstrated by applying it to automated zzso of two completely different anatomical structures depicted on CT zzso namely human lungs and pulmonary zzso Our quantitative experiments on a large number of clinical CT examinations collected from different sources demonstrate the zzso zzso and zzso of the shape zzso strategy in medical image zzso
