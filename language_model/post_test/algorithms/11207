The human zzso zzso zzso zzso is the major constituent of zzso deposits in pancreatic zzso of zzso zzso zzso is zzso together with insulin from the zzso zzso zzso at a low pH of approximately zzso to the zzso environment at a neutral zzso The increased zzso of zzso zzso in diabetes indicates that changes in pH may promote zzso zzso To gain insights and underlying mechanisms of the pH effect on zzso zzso zzso molecular dynamics simulations in explicit zzso model were performed to study the structural properties of five zzso zzso zzso under zzso and neutral zzso zzso In consistent with experimental findings, simulation results show that zzso pH is not conducive to the structural stability of these zzso This provides a direct evidence for a recent experiment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which suggests that zzso pH zzso the zzso formation of zzso In addition, a complementary zzso simulation shows the repulsive zzso interactions among charged zzso zzso slow down the zzso process of zzso by zzso Besides, our zzso simulations reveal zzso pH mainly affects the local structure around zzso zzso by destroying the surrounding zzso network, due to the repulsive interactions between zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso It is also disclosed that the local interactions nearby zzso operating between adjacent zzso trigger the structural transition, which gives hints to the experimental findings that the rate of zzso zzso formation and the zzso of the zzso structures are strongly zzso
