Imaging of blood flow zzso is an area of significant medical zzso Recently, the advantages of using the total integrated zzso power spectrum as the zzso that is zzso in color has been shown to result in an approximately zzso increase in flow sensitivity, a relative zzso to acquisition angle and lack of zzso We have taken this mode a step further and demonstrated the potential for zzso blood flow using zzso zzso applied to the power zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso where zzso is the two-time correlation of the fluctuation in the power zzso and v is the specific flow zzso of mean transit zzso zzso of a dog's blood, pumped at a constant rate through gum rubber zzso were obtained using a zzso zzso zzso linear array zzso at standard zzso spectral mode zzso zzso zzso zzso wall filter zzso 50 zzso sample gate zzso zzso zzso A fixed zzso angle of 68 degrees was zzso Five different flow rates were tested, and the zzso determined by power zzso were compared to the mean zzso calculated from the zzso shifts by linear zzso zzso zzso zzso We believe the results are very encouraging for using power zzso in zzso zzso
