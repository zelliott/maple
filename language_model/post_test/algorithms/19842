zzso population codes play an important role in representation of spatial environment and spatial zzso zzso the internal representation of zzso population codes will help understand neural mechanisms of the zzso For instance, uncovering the patterns represented by rat zzso zzso zzso cells during periods of either navigation or sleep has been an active research topic over the past zzso However, previous approaches to analyze or decode firing patterns of population zzso all assume the knowledge of the place fields, which are estimated from training data a zzso The question still remains unclear how can we extract information from population zzso responses either without a zzso knowledge or in the presence of finite sampling zzso Finding the answer to this question would leverage our ability to examine the population zzso codes under different experimental zzso Using rat zzso as a model system, we attempt to uncover the hidden zzso zzso represented by the zzso population zzso We develop a hidden zzso model zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to achieve this zzso goal, and we apply the analysis to extensive simulation and experimental zzso Our empirical results show promising direction for discovering structural patterns of ensemble spike activity during periods of active zzso This study would also provide useful insights for future exploratory data analysis of population zzso codes during periods of zzso
