zzso zzso zzso zzso is a very attractive functional imaging method despite the low sensitivity and zzso The use of internal zzso with the conventional reconstruction zzso was not enough to enhance image resolution and accuracy in the region of interest zzso We propose a local zzso imaging method with internal zzso developed from careful analysis of the sensitivity zzso that is designed to reduce the sensitivity of the zzso outside the local region and zzso the sensitivity of the zzso inside the local zzso We perform zzso simulations and physical zzso to demonstrate the localized zzso imaging zzso In preliminary results with multiple objects we show the benefits of using an internal zzso and the improved resolution due to the local zzso image reconstruction zzso The sensitivity is further increased by allowing the surface zzso to be zzso spaced with a higher density of surface zzso near the zzso Also, we zzso how much the image quality is improved using several performance parameters for zzso While these have not yet been studied in depth, it convincingly shows an improvement in local sensitivity in images obtained with an internal zzso in comparison to a standard reconstruction zzso
