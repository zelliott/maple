Previously, zzso in power of zzso zzso have been functionally linked to zzso motor and cognitive zzso Such links are commonly established by relating the power zzso to specific target variables such as reaction times or task zzso zzso the resulting zzso representation is subjected to zzso zzso As an alternative, independent component analysis zzso or alternative decomposition methods can be applied and the power of the components may be related to the target zzso In this paper we show that these standard approaches are zzso as the first does not take into account the zzso of many sources due to volume zzso while the second is unable to exploit available information about the target zzso To improve upon these approaches we introduce a novel zzso source separation framework called zzso Power zzso zzso zzso makes use of the target variable in the decomposition process in order to give preference to components whose power zzso with the target zzso We present two zzso that implement the zzso zzso Using simulations with a realistic head model, we show that the zzso zzso are able extract zzso components exhibiting high correlation of power with the target zzso In this task, the zzso zzso outperform other commonly used techniques that are based on the sensor data or zzso zzso Furthermore, using real zzso zzso recordings during an auditory steady state zzso we demonstrate the utility of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso components exhibiting high correlation of power with the intensity of the auditory zzso Taking into account the results of the simulations and real zzso recordings, we conclude that zzso represents an adequate approach for the optimal extraction of zzso components showing zzso of power with continuously changing zzso relevant zzso
