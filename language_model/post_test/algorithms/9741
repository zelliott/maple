We examined the coordination of zzso and reaches in a visual search task in which monkeys were rewarded for reaching to an zzso target among zzso Eye movements were zzso and monkeys typically made one or more zzso before initiating a zzso Target selection for reaching and zzso was highly correlated with the hand and eyes landing near the same final stimulus both for correct reaches to the target and for incorrect reaches to a zzso zzso reaches showed a bias in target zzso they were directed to the zzso in the same zzso as the target more often than to other zzso A similar bias was seen in target selection for the initial zzso in correct reaching trials with multiple zzso We also examined the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso In trials with a single zzso a reaching movement was made after a fairly stereotyped zzso In zzso trials, a reach to the target could be initiated near or even before the onset of the final zzso zzso In these trials, the initial trajectory of the reach was often directed toward the fixated zzso before zzso toward the target around the time of the final zzso In virtually all cases, the eyes arrived at the target before the hand, and remained fixated until reach zzso Overall, these results are consistent with flexible zzso zzso of zzso and reach zzso but fairly tight zzso of target selection for the two types of zzso
