This article considers three different aspects of periodic zzso population zzso First, a formula for the sensitivity analysis of the growth rate zzso is obtained that is simpler than the one obtained by Caswell and zzso zzso the formula for the basic reproduction number zzso in a constant environment is generalized to the case of a periodic zzso Some zzso between zzso and zzso proved by zzso and Zhou are also generalized to the periodic zzso Finally, we add some remarks on zzso notion of evolutionary zzso H and its relationship to the growth rate zzso in the periodic zzso
