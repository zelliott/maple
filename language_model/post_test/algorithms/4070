zzso and coronary vascular incidents are mostly caused by vulnerable zzso zzso and characterization of vulnerable plaques are important for early disease diagnosis and zzso For this purpose, the zzso and composition have been zzso Several zzso have been used to describe zzso data depending on zzso acquisition conditions, and zzso Among them, the zzso distribution is a zzso model used to describe the raw envelope zzso ultrasound signal for its zzso whereas the zzso distribution (a zzso of the zzso zzso is the zzso model which is commonly zzso However, it fails to describe zzso images or Cartesian zzso or zzso zzso images because linear filtering changes the statistics of the zzso In this work, a gamma mixture model zzso is proposed to describe the zzso zzso images and it is shown that the parameters and zzso of the mixture are useful zzso of zzso pattern for different types of plaque zzso This new model zzso recently proposed zzso and textural methods with respect to plaque description and characterization of zzso zzso zzso results provide an overall accuracy of zzso for four classes and zzso for three zzso These results evidence the zzso usefulness for plaque zzso Additionally, the zzso provides probability maps according to each tissue type, which can be displayed for inspecting local tissue zzso or used for automatic filtering and zzso
