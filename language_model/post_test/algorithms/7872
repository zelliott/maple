zzso wounds are a significant socioeconomic problem for governments zzso zzso zzso of people who suffer from diabetes will experience a zzso zzso at some stage of their lives, and zzso of these wounds will ultimately result in zzso of the lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to aid the healing of chronic zzso however, the zzso reasons for the improved healing remain unclear and hence current zzso protocols remain zzso Here we develop a zzso mathematical model of wound healing that is used to simulate the application of zzso oxygen therapy in the treatment of zzso Based on our zzso we predict that intermittent zzso will assist chronic wound healing while zzso oxygen is ineffective in treating such zzso Furthermore, treatment should continue until healing is complete, and zzso will not stimulate healing under all circumstances, leading us to conclude that finding the right protocol for an individual patient is crucial if zzso is to be zzso We provide constraints that depend on the model parameters for the range of zzso protocols that will stimulate zzso More specifically, we predict that patients with a poor zzso supply of zzso high consumption of oxygen by the wound zzso chronically hypoxic wounds, and/or a dysfunctional zzso cell response to oxygen are at risk of zzso to zzso The work of this paper can, in some way, highlight which patients are most likely to respond well to zzso (for example, those with a good zzso zzso and thus has the potential to assist in improving both the success rate and hence the zzso of this zzso
