Iris zzso is an essential module in iris recognition because it defines the effective image region used for subsequent processing such as feature zzso Traditional iris zzso methods often involve an exhaustive search of a large zzso space, which is time consuming and sensitive to zzso To address these problems, this paper presents a novel zzso for accurate and fast iris zzso After efficient reflection zzso an zzso iris detector is first built to extract a rough position of the iris zzso Edge points of iris boundaries are then zzso and an elastic model named pulling and pushing is zzso Under this model, the center and radius of the circular iris boundaries are zzso refined in a way driven by the restoring forces of zzso zzso Furthermore, a smoothing zzso edge fitting scheme is presented to deal with zzso iris zzso After that, eyelids are localized via edge detection followed by curve zzso The novelty here is the adoption of a rank filter for noise elimination and a zzso filter for tackling the shape zzso of zzso Finally, eyelashes and shadows are detected via a learned prediction zzso This model provides an zzso threshold for zzso and shadow detection by analyzing the intensity zzso of different iris zzso Experimental results on three challenging iris image databases demonstrate that the proposed zzso zzso state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and zzso
