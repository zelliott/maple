For cancer one of the primary aims of molecular epidemiology is to identify the zzso or zzso cause of zzso within a zzso Regarding zzso zzso many zzso data have become available via in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso and become publicly available through zzso databases such as the zzso Gene zzso Database zzso One particular zzso zzso incorporates the bacterial zzso zzso gene which allows selection of zzso at virtually all zzso We have developed an zzso called zzso that zzso zzso data from zzso that can be used to predict chemically induced zzso along the zzso zzso The prediction is based on a number of zzso the zzso of zzso zzso after treatment with a zzso of interest; DNA zzso along the zzso zzso the zzso of a zzso along the zzso the likelihood of a site being within a zzso We applied zzso to zzso 5, 7 and 8 of zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso data for zzso to obtain a predicted zzso zzso zzso spectrum after hypothetical treatment with zzso The resulting predicted zzso distribution reveals strong zzso zzso at zzso zzso 248 and 273 that correlate with known zzso zzso zzso within zzso The predicted zzso spectrum strongly resembles the zzso zzso spectrum compiled from known lung cancer zzso data from smokers and further supports evidence that zzso contributes to the overall zzso zzso distribution in lung zzso The zzso shows how zzso target sequence specificity and DNA zzso both shape the overall zzso zzso
