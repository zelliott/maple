zzso zzso zzso is a zzso structural zzso technique for comparing zzso and zzso regional brain volumes between patients and controls in zzso but some of its steps, particularly the zzso lack an experimental zzso The aims of this study were zzso a) to assess the effects of zzso to detect zzso zzso between microscopic and zzso abnormalities on published, classic zzso and b) to suggest a set of potentially optimal settings for detecting zzso abnormalities with new, advanced, high-resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and false positive rate after modulating or not in classic zzso using different software packages and spatial statistics, and after setting a range of different parameters in advanced zzso zzso were calculated in 10 zzso comparisons of 32 altered zzso 32 zzso gray matter images from different healthy zzso zzso brain abnormalities comprised zzso volume differences mainly due to cortical zzso In classic zzso zzso was associated with a substantial decrease of the sensitivity to detect zzso abnormalities zzso zzso settings for advanced zzso included the omission of zzso the use of large smoothing zzso and the application of zzso or zzso cluster enhancement zzso spatial zzso The zzso decrease in sensitivity was due to an increase in zzso and it was more severe in zzso zzso zzso zzso from this study suggest the use of zzso zzso to detect zzso abnormalities such as cortical zzso
