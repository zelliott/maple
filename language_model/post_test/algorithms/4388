New generation zzso zzso zzso often have zzso image defects that will require investigators to either repeat their zzso zzso or analyze their data with the defects left in zzso We investigated the effect of analyzing a zzso experiment on zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence of simulated zzso covering between 1 and zzso of the array zzso Using two different zzso zzso array analysis programs zzso zzso array software, zzso and zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso we found that even the smallest blob defects significantly decreased the sensitivity and increased the false discovery rate zzso of the zzso target zzso 

We introduced a new software zzso the zzso blob zzso zzso which allows rapid zzso detection and removal of various blob defects from the zzso files of different types of zzso zzso It is shown that using zzso significantly improves the sensitivity and zzso of a zzso array analysis compared to leaving the affected zzso in the zzso 

The zzso software and the sample array zzso files used in this article are available at: zzso
