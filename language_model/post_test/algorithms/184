This paper presents an experimental framework for the measurement of the zzso properties of zzso zzso The novelty of the presented framework is in the use of zzso wave zzso and the study of the zzso wave patterns in finite media for the measurement of the zzso zzso zzso is used to track the zzso motions inside a test zzso The zzso parameters of the block are then estimated by 2 zzso a wavelength measurement method and a model fitting zzso zzso are also made with zzso zzso The zzso parameters are estimated for several homogeneous phantom zzso The results from the new methods are compared with the conventional zzso zzso
