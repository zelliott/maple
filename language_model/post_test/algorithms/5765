For zzso in which fitness is zzso or difficult to express zzso interactive evolutionary zzso zzso is a natural zzso It is possible that a collaborative process combining feedback from multiple users can improve the quality and quantity of generated zzso zzso a large-scale online experiment in collaborative interactive evolution zzso explores this zzso zzso is an online community in which users can evolve and share images, and most importantly, continue evolving others' zzso Through this process of branching from other images, and through continually increasing image complexity made possible by the underlying zzso of zzso zzso zzso algorithm, evolved images zzso unlike in any other current zzso zzso This paper discusses not only the strengths of the zzso approach, but its challenges and shortcomings as well, in the hope that lessons learned will inform the design of future zzso zzso
