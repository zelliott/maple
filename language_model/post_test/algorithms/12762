zzso zzso imaging is an zzso technique for detection of abdominal stones which are a serious health zzso zzso of stones from abdominal ultrasound images presents a unique challenge because these images contain strong zzso noise and attenuated zzso In clinical situations where a large number of stones must be identified, traditional methods such as manual identification become tedious and lack zzso zzso The necessity of obtaining high zzso and the need to increase efficiency motivates the development of automated and fast procedures that segment out stones of all sizes and shapes in medical images by applying image zzso zzso In this paper we present and compare two fully automatic and zzso methods for robust stone detection in zzso ultrasound images of the zzso Our approaches are based on the marker controlled watershed zzso along with some zzso and zzso procedures that eliminate the inherent problems associated with medical ultrasound zzso The first zzso zzso I) zzso the advantage of the zzso reducing zzso diffusion zzso technique, along with zzso filtering and zzso gram zzso for removal of zzso noise, and the second zzso zzso zzso is based on the log zzso model which too serves as a tool for zzso of zzso Experimental results obtained from processing a set of 50 ultrasound images ensure the zzso of both the proposed zzso Comparative results of both the zzso based on efficiency and relative error in stone area have been zzso
