Management of patients with cerebral zzso zzso zzso is zzso Excellent surgical results are obtained in patients with low zzso grades, whereas zzso offers a good alternative with its high obliteration zzso In the absence of zzso studies, physicians must choose a treatment plan based on the currently available zzso To support this decision-making process, a mathematical model designed to describe patient survival rates after each treatment option was zzso 

The theoretical survival curve in patients undergoing conventional surgery, zzso or observation was zzso zzso life zzso in patients with zzso who presented at various initial ages were calculated for each treatment zzso A systematic method was also developed to compare the estimated risks of various treatment zzso 

Conventional surgery and zzso definitely produced better survival rates than zzso In the comparison of surgery with zzso zzso was equivalent to surgery with a combined morbidity and mortality rate of approximately zzso for a 20-year-old patient with an zzso cerebral zzso Data for other patient ages and treatment combinations are tabulated for use in determining the best treatment zzso The authors believe that their analysis will provide logical support for the decision-making process involved in the treatment of patients with cerebral zzso
