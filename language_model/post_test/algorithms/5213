Currently, conventional X-ray and CT images as well as invasive methods performed during the surgical intervention are used to judge the local quality of a fractured zzso zzso However, these approaches are either dependent on the zzso experience or cannot assist diagnostic and planning tasks zzso zzso in this work a method for the individual analysis of local bone quality in the zzso zzso based on zzso analysis of zzso and X-ray images of zzso zzso will be zzso A combined representation of shape and spatial intensity distribution of an object and different statistical approaches for zzso reduction are used to create a statistical appearance model in order to assess the local bone quality in CT and X-ray zzso The developed zzso are tested and evaluated on 28 zzso zzso It will be shown that the tools and zzso presented zzso are highly adequate to automatically and zzso predict bone mineral density values as well as a zzso zzso of the bone that can be measured zzso
