zzso cluster analysis has been applied to the 20 zzso acids by using 65 zzso properties as a basis for zzso The zzso products, the fuzzy sets zzso classical sets with associated membership zzso have provided a new measure of zzso acid similarities for use in protein folding zzso This work demonstrates that fuzzy sets of simple molecular zzso when assigned to zzso acid zzso in a zzso zzso can predict the secondary structure of the sequence with reasonable zzso An approach is presented for discriminating standard folding states, using zzso information splitting in zzso segments of the sequence of assigned membership zzso The method is applied to a zzso set of 252 proteins and yields approximately zzso matching for correctly predicted and correctly rejected zzso with approximately zzso overall success rate for the correctly recognized ones in three folding zzso zzso zzso and zzso The most useful attributes for discriminating these states appear to be related to size, zzso and zzso zzso Van der zzso volume, apparent average thickness of surrounding molecular free volume, and a measure of zzso surface electron density can explain approximately zzso of prediction zzso hydrogen bonding and zzso zzso do not yet enable clear zzso and zzso
