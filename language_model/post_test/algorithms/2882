Using a two-dimensional zzso zzso double rotation zzso experiment the contributions of the chemical shift and zzso interaction to zzso resonance shifts can be completely zzso zzso were acquired using a zzso zzso zzso pulse sequence and subsequently sheared along both the zzso and zzso zzso The application of this method is demonstrated for both zzso zzso and zzso samples zzso zzso The existence of the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso allows comparison of results for two zzso with different spins zzso and zzso as well as different zzso and zzso moments in a single chemical zzso Being only limited by homogeneous line broadening and sample zzso zzso of approximately zzso and zzso zzso can be measured for zzso in the zzso and chemical shift dimensions, enabling highly accurate determination of the zzso chemical shift and the zzso product, zzso For zzso zzso the use of zzso allows the chemical shift and electric field zzso zzso to be directly zzso that is difficult to obtain otherwise due to the presence of zzso zzso zzso
