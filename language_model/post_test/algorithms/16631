How can humans acquire zzso representations that enable zzso zzso and other forms of high-level zzso Using comparative relations as a model domain, we explore the possibility that bottom-up learning mechanisms applied to objects coded as feature zzso can yield representations of relations sufficient to solve zzso zzso We introduce zzso zzso with zzso transformations zzso and apply the model to the task of learning zzso comparative relations zzso larger, smaller, fiercer, zzso from a set of animal zzso zzso are coded by zzso of zzso features, based either on human magnitude ratings, zzso feature ratings zzso zzso et zzso zzso or zzso of the topics model zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso from empirical zzso the model is able to induce zzso relations represented as zzso weight zzso even when given positive examples zzso These learned representations allow zzso of novel zzso of the relations and yield a symbolic distance effect of the sort obtained with both humans and other zzso zzso then zzso its learned weight zzso by zzso zzso thereby placing distinct dimensions into zzso These transformed representations allow zzso to reliably solve zzso analogies zzso zzso a type of reasoning that is arguably specific to zzso Our results provide a zzso that structured analogies can be solved with representations induced from zzso feature zzso by mechanisms that operate in a largely bottom-up zzso We discuss potential implications for zzso and neural models of zzso thinking, as well as for the evolution of abstract zzso
