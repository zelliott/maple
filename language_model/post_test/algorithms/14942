An zzso for determining of protein domain structure is zzso zzso structures resulted from the zzso application have been obtained and compared with available zzso The method is based on entirely physical model of van der zzso interactions that reflects as illustrated in this work the distribution of electron zzso Various levels of hierarchy in the protein spatial structure are discerned by analysis of the energy interaction between structural units of different zzso Thus the level of energy hierarchy plays role of sole zzso and the method zzso the use of complicated geometrical criteria with numerous fitting zzso The zzso readily and accurately locates zzso formed by continuous segments of the protein chain as well as those zzso zzso zzso sets no limit to the number of segments in a zzso We have analyzed 309 protein zzso Among 277 structures for which our results could be compared with the domain definitions made in other works, 243 showed complete or partial coincidence, and only in 34 cases the domain structures proved substantially zzso The zzso delineated with our approach may coincide with reference definition at different levels of the zzso zzso Along with defining the domain structure, our approach allows one to consider the protein spatial structure in terms of the spatial distribution of the interaction energy in order to establish the correspondence between the hierarchy of energy distribution and the hierarchy of structural zzso
