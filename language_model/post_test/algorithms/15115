It has been shown in zzso and in zzso that zzso zzso may be able to influence the zzso of its zzso across biological zzso However, the quantitative contribution of the zzso process zzso by zzso on the overall zzso of zzso has not been determined zzso In particular, observations need to be clarified in which zzso showing high affinity to zzso zzso zzso apparently do not seem to be greatly influenced by zzso in their zzso and consequently also with respect to their extent of zzso after oral administration, whereas weaker zzso of zzso zzso zzso have clearly shown zzso zzso phenomena such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso cell zzso and mathematical simulations based on a zzso zzso model should aid in clarifying the underlying mechanism for these observations and zzso the influence of passive membrane zzso and affinity to zzso to the overall zzso drug zzso In addition, the concentration range of drug at which zzso transport across the biological membrane is relevant should be zzso The zzso of various drugs in zzso zzso was determined zzso and modeled using a combination of passive zzso membrane zzso and a zzso transport process in the zzso zzso The passive zzso were zzso obtained for the zzso and zzso membrane by zzso experiments using zzso zzso in the presence of a zzso zzso The zzso parameters were determined by a newly developed zzso zzso for the zzso of drug affinity to zzso The model was able to accurately simulate the zzso of zzso zzso with differing passive membrane zzso and zzso zzso Using the outlined approach, zzso vs zzso profiles were zzso and the relative contribution of passive and active transport processes to the overall membrane zzso was zzso A model is presented to zzso describe and predict zzso drug zzso in zzso zzso by knowing the affinity of a compound to the zzso zzso zzso and its passive membrane zzso It was shown that a combination of high zzso affinity with good passive membrane zzso zzso in the case of zzso will readily compensate for the zzso reduction of zzso zzso resulting in a narrow range in which the zzso depends on the zzso drug zzso On the other hand, the zzso of compounds with low passive membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso might be affected over a wide concentration range despite low affinity to zzso
