The large shape zzso and partial zzso challenge most object detection and tracking methods for zzso targets such as zzso This paper presents a new approach based on a zzso statistical field model that characterizes the prior of the complex shape variations as a zzso distribution and zzso this prior and the complex image likelihood into a zzso zzso A zzso zzso analysis of this model reveals a set of zzso equations characterizing the equilibrium of the zzso It leads to zzso efficient methods for calculating the image likelihood and for training the zzso Based on that, effective zzso for detecting zzso objects are zzso This new approach has several zzso First, it is zzso suitable for capturing local zzso In addition, due to the distributed likelihood, this approach is robust to partial zzso Moreover, the zzso structure provides large flexibility of modeling the image zzso which makes the new method robust to zzso zzso experiments demonstrate its zzso
