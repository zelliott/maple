zzso association studies using unrelated individuals may offer an effective approach for identifying genetic zzso that have small to moderate disease zzso In general, two different strategies may be employed to establish associations between zzso and zzso zzso collecting individual zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso in DNA zzso These two technologies have their respective zzso Individual zzso gathers more information, whereas DNA pooling may be more cost zzso Recent technological advances in DNA pooling have generated great interest in using DNA pooling in association zzso In this article, we investigate the impacts of errors in zzso or measuring zzso zzso on the identification of genetic associations with these two zzso We find that, with current technologies, compared to individual zzso a larger sample is generally required to achieve the same power using DNA zzso We further consider the use of DNA pooling as a screening tool to identify candidate regions for follow-up zzso We find that the majority of the positive regions identified from DNA pooling results may represent false zzso if measurement errors are not appropriately considered in the design of the zzso
