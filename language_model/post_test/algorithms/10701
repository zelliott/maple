In this pilot study, we used an zzso learning zzso for zzso and pattern matching to create feature maps that can be applied to zzso zzso We designed a network to analyze 83 first and/or second upper and lower zzso sets representing 13 zzso zzso species, based on three-dimensional measures obtained from zzso virtual zzso As shown in a comparison with a zzso analysis of the virtual zzso the artificial neural network approach provided more biologically meaningful information than the conventional zzso analysis zzso The methodology discovered partitions and zzso clusters consistent with zzso zzso from the species (or zzso level to the highest categories, by sorting and allocating upper and lower zzso zzso As one might zzso measures of upper zzso were richer in zzso information than those of lower zzso even among the zzso diverse zzso We also show that reducing zzso noise zzso biological zzso by limiting the analysis to a zzso subset improves zzso
