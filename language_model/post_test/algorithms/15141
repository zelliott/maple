Hot spot zzso of proteins are fundamental interface zzso that help proteins perform their zzso zzso hot spots by experimental methods is costly and zzso zzso and structural information has been widely used in the zzso prediction of hot zzso However, structural information is not always zzso In this article, we investigated the problem of identifying hot spots using only zzso characteristics extracted from zzso acid zzso We first extracted 132 relatively independent zzso features from a set of the 544 properties in zzso an zzso acid index zzso Each feature was zzso to train a zzso model with a novel zzso zzso for hot spot prediction by the zzso algorithm, an extension of the zzso neighbor zzso The combinations of the individual zzso were explored and the zzso that appeared frequently in the top performing combinations were zzso The hot spot predictor was built based on an ensemble of these zzso and to work in a voting zzso Experimental results demonstrated that our method effectively exploited the feature space and allowed flexible weights of features for different zzso On the commonly used hot spot benchmark sets, our method significantly outperformed other machine learning zzso and state-of-the-art hot spot zzso The program is available at zzso
