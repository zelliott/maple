Advances in zzso technologies continue to substantially accelerate capability for generating experimental data on protein levels, states, and activities in biological zzso For example, studies on zzso zzso zzso signaling networks can now capture the zzso state of hundreds to thousands of proteins across multiple zzso However, little is known about the function of many of these protein zzso or the zzso responsible for zzso zzso To address this challenge, we have developed an approach that enhances the power of zzso techniques to zzso functional and regulatory meaning of protein states in cell signaling zzso We have created a new zzso framework for applying zzso to biological data in order to overcome the typical dependence on specific a zzso assumptions and expert knowledge concerning the technical aspects of zzso Multiple zzso analysis methodology zzso employs an array of diverse data zzso distance zzso set sizes, and zzso zzso in a zzso fashion, to create a suite of zzso zzso These sets are then evaluated based on their ability to produce biological insights through statistical enrichment of zzso relating to knowledge concerning protein functions, zzso zzso and sequence zzso We applied zzso to a set of dynamic zzso zzso of the zzso network to explore the relationships between zzso parameters and the biological meaning that could be zzso and report on interesting biological zzso Further, we applied zzso to multiple zzso zzso for the zzso network, which allowed us to compare independent and incomplete overlapping zzso of zzso sites in the zzso We report specific and global differences of the zzso network zzso with different zzso and with changes in zzso zzso Overall, we offer zzso as a zzso approach for analysis of zzso data which may help increase the current understanding of molecular networks in a variety of biological zzso
