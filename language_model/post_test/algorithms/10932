A central problem in the zzso of gene regulation is to find the binding sites for regulatory zzso One of the most promising approaches toward identifying these short and fuzzy sequence patterns is the comparative analysis of zzso zzso regions of related zzso This analysis is complicated by various zzso First, one needs to take the zzso relationship between the species into account in order to distinguish conservation that is due to the occurrence of functional sites from zzso conservation that is due to evolutionary zzso Second, one has to deal with the complexities of multiple alignments of zzso zzso regions, and one has to consider the possibility that functional sites may occur outside of zzso zzso Here we present a new motif sampling algorithm, zzso that runs on arbitrary collections of multiple local sequence alignments of zzso zzso The zzso searches over all ways in which an arbitrary number of binding sites for an arbitrary number of zzso factors zzso can be assigned to the multiple sequence zzso These binding site zzso are scored by a zzso zzso model that treats aligned sequences by a model for the evolution of binding sites and zzso zzso zzso This model takes the zzso relationship between the species in the alignment explicitly into zzso The zzso uses simulated zzso and zzso Carlo zzso sampling to rigorously assign zzso probabilities to all the binding sites that it zzso In tests on synthetic data and real data from five zzso species our zzso performs significantly better than four other zzso zzso including zzso that also take zzso into zzso Our results also show that, in contrast to the other zzso zzso can make realistic estimates of the reliability of its zzso Our tests suggest that, running on the zzso multiple alignment of a single zzso upstream region, zzso on average recovers over 50% of all binding sites in zzso zzso at a specificity of about zzso and zzso of all binding sites at a specificity of about zzso We also tested zzso on collections of multiple alignments of zzso regions that were recently zzso based on zzso data, to contain binding sites for the same zzso We compared zzso results with the previous analysis of these data using six other zzso zzso For 16 of 21 zzso for which all other zzso methods failed to find a significant zzso zzso did recover a motif that matches the literature zzso In 11 cases where there was disagreement in the results we compiled lists of known target genes from the literature, and found that running zzso on their regulatory regions yielded a binding motif matching the literature consensus in all but one of the zzso Interestingly, these literature gene lists had little overlap with the targets zzso based on the zzso zzso The zzso code can be downloaded from zzso or zzso The full set of predicted sites from our tests on zzso are available at zzso
