zzso that estimate implanted cortical strip zzso coordinates using zzso skull X-ray zzso with zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso have been zzso However, when cortical strip zzso are inserted for temporary use and removed prior to closure, zzso imaging - either zzso or zzso zzso zzso - must be zzso 

To measure the accuracy of temporarily inserted zzso strip zzso coordinates using zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso compared to zzso CT zzso with zzso zzso 

In 5 patients undergoing movement disorder surgery, zzso zzso was used to generate a three-dimensional cortical surface manually scaled to fit an zzso skull zzso with an in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Individual contact coordinates were estimated using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso coordinates were compared to reference coordinates obtained by zzso zzso zzso with zzso CT in the same zzso 

Mean zzso coordinate distances between estimated and reference locations were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of temporarily inserted zzso zzso can be accomplished using zzso zzso and zzso zzso The accuracy of this approach is verified by zzso zzso and zzso CT zzso in the same zzso
