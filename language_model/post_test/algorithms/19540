Biological complexity and limited quantitative zzso pose severe challenges to standard engineering zzso for zzso and simulation of genes and gene products integrated in a functional zzso In particular, zzso zzso is a zzso and therefore zzso zzso zzso and optimal experiment design are important research topics in systems zzso An approach is presented in which zzso dynamics are replaced by fictitious zzso zzso The dependent input approach is particularly useful in validation experiments, because it allows one to fit model parameters to experimental data generated by a reference cell type zzso and then test this model on data generated by a variation zzso so long as the zzso only affect the zzso dynamics that produce the dependent zzso Another novel feature of the approach is in the inclusion of a zzso information in a zzso identification zzso making it possible to obtain estimates of zzso values and their zzso from a relatively limited experimental data zzso The pathways that control the nitrogen zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso zzso zzso experiments were performed on cells growing in zzso zzso data of zzso and zzso zzso were zzso as well as zzso zzso A zzso model was proposed and was shown to be structurally identifiable given data of its zzso and zzso The identified model is a reliable representation of the zzso system, as it could correctly describe the responses of zzso cells and different zzso
