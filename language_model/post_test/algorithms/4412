Two new experiments were created to characterize the elasticity of soft tissue using zzso In both experiments the spectral zzso image displayed on a GE zzso 700 ultrasound machine shows a moving interference pattern that travels at a very small fraction of the zzso wave zzso The goal of this paper is to devise and test zzso to calculate the speed of the moving interference pattern using the arrival times of these same zzso A geometric zzso expansion is used to obtain zzso equations relating the moving interference pattern arrival times to the moving interference pattern speed and then to the zzso wave zzso A zzso procedure is employed to find the arrival times; and an inverse zzso solver called the level curve method zzso the speed of the interference zzso The zzso is tested on data from a phantom experiment performed at the University of Rochester Center for zzso zzso
