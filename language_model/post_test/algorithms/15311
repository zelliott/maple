zzso alignment of functional zzso zzso data is necessary for group zzso The standard approach to this problem matches anatomical features of the brain, such as major anatomical landmarks or cortical zzso zzso alignment of functional cortical zzso however, cannot be derived using only anatomical zzso We propose a new zzso registration zzso that zzso zzso patterns of functional connectivity across zzso We derive functional connectivity patterns by zzso zzso zzso zzso measured during movie viewing, between zzso remote cortical zzso We validate our technique extensively on real zzso experimental data and compare our method to two state-of-the-art zzso registration zzso By zzso our method on independent zzso we show that the derived alignment zzso well to other experimental zzso
