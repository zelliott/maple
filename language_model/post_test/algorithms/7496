The accurate and automated measuring of zzso of certain human zzso stages is important to assess zzso viability and predict its clinical outcomes in in zzso zzso zzso In this work, we present a zzso zzso stage zzso method to identify the number of cells at every time point of a zzso zzso video of early human zzso zzso The proposed method employs a rich set of zzso and automatically learned zzso features for zzso and avoids explicit zzso or tracking of individual zzso zzso It was zzso evaluated using a total of zzso human zzso videos, resulting in a zzso overall zzso stage zzso zzso
