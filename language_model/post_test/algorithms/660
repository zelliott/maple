zzso of biomedical signals through communication channels is being used increasingly in clinical zzso This technique requires dealing with large volumes of information, and the zzso zzso signal is an example of this zzso In the zzso various channels are recorded during several hours, resulting in a great demand of storage capacity or channel zzso This situation demands the use of efficient data zzso zzso The objective of this work was to develop an efficient zzso for zzso zzso zzso In this algorithm, the zzso signal is segmented and then zzso through zzso zzso zzso The zzso decomposition zzso are zzso and those having absolute values below the threshold are zzso The remaining zzso are appropriately zzso and coded using a zzso coding zzso The compressed zzso signal can be recovered by an inverse zzso zzso experimental tests were made by applying the zzso to zzso records and measuring the zzso rate zzso and the distortion in signal zzso The zzso transform showed a high zzso allowing a reasonably low distortion after a zzso process, for zzso typically in the range zzso The zzso has a relatively low zzso cost, making it appropriate for practical zzso
