zzso accessible DNA databases zzso zzso are rapidly accelerating zzso research (see zzso with integrated zzso DNA, gene structure, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso DNA databases have relatively low zzso the zzso is a linear code that anchors all associated zzso In contrast, zzso expression and protein databases need to be able to handle very high zzso data, with time, zzso cell type and zzso as interrelated zzso The high zzso of zzso expression profile data, and the lack of a standard experimental platform have complicated the development of zzso databases and zzso zzso We have designed and implemented a public resource of expression profile data containing zzso human, mouse and rat zzso zzso expression profiles, generated in the same laboratory, and subject to the same quality and procedural controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our zzso zzso data warehouse includes a novel time series query analysis tool zzso enabling dynamic generation of zzso and spreadsheets showing the action of any transcript of interest over zzso In this report, we demonstrate the utility of this tool using a 27 time point, in zzso muscle zzso zzso This data warehouse and associated analysis tools provides access to zzso zzso data through zzso zzso both for download of all types of raw data for independent analysis, and also for straightforward zzso zzso Planned zzso of zzso will include zzso remote entry of projects adhering to quality control and standard operating procedure zzso criteria, and automated output of alternative probe set zzso for each project (see zzso
