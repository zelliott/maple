Studies of zzso traits often collect data for multiple items measuring different aspects of the zzso For such data, it is common to consider models in which the different items are manifestations of a normal zzso zzso which depends on zzso through a linear zzso zzso This article proposes a flexible zzso alternative in which the unknown zzso variable density can change zzso in location and shape across levels of a zzso zzso zzso of underlying zzso are used in order to model zzso the measurement errors and allow mixed zzso and continuous zzso A dynamic mixture of zzso processes is used to characterize the zzso response zzso zzso zzso proceeds via a zzso chain zzso Carlo algorithm, with zzso zzso used as a basis for zzso and evaluation of model zzso The methods are illustrated using data from a study of DNA damage in response to zzso zzso
