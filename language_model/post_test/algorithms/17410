We apply the method of zzso zzso sampling to a problem of great importance and zzso zzso zzso Gibbs sampling combines exact local zzso with Gibbs zzso in a way that zzso the strengths of zzso The method is able to handle problems with very high complexity, such as linkage analysis in large zzso with many zzso a task that no other known method is able to zzso New developments of the method are zzso and it is applied to a highly complex linkage problem in a human zzso
