As an important tumor zzso zzso reactivate zzso zzso was found in many kinds of human zzso and that restoring active zzso would lead to tumor zzso In this work, we developed a new zzso method to predict the zzso activity for one-, zzso three- and zzso zzso zzso zzso With the approach from the general form of zzso zzso acid zzso we used eight types of features to represent the zzso and then selected the optimal prediction features based on the maximum zzso minimum zzso and incremental feature selection zzso The zzso correlation zzso zzso obtained by using nearest neighbor zzso and zzso cross validation for one-, zzso three- and zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso It was revealed by the further optimal feature set analysis that the zzso zzso structure features composed the largest part of the optimal feature set and maybe played the most important roles in all four types of zzso zzso active status zzso It was also demonstrated by the optimal feature sets, especially those at the top level, that the zzso structure features, zzso zzso and zzso properties of zzso acid near the zzso site, also played quite important roles for zzso zzso active status zzso Our study has provided a new and promising approach for finding functionally important sites and the relevant features for in-depth study of zzso protein and its action zzso
