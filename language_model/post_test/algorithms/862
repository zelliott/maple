Lung mechanics and zzso were assessed in two groups of nine normal zzso rabbits mechanically zzso zzso for zzso h at zero zzso pressure zzso with zzso tidal volumes zzso 11 zzso and high zzso zzso or low zzso zzso inflation flow (44 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Relative to initial zzso on positive zzso pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso increased zzso zzso and airway and zzso resistance more in group A zzso zzso and zzso zzso than in group B zzso zzso and zzso respectively), with no change in zzso time zzso After restoration of zzso zzso zzso and zzso resistance returned to control, whereas airway resistance, still relative to initial values, remained elevated more in group A zzso than in group B zzso In contrast, prolonged zzso zzso on zzso had no effect on lung mechanics of seven zzso rabbits zzso zzso Gas exchange on zzso was equally preserved in all groups, and the lung zzso ratios were zzso Relative to group C, both groups A and B had an increased percentage of abnormal zzso attachments and number of zzso zzso in zzso zzso the latter being significantly larger in group A than in group zzso Thus prolonged zzso on zzso with zzso zzso of peripheral airways causes zzso zzso and zzso inflammation with zzso persistent increase in airway resistance, which are worsened by zzso zzso
