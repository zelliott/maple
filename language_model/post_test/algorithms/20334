zzso coding and decoding zzso is a novel approach to sensory coding and zzso zzso Unlike previous methods, it explicitly takes into account the zzso complexity of the code zzso It zzso zzso that convey information about the input data and can be zzso and zzso by zzso zzso We implement zzso by training zzso with flat minimum search, a recent, general method for discovering zzso neural zzso It turns out that this approach can zzso an unknown number of independent data sources by zzso a minimal number of zzso features necessary for representing the zzso zzso show that unlike codes obtained with standard zzso zzso are based on feature zzso never zzso usually zzso and sometimes zzso or local zzso on statistical properties of the zzso Although zzso is not explicitly designed to enforce sparse or zzso codes, it extracts optimal codes for difficult versions of the zzso benchmark problem, whereas independent component analysis zzso and principal component analysis zzso do zzso It produces familiar, biologically plausible feature detectors when applied to real-world images and codes with fewer bits per zzso than zzso and zzso Unlike zzso it does not need to know the number of independent zzso As a zzso for a vowel recognition benchmark problem, it sets the stage for excellent zzso zzso Our results reveal an interesting, previously ignored connection between two important zzso zzso research and zzso zzso They may represent a first step toward unification of zzso and zzso zzso
