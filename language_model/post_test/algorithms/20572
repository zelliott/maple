About a decade ago, the concept of zzso libraries was introduced to model zzso given known zzso zzso Since then, several groups have developed methods to handle the challenging zzso problem that is faced when searching zzso zzso To avoid a zzso explosion, the dead-end elimination method detects and eliminates zzso that cannot be members of the global minimum energy zzso zzso Several groups have applied and further developed this method in the fields of zzso zzso and protein zzso 

This work addresses at the same time increased prediction accuracy and calculation speed zzso The proposed enhancements allow the elimination of more than one-third of the possible zzso states before applying the dead-end elimination zzso This is achieved by using a highly detailed zzso library allowing the safe application of an zzso rejection criterion without risking the elimination of a zzso zzso As a result, we gain both in zzso accuracy and in zzso zzso Being completely zzso the current zzso of the dead-end elimination prediction of protein zzso can be applied to the zzso of zzso of proteins of any size on the high-end computer systems currently used in molecular zzso The improved accuracy is highlighted in a comparative study on a collection of proteins of varying size for which score results have previously been published by multiple zzso Furthermore, we propose a new validation method for the scoring of the zzso structure versus the experimental data based upon the volume overlap of the predicted and observed zzso This overlap criterion is discussed in relation to the classic zzso and the frequently used zzso 40 degrees window in comparing zzso 1 and zzso 2 zzso 

We have shown that a very detailed library allows the introduction of a safe energy threshold rejection zzso thereby increasing both the execution speed and the accuracy of the zzso zzso We speculate that the current method will allow the zzso prediction of zzso proteins and complex protein zzso involving up to 150 zzso on low-end zzso zzso
