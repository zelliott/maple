Many zzso zzso zzso use band power zzso changes in the electroencephalogram to distinguish between different motor imagery zzso zzso Most current approaches do not take connectivity of separated brain areas into zzso Our objective is to introduce zzso connectivity features and apply these features to zzso zzso 

We introduce a procedure for zzso zzso connectivity estimates from zzso zzso zzso models of independent components in a zzso zzso 

In a simulated zzso we demonstrate that the directed transfer function zzso with zzso zzso and the direct zzso give zzso results similar to zzso while other measures such as the partial directed zzso perform significantly zzso 

We show that zzso zzso zzso is possible with connectivity measures extracted from zzso models, and that a zzso could potentially zzso such zzso
