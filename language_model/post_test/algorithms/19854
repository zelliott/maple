zzso exposure is a common cause of soft tissue injury within the battlefield setting, with the zzso often critically zzso The resulting injury pattern presents with massive soft tissue defects that may be further complicated by varying degrees of accompanying orthopedic and peripheral nerve zzso To address the severe soft tissue zzso various combinations of advanced zzso methods are typically required to achieve definitive wound zzso Continuous external tissue expansion has been used by our institution to significantly reduce wound burden and provide for definitive wound closure in certain zzso zzso 

The authors present an early series of 14 patients who suffered massive zzso soft tissue injuries and were treated with an external tissue expansion system zzso zzso zzso zzso included time to definitive closure and method of definitive wound zzso A zzso subset of this group was zzso analyzed to determine zzso including initial wound surface area zzso percentage reduction in zzso and related zzso 

zzso time to wound coverage ranged from 1 to 6 days, with mean time to wound coverage being zzso zzso Of the 14 patients included in the series, 12 zzso were able to undergo delayed primary closure, whereas 2 required split thickness skin zzso In the zzso zzso zzso initially ranged from zzso to zzso zzso Mean wound size was zzso zzso zzso in zzso ranged from zzso to zzso of the initial zzso with mean decrease being zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso 

In the management of large complex wounds, external tissue expansion has proven to be a valuable adjunct in achieving definitive wound zzso It can often aid in successful delayed primary closure of certain soft tissue wounds, has low associated zzso and can reduce the need for more complex or zzso procedures when used zzso The authors propose an zzso for the use of continuous external tissue expansion system to achieve effective and successful wound closure, while potentially reducing the need for increased zzso zzso associated with more complex or larger reconstruction zzso
