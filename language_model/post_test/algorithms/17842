Recent advancement in technology promises to yield a multitude of tests for disease diagnosis and zzso When there are multiple sources of information available, it is often of interest to construct a composite score that can provide better zzso accuracy than any individual zzso In this paper, we consider robust procedures for zzso combining tests when test results are measured prior to disease onset and disease status zzso over zzso To account for zzso of disease onset time, the most commonly used approach to combining tests to detect subsequent disease status is to fit a zzso hazards model zzso zzso and use the estimated risk zzso However, simulation studies suggested that such a risk score may have poor accuracy when the zzso hazards assumption zzso We propose the use of a zzso transformation model zzso 1987) as a working model to derive an optimal composite score with theoretical zzso We demonstrate that the proposed score is the optimal score when the model holds and is optimal zzso zzso among linear scores even if the model zzso zzso sensitivity, zzso and receiver operating characteristic curve functions are used to zzso the accuracy of the resulting composite zzso We provide consistent and zzso zzso zzso of these accuracy zzso A simple zzso zzso procedure is proposed to obtain all consistent zzso zzso We illustrate the new proposals with simulation studies and an analysis of a breast cancer gene expression data zzso
