The engineering of zzso zzso is receiving increased zzso The paper, zzso and zzso industries, in particular, seek to use environmentally friendly zzso instead of toxic chlorine zzso zzso typically function at temperatures below zzso and zzso if exposed to higher zzso In contrast, a small portion of zzso can withstand higher temperatures as a result of various structural zzso zzso the protein attributes that are involved in this adaptation is the first step toward engineering zzso zzso We employed various supervised and zzso machine learning zzso as well as attribute weighting approaches to find zzso acid composition attributes that contribute to zzso zzso Specifically, we compared two groups of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, a combination of attribute weighting with supervised and zzso zzso zzso was used for prediction and zzso of protein zzso from zzso acid composition zzso Mining a large number of protein sequences zzso through a variety of machine learning zzso which were based on the analysis of more than 800 zzso acid zzso increased the accuracy of this zzso Moreover, these models were successful in predicting zzso from the primary structure of zzso The results showed that expectation zzso zzso in combination with zzso and correlation attribute weighting zzso can effectively zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso per cent of the weighting methods selected zzso content and frequency of zzso zzso as the most important protein zzso On the zzso level, the frequency of zzso was the key factor in distinguishing zzso from zzso zzso This study demonstrates the feasibility of predicting zzso irrespective of sequence similarity and will serve as a basis for engineering zzso zzso in the zzso
