zzso of radar zzso data with rain gauge zzso is a common approach to overcome problems in zzso rain zzso from radar zzso We extend an existing approach for adjustment of zzso radar data using zzso models and use the resulting zzso zzso as input for forecasting zzso from two zzso in the Copenhagen zzso zzso zzso models are applied to create the zzso zzso providing us with not only a point forecast but also a zzso of the forecast zzso Evaluating the results, we can show that using the adjusted radar data improves zzso forecasts compared with using the original radar data and that rain gauge zzso as forecast input are also zzso Combining the data merging approach with short-term zzso forecasting zzso may result in further improved zzso forecasts that can be used in real time zzso
