The separation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso acids using zzso zzso zzso employing zzso complexes zzso formed in the reaction between zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso was zzso The zzso were stabilized by zzso interactions of zzso chains of the zzso zzso and converted to an zzso zzso zzso The running buffer was a zzso solution of sodium zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso in which a part of zzso groups of zzso was blocked by zzso zzso For the systems with zzso of zzso complex zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso as a zzso phase, the zzso of six zzso zzso acids zzso were baseline zzso The separation in this case is based on a complex distribution mechanism of the zzso derivatives between the free buffer and the zzso zzso phase of the zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso of zzso complex zzso to the running buffer does not essentially affect on the zzso zzso of the zzso the zzso zzso is not zzso The influence of the concentration of the complex of zzso on the zzso zzso of zzso was zzso Relative zzso and relative zzso were used for describing zzso zzso of the zzso acid zzso
