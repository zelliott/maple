The aim of this study was to determine the areas involved in episodes of transient global zzso zzso by calculation of cerebral blood flow zzso using zzso fully automated zzso analysis software which we recently zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed during and after zzso attacks on eight patients (four men and four zzso mean study zzso 34 zzso The zzso images were zzso standardized using zzso followed by zzso of zzso constant zzso grouped into 12 segments zzso zzso central, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nucleus, thalamus, zzso and zzso in each zzso to calculate zzso zzso zzso as the zzso mean value for each of the respective 12 segments based on the regional zzso in each zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso of each of the 12 segments of the eight patients was estimated by zzso zzso analysis and zzso correlation test with zzso zzso For the control, zzso zzso was performed on eight subjects (three men and five zzso and repeated within 1 month; the correlation between the first and second zzso values of each of the 12 segments was evaluated in the same way as for patients with zzso Excellent zzso between the two zzso values was found in all 12 segments of the control zzso However, a significant correlation between zzso and zzso zzso was not shown in the zzso or angular segments of zzso zzso The present study was zzso but at least suggested that zzso and angular regions are closely involved in the symptoms of zzso
