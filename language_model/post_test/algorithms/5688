zzso zzso is a zzso belonging to the zzso zzso It interacts with numerous proteins of the zzso zzso in particular cellular growth zzso The number of experimental zzso zzso complexes obtained by zzso or nuclear magnetic resonance is zzso zzso zzso approaches can be zzso Generally, they restrain the zzso of the zzso rings and linkages in order to reduce the complexity of the zzso Modeling the interaction between protein and zzso zzso is indeed challenging because of the large size of the zzso needed for a strong zzso the flexibility brought by the zzso rings and linkages and the high density of negative zzso We propose a zzso method based on molecular zzso and molecular dynamics zzso zzso zzso allows exploring the positioning of a rigid zzso zzso zzso on the protein zzso zzso dynamics refine selected zzso models by explicitly representing zzso molecules and not restraining the zzso zzso The interaction of a zzso of zzso zzso was studied in interaction with zzso growth factor 2 and zzso zzso factor zzso This approach shed light on the plasticity of the growth factors interacting with zzso zzso This approach can be extended to the study of other zzso zzso
