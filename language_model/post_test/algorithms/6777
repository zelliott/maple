zzso zzso was prepared by heating zzso zzso at temperatures between 60 degrees C and 140 degrees zzso The effects of zzso temperatures on the moisture zzso and dissolution behavior of zzso zzso were investigated in this zzso The zzso rate of zzso zzso at zzso relative humidity and 25 degrees C decreased with increasing zzso zzso From the fitting analysis of solid-state reaction models, the zzso reaction was found to be governed by the phase boundary reaction model for samples prepared at lower zzso temperatures zzso degrees zzso but the reaction zzso the growth of zzso reaction model when samples were dehydrated at higher zzso The dissolution rates of various zzso zzso samples were measured by the rotating disk zzso The calculated zzso of zzso zzso prepared by heating was about zzso times higher than that of zzso zzso The phase transformation rate from the zzso form to the zzso during dissolution tests decreased with higher zzso zzso It was found that the zzso zzso prepared at different zzso temperatures transformed to the zzso by way of different growth of zzso zzso zzso
