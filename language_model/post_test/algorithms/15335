The second-generation zzso zzso zzso have shown superiority in many studies relating to safety and efficacy when compared with the first-generation zzso However, it is unclear whether there are differences in efficacy and safety among the second-generation zzso after long-term zzso 

This zzso zzso randomized, zzso trial will directly compare the efficacy and safety among the patients treated with either zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso with minimal exclusion zzso The primary end point is a zzso composite consisted of cardiac death, zzso zzso not clearly attributable to a zzso vessel and clinically indicated target zzso zzso at zzso clinical follow-up zzso zzso With the hypothesis that zzso is zzso to zzso or zzso is zzso to zzso in primary end point, approximately 2,600 patients will be assigned to one of the types of zzso using a zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso trial will directly compare the efficacy and safety of zzso zzso and zzso in everyday clinical practice for long-term zzso
