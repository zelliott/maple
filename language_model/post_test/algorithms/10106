zzso analysis has been proven useful in zzso areas, zzso to explore the dynamics and complexity of biological zzso zzso a set of networks allows zzso general knowledge about the underlying zzso and functional zzso The zzso analysis of networks typically combines networks from different studies that investigate the same or similar research zzso In order to perform an zzso analysis it is often necessary to compare the properties of matching edges across the data zzso This identification of common edges is often burdensome and zzso zzso Here, we present an approach that is different from zzso a new network based on common zzso Instead, we select one network as a graph prototype, which then represents a set of comparable network objects, as it has the least average distance to all other networks in the same zzso We demonstrate the usefulness of the graph zzso approach on a set of prostate cancer networks and a set of corresponding benign zzso We further show that the distances within the cancer group and the benign group are statistically different depending on the zzso distance zzso
