The correct zzso of anatomical structures is a critical component of zzso navigation systems, to guide the surgeon to the areas of interest as well as to avoid brain zzso A major challenge for zzso systems is the brain shift, or deformation of the exposed brain in comparison to zzso zzso zzso zzso image zzso In this work paper, a zzso deformation pipeline is proposed for brain shift compensation of zzso imaging zzso using superficial blood vessels as zzso The input was zzso and zzso zzso image sets of superficial vessel zzso The zzso vessels zzso using 3 zzso zzso were registered and aligned with zzso zzso zzso zzso vessel zzso using manual interaction for the rigid transformation and, for the zzso zzso the zzso point set registration method zzso Point zzso The rigid registration zzso the zzso points from the camera coordinate system to the zzso MR coordinate system, and the zzso registration deals with local transformations in the MR coordinate zzso Finally, the generation of a new zzso volume is achieved with the zzso zzso zzso method using as control points the matches in the MR coordinate system found in the previous zzso The method was tested in a rabbit brain exposed via zzso where zzso were produced by a balloon inserted into the zzso There was a good correlation between the real state of the brain and the zzso volume obtained using the zzso zzso zzso were approximately zzso zzso for the exposed brain alone, and zzso zzso after balloon zzso
