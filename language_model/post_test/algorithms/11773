zzso protein sequence data becomes increasingly important zzso Most previous work on this area has mainly focused on building zzso zzso In this paper, we investigate in the problem of automatic zzso of zzso protein zzso As a widely recognized technique in statistics and computer science, zzso has been proven very useful in detecting unknown object categories and revealing hidden correlations among zzso One difficulty that prevents zzso from being performed directly on protein sequence is the lack of an effective similarity measure that can be zzso zzso zzso we propose a novel model for protein sequence cluster by exploring significant statistical properties possessed by the zzso The concept of imprecise probabilities are introduced to the original zzso zzso tree to monitor the convergence of the empirical measurement and to guide the zzso zzso It has been demonstrated that the proposed method can successfully discover meaningful families without the necessity of learning models of different families from zzso zzso zzso
