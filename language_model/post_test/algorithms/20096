Many functional proteins do not have well defined folded zzso In recent years, both experimental and zzso approaches have been developed to study the zzso zzso of this type of zzso It has been shown previously that experimental zzso zzso zzso zzso can be used to study the backbone sampling of zzso proteins in some zzso In these studies, the backbone structure was zzso using a common geometry for all zzso zzso In the present paper, we demonstrate that experimental zzso are also sensitive to the specific geometry of each zzso acid as defined by zzso internal zzso We have modified the zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso ensembles on the basis of a statistical zzso model, to account for these zzso The modified zzso zzso the advantages of the zzso zzso to efficiently sample the potential energy landscape for zzso zzso The specific zzso incorporated in the new zzso result in a better reproduction of experimental zzso and are generally zzso for further studies to characterize the zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso is an order of magnitude more efficient, and zzso zzso construction, surface zzso zzso zzso distribution sampling and zzso zzso zzso zzso
