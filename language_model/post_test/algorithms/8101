zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso atoms in zzso zzso of proteins contain information on the orientation of bond zzso that is complementary to that contained in zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso between these atoms also display a zzso relation with the backbone zzso angles and report on secondary zzso However, these zzso zzso tend to be small and they are frequently zzso in frequency domain zzso having the broad lines characteristic of large zzso Here a zzso zzso approach for the measurement of small zzso zzso in large proteins is zzso The zzso interference effects inherent in zzso methods improve resolution and signal to noise ratios for large zzso and the use of zzso to zzso zzso eliminates the need to remove frequency zzso from overlapping zzso during data zzso The utility of the method is demonstrated by measurement of zzso zzso , and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso residual zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso protein bound to small zzso zzso a system with an effective zzso weight of approximately zzso
