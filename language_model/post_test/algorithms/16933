zzso the genes that change their expressions between two conditions (such as normal versus zzso is a crucial task that can help in understanding the causes of zzso zzso networking has emerged as a powerful approach to detect the changes in network structures and to identify the zzso connected genes among two zzso However, existing differential network-based methods primarily depend on zzso comparisons of the genes based on their zzso zzso these methods cannot capture the essential zzso changes in the network zzso In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, zzso which ranks the genes based on their contribution to the differences between the two zzso To achieve this goal, we define two novel structural scoring zzso a local structure measure zzso zzso and a global structure measure zzso zzso zzso These measures are zzso by zzso the scores through the network structure and then ranking the genes based on these zzso zzso We demonstrate the effectiveness of zzso on synthetic and real zzso For the synthetic zzso we developed a simulator for generating synthetic differential zzso networks, and we compared our method with existing zzso The comparisons show that our zzso zzso these existing zzso For the real zzso we apply the proposed zzso on several gene expression zzso and demonstrate that the proposed method provides biologically interesting zzso
