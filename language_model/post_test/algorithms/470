Through four zzso explicit models, we investigate how habitat fragmentation affects zzso zzso population zzso We use a zzso zzso zzso zzso framework to describe the zzso of predators and prey in a zzso landscape made of high quality and low quality habitat patches, subject to increasing fragmentation through habitat separation and/or habitat zzso Our results show that habitat fragmentation decreases the zzso of the zzso population cycles while average population density is not as strongly affected in zzso Beyond these simple trends however, the four models show differing responses to zzso indicating that when making predictions about population survival and persistence in the face of habitat zzso the choice of model is zzso Our results may inform conservation efforts in fragmented zzso for zzso species such as the zzso zzso and Canada zzso
