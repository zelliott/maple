A zzso based zzso zzso model was constructed for the disposition of zzso zzso in male rats and its induction of zzso of zzso zzso zzso The model included zzso delivery of zzso to compartments representing liver, zzso fat, zzso zzso zzso zzso rapidly zzso zzso and zzso slowly zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso was included for liver and zzso Rates of zzso zzso production and zzso by zzso zzso zzso were taken from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso was modeled with a zzso value corresponding to the measured zzso reduction in zzso efficiency and with free and bound forms of zzso competing for access to the zzso Increased zzso zzso of zzso into the kidney zzso zzso zzso A model that ascribed zzso zzso zzso solely to reduced zzso zzso failed to reproduce the observed zzso The model could reproduce experimental observations if a transient increase in zzso synthesis of zzso zzso by the presence of zzso zzso in the blood, and accelerated zzso of the protein from the liver were zzso This model reproduces time course data of blood and kidney zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso of zzso is not simply a consequence of reduced zzso degradation but may also involve a transient increase in zzso zzso zzso The model predicts increased delivery of zzso to the kidney and zzso increased zzso production of potentially toxic zzso zzso than would be the case if no zzso were zzso zzso zzso activity and increased production of toxic zzso may both contribute to the zzso observed in male rats exposed to an zzso zzso or its zzso
