zzso zzso of a zzso effect in an zzso clinical trial can be severely hindered when it has been chosen from a larger group of potential zzso This is because selection mechanisms that condition on the rank order of treatment statistics introduce zzso Nevertheless, designs of this sort are seen as a practical and efficient way to fast track the most promising compounds in drug zzso In this paper we extend the method of Cohen and zzso (1989) who proposed a zzso unbiased estimate for the best performing treatment at zzso This enables their estimate to work for unequal stage one and two sample sizes, and also when the quantity of interest is the best, second best, or zzso zzso best treatment out of zzso The implications of this new flexibility are explored via zzso
