zzso zzso zzso use zzso zzso among random variation and zzso find solutions to complex zzso Mostly used in engineering, zzso gain growing interest in ecology and zzso Here, we assess their usefulness in functional zzso introducing finite element zzso zzso as a simulated mechanical environment for evaluating the zzso of randomly varying zzso We used this method to identify zzso adaptations in bone zzso a long-lasting problem in skeletal zzso The zzso started with a bone tissue model containing randomly distributed vascular zzso The zzso randomly zzso the distribution of vascular spaces, and selected the new structure if its mechanical resistance was zzso After some thousands of generations, organized zzso emerged, containing vascular canals and zzso mimicking real bone tissue zzso This supported the hypothesis that natural bone zzso can result from zzso zzso Despite its limited zzso to reality, we discuss the ability of the zzso method to assess adaptation in a dynamic evolutionary zzso which is not possible in the real world because of the generation times of zzso We also point out the interesting potential of zzso to simulate not only adaptation, but also concurrent evolutionary zzso such as historical zzso
