The assessment of zzso effects of chemicals for regulatory purposes requires large amounts of experimental data which are expensive to obtain and eventually might entail exhaustive animal zzso The required decision-making processes in this regulatory context, must often be carried out with limited or even contradictory sources of zzso To benefit from all sources of information without compromising the quality of the decision process, uncertainty management and reduction techniques, such as the zzso theory of evidence, have to be zzso This theory was applied to both experimental and in zzso zzso data sources to assess chemical zzso zzso of the initially zzso uncertain estimates for zzso rates in water were reduced by as much as zzso The analysis showed that conflicting evidence can be zzso zzso and redistributed zzso among all the feasible zzso of zzso The advantages of the zzso theory over zzso approaches to represent evidence concerning hypotheses by assigning probabilities were also zzso
