A challenging task in zzso biology is the reconstruction of zzso sequences of extinct ancestors, given the zzso tree and the sequences at the zzso This task is best solved by calculating the most likely estimate of the ancestral zzso along with the most likely edge zzso We deal with this problem and also the zzso in which the zzso tree in addition to the ancestral sequences need to be zzso The latter problem is known to be zzso while the zzso complexity of the former is zzso Currently, all zzso for solving these problems are zzso without performance zzso The biological importance of these problems calls for developing better zzso with guarantees of finding either optimal or approximate zzso We develop zzso fix zzso zzso zzso and fast zzso zzso for two zzso of the problem; when the zzso tree is known and when it is zzso The approximation zzso guarantees a solution with a zzso ratio of 2 relative to the optimal zzso The zzso has a running time which is zzso in the length of the sequences and exponential in the number of zzso This makes it useful for calculating the optimal solution for small zzso Moreover, we combine the approximation zzso and the zzso into an zzso with arbitrary good approximation guarantee zzso We tested our zzso on both synthetic and biological zzso In particular, we used the zzso for computing the most likely ancestral zzso zzso of zzso (the great zzso thereby answering an interesting biological zzso Moreover, we show how the approximation zzso find good solutions for reconstructing the ancestral zzso for a set of zzso zzso of zzso zzso material of this work is available at zzso
