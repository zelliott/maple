Computer models of biological systems grow more complex as computing power zzso Often these models are defined as differential equations and no zzso solutions zzso zzso integration is used to approximate the zzso this can be zzso zzso time consuming and be a large proportion of the total computer zzso The performance of different integration methods depend on the mathematical properties of the differential equations system at zzso In this paper we investigate the possibility of zzso gains by calculating parts of or the whole differential equations system at given time zzso outside of the differential equations zzso This approach was tested on nine models defined as differential equations with the goal to reduce zzso while maintaining model fit, based on the objective function zzso The software used was zzso In four models the zzso zzso was successfully reduced (by zzso The differences in zzso estimates, compared to using only the differential equations solver were less than zzso for all fixed effects zzso For the zzso zzso estimates were within zzso for the majority of the zzso zzso and individual predictions were similar and the differences in zzso were between 1 and zzso zzso When zzso zzso seriously affects the usefulness of a model we suggest evaluating this approach for repetitive elements of model building and evaluation such as zzso inclusions or zzso
