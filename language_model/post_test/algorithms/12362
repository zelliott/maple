Current alarm systems in intensive care units create a very high rate of false positive alarms because most of them simply compare zzso zzso to fixed zzso An improvement can be expected when the actual zzso are replaced by smoothed estimates of the underlying zzso However, classical filtering procedures are not appropriate for signal zzso as standard zzso such as zzso do no hold here: the time series measured often show long periods without change, but also upward or downward trends, sudden shifts and numerous large measurement zzso Alternative approaches are needed to extract the relevant information from the data, zzso the underlying signal of the monitored variables and the relevant patterns of change, such as abrupt shifts and zzso This article reviews recent research on zzso online signal extraction methods designed for application in intensive zzso
