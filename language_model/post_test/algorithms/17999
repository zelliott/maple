We introduce a new approach to global data fitting based on a zzso condition that zzso continuity in the global data zzso zzso of the data fitting procedure comes from zzso constraint of the global solution to physically reasonable behavior rather than to specific models of the system zzso This method is zzso to the fitting of many types of zzso data including dynamic light zzso zzso zzso counting zzso and circular zzso We compare our method to traditional approaches to fitting an inverse zzso transform by examining the evolution of multiple lifetime components in synthetic zzso zzso The global zzso recovers features in the data that are not apparent from traditional zzso We show how our approach allows one to start from an essentially zzso fit and progress to a specific model by moving from zzso to deterministic constraints in both zzso transformed and zzso zzso
