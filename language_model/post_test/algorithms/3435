A novel synthetic process leading to the framework of zzso has been discovered and zzso The process is composed of two separate zzso the first of which is a partial reduction of the zzso groups of the zzso a process that we believe proceeds via a zzso mechanism to yield the zzso and zzso zzso In the following step the zzso takes place under formation of the zzso zzso We believe that this process take place via a radical mechanism through the zzso radical zzso The novel process zzso either zzso or zzso zzso both in high yields, zzso and zzso zzso To obtain zzso the reaction is conducted with an alcohol as zzso and an zzso as the base, while for zzso zzso water is used as zzso with sodium hydroxide as the zzso To establish the latter zzso statistical experimental design and zzso modeling were zzso to reveal the response surface for the reaction and to determine the optimal conditions for the zzso A proposal for the complex reaction mechanism is zzso During the corroboration of the zzso a new zzso reaction for converting zzso zzso into zzso was zzso The reaction is conducted by treating the zzso with sodium zzso at elevated temperature to achieve zzso conversion into zzso in a yield of zzso
