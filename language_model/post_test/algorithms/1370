The purpose of this work was to develop a new family of test zzso for computerized zzso threshold zzso which significantly reduces test time without any reduction of data zzso 

A comprehensive visual field model constructed from available knowledge of normal and zzso visual fields is continuously updated during zzso The model produces threshold estimates and also estimates of the certainty to which the threshold is known at each zzso Testing is interrupted at each test location at predetermined levels of threshold zzso New zzso methods are employed for zzso of false answers, and test pacing is zzso After completion of the test, all threshold estimates are zzso taking into account the complete body of patient zzso Computer simulations were used to zzso the different parameters of the new zzso to evaluate the relative importance of those zzso and to evaluate the performance of the zzso as a whole in comparison with a standard zzso 

zzso test results obtained with this zzso were slightly more accurate than those of the zzso Full zzso test zzso The number of simulated stimuli presented was reduced by an average of zzso in normal fields and zzso in zzso zzso zzso clinical test time should be further reduced, since the influence of the improved timing zzso was not included in the zzso 

We applied new methods which take available knowledge of visual field physiology and zzso into account, and employ modern zzso mathematical methods for real time estimates of threshold values and threshold error zzso In this way it was possible to design a family of testing zzso which significantly reduced zzso test time without any loss of quality in zzso
