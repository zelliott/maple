For zzso gene expression profiles or other types of medical data, simple rules are preferable to zzso distance or kernel zzso This is because rules may help us understand more about the application in addition to performing an accurate zzso In this paper, we discover novel rules that describe the gene expression profiles of more than six zzso of acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso We also introduce a new zzso named zzso to make effective use of the zzso zzso is accurate and can handle multiple parallel zzso We evaluate this method by zzso zzso zzso ALL zzso Our test error rate is competitive to that of support zzso machines, and it is zzso better than zzso 50% better than zzso zzso and zzso better than zzso zzso Experimental results on another independent data sets are also presented to show the strength of our zzso
