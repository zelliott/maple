Through the process of zzso the eye zzso response of the zzso zzso zzso can be reduced by prolonged exposure to a head zzso zzso In previous work, the goldfish zzso zzso at a single, low frequency zzso or zzso zzso zzso showed frequency specific effects at and near that frequency, and could be zzso when combined with a higher frequency zzso Here we show that the goldfish zzso exposed to prolonged rotation at two zzso in combination will still produce zzso at low frequency, and can exhibit effects specific to both zzso The zzso at a low frequency can be zzso if the combined component is switched to a different zzso These results demonstrate zzso and context specificity of zzso zzso
