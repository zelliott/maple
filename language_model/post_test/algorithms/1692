Some new effects in the zzso dynamics governed by higher order zzso zzso zzso equations are discussed based on the exact explicit solutions of the equations on the positive zzso The solutions describe the process of generation of a zzso that occurs without boundary forcing and on the steady state zzso the boundary conditions remain constant and the initial distribution is a steady state solution of the zzso The time moment when the zzso generation starts is not determined by the parameters present in the problem zzso the additional parameters zzso into the solution are needed to determine that zzso The equations found capable of describing those effects are the zzso zzso equation and the zzso zzso equation which, albeit not proven to be zzso possesses zzso zzso
