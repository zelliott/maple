zzso zzso and zzso zzso is perhaps the most fundamental problem to solve in zzso in order to build truly autonomous mobile zzso The sensors have a large impact on the zzso used for zzso Early zzso approaches focused on the use of range sensors as zzso rings or zzso However, cameras have become more and more used, because they yield a lot of information and are well adapted for embedded zzso they are light, cheap and power zzso Unlike range sensors which provide range and angular information, a camera is a zzso sensor which measures the bearing of images zzso Therefore depth information zzso cannot be obtained in a single zzso This fact has zzso the emergence of a new family of zzso zzso the zzso zzso methods, which mainly rely in zzso techniques for features zzso in order to enable the use of bearing sensors (as zzso in zzso zzso In this work a novel and robust method, called zzso zzso is presented which is inspired by having the complementary advantages of the zzso and Delayed methods that represent the most common approaches for addressing the zzso The key is to use zzso two kinds of feature representations for both zzso and delayed stages of the zzso The simulations results show that the proposed method zzso the performance of previous zzso
