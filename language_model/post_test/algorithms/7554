As one of the biggest challenges in research on zzso systems, the data zzso issue is mainly caused by the fact that users tend to rate a small proportion of items from the huge number of available zzso This issue becomes even more problematic for the neighborhood-based collaborative filtering zzso methods, as there are even lower numbers of ratings available in the neighborhood of the query zzso In this paper, we aim to address the data zzso issue in the context of neighborhood-based zzso For a given query zzso zzso a set of key ratings is first identified by taking the historical information of both the user and the item into zzso Then, an zzso zzso zzso method is proposed to zzso the missing values in the set of key zzso We present a theoretical analysis to show that the proposed zzso method effectively improves the performance of the conventional neighborhood-based zzso zzso The experimental results show that our new method of zzso with zzso zzso six existing recommendation methods in terms of zzso
