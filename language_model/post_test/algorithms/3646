The increasing use of zzso technologies is generating large amounts of data that must be processed in order to extract useful and rational fundamental patterns of gene zzso zzso zzso technology is one method used to analyze gene expression data, but traditional zzso zzso zzso suffer from several drawbacks zzso fixed zzso zzso zzso data which cannot be zzso In this paper, we introduce a new zzso zzso zzso that overcomes some of these zzso 

We propose a new zzso zzso neural network, called zzso growing zzso tree zzso zzso for zzso zzso The zzso zzso a hierarchy from top to bottom by zzso At each zzso level, the zzso zzso the number of zzso from which the proper zzso structure of the underlying zzso can be zzso In addition, we propose a new cluster validation criterion based on the geometric property of the zzso partition of the zzso in order to find the proper number of clusters at each zzso zzso This criterion uses the Minimum zzso Tree zzso concept of graph theory and is zzso inexpensive for large zzso A zzso up distribution zzso zzso which increases the scope of data distribution in the hierarchy construction, was used to improve the zzso zzso The zzso mechanism allows the data zzso in the early stages to be reevaluated at a later stage and increases the accuracy of the final zzso zzso The zzso result of the zzso is easily displayed as a zzso for zzso Based on a zzso cell cycle zzso expression zzso we found that our zzso extracts gene expression patterns at different zzso Furthermore, the biological functionality enrichment in the clusters is considerably high and the zzso structure of the clusters is more zzso
