A zzso mathematical computer model was used to develop a guidance graph for zzso zzso The model permitted variation in infusion rates, in zzso parameters and in zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed a relationship between the rate of recovery from a fixed zzso loading dose and the most appropriate initial infusion zzso This relationship was expressed as a guidance graph or zzso zzso The quality of guidance was assessed in 50 zzso given zzso In 39 patients optimal zzso block for surgery was maintained for the duration of the infusion without adjustments or supplementary zzso zzso The mean operating time was 92 zzso and the mean duration of infusion was 59 zzso
