We consider a network of imaging zzso We address the problem of energy-efficient communication of the zzso of the zzso A novel zzso is presented for the purpose of exploiting zzso and zzso zzso which is inherent in a network of imaging zzso The collaborative zzso is used in conjunction with a cooperative zzso zzso strategy to maximize the lifetime of the zzso The zzso is demonstrated to achieve an average gain in the lifetime as high as zzso over previous zzso
