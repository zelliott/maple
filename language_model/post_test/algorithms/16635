Most patients with liver zzso must undergo a series of clinical zzso including ultrasound imaging, liver zzso and blood zzso However, the zzso of liver zzso by zzso significant features from a zzso magnetic resonance image zzso provides useful diagnostic information in clinical zzso zzso subjects were randomly selected to participate in this retrospective analysis with assigned to experimental and control zzso The zzso zzso was obtained and to them dynamic adjusted gray zzso The extracted features of the image were standard zzso zzso mean, and zzso of zzso intensity in the region of interest zzso The receiver operator characteristic zzso curve, zzso confidence zzso and zzso statistics were used to test the significance and zzso The analysis of area under zzso shows that zzso mean, and zzso in the zzso were significant between the experimental group and the control zzso Smaller values of zzso mean, and zzso were associated with a higher probability of liver zzso The agreements between the extracted features and diagnostic results were shown significantly zzso zzso zzso In this investigation, quantitative features of zzso mean, and zzso in the zzso were successfully zzso by the dynamic gray level zzso of zzso zzso with high zzso
