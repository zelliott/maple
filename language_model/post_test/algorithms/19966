The present paper examines the zzso evolution of acoustic fields by modeling forward propagation subject to sea surface dynamics with time scales of less than a second to tens of zzso A zzso rough sea surface model is combined with a rough surface zzso of a zzso equation model for predicting zzso acoustic zzso Surface waves are generated from surface wave zzso and stepped in time using a zzso integration technique applied to linear evolution zzso This evolving, zzso surface information is combined with other environmental parameters and input to the acoustic model, giving an approximation of the zzso acoustic zzso The wide-angle zzso equation model manages the rough sea surfaces by molding them into the boundary conditions for calculations of the zzso acoustic zzso This merged acoustic model is validated using zzso acoustic and environmental information, including surface wave zzso Data to model comparisons demonstrate that the model is able to approximate the zzso acoustic intensity at ranges of about a zzso for acoustic signals of around 15 zzso Furthermore, the model is shown to capture variations due to surface fluctuations occurring over time scales of less than a second to tens of zzso
