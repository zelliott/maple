For the zzso of medical signals such as zzso zzso excellent reconstruction quality of a highly compressed signal can be obtained by using a zzso zzso The most widely used objective quality criterion for the compressed zzso is called the percent of zzso difference zzso In this paper, given a zzso zzso an zzso is proposed to meet the zzso demand by searching for an appropriate bit rate in an zzso smooth, and fast manner for the zzso zzso The bit rate searching is modeled as a zzso problem for a one-dimensional function, where an unknown zzso curve represents the function and the desired rate is the root to be zzso A solution derived from zzso methods in zzso analysis is zzso The proposed solution is incorporated in a well-known zzso coding strategy called set zzso in zzso zzso zzso signals taken from the zzso database are tested, and excellent results in terms of convergence speed, quality variation, and coding performance are zzso
