The analysis of zzso zzso resonance energy transfer zzso zzso has become one of significant zzso zzso In zzso the transition rates between various states of a system for zzso data, researchers have relied on simple, but often arbitrary methods of zzso rates from zzso zzso Although these methods have proven satisfactory in cases of zzso zzso two- or zzso systems, they become less reliable when applied to a system of greater zzso We have developed an analysis scheme that casts zzso zzso zzso zzso as hidden zzso zzso allowing one to zzso based on probability alone, the most likely zzso zzso of states and their zzso rates while simultaneously determining the most likely time sequence of underlying states for each zzso Together with a transition density plot and zzso information criterion we can also determine the number of different states present in a system in addition to the zzso transition zzso Here we present the zzso and test its limitations with various simulated data and previously reported Holliday junction zzso The zzso is then applied to the analysis of the binding and zzso of three zzso zzso on a DNA zzso
