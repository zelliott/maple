In this article we apply some zzso results to the study of zzso in a structured population with zzso The graph is the pattern of migration among zzso or zzso and we use the theory of random walks on zzso to characterize the ease with which ancestral lineages can traverse the habitat in a series of migration zzso We identify conditions under which the zzso process in populations with restricted migration, such that individuals cannot traverse the habitat freely in a single migration event, nonetheless becomes identical to the zzso process in the island migration model in the limit as the number of zzso tends to zzso Specifically, we first note that a sequence of zzso zzso with zzso constant bounded above has an zzso zzso zzso in the limit for a sample of size two from two different zzso We then show that circular and zzso models with long-range but restricted migration have an upper bound on this constant and so have an zzso zzso in the zzso We investigate the rate of convergence to this limit using zzso
