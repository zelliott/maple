zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in detecting zzso zzso 8 zzso and acute zzso 24 zzso cerebral zzso is zzso We propose an automatic method to detect and zzso zzso zzso and to assess its volume from a single zzso zzso 

The method automatically determines zzso value ranges of zzso fluid and white and gray matter, separates the brain scan into the left and right zzso and by analyzing zzso zzso value zzso using zzso difference ratios, it zzso zzso and zzso the zzso without its zzso The method performance was evaluated on zzso patients with clinically confirmed stroke through zzso scans acquired at 4 centers to measure how it matched with that of experts in zzso zzso and assessment of zzso zzso The time from the onset of symptoms ranged from zzso to 72 hours for 450 scans and more than 72 hours for 82 scans, most with zzso findings in addition to cerebral zzso the time was unavailable for 44 zzso In addition, the method was compared with the zzso (with 52 zzso and experienced readers' zzso detection (with 21 zzso 2 zzso in early zzso detection (with the time from the onset of symptoms ranging from zzso to 7 zzso 

The method matches zzso the zzso zzso detection when chronic zzso zzso cases, and zzso volumes less than 2 zzso zzso by detection accuracy zzso are excluded from the zzso For all cases excluding zzso volumes less than 2 zzso the method detection accuracy is zzso Overall, the method detection accuracy is zzso The early method detection accuracy zzso 3 zzso is zzso The novice detection accuracy is zzso zzso 3 hours), zzso (3 zzso to zzso 8 hours), and zzso zzso 8 hours), whereas the expert detection accuracy for these cases is zzso Moreover, the method detected all 21 early zzso of which 15 were missed by the stroke experts and 14 of 15 were missed by a general zzso The method performs automatic analysis in approximately 7 zzso 

The results demonstrate potential benefits of our method for enhancing zzso performance because it quickly zzso the zzso and detects cases missed by experts, and it is to be considered as an aid in the emergency department because it substantially zzso novice readers zzso vs zzso in zzso detection on zzso
