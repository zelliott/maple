The Dam zzso zzso activity, broadly distributed in association with restriction zzso as part of the zzso defense systems, has evolved to become intimately associated with essential biological functions in a few zzso In zzso coli, zzso is involved in multiple aspects of DNA zzso replication zzso daughter zzso zzso DNA mismatch repair, gene expression control, zzso The participation of zzso in such a diverse set of functions required that other genes zzso or emerged through evolution, in response to the zzso modification of the zzso zzso One example is zzso a protein that senses the zzso status of the origin of replication of the zzso to control the timing of replication zzso Interestingly, zzso is only present in a few zzso zzso This observation led us to zzso that other zzso specifying related functions, might also be found in these zzso To test this hypothesis, we implemented a large-scale comparative zzso screen meant to identify genes specifying DNA zzso sensing zzso probably involved in DNA maintenance zzso 

We carried out a zzso analysis of zzso identifying two contrasting behaviors of the zzso Based on this zzso we defined precisely a set of zzso in which the protein activity is likely to be involved in DNA maintenance functions, the zzso dam zzso We defined a second set of zzso in which zzso is not zzso We zzso a new zzso zzso in order to screen these two sets for protein zzso that are strictly associated with zzso dam zzso This approach was rewarding and generated a list of zzso among which some, at least, specify activities with clear linkage to zzso DNA zzso and DNA zzso 

zzso is implemented as a web resource and is accessible at zzso
