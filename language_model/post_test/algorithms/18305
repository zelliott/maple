zzso in zzso zzso and zzso the genes that zzso the zzso zzso component collagen zzso lead to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso muscular zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso is difficult to diagnose because of its clinical overlap with other zzso zzso and the lack of sensitivity of standard muscle biopsy zzso diagnostic zzso 

We zzso two potential techniques for the diagnosis of zzso dual zzso zzso for collagen VI and zzso zzso zzso in muscle, and zzso labeling of collagen VI in skin zzso zzso cultures, which was conducted in 40 patients by blinded investigators and correlated with genetic zzso 

zzso IF was indistinguishable from normal controls in most zzso zzso However, abnormalities in the IF labeling pattern of collagen VI were detected in more than zzso of genetically confirmed zzso patient zzso cell zzso In addition, in a group of patients with unknown diagnosis studied zzso the zzso IF technique was highly zzso of the presence of a zzso zzso providing a positive zzso value of zzso a sensitivity and negative zzso value of zzso and a specificity of zzso 

zzso labeling of collagen VI in zzso cultures is a useful addition to current diagnostic services for zzso zzso zzso It can be used to guide molecular genetic testing, the gold standard diagnostic technique for zzso in a cost-effective and zzso zzso
