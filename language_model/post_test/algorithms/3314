To derive and validate a clinical prediction model with high sensitivity for zzso zzso meningitis zzso patients from bacterial meningitis zzso zzso 

We developed the model using the derivation cohort in a community rural hospital in Okinawa and assessed its performance using the validation cohort in a metropolitan urban hospital in zzso There were 66 zzso and 5 zzso adult patients with zzso among the derivation zzso and the validation cohort zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to determine the important zzso variables and to develop a sensitive model to safely exclude zzso 

The model produced zzso and low-risk groups based on the zzso 1) Gram zzso 2) zzso zzso percent zzso or zzso 3) zzso zzso count zzso or zzso zzso and, 4) mental status zzso Among the derivation zzso there were 65 patients with zzso in the high-risk group zzso while only one patient with zzso was noted zzso zzso in the low-risk group zzso Among the validation zzso there were 5 patients with zzso in the high-risk group zzso while no patient was classified with zzso zzso zzso in the low-risk group zzso 

This simple and sensitive model might be useful to safely identify low-risk patients for zzso who would not require zzso zzso
