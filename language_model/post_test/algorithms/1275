A zzso three-dimensional coupled zzso dynamics model was developed for a generic zzso zzso valve in a rigid zzso root graft with zzso zzso zzso geometry was based on that of the natural zzso Blood flow was modeled as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The structural model accounted for material and geometric zzso and also simulated leaflet zzso A body fitted grid was used to zzso the flow domain into zzso finite volume zzso Shell finite elements were used to zzso the leaflet zzso A finite volume zzso fluid dynamics code and finite element structure dynamics code were used to solve the flow and structure zzso zzso The fluid flow and structural equations were coupled using an implicit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso pressure zzso were prescribed as the flow boundary zzso The zzso flow field, valve structural zzso and leaflet stresses were zzso at 2 zzso zzso Model predictions on zzso flow and transient variation in valve orifice area were in close agreement with corresponding experimental in zzso zzso These findings suggest that the computer model has potential for being a powerful design tool for zzso zzso zzso
