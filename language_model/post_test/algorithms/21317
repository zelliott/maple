Two new zzso 4 and 5, of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso These compounds, which span the zzso binding zzso of the zzso were derived by replacing the zzso zzso unit of a good zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso 5, zzso is an extremely potent inhibitor of zzso with a Ki value less than 1 zzso This result is consistent with the proposal that zzso functions as a zzso replacement for a zzso zzso zzso zzso 4, which contains His at zzso is 2 orders of magnitude less active than the zzso analogue 5 zzso zzso 150 zzso The factor for the decrease in binding to zzso zzso by replacement of Val by His at zzso parallels the ratio of zzso vs zzso zzso group in zzso 4 at pH 4, according to the zzso zzso This result suggests that a positively charged side chain at zzso is zzso for maximum zzso zzso zzso zzso for several known zzso of zzso and zzso are presented that demonstrate that the effect of His incorporation at zzso on zzso zzso depends upon the zzso sequence and that the effect is considerably different for zzso zzso We further suggest that the high selectivity of potent zzso zzso known to be only weak zzso and zzso D zzso is due in part to the extent of zzso zzso at zzso arising from pH differences in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso compared to other zzso zzso zzso pH zzso
