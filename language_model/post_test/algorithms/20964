Several zzso and zzso parameters have been considered for the quantitative assessment of the vascular architecture, using a variety of test specimens and of zzso zzso The zzso parameters have the advantage of being scale zzso zzso to be independent of the zzso and resolution of the images to be investigated, making easier the comparison among different zzso and zzso 

The success of several commercial and/or free codes in computing the zzso parameters has been tested on well known exact zzso Based on such a preliminary study, we selected the code zzso in order to analyze images obtained by visualizing the zzso process occurring in chick zzso zzso zzso zzso assumed to be zzso of a realistic zzso vascular zzso Among the parameters investigated, the zzso dimension zzso proved to be the most robust zzso for zzso vascular zzso Moreover, only zzso was able to discriminate between effective and elusive increases in zzso after drug-induced zzso zzso on zzso 

The zzso dimension zzso is likely to be the most promising tool for monitoring the effectiveness of zzso therapies in various clinical zzso
