We present a method called zzso for zzso energetic and structural parameters in zzso models, including zzso energy functions, when native structures and zzso are zzso The present method goes beyond previous approaches in treating energy functions that are zzso in the parameters and continuous in the degrees of zzso We illustrate the method by improving zzso parameters in the energy function zzso which consists of the zzso polar hydrogen force field zzso by a zzso zzso zzso Although the published parameters for zzso correctly discriminate the native from zzso in the decoy sets of Levitt et zzso they fail on several of the more difficult decoy sets of Baker et zzso zzso successfully finds improved parameters that allow zzso to discriminate native from decoy structures on all protein structures that do not have metals or prosthetic zzso
