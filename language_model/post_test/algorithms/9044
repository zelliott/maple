Human zzso is a zzso zzso tissue with a zzso composite zzso Few studies have focused on the zzso property relationship and its link to the zzso architecture of human zzso zzso the response to mechanical loading is affected not only by the rod distribution at zzso but also strongly influenced by the mineral zzso shape, and spatial arrangement and zzso In this study, two complementary zzso X-ray zzso techniques, wide and small angle X-ray scattering zzso were used to obtain zzso quantitative information about the structure and deformation response of human zzso to in zzso zzso zzso zzso The apparent zzso was determined linking the external load and the internal strain in zzso zzso zzso An improved zzso zzso model is proposed taking into account the zzso zzso structure of zzso This framework has been used to zzso the experimental data for the elastic lattice strain evolution within the zzso zzso The achieved agreement between the model prediction and experiment along the loading direction zzso the model and suggests that the new zzso approach reasonably captures the zzso relationship for the human zzso The ability of the model to predict zzso strain components is also evaluated by comparison with the zzso The results are useful for understanding the intricate relationship between the zzso structure and the mechanical properties of zzso and for making predictions of the effect of structural zzso that may occur due to the disease or treatment on the performance of dental zzso and their artificial zzso
