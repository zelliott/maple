We describe novel computer zzso for zzso sometimes virtually instantaneous generation of trial sequences needed to instrument many behavioral research zzso zzso on typical zzso or laptop computers, the zzso impose constraints to zzso development of zzso stimulus control by position, recent trial zzso and other variables that could impede simple and conditional discrimination zzso They yield zzso lists of sequences that can serve zzso as zzso to procedure control software or zzso in generating templates for constructing sessions for zzso by hand or zzso
