This paper proposes an zzso method to detect zzso of hydrated zzso alcohol fuel based on near infrared zzso and middle infrared zzso zzso associated with supervised pattern recognition zzso For this purpose, linear zzso analysis zzso was employed to build a zzso model on the basis of a reduced subset of zzso For variable selection, three techniques are considered, namely the successive projection zzso zzso the genetic zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso For comparison, models based on partial least squares zzso analysis zzso were also employed using zzso The method was validated in a case study involving the zzso of 181 hydrated zzso alcohol fuel samples, which were divided into three different zzso zzso authentic zzso zzso samples adulterated with water and zzso samples contaminated with zzso zzso and zzso models were found to be the best methods for zzso the spectral data obtained in zzso region, which achieved a correct prediction rate of zzso in the test set, while the zzso and zzso were correctly classified at zzso and zzso zzso For zzso data, all models zzso and zzso coupled with the zzso zzso and zzso employed in this study correctly classified all samples in the test zzso
