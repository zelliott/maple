The heavy metal zzso interaction is an important research topic in environmental and zzso zzso The presence of the silver zzso zzso may influence the formation of zzso intermediate and the zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso since zzso can interact with zzso at the binding sites which are involved in the zzso zzso reaction of zzso According to this principle, a new zzso sensor for indirectly detecting zzso based on the interaction of zzso with isolated zzso base using differential pulse zzso zzso was zzso Among the heavy metal zzso zzso only zzso showed the strongest zzso effect on the zzso zzso of zzso at the zzso carbon zzso modified glassy carbon zzso zzso And the quantitative study of zzso based on zzso sensing system gave a linear range from 100 zzso to zzso zzso with a detection limit of 30 zzso In addition, this modified zzso had very good zzso and zzso The developed zzso method is an ideal tool for zzso detection with some merits including remarkable zzso low-cost, and no requirement for probe zzso
