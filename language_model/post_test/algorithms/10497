This paper proposes a framework for detecting the suspected abnormal region of the zzso wall via magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso features are zzso First, the zzso wall is divided into several zzso based on which a path from each zzso on the inner border to the outer border is zzso By using the path length to measure the wall thickness and a bent rate zzso term to measure the geometry property of the zzso on the inner border, the seed zzso representing the abnormalities on the inner border are zzso Then, by tracing the path from each seed, a weighted zzso term is constructed to determine the suspected zzso which are on the path and inside the zzso zzso All the suspected zzso are grouped together for the abnormal zzso This work is significantly different from most of the previous zzso zzso tumor detection reports on two zzso First of all, the T zzso MR images are used which give better image contrast and texture information for the zzso wall, comparing with the zzso zzso zzso Second, while most previous reports detected the abnormalities and indicated them on the reconstructed 3-D zzso model by surface zzso we further determine the possible region of the zzso inside the zzso zzso This study aims at a zzso procedure for zzso tumor detection and abnormal region zzso which has the potential for further clinical analysis such as the invasion depth of the tumor and virtual zzso zzso Five zzso including two patients and three volunteers were used to test the presented method, all the tumors were detected by the method, and the overlap rates of the regions delineated by the computer against the experts were zzso The results demonstrated the potential of the method for detecting zzso wall abnormal regions via MR zzso
