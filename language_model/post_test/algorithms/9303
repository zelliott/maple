zzso the unknown material parameters of intact zzso zzso can be challenging due to highly zzso material zzso Previous studies combining a zzso zzso procedure with finite element analysis zzso were limited to two-dimensional zzso models or simplified three-dimensional zzso zzso Here we present a novel scheme to estimate unknown material parameters for zzso zzso by combining a genetic zzso zzso with zzso finite element zzso This approach systematically explores the domain of the material zzso The objective function to minimize was the error between simulated strain data and finite element model zzso The proposed scheme was validated for a zzso problem using a realistic material law for zzso zzso zzso material parameters were generally within zzso of the true zzso To demonstrate the zzso of the new zzso unknown material parameters were also determined for a realistic zzso heart model with an exponential zzso material zzso When using strains from two material points, the zzso zzso to parameters within zzso of the true zzso We conclude that the proposed scheme is robust when zzso zzso material parameters in zzso and zzso zzso
