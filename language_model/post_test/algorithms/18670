zzso and zzso energies are important for defining protein stability, structural zzso and molecular zzso Because these energies are difficult to zzso quickly and accurately, they are often ignored or modeled very zzso in zzso protein zzso To address this problem, we have developed a simple, fast, and accurate approximation for calculating Born zzso in the context of protein design zzso When these approximate Born zzso are used with the generalized Born zzso zzso model, energies calculated by the zzso slower finite difference zzso model are faithfully zzso A similar approach can be used for zzso zzso surface areas zzso As an independent test, we show that these approximations can be used to accurately predict the zzso determined zzso of zzso zzso groups from 15 zzso
