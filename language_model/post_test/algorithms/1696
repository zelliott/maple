We present an zzso for automatically predicting the zzso family of any zzso three-way zzso given only the information from the secondary zzso the sequence and the zzso zzso The parameters of the zzso have been determined on a data set of 33 three-way junctions whose zzso zzso is zzso We applied the zzso on 53 other junctions and compared the predictions to the real shape of those zzso We show that the correct answer is selected out of nine possible zzso zzso of the zzso Additionally, these results are noticeably improved if zzso information is zzso The resulting software, zzso is available online and downloadable (with zzso at: zzso
