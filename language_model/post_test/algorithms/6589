To examine the age-related and zzso rates and zzso of change in zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in older zzso adults, taking into account zzso to the zzso 

Prospective cohort study from Rancho zzso California, zzso 

Plasma for zzso was collected at baseline and 10-14 years later from 242 men and zzso zzso women (age range, zzso zzso who were not taking hormone therapy or zzso zzso and zzso changes in zzso were calculated according to four different definitions of change: absolute change, annual percentage change, change exceeding zzso of baseline and change exceeding that expected from statistical zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso change were assessed using zzso zzso 

zzso zzso levels were higher for men than women zzso means, zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, zzso with more pronounced declines observed in men zzso compared with women zzso zzso Some zzso of women and zzso of men had zzso levels that increased or stayed the same according to a zzso definition of zzso When zzso to the mean artifact was accounted for, only zzso of women and zzso of men showed true increases in zzso In both zzso baseline zzso levels accounted for three-quarters of the zzso in absolute zzso change over time, with higher baseline levels resulting in greater zzso Sex, baseline weight, age and smoking status were significantly associated with zzso change in zzso zzso only sex remained independently associated with zzso change in zzso zzso with men showing greater annual declines than women zzso zzso zzso 

In this sample, over zzso of the observed changes in zzso could be attributed to zzso to the zzso Potential underlying mechanisms of change in zzso levels, and sex differences, are zzso
