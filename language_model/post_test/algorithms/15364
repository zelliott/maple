This study addresses the zzso and simulation of blood collection for fixed blood collection sites in a zzso large French city, as well as mobile blood collection in urban and rural zzso 

zzso zzso net models were used to describe all relevant donor flows of the various blood collection zzso the zzso net models were converted onto zzso simulation models, allowing the evaluation of a large number of scenarios and zzso of blood collection zzso zzso models were proposed that zzso all components of the blood collection systems, such as the donor arrival process, resource capacities and performance zzso zzso experimental designs and zzso analyses were used to determine the best zzso of human resources and donor appointment zzso 

The donor service level depended on both adequate human resources capacity and appropriate appointment zzso These decisions depend on the distribution during the day of walk-in zzso 

Models permit to improve management of blood zzso they have now partially entered the real situation, awaiting further zzso
