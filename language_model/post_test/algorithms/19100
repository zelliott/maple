The widespread use of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in practical applications motivates the development of zzso theoretical approaches to improve fundamental understanding of the behavior of these complex zzso systems and to facilitate the design and zzso of new zzso and zzso zzso This paper is the first of two articles introducing a new computer zzso zzso zzso zzso The two articles explore the application of computer simulation zzso methods to zzso the thermodynamics associated with mixed zzso and zzso zzso formation in zzso zzso In this paper zzso 1 of the zzso a theoretical approach is introduced to use computer simulation zzso methods to zzso the zzso change associated with changing zzso composition zzso to as zzso In this approach, experimental critical zzso concentration zzso data, or a molecular zzso model of zzso formation, is first used to evaluate the free energy associated with single zzso zzso zzso formation, zzso in which the single zzso zzso contains only zzso A zzso An zzso approach is proposed to combine the estimated value of zzso with zzso estimates of zzso based on computer simulation to determine the optimal free energy of mixed zzso formation, the optimal zzso zzso number and zzso and the optimal bulk solution zzso After introducing the zzso modeling zzso a variety of zzso methods are briefly zzso and the selection of the zzso integration zzso method is justified and selected to implement the zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso is proposed to allow evaluation of the zzso change associated with exchanging a zzso A zzso with a zzso B zzso through zzso zzso In article 2 of this series, the zzso of the zzso model to make zzso zzso predictions for several zzso systems is discussed, and the predictions of the zzso model are compared with the zzso predictions of a molecular zzso model fitted to relevant experimental zzso
