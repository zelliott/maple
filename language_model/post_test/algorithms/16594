To zzso the causes of zzso artifacts with the zzso technique and clarify the effective suppression zzso 

We separately observed the zzso artifacts of zzso from features inside and then outside the defined zzso zzso using phantom zzso The effectiveness of suppressing them with phase zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso Finally, our observations were confirmed for a healthy zzso 

zzso zzso artifacts were observed from both inside and outside the zzso Those from inside the zzso were sufficiently suppressed by using a zzso of zzso considering the acquisition time zzso Those from outside the zzso were nearly suppressed using SAT outside the zzso without selecting needless receiver zzso zzso artifacts on the zzso images of the head and neck with a healthy volunteer were completely suppressed by a combination of using a zzso of zzso and using SAT on all four sides outside the zzso 

The characteristic zzso artifacts of zzso are caused from both inside and outside the defined zzso They can be effectively suppressed by a combination of using a zzso of zzso and using SAT on all four sides outside the zzso
