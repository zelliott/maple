One of the main degrading factors in the quality of zzso PET images of the zzso and upper abdomen is respiratory motion of zzso One method to reduce this effect is the acquisition of PET data in gated zzso A second method is the correction of studies for zzso Motion registration is essential in both zzso We report a method using zzso data to detect the zzso zzso movement of zzso and abdominal zzso without using any external gating zzso The aim of this study was to show the feasibility of applying this method to patient zzso 

For 10 patients with zzso in the lung or upper abdominal zzso images for short time bins of zzso 500, and 750 zzso were zzso A volume of interest, which was manually defined in a summed image around the structure of interest, was projected to each time zzso The center of mass of the activity distribution in this volume of interest was determined for each zzso The zzso of the zzso of the center of mass zzso over the time were analyzed and compared with zzso zzso obtained by a pressure-sensitive zzso 

In 7 of the 10 patients, movement of the zzso was registered in good accordance with the pressure zzso In the 3 remaining patients, no changes in the center of mass due to zzso could be zzso most likely because of minimal respiratory zzso The zzso difference in zzso for a zzso that was detected within the zzso acquisition was zzso zzso For 7 of the 10 patients, the mean value for each zzso zzso was between zzso and zzso zzso 

We have shown the feasibility of registering movement of zzso zzso without the use of any external device that may restrain the zzso Furthermore, unlike external sensors, this method zzso internal motion and, thus, is a promising base for correction zzso
