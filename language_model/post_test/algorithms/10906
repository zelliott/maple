zzso retinal zzso cells zzso of the cat are classified as either zzso or zzso according to their response to zzso The cell bodies of these zzso and off-center zzso are zzso distributed into regular patterns, known as retinal zzso In this paper, we investigate the nature of spatial zzso between the positioning of zzso and off-center zzso by zzso maps of zzso and simulating these zzso We introduce zzso approaches to zzso zzso along with zzso techniques to evaluate different zzso zzso constraints between cells zzso and zzso are assumed to be controlled by two zzso interaction functions and one zzso interaction zzso By making different assumptions on the shape of the zzso interaction function, we can compare the hypothesis of statistical independence against the alternative hypothesis of functional independence, where interactions between type are limited to preventing zzso zzso Our findings suggest that the mosaics of zzso and off-center beta zzso are likely to be generated assuming functional independence between the two zzso By contrast, allowing a more general form of zzso interaction function did not improve the likelihood of generating the observed zzso zzso and off-center beta zzso are therefore likely to be positioned subject only to zzso constraints and the physical constraint that no two zzso of opposite type can occupy the same zzso
