While global breast cancer gene expression data sets have considerable zzso in terms of their data content, the populations that they represent and the data collection methods zzso can be quite zzso We sought to assess the extent and consequence of these systematic differences with respect to identifying clinically significant zzso zzso 

We zzso how effectively zzso zzso employing randomly generated sets of genes could segregate tumors into zzso groups using four zzso breast cancer data zzso 

Using a common set of 5,000 randomly generated lists zzso zzso the percentages of clusters with significant differences in zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso Cancer zzso Wang, zzso and zzso data sets, zzso Among zzso positive tumors, the percentages were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Few random lists were zzso among zzso negative tumors in any data zzso zzso was associated with zzso status and, after globally adjusting for the effects of zzso gene zzso the percentages were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The impact of adjusting for zzso status depended on the extent of zzso between zzso gene expression and markers of zzso 

It is highly probable to identify a statistically significant association between a given gene list and prognosis in the zzso zzso due to its large sample size and the zzso between zzso expression and markers of zzso In most respects, the zzso data set generated similar outcomes as the zzso data set, although its smaller sample size led to fewer statistically significant zzso
