This paper introduces a learning zzso that can be used for training reformulated zzso basis function neural networks zzso capable of identifying uncertainty in data zzso This learning zzso trains a special class of reformulated zzso known as zzso zzso by updating selected adjustable parameters to minimize the zzso zzso at the zzso of their zzso basis functions zzso The experiments verify that quantum neural networks zzso and zzso zzso trained by the proposed learning zzso are capable of identifying uncertainty in data zzso a property that is not shared by zzso zzso trained by the original learning zzso and conventional zzso neural networks zzso Finally, this study leads to a simple zzso strategy that can be used to improve the zzso accuracy of zzso and zzso zzso by rejecting ambiguous feature zzso based on their zzso
