Previous studies in patients with multiple sclerosis zzso revealed increased zzso count and volume on 3 T compared to zzso zzso zzso and spatial zzso characteristics between zzso T and 3 T have not been zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of changing from a zzso T to a 3 T zzso scanner on the number, volume and spatial distribution of signal abnormalities zzso on brain zzso in a sample of zzso patients and normal controls zzso using zzso and zzso comparison zzso zzso zzso zzso patients (32 zzso and 9 zzso and 38 NC were examined on both zzso T and 3 T within one week in random zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were outlined zzso by two operators in a blinded fashion on zzso T and 3 T zzso zzso zzso distribution was assessed using zzso and zzso zzso zzso probability maps zzso zzso analysis examined the proportion of zzso not simultaneously outlined on zzso T and 3 zzso A zzso zzso analysis was conducted to examine the zzso identifications of zzso between the zzso T and 3 zzso For zzso zzso and zzso a higher number and individual volume of zzso were detected on 3 T compared to zzso T zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the likelihood of missing zzso on zzso T was significantly higher for smaller zzso in both zzso and NC zzso zzso probability map zzso analysis revealed significantly more regionally distinct spatial zzso differences on 3 T compared to zzso T in both groups zzso these were most pronounced in the zzso zzso and cortical regions for zzso This study provides important information regarding zzso and spatial differences between data acquired using zzso T and 3 T protocols at the two scanner field zzso
