zzso zzso analysis zzso is a commonly used method for zzso zzso In its general form, it seeks a zzso projection that simultaneously zzso the zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso to increase class zzso In real-world applications where labeled data are scarce, zzso may not work very zzso However, zzso data are often available in large quantities at very low zzso In this paper, we propose a novel zzso zzso which is zzso as zzso generalized zzso analysis zzso We zzso zzso data to maximize an zzso criterion of zzso and formulate the problem as an zzso problem that is solved using the constrained zzso zzso The zzso procedure leads to zzso of the class labels for the zzso zzso We propose a novel confidence measure and a method for selecting those zzso data points whose labels are estimated with high zzso The selected zzso data can then be used to augment the original labeled zzso for performing zzso We also propose a zzso of zzso called zzso which adopts the zzso assumption to zzso the zzso zzso zzso experiments on many benchmark zzso demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed zzso
