zzso zzso zzso systems, such as those needed to image extrasolar zzso are known to require excellent zzso control and zzso zzso The Laboratory for zzso zzso at UC Santa Cruz is investigating limits to zzso imaging in support of the zzso Planet zzso zzso In this paper we examine the effect of heat sources in the zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso a heat source primarily introduces image zzso The zzso error budget requires image motion to be less than zzso zzso zzso zzso motion of the zzso core is typically zzso zzso zzso zzso and with a 20 watt heat source introduced near the zzso plane image motion is increased to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso even a heat source as large as 20 zzso near the zzso plane causes errors below the zzso requirement, but the combination of the heat source and additional air turbulence on the system introduced by changes to the zzso or the fan of other components can produce significantly more zzso Heat also can affect the zzso pattern in the zzso region, but in the final instrument other sources of error should be more zzso
