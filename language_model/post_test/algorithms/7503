In this work we formulate vessel zzso on zzso CT zzso images as a zzso tracking zzso To obtain zzso probability zzso of vessel location, we employ sequential zzso Carlo tracking and propose a new vessel zzso method by fusing multiple cues extracted from CT zzso These cues include intensity, zzso organ zzso and bridge information for poorly enhanced segments from global path zzso By fusing local and global information for vessel zzso we achieved high accuracy and zzso with significantly improved precision compared to a traditional zzso method zzso zzso zzso Our method was applied to the zzso of the marginal artery of the zzso a small bore vessel of potential importance for colon zzso and CT zzso Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed zzso
