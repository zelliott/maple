zzso muscle wasting is common and insidious in patients who receive maintenance zzso treatment for the management of zzso The objective of this study was to determine whether 12 zzso of zzso progressive resistance training zzso administered during routine zzso treatment could improve skeletal muscle quantity and quality versus usual zzso zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso on zzso were recruited from the zzso zzso unit of the zzso George Public Hospital zzso zzso Patients were zzso to zzso + usual care zzso zzso 24) or usual care control only zzso zzso zzso The zzso group performed two sets of 10 exercises at a high intensity (15 to zzso on the zzso zzso using free zzso three times per week for 12 zzso during routine zzso zzso zzso outcomes included thigh muscle quantity zzso area zzso and quality zzso zzso content via zzso evaluated by zzso zzso zzso Secondary outcomes included muscle strength, exercise capacity, body circumference measures, zzso zzso zzso zzso and quality of zzso There was no statistically significant difference in muscle zzso change between zzso However, there were statistically significant improvements in muscle zzso muscle strength, zzso and zzso zzso body weight, and zzso protein in the zzso group relative to the zzso control zzso These findings suggest that patients with zzso can improve skeletal muscle quality and derive other zzso adaptations solely by engaging in a zzso high-intensity zzso regimen during routine zzso treatment zzso zzso training zzso or more sensitive analysis techniques may be required to document zzso in muscle zzso
