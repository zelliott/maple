Parallel zzso is a commonly used method for increasing the frame rate in ultrasound imaging zzso By receiving in several directions for each transmission, the frame rate is zzso However, this method also introduces zzso artifacts in the zzso image, due to the reception zzso when compared with the transmission zzso The synthetic transmit beam technique zzso has been previously proposed as a compensation technique when addressing these zzso Previous work by zzso et zzso investigated the performance of this method in regard to the case of 2 parallel beams in tissue mimicking zzso without zzso This study is a continuation of that work in which this method is tested in an zzso environment using 4 parallel zzso Several quantitative and qualitative performance aspects of this method have been investigated such as lateral shift zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso tracking performance, improvements from higher order zzso zzso and beam profile shape preservation, as well as perceived image quality zzso The results were obtained from simulations, in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso The results showed that aberration amplified the image artifacts for regular parallel zzso which resulted in more shift zzso lower zzso zzso higher zzso tracking error, and more variation in beam profile zzso Compared with regular parallel zzso zzso resulted in a significantly better image quality and a higher score in all measuring zzso The improvements from using zzso were largest in cases involving zzso Using zzso the variation in zzso correlation was reduced from zzso to zzso and the standard zzso of the zzso error was reduced from zzso to zzso
