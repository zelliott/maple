zzso zzso linear approximation of surfaces causes zzso zzso appearance of zzso We present an efficient method for smoothing the zzso of coarse triangle zzso using efficient zzso curve reconstruction and simple local zzso It does not assume the availability of a fine mesh and generates only moderate amount of additional data at run zzso Furthermore, zzso feature edges are also smoothed in a unified zzso Our method is based on a novel zzso scheme over silhouette zzso and this ensures that smooth zzso are faithfully reconstructed and always change continuously with respect to continuous movement of the view point or zzso We speed up zzso with zzso assistance to achieve real-time rendering of coarse zzso with the smoothed zzso zzso show that this method zzso previous methods for silhouette zzso
