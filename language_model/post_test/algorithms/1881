A genetic code, the mapping from zzso zzso to zzso zzso can be viewed as a partition on the set of 64 zzso A small set of zzso genetic codes is known, and these codes can be zzso compared by their partitions of the zzso zzso To measure distances between set zzso this study defines a zzso family of metric functions that includes Shannon zzso as a special zzso zzso were zzso for 17 curated genetic codes using four members of the metric function zzso With these metric functions, nuclear genetic codes had relatively small zzso zzso while zzso codes exhibited greater zzso zzso zzso using Ward's zzso produced a tight grouping of nuclear codes and several distinct zzso of zzso zzso This family of functions may be employed in other biological applications involving set zzso such as analysis of zzso data, gene set enrichment and zzso interaction zzso
