zzso association analyses are more powerful than zzso analyses in identifying genetic zzso associated with a zzso of zzso However, if the population or sample structure is omitted from the model, population zzso and cryptic zzso may lead to false positive and negative signals caused by zzso between individuals, rather than association due to close linkage of the marker and the trait zzso Therefore it is important to correct or account for these zzso in zzso association zzso However, there is cumulative evidence that when fitting a zzso association model, the genetic relationships between the individuals can be captured by the markers themselves, bringing about a possibility to use the models without an additional correction for the population or sample zzso In this work we have further investigated this possibility in the zzso zzso association model context using the extended zzso zzso and the zzso variable zzso In particular, we have studied whether these zzso models benefit from an zzso of an additional zzso term representing the genetic variation not captured by the markers and taking account of the residual zzso between the zzso We have found that although the models may benefit from the zzso of the zzso zzso omitting the component does not damage the model performance zzso
