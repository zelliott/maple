A three-dimensional zzso ultrasound imaging system has been used to study spatial compounding of images acquired with different zzso positions and zzso A compounding zzso has been developed that assigns regional weights depending on the local zzso angle of the ultrasound zzso zzso scans were performed of bones in zzso and the shoulder rotator cuff in volunteer zzso Border zzso zzso value and zzso were compiled as a function of ultrasound beam zzso angle and compared for single views and for zzso mean and weighted mean compounding zzso The weighted mean produces less zzso than that of the maximum and mean for both intensity and border zzso The weighted method also demonstrates less blurring of borders than the maximum and mean zzso zzso derived from the weighted reconstructions exhibited fewer gaps and fewer zzso connections between surfaces, which could be of particular importance for automated image zzso
