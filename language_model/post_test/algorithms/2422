zzso expression quantitative trait zzso zzso studies have emerged as a powerful tool to understand the genetic basis of gene expression and complex zzso In a typical zzso study, the huge number of genetic markers and expression traits and their complicated correlations present a challenging zzso correction zzso The zzso test using zzso or zzso procedures is a standard approach to address the zzso problem in zzso zzso A zzso force application of the zzso test to large-scale zzso data sets is often zzso zzso Several zzso efficient methods have been proposed to calculate approximate zzso zzso However, these methods rely on certain assumptions about the correlation structure of the genetic zzso which may not be valid for certain zzso We propose a novel algorithm, rapid and exact multiple testing correction by zzso zzso to address this zzso zzso zzso the exact zzso zzso in a zzso efficient zzso The zzso advantage of zzso lies in its strategy of pruning the search space by skipping genetic markers whose upper bounds on test statistics are zzso zzso does not rely on any assumption about the correlation structure of the genetic zzso It can be applied to a variety of zzso zzso correction methods including zzso and zzso zzso We evaluate zzso on three zzso data sets zzso zzso zzso and human rare zzso and show that it achieves accurate zzso zzso zzso with much less zzso cost than existing zzso The software is available at zzso
