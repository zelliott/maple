To illustrate the interplay between zzso and grass, we present a novel zzso Carlo model including zzso growth, consumption of grass by zzso and birth, migration and death of zzso The rates of the former and three latter processes are assumed to depend on the environment so that the conventional zzso approximation does not hold (in particular, the model takes into account that grass grows on the zzso zzso and zzso are mobile and prefer to stay on the areas covered by zzso Due to the feedback between various zzso as expected, the model predicts stable regimes and irregular zzso of the area of the grass islands and zzso zzso The patterns observed are however different compared to those predicted by conventional zzso Carlo zzso zzso Specifically, there is no tendency for zzso and grass to zzso The zzso version of the model is briefly discussed as zzso
