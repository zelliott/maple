zzso is characterized by bone loss and deterioration of the zzso bone zzso architecture that leads to impaired overall mechanical strength of the zzso Bone mineral density zzso measured by zzso zzso zzso is currently the standard clinical metric assessing bone integrity but it fails to capture the structural changes in the zzso Recent research suggests that structure contributes to bone strength in a manner complementary to zzso Besides parameters of scale such as the mean zzso thickness and mean bone volume zzso parameters describing the zzso of the zzso architecture play an important role in the characterization of zzso since zzso are zzso oriented along the direction of local zzso zzso the degree of structural zzso is of pivotal importance to the zzso mechanical zzso The most common method for measuring structural zzso of zzso is the zzso length zzso In this work we present a method, based on the three-dimensional spatial zzso function zzso for mapping of the full structural zzso zzso of both zzso thickness and spacing and we examine its performance as compared to that of zzso Not only is the zzso method faster by several orders of zzso it is also considerably more robust to zzso Further, it is zzso at lower spatial resolution and is relatively insensitive to image zzso The chief reason for zzso superior performance is that it does not require zzso which is difficult to achieve in the limited spatial regime of in zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso and zzso have been applied to high-resolution magnetic zzso images of the zzso in a group of ten healthy zzso women by comparing the structural zzso and principal direction of the zzso fabric zzso for each zzso While there is fair agreement between the two methods, zzso analysis yielded greater zzso than zzso for both zzso thickness and zzso There was good agreement between the two techniques as far as the zzso of the fabric zzso were concerned, which parallel the zzso zzso zzso
