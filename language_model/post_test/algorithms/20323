The preferred chest tube zzso removal zzso has not yet been zzso The purpose of this study was to determine which technique, water seal or zzso allowed for shorter CT zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso rate, the need for CT zzso and the total number of chest zzso films zzso were zzso 

Prospective zzso trial of 205 trauma patients, older than 15 years of age, requiring tube zzso for blunt and penetrating zzso Patients requiring mechanical ventilation more than 24 hours were excluded from the zzso zzso consent was obtained from all zzso zzso tubes were zzso for removal when output was less than 150 zzso hours, zzso revealed no significant zzso and no air leak was zzso Patients in the water seal group were disconnected from low wall zzso and a zzso was obtained 6 to 8 hours zzso zzso tubes in the no water seal group were disconnected from wall zzso and pulled zzso All tubes were removed by using standard protocol with patients at zzso zzso zzso A follow-up zzso was obtained after zzso 

Of the 205 patients, 93 patients zzso zzso were zzso to the water seal group and 112 patients zzso to the no water seal zzso Four patients in the water seal group developed a zzso before CT removal and were considered treatment zzso After CT zzso repeat zzso was seen in 13 patients in the water seal group and in 9 patients in the no water seal zzso However, seven patients in the no water seal group required CT zzso compared with one in the water seal group zzso Average number of zzso in the water seal group was zzso compared with zzso zzso in the no water seal zzso There was no difference in chest tube duration or hospital length of stay between groups for either all patients or only those patients with isolated chest zzso Patients who required another CT had a hospital length of stay twice that of patients who did zzso 

It is possible that patients in the no water seal group did not have sufficient time for a possible zzso to evolve, which resulted in a larger and more significant zzso requiring another zzso Although there was no difference in chest tube duration between the no water seal and water seal groups, a short trial of water seal appears to allow zzso air leaks to become clinically apparent and reduces the need for another zzso
