A systematic evaluation of the zzso zzso which simulate off-site drift and deposition of zzso applied zzso contained in the zzso model was performed by comparing model simulations to zzso data collected by the zzso zzso Task zzso zzso data used for model evaluation included 161 separate trials of typical agriculture aerial applications under a wide range of application and meteorological zzso zzso for model simulations included information on the aircraft and spray equipment, spray material, zzso and site zzso The model input zzso were generated independently of the field deposition results, zzso model zzso were in no way altered or selected to improve the fit of model output to field zzso zzso shows a response similar to that of the field observations for many application variables zzso zzso size, application zzso wind zzso However, zzso is sensitive to zzso effects, and modeled deposition in the zzso responds to wet bulb depression whereas the field observations did zzso The model tended to zzso deposition rates relative to the field data for zzso zzso particularly under zzso zzso zzso was in good agreement with field results for zzso zzso buffer zones needed to manage human, crop, zzso and ecological zzso
