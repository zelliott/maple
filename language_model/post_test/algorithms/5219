Delayed enhancement zzso zzso can be used to identify zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso into the zzso core and zzso periphery (called the gray zzso on conventional zzso zzso echo zzso zzso images has been related to zzso for zzso zzso However, this zzso is sensitive to image noise, depends on the signal intensity characteristics in a remote region of zzso and requires manual contours of the zzso zzso Image analysis and fuzzy zzso techniques were developed to analyze images acquired using a zzso delayed enhancement zzso sequence in order characterize the zzso zzso The zzso analysis is automated and uses data fitting of signal zzso acquired at multiple inversion zzso In a study of 15 patients with chronic zzso the gray zones derived from zzso and zzso images were zzso The zzso in the gray zone size associated with random noise and operator input was significantly reduced using the zzso analysis compared to the zzso zzso In zzso the zzso approach yields a more zzso measure of the zzso core and gray zones on any given data zzso
