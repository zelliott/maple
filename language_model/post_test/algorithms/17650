In zzso zzso imaging zzso and diffusion zzso imaging zzso the evaluation of diffusion parameters such as apparent diffusion zzso and zzso zzso is affected by image zzso that arise from residual zzso currents produced by the zzso zzso Correction methods that zzso zzso and zzso images suffer from the different contrast properties inherent in these image zzso Here, a zzso correction scheme is introduced that makes use of the inverse characteristics of zzso generated by zzso with reversed zzso In this approach, only zzso images with identical contrast are included for zzso That is, zzso images are not needed as a reference for zzso Furthermore, the acquisition of an additional zzso with moderate zzso as suggested by zzso and Moore zzso zzso zzso zzso is not zzso With phantom data it is shown that the theoretically expected symmetry of zzso is preserved in the images to a very high degree, demonstrating the practicality of the new zzso zzso from human brain images are also zzso
