The technique of diffusion zzso zzso zzso directions of maximum diffusion to reconstruct pathways of white matter structures in the zzso zzso successful tracking of these white matter pathways depends on zzso zzso diffusion directional zzso By examination of diffusion zzso field properties in the human brain, we demonstrate that the geometry of tracked pathways is influenced by points in the field where the maximum diffusion direction is poorly zzso In common with zzso fields describing other mathematical and physical phenomena, such as zzso surface differential geometry and zzso fields, we refer to these points as zzso Here we describe an automated procedure for detecting zzso and demonstrate that these occur where there is zzso fiber zzso zzso pathways passing close to one another within a zzso zzso volume zzso and zzso noise propagation into low zzso zzso In order to highlight the relevance of zzso in tracking white matter structures, we determined their effect on zzso of the zzso zzso
