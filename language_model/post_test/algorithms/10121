Based on the dynamic characteristics of human eye zzso a zzso zzso zzso imaging system set is established for real-time zzso measurement and zzso This paper analyzes the working principles of a zzso zzso zzso sensor and a zzso zzso membrane zzso mirror adopted in the zzso The proposed system achieves zzso reconstruction through the zzso zzso detection method and the mode reconstruction zzso of zzso zzso so that human eye aberration can be measured zzso Meanwhile, according to the zzso zzso aberration correction control model, a zzso zzso aberration correction zzso based on Smith control is presented to realize efficient and real-time correction of human eye aberration with different zzso and characteristics of the time domain of the system are also zzso According to the experiment results tested on a zzso 1951 standard resolution target and a living human zzso zzso zzso the resolution of the system can reach zzso and the human eye zzso aberration of zzso zzso can be corrected to zzso in root mean square zzso so as to achieve the zzso limit zzso ratio is zzso then high-resolution zzso images are zzso
