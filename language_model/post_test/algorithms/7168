zzso zzso Device Architecture zzso is a parallel computing platform and programming model invented by zzso It enables dramatic increase in computing performance via the power of the graphics processing unit zzso In medical image analysis, zzso image registration generally takes relatively long time, which is not feasible for clinical zzso To solve this problem, this paper proposed a high performance zzso method based on zzso which took full advantage of zzso parallel computing under zzso architecture combined with image multiple scale and maximum mutual zzso zzso showed that this zzso can not only maintain the registration accuracy but also greatly increase the speed of registration process and meet the real-time requirement of clinical zzso
