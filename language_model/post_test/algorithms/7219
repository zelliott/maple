This chapter describes a practical procedure to dissect zzso systems, simplify them, and use or derive zzso rate equations in order to build a mathematical model of a zzso system and run zzso We first deal with a simple example, modeling a single zzso that follows zzso zzso and operates in the middle of an zzso zzso zzso Next we describe the rules that can be followed to isolate zzso from their environment to simulate their zzso Finally we use examples to show how to derive suitable rate zzso simpler than those needed for zzso studies, though adequate to describe the behavior over the zzso range of zzso of the general characteristics of kinetic models will be obvious to readers familiar with the theory of zzso control analysis zzso zzso of zzso Kinetics, zzso zzso zzso zzso but here we shall not assume such knowledge, as the chapter is directed toward practical application rather than zzso
