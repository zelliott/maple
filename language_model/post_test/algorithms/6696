The zzso zzso encompasses an ensemble of genes involved in preserving cell viability under massive DNA damage and is present in most bacterial zzso Up to date, however, the scope of this network had only been assessed in the zzso zzso Here, we report the structure of the zzso zzso in the Alpha zzso using a combined approach that makes use of in zzso and in zzso techniques to assist and validate the comparative zzso in zzso zzso This leads to the first zzso validated description of the zzso zzso in the Alpha zzso and comparison of zzso core structures in both classes suggests that a least common multiple set of genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso might be a defining property of the zzso zzso zzso
