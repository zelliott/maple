This paper proposes a period representation for modeling the zzso zzso therapies and an zzso zzso Algorithm zzso for designing the optimal zzso The period representation offers benefits in terms of flexibility and reduction in zzso compared to the zzso zzso The zzso is a zzso zzso which employs a list of three local searchers zzso activated by an evolutionary zzso These local zzso having different features according to the exploration logic and the zzso rule, have the role of exploring the decision space from different and complementary perspectives and, thus, assisting the standard evolutionary operators in the zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso makes use of an adaptation which zzso sets the zzso parameters in order to prevent stagnation and premature zzso The zzso results demonstrate that the application of the proposed zzso leads to very efficient medication schedules which quickly stimulate a strong immune response to zzso The earlier termination of the medication schedule leads to lesser unpleasant side effects for the patient due to strong zzso zzso A zzso comparison shows that the zzso is more efficient than three popular zzso Finally, a statistical test based on the calculation of the tolerance zzso confirms the superiority of the zzso compared to the other methods for the problem under zzso
