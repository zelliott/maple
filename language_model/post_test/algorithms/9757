In this work a procedure for determining the zzso of products by merging zzso zzso zzso zzso techniques of data analysis, and kinetic theory is zzso This procedure allows information from several sources zzso physical chemical, and zzso to be merged via the zzso accelerated zzso test zzso zzso The zzso is a zzso approach that relies on soft modeling via an unfolding principal component analysis zzso and hard zzso through the conventional kinetic theory, for determining the final zzso of zzso The procedure was successfully applied to a consumer goods product (a body zzso whose zzso was determined to be 3 years and 9 months, in accordance with results previously obtained using conventional zzso techniques and zzso methods of data zzso
