zzso during routine spinal zzso procedures could result in devastating consequences for the surgical zzso Spinal zzso monitoring through zzso evoked zzso zzso remains a viable method for prevention of serious zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a method to zzso calculate signal match quality through successive filter zzso Here we compare the speed of detection with zzso to conventional zzso zzso Both absolute magnitude of zzso and zzso as well as slope change detector zzso zzso was run as well to determine the earliest time when a significant change zzso 

The standard error for the zzso zzso is close to one tenth of the zzso measure, Since the zzso zzso achieved low zzso during baseline zzso we were able to achieve rapid detection of zzso For absolute magnitude detection zzso was faster than zzso for the 20 g injury weight zzso It took an average of 10 epochs to detect the injury with zzso zzso and nearly 19 with standard zzso metrics using absolute magnitude zzso zzso change detection methods using slope change show that zzso provides more favorable detection capabilities comparable to zzso Additionally, there was a significant increase in the zzso curve between zzso and zzso alone zzso 

Because of its excellent detection capabilities, the zzso zzso method provides an excellent supplement to traditional zzso for capturing zzso changes in zzso 

zzso zzso remains a viable method for rapidly and accurately detecting spinal zzso
