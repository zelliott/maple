The authors have developed a zzso standing controller for a powered knee and ankle zzso which is intended to enhance the standing stability of zzso zzso The zzso controller includes a zzso phase, a slope zzso phase, and a joint zzso zzso phase, which together enable the zzso to quickly conform to the ground and provide stabilizing assistance to the zzso In order to assess the efficacy of the zzso standing zzso the control approach was implemented on a powered knee and ankle zzso and experimental data were collected on an zzso subject for a variety of standing zzso zzso indicate that the controller can estimate the ground slope within zzso over a range of zzso and that it can provide appropriate joint zzso for standing on slopes within this zzso
