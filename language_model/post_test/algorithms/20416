The purpose of this study was to determine whether the maximum zzso zzso zzso in zzso mechanical model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso London zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso should be scaled with zzso measured as a fraction of the maximum zzso force zzso By using the zzso method, zzso zzso relationships of the wrist zzso were gathered at five different zzso levels zzso of maximum at intervals of zzso from four zzso The zzso data at different zzso levels can be fitted remarkably well with zzso characteristic zzso In general, the zzso zzso decreases with zzso With the assumption of zzso relationships between Hill zzso and zzso level, a scaled zzso model was zzso When the zzso zzso for zzso zzso were forced to zzso at the zzso obtained with maximum zzso zzso zzso zzso there were drastic changes in the shape of the zzso The differences in zzso values generated by the scaled and constant zzso models were statistically zzso These results suggest that, when a zzso model is used in musculoskeletal zzso the zzso should be scaled with zzso
