The method of continuous variation, often known as the Job plot, has long been used for determining the zzso of two interacting zzso The correct binding ratio, zzso is generally obtained when the total concentration of the zzso zzso is much greater than the zzso zzso zzso For zzso binding systems, the zzso varies between one and zzso as zzso increases; whereas for positive cooperative systems, values larger than zzso may be observed at low zzso In this report, we present examples to illustrate how the changing apparent zzso as a function of zzso can provide clues for zzso various binding zzso To test these concepts, we examined the zzso of zzso with zzso in the range of zzso to 210 zzso with zzso expressed in zzso concentration or in terms of its binding zzso (three in this zzso The results were analyzed according to several models and found to be most consistent with the mechanism of zzso complex formation or infinite zzso with a zzso of 8 zzso
