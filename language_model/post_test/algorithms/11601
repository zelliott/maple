We present a new zzso method, zzso for accurately zzso zzso into protein active zzso The method employs a cavity detection zzso for detecting zzso in the protein as candidate active site zzso A shape comparison filter is combined with a zzso Carlo zzso search for generating zzso poses consistent with the active site zzso zzso poses are minimized in the context of the active site using a zzso method for evaluating zzso interaction zzso Errors arising from grid zzso are dramatically reduced using a new zzso zzso zzso zzso are presented for 19 diverse zzso zzso The method appears quite promising, zzso the X-ray structure zzso pose within an zzso of 2A in 14 out of the 19 zzso A zzso screening study applied to the zzso zzso zzso is also presented in which zzso when combined with zzso an internally developed scoring function, yields very good hit rates for a zzso pool seeded with known zzso
