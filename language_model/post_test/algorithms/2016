The relaxation of zzso zzso due to their interaction with zzso zzso zzso in gel structures is measured using fast zzso zzso This phenomenon called zzso dips has been reported in different zzso zzso zzso In this study, we have studied zzso dips in zzso an zzso protein that is the core zzso of zzso zzso was formed by the addition of zzso to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were measured using fast zzso zzso zzso over the field range of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and were analyzed using a zzso zzso A linear increase of signal zzso with increasing zzso concentration was zzso This agrees with the current theory that predicts a linear relationship of signal zzso with the concentration of contributing zzso spins in the zzso Interestingly, zzso formation gave rise to the zzso regardless of zzso induced by the zzso factor zzso To investigate the effect of proteins that might be trapped in the zzso in zzso the plasma protein zzso was added to the zzso zzso and an increase in the zzso signal zzso was zzso This study can potentially be useful for zzso zzso by fast zzso zzso zzso
