zzso zzso suppression is demonstrated of zzso zzso zzso introduced by multiple cavity effects in transmission zzso zzso of various Bragg grating zzso These devices were zzso within access zzso and terminated with zzso zzso The zzso based on a zzso to an equivalent scattering zzso model, is shown to extract transmission zzso of devices, without zzso knowledge of their zzso zzso and complex grating structure zzso are successfully extracted and compare well with simulated zzso The technique exhibits robust zzso for varying facet conditions and device zzso outperforming classical averaging zzso
