There has been some effort by using zzso zzso zzso which is based on zzso transfer theory to calculate zzso zzso of zzso A field investigation in Lake zzso was carried out in June, 2009, and a zzso including many parameters such as remote sensing zzso zzso and zzso zzso concentration of total suspended matter zzso had been zzso zzso a model for zzso zzso was built, and in order to improve the zzso we employed the zzso zzso to simulate zzso ratio of Lake zzso The results show that: 1) zzso zzso and zzso zzso are determined as optimum bands for the Two zzso zzso zzso in Lake zzso and the average specific scattering zzso of suspended matters at the wavelength of zzso zzso and zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) The zzso ratio of Lake zzso is zzso and better accuracy is achieved by using this value rather than other empirical zzso The root mean square error zzso and mean absolute percentage error zzso of the estimated zzso with calculated zzso ratio are zzso 143 zzso zzso zzso and zzso 3) It is found that stations with high zzso (nearly greater than 30 zzso zzso zzso can have more stable and reliable estimated zzso
