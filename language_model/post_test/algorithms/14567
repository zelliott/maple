zzso biological network zzso that can help predict the behavior of a system given prior observations from zzso data is a very valuable but difficult task, especially in the light of the ever-increasing volume of experimental zzso Such an endeavor can be greatly enhanced by considering regulatory influences on zzso groups of genes representing functional zzso thus constraining the number of parameters in the zzso This allows development of network models that are zzso of system zzso We first develop a zzso network model of the zzso of whole blood from a mouse model of zzso in zzso stroke, and show that it can accurately predict system behavior under novel zzso We then use a network zzso approach to expand the set of regulators considered and show that addition of zzso bottlenecks improves the performance of the zzso zzso Finally, we explore how improvements in definition of functional zzso may be achieved through an integration of zzso network relationships and functional relationships defined using Gene zzso zzso We show that appropriate integration of these two types of relationships can result in models with improved zzso
