The current consensus is that zzso treatment is superior to mastectomy because it provides survival equivalent to total mastectomy and zzso dissection while preserving the zzso This technique still has several technical issues that can adversely influence the successful outcome of zzso zzso Specifically, dose coverage and zzso must be maintained throughout the breast while reducing the zzso magnitude and normal tissue zzso A random retrospective three-dimensional zzso study was conducted using zzso zzso scans of 20 female patients with zzso breast zzso zzso and three-dimensional zzso and zzso treatment planning was conducted using all possible zzso combinations and effective zzso zzso with the goal of reducing the hot volumes in the breast below 110 percent of the prescribed zzso The zzso combination that minimized the hot volumes uses either zzso wedges on the zzso and lateral beams or a zzso wedge on the zzso beam and a zzso wedge on the lateral zzso For patients with bridge distances less than 20 zzso this wedge combination reduces the hot volumes below 110 percent of the prescribed zzso For patients with bridge distances greater than 20 zzso low- and zzso zzso beams must be mixed to lower the maximum dose below 110 percent of the prescribed zzso The hot volumes in the breasts of 20 random patients was reduced below 110 percent of the prescribed dose without a significant reduction in tumor zzso
