We present a new approach for automated zzso of the carotid zzso zzso from zzso zzso ultrasound using a zzso surface graph cut zzso The method requires only the manual selection of single seed points in the zzso zzso and common carotid zzso zzso the zzso between these points is automatically zzso and the optimal zzso surface is found around the zzso using graph zzso To refine the result, the latter process was zzso The method was tested on twelve carotid arteries from six subjects including three patients with a moderate carotid artery zzso Our method successfully segmented the zzso in all zzso We obtained an average dice overlap with respect to a manual zzso of zzso for healthy zzso For the patient data, we obtained a dice overlap of zzso
