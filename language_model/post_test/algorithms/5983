The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of 4 methods for zzso tracing zzso They are the zzso method, zzso method, zzso averaged 5 landmarks zzso method, and manual geometric zzso 

Eight lateral zzso zzso were zzso zzso tracing was performed by 2 zzso One had extensive experience in landmark zzso while the other had minimal zzso The zzso were scanned and the reference landmarks zzso Point A, Point B, and zzso were zzso creating 8 master zzso Then 6 digital copies of each master tracing were made, 3 for each zzso zzso the examiners were asked to zzso and trace predetermined zzso base landmarks and zzso zzso occurred at zzso zzso As a result, 3 separate zzso of each set were obtained from each zzso The zzso of each set were superimposed using 4 different methods in the zzso software zzso Technology zzso Hong Kong zzso zzso For each method of zzso the coordinates of zzso Point A, Point B, and zzso were zzso Their means and zzso were zzso The zzso represents the zzso of the zzso zzso A general linear model for repeated measures was zzso to test whether there were statistically significant differences among the 4 zzso methods, 2 zzso 4 reference landmarks, and 2 zzso Because the distribution of the zzso was zzso they were transformed to log zzso Finally, the errors of the zzso in zzso for each given zzso zzso method, reference landmark, and direction zzso zzso were zzso 

There was a statistically significant difference in measurement zzso among the 4 zzso methods zzso zzso zzso For both zzso the zzso of the different zzso methods from the highest to the lowest was: zzso zzso registered at zzso method, zzso registered at zzso method, zzso averaged 5 landmarks method, and the manual geometric zzso In addition, there was a statistically significant difference in the magnitude of zzso errors between the 2 examiners zzso zzso zzso The experienced examiner was consistently more precise than the inexperienced examiner across all zzso Moreover, there was a statistically significant difference among 4 reference landmarks zzso zzso zzso For both zzso the recorded zzso of each given reference landmark from the lowest to the highest was: zzso Point A, Point B, and zzso Furthermore, the zzso differences between horizontal and vertical directions did not reach a conventional level of significance zzso zzso zzso Finally, the recorded errors in zzso for each zzso method were zzso A smaller error in zzso represented a higher accuracy in zzso The error of using manual geometric or zzso methods for both examiners was less than zzso zzso while the error of using the other 2 methods was up to zzso zzso for the experienced examiner and zzso zzso for the inexperienced zzso 

The error of both manual and zzso methods was within zzso zzso The zzso method had its advantage because it could be automated by the zzso
