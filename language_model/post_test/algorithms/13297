This paper applies root locus theory to develop a zzso tool for the analysis and design of zzso active noise control zzso It is shown that the poles of the adaptation process performed in these systems move on typical zzso in the zzso as the adaptation zzso zzso Based on this finding, the dominant root of the adaptation process and its trajectory can be zzso The first contribution of this paper is zzso parameters of the adaptation process root zzso The next contribution is introducing a mechanism for zzso the trajectory of the dominant root in the root zzso This mechanism creates a single open loop zero in the original root zzso It is shown that appropriate zzso of this zero can cause the dominant root of the locus to be pushed toward the origin, and thereby the adaptation process becomes zzso The zzso of the theoretical findings is confirmed in an experimental setup which is implemented using real-time zzso and zzso processing zzso
