In pediatric zzso zzso analysis, mild right zzso zzso zzso and especially mild zzso with terminal right zzso delay zzso are often confused with partial right bundle branch block zzso This is problematic for computer zzso analysis zzso and even for most experienced pediatric zzso This study was designed to achieve better zzso of mild zzso and zzso by combining the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plane zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso used in the study were recorded with 15 leads and a 500 zzso sampling rate at the zzso Salter Packard Children's Hospital, Stanford University Medical zzso Out of 4,200 zzso collected zzso over a period of 18 months, zzso zzso 335 zzso and zzso zzso were interpreted by expert pediatric zzso and were included in the zzso zzso comparison of zzso and zzso zzso were done in zzso zzso sets zzso that have a visually indistinguishable zzso pattern, 117 zzso 96 zzso and 199 normal, showed significant differences in initial and terminal zzso in the zzso zzso The mean angle of the initial zzso was anterior zzso degrees zzso zzso in the normal group, left anterior in the zzso group zzso degrees zzso zzso and in the zzso group zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso The mean angle of the terminal zzso was right anterior zzso degrees zzso zzso in the zzso group, rightward zzso degrees zzso zzso in the zzso group and right zzso zzso degrees zzso zzso in the normal zzso These are clearly zzso features for a zzso zzso zzso improved zzso results were obtained from a new zzso using combined zzso and zzso zzso versus an existing zzso The limitation of this study stems from the unavailability of a more reliable gold zzso It may be necessary to used body surface zzso obtained with a large number of zzso to accurately differentiate the study zzso
