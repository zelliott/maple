We consider distributed source coding in the presence of hidden variables that zzso the statistical dependence among zzso We derive the zzso bound and devise coding zzso for a zzso model of this zzso The zzso zzso in addition to syndrome zzso a portion of the source to the decoder zzso as doping zzso The decoder uses the zzso zzso to simultaneously recover the source symbols and the hidden statistical dependence zzso We also develop novel techniques based on density evolution zzso to analyze the coding zzso We zzso confirm that our DE analysis closely zzso practical zzso This result allows us to efficiently zzso parameters of the zzso In particular, we show that the system performs close to the zzso bound when an appropriate doping rate is zzso We then apply our coding and analysis techniques to a zzso video quality monitoring system and show a bit rate saving of about zzso compared with zzso zzso
