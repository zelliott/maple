A mathematical analysis, called zzso zzso was applied to two sets of data on zzso from head and neck zzso The analysis places zzso zzso in an imaginary space (here termed a zzso such that distances between zzso clusters are zzso to differences in the occurrence of tumor zzso zzso zzso explains zzso of the zzso in clinical data from 1008 patients and zzso of the zzso in pathological data from a different set of 415 zzso These independent results are closely zzso and both explain vastly more of the data than expected by zzso The dimensions of the zzso are not related to anatomical coordinates of the zzso suggesting that a representation of these structures in an abstract space explains the spread of zzso better than an analysis of spread in real zzso Surprisingly, a plot of the extent to which zzso from different primary sites spread along the zzso dimensions is closely related to the normal anatomical locations of the zzso This shows that although the zzso may be difficult to zzso it must have some biological zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso successfully zzso a pattern in the spread of head and neck zzso
