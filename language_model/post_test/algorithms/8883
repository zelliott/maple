Renal zzso zzso injury leads to acute kidney injury zzso and is associated with tissue zzso inflammatory cell zzso and subsequent development of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of the functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso techniques, zzso zzso and zzso imaging zzso in characterizing acute and chronic pathology after unilateral zzso in zzso 

zzso or severe zzso were induced in zzso mice through transient unilateral clamping of the zzso zzso for 35 minutes zzso zzso or 45 minutes zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging was performed in 10 animals with moderate zzso and 7 animals with severe zzso before surgery and at 5 time points thereafter zzso 1, 7, 14, 21, zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso images, zzso zzso spin zzso and zzso sequences (7 b zzso were acquired in matching zzso zzso zzso maps of zzso relaxation time and apparent diffusion zzso zzso were zzso and mean values were determined for the zzso cortex, the outer zzso and the inner zzso zzso cell zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso as well as the degree of zzso zzso 4 weeks after zzso were determined through zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis comprised zzso zzso tests for group comparisons and correlation analysis between zzso parameters and kidney volume zzso 

zzso of zzso relaxation time, indicating tissue zzso was most pronounced in the outer zzso and reached maximum values at zzso after zzso At this time point, zzso values in the outer zzso were significantly increased to zzso zzso zzso milliseconds after the severe zzso and to zzso zzso zzso milliseconds after the moderate zzso when compared with the respective zzso normal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso values reached baseline by zzso zzso zzso was significantly reduced at all time points after zzso restriction of diffusion was significantly more pronounced after the severe zzso than after the moderate zzso at zzso and zzso Changes of zzso zzso and zzso values were associated with the severity of zzso as well as the degree of inflammatory cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso 4 weeks after zzso Furthermore, relative changes of both zzso parameters significantly correlated with kidney volume loss 4 weeks after zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso values through zzso is a zzso way to determine the presence and severity of acute and chronic zzso changes after zzso in zzso Thus, the method should prove useful in animal and human clinical zzso
