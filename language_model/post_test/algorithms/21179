zzso imaging can potentially be used to zzso the connectivity of the human brain in zzso using zzso techniques, and is therefore of great interest to neuroscientists and zzso A key requirement for zzso tracking is the accurate zzso of white matter zzso zzso within each imaging zzso The diffusion zzso model, which is widely used for this purpose, has been shown to be inadequate in crossing zzso zzso A number of approaches have recently been proposed to address this issue, based on high angular resolution zzso imaging zzso zzso In this study, an experimental model of crossing zzso consisting of zzso plastic zzso is used to thoroughly assess three such zzso constrained zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso imaging zzso zzso data were acquired over a range of crossing angles and zzso from which zzso zzso were zzso using each zzso All techniques were capable of resolving the two zzso populations down to a crossing angle of 45 degrees , and down to 30 degrees for zzso A bias was observed in the zzso zzso estimated by zzso for crossing angles other than 90 degrees, consistent with previous simulation zzso Finally, for a 45 degrees zzso the minimum zzso required to resolve the zzso zzso was zzso zzso for zzso 2000 zzso for zzso and 1000 zzso for zzso The quality of zzso of zzso zzso may profoundly affect zzso tracking attempts, and the results presented provide important additional information regarding performance characteristics of well-known zzso
