zzso evolved through the zzso of functional zzso and therefore, the same domain can be found in different proteins and zzso zzso between such zzso zzso often involve specific, zzso binding surfaces reflecting their important biological role in a zzso To find biologically relevant interactions we developed a method of systematically comparing and zzso protein domain interactions from the structural zzso As a result, a set of zzso binding modes zzso was created using the atomic detail of structure alignment data and the protein domain zzso of the zzso zzso zzso A zzso binding mode is zzso when different members of interacting domain families dock in the same way, such that their structural complexes zzso zzso Such domain interactions with recurring structural themes have greater significance to be biologically relevant, unlike zzso crystal packing zzso zzso this study gives lower and upper bounds on the number of different types of interacting domain pairs in the structure database on the order of zzso We use zzso to create domain interaction networks, which highlight functionally significant connections by avoiding many zzso links between highly connected zzso The zzso also constitute a library of zzso templates that may be used in molecular modeling to zzso the characteristics of an unknown binding surface, just as zzso zzso may be used to zzso the structure of an unknown zzso The zzso ability to sort through and zzso large numbers of putative interacting domain pairs is demonstrated on the zzso interactions of zzso
