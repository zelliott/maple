zzso zzso zzso zzso allows assessment of left zzso zzso volume zzso left zzso zzso volume zzso left zzso stroke volume zzso and left zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso images with the patient both prone and zzso is an approved method of identifying and reducing zzso Yet prone positioning alters zzso zzso This study investigated how prone versus zzso patient positioning during gated zzso affects zzso zzso zzso zzso and heart zzso 

Forty-eight patients scheduled for routine zzso zzso imaging were examined with gated zzso zzso (at zzso while positioned prone and zzso zzso in random zzso All parameters for both acquisitions were calculated using the commercially available zzso zzso 

Whereas zzso and zzso were significantly lower zzso zzso zzso for prone acquisitions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than for zzso acquisitions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not differ zzso Heart rate was significantly higher zzso zzso zzso during prone acquisitions zzso zzso zzso zzso than during zzso acquisitions zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The observed zzso effect on zzso zzso and heart rate might be explained by decreased zzso filling and increased sympathetic nerve zzso zzso zzso reference data should not be used to zzso the results of prone zzso
