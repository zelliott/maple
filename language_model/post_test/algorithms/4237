This study was to assess the zzso zzso for patients with zzso cancer undergoing zzso dose treatments following zzso radiation zzso The zzso zzso is an inflatable zzso cylinder with multiple zzso It is used to tailor the dose distribution to an zzso zzso disease, and better spare zzso at zzso Five patients with high-risk zzso cancer were selected for this zzso The patients were treated with a high dose of radiation using the zzso zzso daily fraction of 7 zzso was prescribed for a total dose of zzso The treatment plans included zzso parameters such as equivalent uniform dose zzso normal tissue complication probability zzso and tumor control probability zzso Based on the zzso zzso zzso we also calculated four quality factors: conformity index zzso dose zzso index zzso dose zzso index zzso and overdose index zzso The zzso values range from zzso to zzso Very low values of zzso were observed for the zzso and zzso The zzso to zzso at risk ranged from zzso zzso to zzso zzso for the zzso and from zzso zzso from to zzso zzso for the zzso The mean zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso were in the range of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The use of a zzso zzso cylinder may not only help cover extensive zzso disease, but also reduce the dose to the zzso This zzso analysis shows that zzso doses could be reduced using a zzso zzso However, the dose delivered to the zzso based on zzso calculation may be higher than that obtained with other zzso Each patient must be evaluated independently to determine if a zzso treatment is zzso Clinical followup will show whether this zzso dose sparing translates into a real toxicity zzso
