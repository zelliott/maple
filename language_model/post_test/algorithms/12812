zzso zzso Networks zzso comprise a powerful tool to approximate the complicated behavior and response of physical systems allowing considerable reduction in zzso time during time-consuming zzso zzso In this work, a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Network zzso is combined with a zzso Evolution zzso zzso to solve a water resources management problem, using an zzso zzso The objective of the zzso scheme is to cover the daily water demand on the coastal zzso east of the city of zzso zzso without reducing the subsurface water quality due to seawater zzso The zzso is zzso as an zzso surrogate model to approximate the behavior of the zzso and to replace some of the costly evaluations of an accurate zzso simulation model which zzso the subsurface water flow differential zzso The zzso is used as a local approximation model in such a way as to maintain the zzso of the DE zzso The results of this procedure are compared to the corresponding results obtained by using the zzso method and by using the DE procedure without the surrogate zzso As it is demonstrated, the use of the surrogate model zzso the convergence of the DE zzso procedure and additionally provides a better solution at the same number of exact evaluations, compared to the original DE zzso
