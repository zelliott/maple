zzso zzso zzso of zzso structures, such as for zzso or gastrointestinal imaging, is performed by using a fiber-optic zzso as a zzso zzso The interrogating beam is scanned zzso by rotating the fiber around a fixed central zzso Because the beam is focused only at a fixed distance from the center of the zzso only zzso near this distance are zzso We present a solution of the inverse scattering problem that provides an estimate of the zzso of the sample for an zzso scanned zzso beam focused at a fixed distance from the zzso This solution provides zzso meaningful reconstructions while also extending the volume of the sample that is resolvable by the zzso
