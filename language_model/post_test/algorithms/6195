A key to advancing the understanding of molecular biology in the zzso age is the development of accurate zzso models for genetic regulation, protein interaction, zzso and other zzso zzso To facilitate model development, simulation zzso must provide an accurate representation of the system, while performing the simulation in a reasonable amount of zzso zzso zzso simulation zzso zzso accurately depicts zzso homogeneous models with small populations of chemical species and properly represents noise, but it is often abandoned when modeling larger systems because of its zzso zzso In this work, we examine the performance of different versions of the zzso when applied to several zzso zzso Through our analysis, we discover that transient changes in reaction execution zzso which are typical of zzso models with gene induction and repression, can dramatically affect simulator zzso To account for these shifts, we propose a new zzso called the sorting direct method that maintains a loosely sorted order of the reactions as the simulation zzso Our zzso show that the sorting direct method performs favorably when compared to other well-known exact zzso simulation zzso
