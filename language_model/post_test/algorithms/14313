This paper presents an approach to the registration of significantly dissimilar images, acquired by sensors of different zzso A robust matching criterion is derived by aligning the locations of zzso zzso The alignment is achieved by zzso maximizing the zzso of the intensity zzso of a set of zzso in one of the images, where the set is zzso by the zzso zzso locations of the second zzso No explicit similarity measure that uses the zzso of both images is zzso The zzso zzso the full spatial information of the first image and the accuracy and zzso of the registration depend only on zzso False zzso are detected and zzso weighted using a directional similarity zzso By embedding the scheme in a zzso to zzso zzso we were able to estimate zzso and zzso global motions, even when the images were characterized by complex space varying intensity zzso The scheme is especially suitable when one of the images is of considerably better quality than the other zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate these properties via experiments on real zzso image zzso
