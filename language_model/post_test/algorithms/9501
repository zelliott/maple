In this article, we demonstrate a zzso method to measure an average flow zzso zzso along an arbitrary zzso This method is based on the zzso sequence and zzso zzso and zzso magnetic field zzso along multiple directions for the optimal determination of flow zzso components in three-dimensional zzso zzso measured average flow zzso from the flow induced phase shift with a zzso zzso sequence show excellent agreements with the known flow rate, and the signal zzso of each echo due to a zzso distribution is also zzso verified with known zzso flow zzso
