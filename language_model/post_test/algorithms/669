There is little data available on the responses of the human cervical spine to zzso zzso Such tests are mechanistically and technically challenging due to the variety of end conditions that need to be imposed and the difficulty of strong zzso zzso As a result, spine specimens need to be tested using fairly complex, and potentially zzso zzso in order to fully characterize the mechanical responses of each zzso This, combined with the relatively high zzso of human spine zzso can result in errors in zzso zzso In this study, 18 zzso preparations were tested in zzso Tests were performed on whole cervical spines and on spine zzso On average, the linear zzso of the segment preparations was zzso zzso and the zzso of the whole cervical spine was 48 zzso The test frame was found to have a zzso of 933 zzso zzso a whole spine from a series combination of eight segments with a zzso of zzso zzso results in an estimated whole spine zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The segment zzso were corrected by assuming that the segment preparation zzso is a series combination of the zzso of the segment and the zzso This resulted in an average corrected segment zzso of zzso zzso Taking the frame compliance into account, the whole spine zzso is 51 zzso A series combination of eight segments using the corrected zzso results in an estimated whole spine zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso We report both linear and zzso zzso models for male spines and conclude that the compliance of the frame and the fixation must be zzso in all tension studies of spinal zzso Further, reported zzso should be adjusted to account for frame and fixation zzso
