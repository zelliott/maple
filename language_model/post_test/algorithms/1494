zzso is a new zzso imaging technique that produces images zzso of the elastic properties of complaint zzso To determine the Young's zzso it is necessary to measure or estimate any five of seven relevant zzso In zzso the measured quantity is the normal strain component in the direction of the applied load, and the three normal components of stress may be estimated using the modified zzso zzso models while assuming a value close to zzso zzso for zzso zzso The distribution of Young's zzso can thus be zzso and displayed in the form of two-dimensional images called zzso The zzso models used for the zzso of the three normal components of stress assume that the target is zzso and homogeneous in zzso The objective of this article is to determine some of the errors associated with the assumption of zzso of the zzso zzso using computer simulations were performed to study the efficiency with which zzso display the contrast in the Young's zzso of a zzso or target, with respect to its background under certain zzso It was observed zzso the definition of zzso efficiency of zzso as the ratio of the elasticity contrast as measured from an zzso to the true zzso that zzso were consistently efficient in zzso depicting the elasticity contrast of hard zzso however, they showed zzso zzso efficiency in cases of soft zzso in a hard zzso In general, zzso are efficient in displaying the elasticity contrast of hard or soft zzso which have a low contrast level with respect to the surroundings, irrespective of their size and zzso
