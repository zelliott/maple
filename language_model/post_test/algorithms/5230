zzso fold zzso is a key step to predicting protein zzso zzso This paper proposes a novel approach based on genetic zzso and feature selection to zzso protein zzso Our zzso is divided into a training zzso and a test zzso Each individual for the genetic zzso represents a selection function of the feature zzso of the training zzso A support zzso machine is applied to each individual to evaluate the fitness value zzso zzso zzso of each zzso The aim of the genetic zzso is to search for the best individual that produces the highest fold zzso zzso The best individual is then applied to the feature zzso of the test zzso and a support zzso machine is built to zzso protein folds based on selected zzso Our experimental results on zzso and zzso benchmark zzso of zzso folds show that our approach achieves an accuracy of zzso which zzso current state-of-the-art protein fold zzso
