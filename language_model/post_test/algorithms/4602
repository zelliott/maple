The volume of patient monitoring video acquired in hospitals is very huge and hence there is a need for better zzso of the same for effective storage and zzso This paper presents a new motion zzso technique, which improves the zzso of patient monitoring zzso The proposed motion zzso technique makes use of a zzso mask, which is obtained by zzso the standard zzso values of the zzso along the zzso zzso Two zzso methods, which make use of the proposed motion zzso technique, are zzso The first method uses zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso the moving and stationary portions of the video zzso The second method uses zzso zzso for zzso both the moving and the stationary portions of the zzso The performances of these zzso zzso are evaluated in terms of zzso and zzso From the experimental results, it is found that the proposed motion technique improves the performance of the zzso zzso Among the two zzso methods zzso the zzso based method performs better for zzso less than 767 zzso whereas for zzso above 767 zzso the performance of the zzso based method is found zzso
