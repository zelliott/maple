In cancer drug development, demonstrated zzso activity in animal models is an important step to bring a promising compound to zzso Proper design and analysis of experiments using laboratory animals have received increasing attention zzso These experiments involve zzso censored zzso data with small zzso The problem is further complicated because of order constraints due to the intrinsic growth of control tumors without zzso This article proposes a zzso zzso model to analyze zzso censored zzso data while accounting for the zzso constraints and providing valid small sample zzso We adopt a zzso sampling approach, the inverse zzso zzso zzso zzso to generate independent zzso samples, which avoids convergence problems associated with zzso chain zzso zzso To effectively deal with the restricted zzso problem, we use a linear transformation to simplify the constraints and exploit the zzso method to generate random samples from truncated zzso normal zzso Because diffuse zzso are used, the zzso modes approximate the maximum likelihood estimates well, and the zzso model can be considered as an extended zzso zzso A real zzso experiment on a new treatment is analyzed by using the proposed zzso
