zzso steps in the development of a suite of zzso zzso solid-state zzso experiments zzso to aligned samples of zzso and zzso labeled proteins are zzso The experiments take advantage of the opportunities for zzso detection without the need for zzso zzso decoupling presented by samples with two different patterns of zzso zzso In one type of sample, the proteins are approximately zzso randomly labeled with zzso in all backbone and side chain carbon sites and approximately zzso zzso zzso labeled in all nitrogen zzso in the second type of sample, the peptides and proteins are zzso labeled at only the zzso and zzso labeled at the zzso nitrogen of a few zzso The requirement for zzso zzso decoupling while detecting zzso signals is avoided in the first case because of the low probability of any two zzso zzso being bonded to each zzso in the second case, the labeled zzso sites are separated by at least three bonds in the zzso zzso The experiments enable the measurement of the zzso chemical shift and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with the zzso and zzso backbone sites, which provide orientation constraints complementary to those derived from the zzso labeled zzso backbone zzso zzso zzso experiments identify zzso carbon zzso The ability to measure zzso zzso zzso zzso and correlate zzso and zzso zzso provides a mechanism for making backbone resonance zzso zzso combinations of these experiments ensure that the resolution, assignment, and measurement of zzso dependent zzso can be extended to larger zzso Moreover, zzso of the zzso chemical shift and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for nearly all side chain sites enable the complete three-dimensional structures of proteins to be determined with this zzso
