There is a controversy regarding the investigation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism zzso 

To compare the zzso of alternative methods of diagnosing acute zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alone and in combination with zzso ultrasound zzso of legs and pulmonary zzso zzso were compared to a conventional zzso using zzso zzso zzso supplemented in selected cases by US and zzso 

A zzso model was constructed to model the costs and effects of the three diagnostic strategies in a hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients zzso Transition probabilities were based on published zzso Life years gained by each strategy were estimated from published mortality zzso Schedule fees were used to estimate zzso 

The zzso protocol is both more expensive and more effective than CT alone resulting in zzso additional lives saved at a zzso cost of zzso per life year zzso An additional zzso lives can be saved if CT replaces zzso zzso in the diagnostic zzso but at a cost of zzso per life year zzso 

The more effective diagnostic strategies are also more zzso In patients with suspected zzso the incremental zzso of the zzso based strategy over CT alone is reasonable in comparison with other health zzso The zzso of the supplemented CT strategy is more zzso
