We here present a parallel zzso of artificial neural networks on the connection machine zzso and compare it with other parallel zzso on zzso and zzso zzso This parallel zzso was developed with the goal of efficiently training large neural networks with huge training pattern sets for applications in molecular biology, in particular the prediction of coding regions in DNA zzso The zzso uses training pattern zzso and makes use of the parallel zzso facilities of the zzso and its efficient reduction operations available within the control network to achieve a high zzso The parallel simulator zzso a maximum speed of zzso zzso for training zzso networks with zzso on a 512 zzso zzso system without using the zzso zzso zzso The zzso poses no restriction on the type of network zzso and works with different batch training zzso like zzso zzso and zzso
