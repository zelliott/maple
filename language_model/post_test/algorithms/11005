zzso resonance image zzso reconstruction from zzso zzso data requires zzso to reduce noise and zzso zzso Proper application of zzso however requires appropriate selection of associated zzso zzso In this work, we develop a zzso zzso zzso adjustment scheme that zzso an estimate zzso on the principle of Stein's unbiased risk estimate zzso of a suitable weighted zzso measure in zzso To zzso this zzso estimate, we propose a zzso scheme that extends our previous approach to inverse problems zzso zzso zzso involving zzso zzso Our approach depends only on the output of a given reconstruction zzso and does not require knowledge of its internal zzso so it is capable of tackling a wide variety of reconstruction zzso and zzso zzso including total variation and those based on the zzso zzso with simulated and real MR data indicate that the proposed approach is capable of providing near mean zzso optimal zzso parameters for single-coil zzso zzso zzso zzso
