zzso training via simulation as an educational adjunct may lead to a more rapid and complete skill zzso The authors hypothesized that simulation training will also enhance performance in zzso zzso image acquisition among zzso zzso 

A total of 42 clinical zzso residents were zzso to one of two groups: a control group, which received traditional zzso training, and a simulator group, whose training used a zzso zzso zzso Each participating resident was directed to obtain 10 commonly used standard views on an zzso patient under attending zzso Each of the 10 selected zzso views were evaluated on a grading scale of 0 to 10, according to predetermined zzso The effect of the intervention was assessed by using a linear mixed model implemented in zzso zzso zzso Institute zzso Cary, zzso 

Residents in the simulation group obtained significantly zzso images with a mean total image quality score of 83 zzso zzso 74 to zzso versus the control group score of 67 zzso zzso 58 to zzso P zzso zzso On average, zzso zzso zzso 58 to zzso of images acquired by each resident in the simulator group were acceptable for clinical use compared with zzso zzso zzso 35 to zzso in the zzso P zzso zzso Additionally, the mean difference in score between training groups was the greatest for the clinical zzso residents zzso 24; P zzso zzso zzso zzso 7 per zzso and for those with no previous zzso zzso experience zzso zzso P zzso zzso simulator zzso zzso 13; control zzso zzso zzso
