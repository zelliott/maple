zzso zzso zzso enables rapid imaging of large areas of fresh zzso without the processing that is necessary for conventional zzso zzso may offer a means to perform rapid zzso at the zzso A possible barrier toward clinical acceptance is that the mosaics are based on a single mode of zzso contrast and appear black and white, whereas zzso is based on two zzso zzso for zzso zzso for cellular zzso and zzso and appears purple and zzso Toward addressing this barrier, we report advances in digital zzso zzso mosaics that show only zzso are digitally stained purple and zzso on zzso zzso which show only cellular zzso and zzso and are digitally stained zzso With digital zzso the appearance of zzso mosaics mimics the appearance of zzso Using zzso analysis and color matching functions, red, green, and blue zzso components of zzso and zzso zzso in tissue were zzso The resulting zzso components were then applied in a linear zzso to transform zzso and zzso contrast in zzso mosaics to the zzso contrast seen in zzso zzso of zzso with zzso orange showed improved quality of digitally stained zzso with good correlation to the corresponding zzso
