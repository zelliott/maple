Current assessment of zzso interaction zzso prediction success is based on whether predictions fall within a zzso range of the observed zzso This strategy results in a potential bias toward successful prediction at lower interaction levels zzso of the area under the zzso profile zzso in the presence of zzso compared with control is zzso This scenario can bias any assessment of different zzso prediction zzso if databases contain large proportion of interactions in this lower zzso zzso the current study proposes an alternative method to assess prediction success with a variable prediction margin dependent on the particular zzso zzso The method is zzso for assessment of both induction and zzso zzso The inclusion of zzso into this zzso measure is also considered using zzso as a case zzso zzso of the traditional zzso and the new zzso method was performed on a subset of zzso zzso collated from previous zzso in each case, zzso were predicted using the dynamic model in zzso zzso A zzso reduction in prediction accuracy was evident using the new zzso measure, in particular at the level of zzso interaction zzso ratio zzso However, inclusion of zzso increased the prediction success at these levels by zzso The trend of lower prediction accuracy at higher potency of zzso reported in previous studies is no longer apparent when predictions are assessed via the new zzso zzso Thus, the study proposes a more logical method for the assessment of prediction success and its application for induction and zzso zzso
