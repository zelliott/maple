We describe a design methodology for zzso the zzso index profile of zzso optical instruments that incorporate zzso or zeros in their zzso zzso The process maintains the device performance whilst resulting in graded profiles that are zzso do not require materials with unrealistic values, and that are zzso matched to the zzso zzso This is achieved by zzso the zzso (or zzso using the zzso of transformation zzso but with an additional boundary condition requiring the zzso of the zzso transformation be zzso This additional boundary condition ensures that the device is zzso matched to the zzso medium when the zzso varying zzso and zzso profiles are scaled to zzso zzso We demonstrate the method in some detail for an Eaton zzso before describing the profiles for an zzso zzso and zzso zzso
