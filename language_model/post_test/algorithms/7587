Prior zzso of bipolar disorder have revealed zzso zzso as a promising candidate zzso However, linkage zzso zzso mapping studies have yet to identify zzso zzso zzso 

We analyzed zzso zzso single zzso zzso zzso in 83 genes to test zzso and zzso evidence of association with bipolar disorder in the zzso zzso Initiative bipolar zzso and the Portuguese Island Collection zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Both studies previously demonstrated significant evidence of linkage to zzso zzso were zzso using an zzso zzso zzso array which employs the zzso zzso Evidence of zzso association was assessed using the generalized zzso test zzso zzso estimates of zzso significance were obtained by zzso (via 100,000 zzso zzso of zzso combined test of zzso for each zzso 

No single zzso yielded significant zzso evidence of association, for either the combined sample or in each zzso Our zzso simulations identified zzso significant zzso associations with multiple zzso of which zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso were the strongest zzso However, no one gene consistently exceeded empirical significance criteria in both independent samples or survived zzso correction for the number of genes zzso 

Using a zzso approach to zzso association, we identified zzso associations with several zzso though no single locus was significantly associated with bipolar disorder in both zzso This suggests that zzso zzso may harbor multiple zzso zzso or that complex patterns of zzso in this region may confound approaches based on common zzso Published zzso This article is a zzso Government work and is in the public domain in the zzso
