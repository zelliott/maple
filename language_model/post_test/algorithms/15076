We present a method to estimate the summary receiver operating characteristic zzso curve for combining information on a diagnostic test from several different zzso Unlike previous methods that assume the reference standard to be error free, our approach allows for the possibility of errors in the reference standard, through use of a zzso class zzso The model provides estimates of the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test and the case prevalence in each study; these parameters can then be used in a zzso for example, using the zzso method proposed by Moses et zzso of a measure of test discrimination on a measure of the diagnostic zzso to fit the zzso The method is illustrated with an example on Pap zzso that shows how adjusting for zzso in the reference standard typically reduces the scatter of data in the zzso plot, and tends to indicate better performance of the test than zzso
