Stroke is a frequent cause of adult disability that can lead to enduring zzso However, given the zzso plasticity of the brain one could assume that recovery could be facilitated by the harnessing of mechanisms underlying zzso zzso Currently it is not clear how this reorganization can be zzso Novel technology based zzso techniques hold promise to address this zzso Here we describe a zzso Reality zzso based system, the Rehabilitation zzso System zzso that is based on a number of hypotheses on the zzso mechanisms underlying recovery, the structure of training and the role of zzso We investigate the zzso of the zzso in stroke patients and healthy zzso 

We describe the key components of the zzso and the zzso of one rehabilitation scenario called zzso We performed trials with 21 zzso stroke patients and 20 healthy controls to study the effect of the training parameters on task zzso This allowed us to develop a zzso Training zzso zzso for online adjustment of task zzso In addition, we studied task transfer between physical and virtual zzso Finally, we assessed the zzso and acceptance of the zzso as a rehabilitation zzso 

We show that the zzso implemented in zzso allows us to effectively adjust the difficulty and the parameters of the task to the user by capturing specific features of the movements of the zzso The results reported here also show a consistent transfer of movement zzso between physical and virtual zzso Moreover, our zzso assessment shows that the zzso is highly accepted by stroke patients as a rehabilitation zzso 

We introduce a novel zzso based paradigm for zzso zzso which combines specific zzso principles with a zzso evaluation to provide a personalized and automated zzso Our results show that the zzso effectively adjusts to the individual features of the user, allowing for an zzso deployment of individualized rehabilitation zzso
