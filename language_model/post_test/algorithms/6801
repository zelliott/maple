The relative energy response of zzso and zzso zzso zzso chambers to zzso zzso beams from the zzso zzso indicates significant differences between these two types of zzso In 16 zzso beams of zzso zzso differences of about zzso are zzso The results are expressed as ratios zzso of the beam quality correction factors zzso where the zzso factor for each type of chamber is the ratio of the absorbed dose to water zzso factor zzso at the zzso quality Q to that at zzso These results have implications for the use of generic zzso factors in zzso protocols and suggest that zzso and zzso zzso chambers cannot be assumed to be zzso
