A 115 compound zzso for zzso binding is divided into the training set and the test set based on molecular similarity and cluster zzso Both zzso zzso connectivity zzso and zzso similarity measures were applied to this zzso Four different zzso schemes zzso zzso zzso zzso were applied to the test set based on the similarity measures of each compound to the compounds in the training zzso The first zzso scheme zzso predicts the binding affinity of a test compound using only the most similar training set zzso binding zzso This scheme has relatively poor zzso based both on zzso zzso connectivity zzso similarity measures and zzso similarity zzso The other three zzso schemes zzso zzso zzso which assign a weighting zzso to each of the zzso most similar training set compounds, have reasonable zzso of a test zzso The zzso scheme which zzso the most similar compounds into different weighted clusters predicts the test set zzso The zzso provide 36 different individual zzso type molecular similarity zzso This study supports that some types of similarity measures are highly similar to one another for this zzso Both the zzso zzso connectivity zzso similarity measures and the zzso have nearly same zzso for this particular zzso
