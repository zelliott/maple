We present here a method for zzso an optical see-through zzso display zzso using techniques usually applied to camera zzso zzso Using a camera placed inside the zzso to take pictures simultaneously of a tracked object and features in the zzso display, we could exploit established camera zzso techniques to recover both the intrinsic and zzso properties of the zzso zzso zzso focal zzso zzso zzso and principal ray of the zzso Our method gives low zzso errors and, unlike existing methods, involves no time-consuming and zzso human zzso nor any prior estimates about the zzso zzso
