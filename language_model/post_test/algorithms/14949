A zzso neural network has been used to predict protein secondary structure based on the position specific scoring zzso generated by zzso Despite the simplicity and convenience of the approach used, the results are found to be superior to those produced by other methods, including the popular zzso method according to our own zzso results and the results from the recent Critical Assessment of zzso for zzso zzso zzso experiment zzso where the method was evaluated by stringent blind zzso Using a new testing set based on a set of zzso unique zzso and three-way zzso based on structural similarity criteria rather than sequence similarity criteria used previously (no similar folds were present in both the testing and training zzso the method presented here zzso achieved an average zzso score of between zzso to zzso depending on the precise definition of observed secondary structure used, which is the highest published score for any method to zzso Given the success of the method in zzso it is reasonable to be confident that the evaluation presented here gives a fair indication of the performance of the method in zzso
