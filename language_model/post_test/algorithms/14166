This study focuses on understanding the impact of zzso zzso zzso delivery effects when applied to plans generated by commercial zzso systems such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Medical zzso These commercial planning systems have had several version upgrades (with improvements in the zzso zzso but the zzso delivery effects have not been incorporated into the zzso zzso zzso delivery effects include zzso zzso from zzso fields, transmission through leaves and the effect of the rounded shape of the leaf zzso They are usually accounted for after zzso when leaf sequencing the zzso zzso profiles, to derive the delivered zzso zzso The study was divided into two main zzso zzso zzso the dose distribution within the zzso volume zzso produced by each of the commercial zzso systems, after the delivered zzso had been zzso to deliver the correct dose to the zzso and zzso studying the impact of the zzso delivery technique on the surrounding critical zzso such as the spinal cord, zzso zzso zzso zzso The study was performed for zzso of zzso the zzso and zzso the prostate and pelvic zzso An zzso case was planned with the zzso planning system for zzso delivery, via zzso fields zzso and zzso using the zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso A prostate and pelvic zzso zzso plan was performed with the zzso system for a dynamic delivery zzso using the zzso zzso Millennium zzso In these commercial planning systems, since zzso delivery effects are not included into the zzso process, zzso zzso is required such that the median delivered zzso dose equals the initial prescribed zzso zzso In preparing the optimum zzso profile for delivery, the zzso dose has been zzso by the zzso delivery zzso In the case of the zzso the critical organ, spinal cord, received a greater dose than initially planned, due to the delivery zzso The increase in the spinal zzso dose is of the order of 2-3 zzso In the case of the prostate and pelvic zzso the zzso delivery effects led to an increase of approximately 2 zzso in the dose delivered to the secondary zzso the pelvic zzso In addition to this, the small zzso zzso and zzso received an increased dose of the order of 2-3 zzso to 50% of their total zzso zzso delivery techniques strongly influence the delivered dose zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso sites and these effects are not yet accounted for in the zzso and the zzso planning zzso Currently, they must be taken into account during the zzso stage by altering the dose limits accepted during zzso so that the final zzso dose is within the zzso
