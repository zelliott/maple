zzso alignment zzso all of comparative zzso yet it remains an incompletely solved zzso In particular, the statistical uncertainty within zzso alignments is often zzso while zzso or zzso zzso are considered meaningless without confidence zzso Here, we report on a theoretical and simulation study of zzso alignments of zzso DNA at zzso zzso We find that zzso of aligned bases are incorrect in existing zzso zzso and we identify three types of alignment error, each leading to systematic biases in all zzso zzso zzso modeling of the evolutionary process improves alignment zzso however, these improvements are modest compared with the remaining alignment zzso even with exact knowledge of the evolutionary model, emphasizing the need for statistical approaches to account for zzso We develop a new algorithm, zzso zzso Decoding zzso which explicitly accounts for zzso is less biased and more accurate than other zzso we consider, and reduces the proportion of zzso bases by a third compared with the best existing zzso To our knowledge, this is the first zzso zzso for DNA sequence alignment to show robust improvements over the classic zzso zzso Despite this, considerable uncertainty remains even in the improved zzso We conclude that a zzso treatment is essential, both to improve alignment quality and to zzso the remaining zzso This is becoming increasingly relevant with the growing appreciation of the importance of zzso DNA, whose study relies heavily on zzso zzso errors are inevitable, and should be considered when drawing conclusions from zzso Software and alignments to assist researchers in doing this are provided at zzso
