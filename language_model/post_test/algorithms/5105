Of all available reconstruction methods, statistical zzso reconstruction zzso appear particularly promising since they enable accurate physical noise zzso The newly developed zzso zzso sensing zzso zzso has shown the potential to accurately reconstruct images from highly zzso zzso The zzso zzso can be implemented in the statistical reconstruction framework as zzso In this study, we compared the performance of two standard statistical reconstruction zzso zzso weighted least squares and zzso to the zzso zzso In assessing the image quality using these zzso zzso it is critical to zzso realistic background anatomy as the reconstruction results are object zzso A zzso head was scanned on a zzso Trilogy system at different dose zzso Several figures of merit including the relative root mean square error and a quality factor which accounts for the noise performance and the spatial resolution were introduced to zzso evaluate reconstruction zzso A comparison is presented between the three zzso for a constant zzso factor comparing different zzso at several dose zzso To facilitate this comparison, the original zzso method was formulated in the framework of the statistical image reconstruction zzso Important conclusions of the zzso from our studies are that zzso for realistic zzso over 100 projections are required to avoid streak artifacts in the reconstructed images even with zzso zzso zzso regardless of the zzso zzso it is beneficial to distribute the total dose to more views as long as each view remains quantum noise limited and zzso the total zzso zzso method is not appropriate for very low dose levels because while it can mitigate zzso artifacts, the images exhibit zzso behavior, which is potentially harmful for medical zzso
