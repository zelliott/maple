The use of chronic zzso zzso zzso has become increasingly prevalent in zzso zzso However, it is not obvious whether zzso signals obtained over multiple recording sessions come from the same or different zzso Here, we develop a criterion to assess zzso stability by measuring the similarity of 1) average spike zzso and 2) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was recorded from four Utah zzso implanted in primary motor and zzso zzso in three zzso zzso monkeys during 10 recording sessions over a zzso to zzso zzso A unit was defined as stable through a given day if the stability criterion was satisfied on all recordings leading up to that zzso We found that 57% of the original units were stable through 7 days, zzso were stable through 10 days, and zzso were stable through 15 zzso Moreover, stable units were more likely to remain stable in subsequent recording sessions zzso zzso of the zzso that were stable through four sessions remained stable on the zzso Using both zzso and zzso data instead of just zzso improved performance by reducing the number of false zzso We also demonstrate that this method can be used to track zzso across days, even during adaptation to a zzso zzso zzso a stable subset of zzso should allow the study of long-term learning effects across days and has practical implications for pooling of behavioral data across days and for increasing the effectiveness of zzso zzso
