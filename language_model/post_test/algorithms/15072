We developed a relief strategy for assigning zzso zzso to zzso operating zzso The strategy relies on a statistical method which analyzes historical case zzso available from surgical services information systems to estimate the expected zzso remaining hours in cases after they have zzso We tested our relief strategy by comparing the number of hours that zzso zzso would work overtime if zzso zzso were assigned using our strategy versus if the zzso coordinator knew in advance the exact amount of time remaining in each zzso Our relief strategy resulted in zzso to zzso more overtime hours for zzso zzso than the theoretical zzso as would have been obtained had perfect retrospective knowledge been zzso Few additional staff hours would have been saved by supplementing our relief strategy with other methods to monitor case zzso zzso real-time patient tracking systems or closed circuit cameras in operating zzso 

A relief strategy that relies only on analyzing historical case zzso from an operating room information system to predict the time remaining in cases performs well at minimizing zzso staffing zzso
