zzso cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in Swiss men and the second leading cause of cancer related death among them zzso zzso zzso in year zzso With the population at risk constantly growing these absolute numbers are expected to further zzso While there is no question that aggressive treatment of zzso zzso is required for definitive cure of prostate cancer, the application of screening for early stage disease remains zzso Since 1998 the Clinic of zzso in zzso zzso has participated in the zzso zzso zzso Study of zzso for zzso zzso study, which is designed to provide data on prostate cancer screening within a prospective zzso controlled zzso 

Men aged between 55 and 70 years were enrolled in the zzso From zzso zzso zzso men invited by a letter to participate, zzso zzso agreed and gave their informed consent to be zzso in either a zzso measurement zzso zzso zzso group 1) or a control group zzso zzso zzso group zzso Men in group 1 with a zzso level zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso then underwent ultrasound guided zzso zzso biopsy of the zzso 

zzso cancer was detected at presentation in every fourth man zzso zzso zzso zzso Neither the zzso zzso ratio nor the zzso density could significantly spare zzso while sustaining a high sensitivity zzso The overall cancer detection rate amounted to zzso in zzso tested zzso In zzso zzso zzso 5) distant disease was already zzso zzso of men with clinically organ confined disease underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso whilst only zzso zzso 3) chose to follow a policy of watchful zzso In zzso the zzso of the zzso specimens revealed aggressive cancer characteristics according to the criteria of Epstein et zzso 

Although the clinically relevant zzso characteristics and the relatively low cancer detection rate of zzso (less than the lifetime mortality risk of zzso and the morbidity risk of zzso seem to justify screening in terms of adequate diagnosis and treatment, follow-up until 2008 is needed to prove the benefit in mortality for the prostate cancer screening group over the control zzso Furthermore, information from the ongoing zzso study is needed in order to assess uncertainties zzso the degree of overdiagnosis caused by repeated screening and the quality of life adjusted gain in life zzso For daily practice a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso can no longer be zzso as only zzso of men in this range presented with organ confined zzso Once the zzso level exceeds zzso zzso prostate biopsy should be performed zzso
