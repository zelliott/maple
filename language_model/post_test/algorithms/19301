We present a mathematical model for the growth and length regulation of the filament of the zzso motor of zzso zzso Under the assumption that the molecular constituents are zzso into the nascent filament by an zzso and then move by molecular diffusion to the growing end, we find a zzso decreasing relationship between the speed and the zzso of growth that is zzso zzso to length for a large zzso This gives qualitative but not quantitative agreement with data of the zzso of zzso We also propose that the length of filaments is zzso by the rate of zzso of the zzso zzso using negative feedback, and present a mathematical model of this regulatory zzso The combination of this regulatory network with the zzso rate of growth enable the zzso to detect length zzso and zzso severed zzso zzso
