The present investigation focuses on the development of an effective strategy to determine the optimum environmental conditions leading to the maximum rate of zzso of zzso by zzso response surface methodology zzso with a developed genetic zzso zzso thereby ensuring minimum contact zzso zzso is zzso to create an efficient zzso model for zzso of zzso in terms of environmental zzso zzso temperature, zzso activity and time of zzso For this purpose, a number of degradation experiments based on statistical zzso Box zzso design methods were carried zzso An effective response surface zzso model is developed by carrying out experiments designed using the Box zzso zzso The zzso model thus developed is further zzso with the zzso to zzso the degradation conditions for optimum degradation with minimum contact zzso The zzso increases the zzso conditions to zzso within a time period of zzso within the given range of experimental zzso The conditions obtained from zzso were verified zzso
