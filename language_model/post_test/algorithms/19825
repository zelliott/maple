This paper addresses the introduction of a new Human zzso zzso zzso sensor for guide zzso Guide robots for geriatric patients or the visually impaired should follow user's control command, keeping a certain desired distance allowing the user to work zzso zzso it is necessary to acquire control commands and a user's position on a real-time zzso We suggest a new sensor fusion system to achieve this objective and we will call this sensor the zzso zzso The objective of the intelligent lead is to acquire a stable distance from the user to the robot, zzso volume and zzso volume, even when the robot platform with the intelligent lead is shaken on uneven zzso In this paper we explain a precise zzso Kalman zzso zzso procedure for zzso The intelligent lead physically consists of a zzso zzso the serial linkage attached with eight rotary zzso and an zzso zzso zzso Unit) and their zzso are fused by the zzso A mobile robot was designed to test the performance of the proposed sensor zzso After installing the intelligent lead in the mobile robot, several tests are conducted to verify that the mobile robot with the intelligent lead is capable of achieving its goal points while maintaining the appropriate distance between the robot and the zzso The results show that we can use the intelligent lead proposed in this paper as a new zzso sensor joined a zzso and a distance measure in the mobile environments such as the robot and the user are moving at the same zzso
