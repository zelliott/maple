We present a simple method, zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from an zzso set of two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso based on the principle of quantitative J zzso The primary advantage of the zzso method over other methods is the ability to measure zzso without zzso peak positions or altering the narrow line zzso characteristic of zzso zzso zzso of the method is demonstrated for the model system zzso Application to the zzso core domain of zzso zzso a 36 zzso zzso with zzso spectral zzso demonstrates its practical zzso Precision of the zzso measurement is limited by the zzso ratio, zzso achievable in the zzso zzso spectrum, and is approximately given by zzso zzso
