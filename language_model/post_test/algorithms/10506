zzso circulatory zzso zzso have been widely used to test left zzso assist zzso The zzso properties of the mock systemic zzso system are usually described by two alternative zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso model, their zzso especially the zzso term, are much more difficult to zzso In this paper, an zzso based on the zzso zzso Kalman filter zzso zzso is proposed to identify model zzso zzso of these parameters for different zzso is zzso Performance of the zzso for different model structures is first evaluated using zzso simulation data contaminated with artificial zzso An zzso is developed to test the proposed zzso zzso estimates for different models are compared with the calculated values derived from the mechanical and zzso properties of the zzso to validate model zzso In conclusion, the zzso model with an zzso and an zzso characteristic resistance arranged in series is proposed to represent the mock systemic zzso zzso Once model structure is appropriately selected, zzso can provide reasonable zzso accuracy in a limited time and may be helpful for future clinical zzso
