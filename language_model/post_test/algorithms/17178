In order to acquire a zzso young children must segment speech into words, even though most words are unfamiliar to zzso This is a zzso task because speech lacks any acoustic analog of the blank spaces between printed zzso Two sources of information that might be useful for this task are zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso refers to the zzso that sound sequences that occur frequently and in a variety of contexts are better candidates for the lexicon than those that occur rarely or in few zzso We express that zzso formally by a class of functions called DR zzso We then put forth three zzso First, that children segment using DR zzso Second, that they exploit zzso constraints on the possible zzso of words in their zzso Specifically, they exploit both the requirement that every word must have a vowel and the constraints that languages impose on zzso and zzso consonant zzso Third, that children learn which zzso clusters are permitted in their language by assuming that all permissible zzso clusters will eventually occur at zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we investigate the effectiveness of these strategies for zzso broad phonetic transcripts of zzso zzso The results show that DR functions and zzso constraints can be used to significantly improve zzso Further, the contributions of DR functions and zzso constraints are largely independent, so using both yields better zzso than using either one zzso Finally, learning the permissible zzso clusters from zzso boundaries does not degrade zzso zzso
