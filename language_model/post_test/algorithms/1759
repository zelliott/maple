zzso proteins play an important role in most cellular zzso such as gene regulation, zzso repair, zzso and DNA zzso In this article, an optimal zzso zzso zzso acid composition zzso based on zzso characters of zzso acid is proposed to represent proteins for identifying zzso zzso Six zzso characters of zzso acids are zzso to generate the sequence features via the web server zzso The optimal values of two important parameters zzso factor zzso and weighting factor zzso about zzso are determined to get the appropriate representation of zzso which ultimately result in better prediction zzso Experimental results on the benchmark zzso using random forest show that our method is really promising to predict zzso proteins and may at least be a useful supplement tool to existing zzso
