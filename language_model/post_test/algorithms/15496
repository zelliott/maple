We discuss an zzso approach through which the neural symbols and corresponding stimulus space of a zzso or neural ensemble can be discovered simultaneously and zzso making few assumptions about the nature of the code or relevant zzso The basis for this approach is to zzso a neural coding scheme as a collection of zzso classes akin to a dictionary or zzso with each class corresponding to a spike pattern zzso and its corresponding stimulus feature in the zzso The neural zzso is derived by zzso the neural responses into a small reproduction set, and zzso the zzso to minimize an zzso distortion zzso We apply this approach to the analysis of coding in sensory zzso of a simple zzso sensory zzso For a simple sensory characteristic zzso zzso we demonstrate a case for which the classical definition of tuning does not describe adequately the performance of the cell zzso Considering a more involved sensory operation zzso zzso we also show that, for some cells in this system, a significant amount of information is zzso in patterns of spikes that would not be discovered through analyses based on linear zzso zzso
