In this paper, an optimal and robust design method to implement a zzso zzso zzso system is zzso The zzso zzso consists of a zzso chip for sensing the external acceleration and a zzso chip for signal zzso An zzso design method to determine the device zzso the zzso zzso and the vertical gap length of the M zzso sensing element is applied to minimize the fundamental noise level and also to achieve the zzso to the fabrication zzso In order to cancel out the offset and gain variations due to zzso zzso and process variations, a digitally zzso architecture consisting of an 11 bit zzso array is adopted in the analog front-end of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso has the scale factor of zzso zzso zzso the output zzso of zzso zzso zzso the input range of zzso g and a bias instability of 122 zzso zzso The zzso ratio and the noise equivalent resolution are measured to be zzso zzso zzso and 180 zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso sensitivities are measured to be zzso and zzso of the zzso sensitivity, zzso The results show that the optimal and robust design method for the zzso sensing element and the highly zzso capacity of the zzso zzso zzso circuit are suitable to enhance the zzso uniformity of the packaged zzso without compromising the performance zzso
