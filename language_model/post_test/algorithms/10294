The occurrence of so-called sticking points in a lift is pervasive in weight training zzso zzso complex exercises often exhibit zzso variation of effective force exerted against the load as a function of the zzso and zzso of the zzso This results in a variety of possible zzso for the occurrence of sticking points and makes the problem of designing the optimal training strategy to overcome them zzso In this article a case founded on theoretical grounds is made against a purely empirical zzso It is argued that the nature of the problem considered and the wide range of variables involved limit the zzso of conclusions which can be drawn from experimental studies zzso Instead an alternative is zzso zzso a recently proposed mathematical model of zzso adaptation is employed in a series of computer zzso These are used to examine zzso the effects of differently targeted partial range of motion zzso training zzso zzso and in contrast to common training practices, the key novel insight zzso from the obtained results is that in some cases the most effective approach for improving performance in an exercise with a sticking point at a particular point in the zzso is to improve force production capability at a different and possibly remote position in the zzso In the context of the employed model, this result is explained by changes in the zzso and zzso environment for force zzso
