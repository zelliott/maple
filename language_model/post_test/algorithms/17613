We present the first global zzso sequencing zzso for the de zzso determination of short zzso acid zzso The method compares the zzso zzso zzso generated by zzso zzso of multiply charged zzso to the zzso values predicted employing established fragmentation pathways from a known reference zzso The closeness of matching between the measured spectrum and the predicted set of zzso zzso is characterized by the zzso which takes into account the difference between measured and predicted zzso values, the intensity of the zzso zzso the number of fragments zzso and the number of zzso positions not covered by zzso zzso in the experimental zzso Smaller values for the fitness indicate a closer match between the measured spectrum and predicted zzso zzso In order to find the sequence most closely matching the experimental spectrum, starting from a given zzso composition all possible zzso sequences are assembled followed by identification of the correct sequence by the lowest fitness zzso Using this concept, sequences of zzso to zzso zzso were successfully de zzso zzso High sequence coverage with zzso zzso was essential for obtaining unequivocal sequencing zzso Moreover, the collision energy was shown to have an impact on the zzso of tandem mass zzso by the de zzso sequencing zzso zzso revealed that the optimal collision energy should be set to a value just sufficient for complete fragmentation of the precursor zzso
