zzso fluid dynamic zzso analysis of the zzso flow in the combustion chamber of a solid waste zzso provides crucial insight into the zzso zzso However, the zzso of the gas flow with the burning waste has not been adequately treated in many zzso zzso A strategy for a combined simulation of the waste combustion and the gas flow in the furnace is introduced zzso When coupled with zzso a model of the waste combustion in the bed provides the inlet conditions for the gas flow field and receives the zzso heat flux onto the bed from the furnace wall and gaseous zzso An unsteady one-dimensional bed model was used for the test zzso in which the moving bed was treated as a packed bed of homogeneous fuel zzso The simulation results show the physical processes of the waste combustion and its interaction with the gas flow for various operational zzso
