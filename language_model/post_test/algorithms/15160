We study the zzso of zzso evolution strategies for the problem of zzso a linear function with a single linear zzso Two zzso of the zzso are zzso a strategy that zzso zzso candidate solutions and one that applies a simple repair zzso zzso expressions that describe the zzso zzso zzso are derived and used in a simple zzso order model for the steady state attained when operating with constant step zzso zzso to the analysis of cumulative step size adaptation, the approach provides an intuitive explanation for the qualitative difference in the zzso zzso zzso The findings have implications for the design of constraint handling techniques to be used in connection with cumulative step size zzso
