The problem of predicting sets of components of zzso protein complexes is a challenging problem in Systems zzso There have been many tools proposed to predict those zzso Among them, zzso a protein complex prediction zzso based on the zzso algorithm, is reported to outperform other zzso In this work, we improve zzso by refining scoring functions and a proposal distribution used inside the zzso so that predicted clusters are more accurate as well as the resulting zzso runs zzso The new version is called zzso In zzso experiments, zzso is shown to outperform other tools including zzso The zzso score of zzso is zzso which is at least zzso higher than those of the other zzso In addition, about zzso of the predicted clusters that are zzso with any known complexes are statistically significant on the biological process aspect of Gene zzso Furthermore, the running time is reduced to zzso minutes, which is zzso of that of zzso
