zzso rates of early zzso zzso zzso are high, and avoidance of late complications and second zzso have become increasingly zzso This comparative treatment planning study analyzes to what extent target volume reduction to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso and three-dimensional zzso zzso can reduce doses to zzso at risk zzso 

Based on 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso of patients with early zzso zzso zzso we created treatment plans for zzso and zzso for both the IF and IN according to the guidelines of the German zzso Study Group zzso As zzso we defined heart, zzso zzso and spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso were evaluated for planning target volumes zzso and zzso 

Average zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Mean doses to the zzso were almost identical for all zzso For zzso conformity was better with zzso and zzso was better with zzso Mean doses to the heart zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and spinal zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso were reduced by zzso whereas mean doses to lung zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and breasts zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and right zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso were zzso Volume exposed to high doses was smaller for zzso whereas volume exposed to low doses was smaller for zzso zzso benefits of zzso were observed for patients with zzso zzso anterior to the zzso zzso achieved substantially better values than zzso for almost all zzso zzso zzso dose reduction of zzso to zzso regardless of radiation zzso 

Reduction of target volume to IN most effectively improves zzso zzso but is still considered zzso For the time being, zzso should be considered for large zzso especially when the anterior zzso is zzso
