zzso zzso zzso and diffuse optical imaging zzso are finding widespread application in the study of human brain zzso motivating further zzso development of the zzso zzso and zzso offer the potential to zzso changes in zzso zzso and total zzso zzso zzso thus enabling distinction of oxygen consumption and blood flow changes during brain zzso While the techniques implemented presently provide important results for zzso and the zzso through their relative measures of zzso and zzso zzso there is much to be done to improve sensitivity, zzso and zzso In this paper, we review the advances currently being made and issues to consider for improving optical image zzso These include the optimal selection of zzso to minimize random and systematic error propagation in the calculation of the zzso zzso the filtering of systemic zzso signal clutter to improve sensitivity to the zzso response to brain zzso the zzso of overlapping zzso to improve image spatial resolution and zzso and the zzso of spatial prior information from structural and functional zzso to reduce zzso partial volume error and improve image quantitative zzso
