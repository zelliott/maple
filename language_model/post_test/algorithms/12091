To compare methods of evaluating zzso zzso in systems that learn from zzso 

The performance of four automatic learning zzso representing current machine learning technology, were assessed using four zzso in the task of separating normal zzso intermediate cervical cells from all other segmented objects in digital zzso Two of the zzso were carefully constructed to model sources of variation associated with the choice of training and test zzso These assessments were statistically compared with assessments using both standard and a modified version of zzso 

The investigation illustrates the tradeoffs involved in obtaining statistical rigor as compared with the cost of collecting zzso While zzso makes frugal use of data, it can produce misleading assessments of zzso performance in terms of both bias and zzso The modified version produces more reliable assessments but in some cases may also be zzso 

We suggest that users of learning zzso should exercise judicious care in evaluating learning zzso performance in order to avoid unnecessary bias and large zzso in their zzso
