One of the most important issues in zzso zzso is to produce a prediction model for the zzso or zzso of biological function of novel protein zzso In order to improve the prediction zzso much attention has been paid to the improvement of the performance of the zzso used, few is for solving the fundamental issue, zzso zzso acid zzso as most existing pattern recognition zzso are unable to recognize zzso acids in protein zzso zzso the most commonly used zzso acid zzso method has the flaw that leads to large zzso cost and recognition zzso 

By replacing kernel functions of support zzso machines zzso with zzso acid similarity measurement zzso we have modified zzso a new type of pattern recognition zzso for zzso protein zzso particularly for zzso zzso site zzso We refer to the modified zzso as zzso zzso zzso When applied to the prediction of zzso zzso zzso sites, the new method has shown a remarkable advantage in reducing the model complexity and enhancing the model zzso
