zzso learning techniques are based on experience zzso In most realistic applications, experience is zzso it implies sensor reading, zzso control and zzso update, constrained by the learning system zzso The information zzso upon which classical learning zzso operate make such problems too difficult and zzso Nonetheless, additional information for zzso the learning process zzso should be embedded in such a way that the zzso well-studied characteristics of these fundamental zzso are zzso We investigate in this article a more general zzso of the zzso method that allows for a spreading of information derived from single updates towards a zzso of the instantly visited state and zzso to zzso We show how this new zzso can be used as a mechanism to safely zzso prior knowledge about the structure of the state space, and demonstrate it in a modified zzso of a reinforcement learning zzso in a real robot navigation zzso
