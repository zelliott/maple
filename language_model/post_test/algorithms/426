In this study, zzso networks have been used to zzso and zzso pulmonary crackles with an aim to depict the zzso with a small set of meaningful zzso Complex zzso zzso are used at the zzso of both single and zzso networks to model the zzso with the zzso rendering smaller modeling zzso The features extracted from the model parameters have been compared with the conventional time domain features in a zzso zzso experiment with nearly zzso matching between the clusters of different zzso sets and with the model parameters forming clusters more closely distributed around their means and better separated from each zzso Moreover, using simulated crackles embedded on real respiratory sounds, features extracted from zzso networks have been shown to be more robust to background zzso sounds compared to conventional parameters which are very sensitive to zzso
