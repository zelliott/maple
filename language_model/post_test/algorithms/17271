The zzso organ is one of a specialized group of zzso structures devoid of a significant zzso barrier, collectively known as the zzso zzso While peptides are normally excluded from access to most regions of the zzso the zzso organ contains zzso with a high density of receptors for many circulating zzso including zzso There is a well-established role for the zzso organ in stimulating the release of zzso and recent evidence suggests that it may also play an important role in zzso the negative feedback actions of zzso The aim of this study was to determine the direct effects of zzso on zzso organ zzso through zzso studies in a zzso zzso organ zzso In zzso studies, bath application of 10 zzso zzso caused zzso in zzso zzso in zzso and no significant change in membrane potential in zzso of zzso zzso We then sought to determine the specific zzso channels involved in regulating the zzso zzso of zzso organ zzso through zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso decreased the peak outward current at zzso zzso by 50% zzso which was blocked by zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on these findings, we carried out a systematic characterization of two zzso organ zzso channels, the delayed zzso zzso and the transient outward current zzso Through zzso isolation of zzso we found that zzso inhibited the zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso also inhibited the peak zzso by zzso zzso These data provide the first evidence of a role for zzso channels in zzso the zzso effects of zzso on zzso organ zzso The exact zzso roles and sources of zzso which may act on zzso organ zzso are not completely understood at zzso
