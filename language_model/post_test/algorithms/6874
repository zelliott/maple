A zzso zzso zzso model for an zzso mixed zzso is developed and then used to zzso the contribution that different zzso sources make to regional fine particle zzso in the South Coast Air zzso surrounding Los Angeles, CA, on September 25, zzso The model simultaneously tracks fine particle zzso zzso zzso particle zzso zzso zzso and other gaseous zzso zzso yielding a tool that can be used to study the control of all of the regulated zzso in the atmosphere within a single unified zzso Model predictions identify geographical areas that are influenced by zzso associated with zzso material other than paved road dust, paved road dust, diesel engines, food cooking, zzso equipped gasoline engines, zzso gasoline engines, combustion of high zzso fuel, other primary particle sources, sea salt, and marine background zzso zzso The contribution that each of these source types makes to regional fine particle zzso is zzso reflecting the unique chemical zzso spatial distribution, and zzso trends of primary zzso The single largest contribution to regional zzso in the South Coast Air zzso surrounding Los Angeles is associated with the zzso of secondary ammonium nitrate on background marine zzso zzso This pattern indicates that control of zzso zzso in Los Angeles must be accomplished through a program that includes both reductions in the emissions of gaseous precursors of secondary zzso as well as control of primary particle zzso
