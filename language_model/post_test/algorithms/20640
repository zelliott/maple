When the effect is studied of a factor like zzso zzso on linear zzso growth, the zzso consequence of age and gender on size cannot be zzso The zzso correct solution is division of the study group into smaller units, each of which is homogeneous with respect to age, zzso and therapy, and to compare these with matched zzso Yet, apart from matched controls being hard to find, this method of subdivision has the serious drawback that smaller groups decrease statistical zzso A solution without the need to create zzso lies in the application of multiple linear zzso zzso It has been applied to biological data in other studies, but zzso of the outcome has not been reported so zzso Indeed, testing the mathematical assumptions underlying the zzso model created zzso obstacles and, therefore, it was decided to perform zzso by means of practical zzso Two separate tests for the zzso of the multiple linear zzso method, on different data, with differing predictor sets, and with different control samples have been zzso
