zzso blood pumps have been considered effective permanently zzso zzso However, control of such pumps is quite zzso zzso control of pump flow is required because no invasive flow or pressure sensors are zzso Whereas insufficient pump output can cause zzso and should be avoided, zzso may cause zzso collapse and must be zzso An intelligent zzso control zzso is highly desirable to reach optimal pump output based on zzso zzso We present an intelligent zzso control mechanism for the blood pump allowing it to achieve normal zzso zzso control of pump flow is gained by analysis of the electric motor current and zzso The required pump output flow is chosen based on heart rate, and an intelligent fuzzy logic based control mechanism is developed to adjust the motor input so that the pump output can reach required flow while also preventing the occurrence of zzso zzso or zzso zzso Computer simulation was carried out, and the results indicate that the proposed zzso can achieve required pump flow to obtain normal zzso whereas zzso can be prevented to provide safe zzso
