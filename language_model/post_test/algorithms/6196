On the basis of maximum weighted matching zzso algorithm, we introduced a dynamic weight related with stem length and used a zzso zzso to predict zzso secondary structures by searching the stem structure with maximum weight zzso zzso This zzso not only avoids the complicated free energy zzso but also it could attain higher prediction zzso Moreover, our zzso can predict most types of potential zzso in the zzso zzso
