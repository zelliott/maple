New zzso drugs are being developed and many clinical trials evaluating the benefits of zzso drugs for the secondary prevention of zzso events in patients with zzso vascular disease have been zzso 

An updated systematic review and evidence-based guidelines for the appropriate selection of zzso drugs may be beneficial to physicians and zzso organizations attempting to create or update current clinical practice guidelines or clinical pathways aimed at caring for these zzso 

zzso A systematic review of the recent literature on the relative efficacy and safety of zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso an zzso expert panel approach using a modified zzso technique to create explicit guidelines for prescribing zzso therapy was zzso and zzso the recommendations of an expert panel were zzso 

Consensus guidelines were developed for the zzso of zzso zzso or zzso for the prevention of zzso events in patients with manifestations of zzso vascular disease zzso zzso zzso prior zzso stroke, or established peripheral zzso disease) who are at increased risk for zzso zzso zzso Based on efficacy and safety, zzso was recommended as the drug of choice for patients with established peripheral zzso zzso aspirin or zzso should be considered in patients with prior zzso zzso (with zzso favored for patients who have had a zzso event while on aspirin or in whom aspirin is zzso aspirin or zzso should be considered as zzso treatment in patients with prior zzso zzso zzso zzso is the favored drug in patients in whom other zzso drugs are either zzso or who have had zzso events while on zzso 

zzso zzso zzso stroke, and peripheral zzso disease are all clinical manifestations of the same underlying disease process zzso with zzso formation on the disrupted zzso plaque zzso being a common zzso factor of zzso events in patients suffering from these zzso An evidence-based approach was used to develop a practice zzso based on available published evidence, for the appropriate zzso of zzso agents zzso zzso or zzso These guidelines may be of use to multidisciplinary teams wishing to create or update clinical guidelines or clinical pathways which address the care of patients with zzso vascular zzso New zzso agents such as zzso may be more effective and associated with lower risk of selected adverse effects (such as gastrointestinal distress, gastrointestinal zzso and zzso than those previously used to prevent zzso formation in the setting of zzso zzso zzso Combination zzso therapy is being evaluated as an option for those patients who experience zzso events on a single zzso zzso
