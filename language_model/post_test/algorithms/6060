An zzso zzso structure prediction approach adapted to the zzso zzso complex zzso class I system is zzso Based on structure comparisons of a large set of zzso class I complexes, a molecular dynamics protocol is proposed using simulated zzso zzso cycles to sample the zzso space of the zzso in its fixed zzso zzso A set of 14 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 27 zzso zzso complexes for which X-ray structures are available is used to test the accuracy of the prediction zzso For each complex, 1000 zzso zzso are obtained from the zzso zzso A graph theory zzso zzso based on heavy atom zzso zzso zzso values is applied to the sampled zzso The clusters are ranked using cluster size, mean effective or zzso free zzso with zzso free energies zzso using zzso Born zzso 2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The final zzso is chosen as the center of the zzso zzso With zzso free zzso the overall prediction success is zzso using a zzso zzso crystal zzso criterion for zzso zzso and zzso using a zzso zzso zzso criterion for heavy zzso The prediction success is even higher for the set of 14 zzso zzso zzso zzso of the peptides have zzso zzso values zzso or zzso zzso and zzso of the peptides have heavy atom zzso values zzso or zzso zzso This structure prediction method can be applied to complexes of natural or modified zzso peptides in their zzso environment with the aim to perform rational zzso zzso of tumor zzso
