In this chapter we illustrate the methodology for zzso zzso flux zzso Central to this is developing an end to end data pipeline, crucial for zzso the wet lab experiments and zzso combining hardware and software automation, and zzso data representation providing zzso and exporters to support third party zzso The use of existing software at the start, data extraction from the zzso and the end, zzso analysis, allows for the most flexibility in this zzso zzso zzso provided a standard, zzso platform independent tool to act as the zzso between these end zzso Most zzso this tool can be easily adapted to support different data formats, data zzso and data correction steps allowing it to be central to managing the data necessary for zzso zzso An additional tool was needed to automate the zzso software and in particular to take advantage of the course zzso parallel nature of zzso analysis and available high performance computing zzso combination these methods show the development of zzso pipelines that allow zzso flux analysis to join as a full member of the zzso zzso
