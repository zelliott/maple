zzso fitting by the expectation zzso zzso method is presented to zzso zzso zzso recorded using an zzso detector for a water monitoring zzso The zzso of the method was tested by zzso measured zzso taken using an industry standard 3'' zzso 3'' zzso zzso detector in a model water tank with several zzso zzso The results show significant removal of the Compton zzso counts and efficient transfer of the counts into the corresponding zzso The zzso count ratio and the number of counts in the zzso in the zzso zzso increased approximately zzso and zzso times, respectively, compared with those of measured zzso taken using an zzso zzso detector in the case of zzso
