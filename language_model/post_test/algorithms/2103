To date, most functional imaging centers have relied on zzso imaging approaches such as zzso imaging zzso techniques for acquiring functional brain zzso zzso These methods require specialized hardware and are not yet installed widely on clinical MR zzso thus limiting the application of functional MR imaging at many zzso zzso is used to limit motion artifacts and to collect multiple images under different task zzso in order to distinguish reliably true signal changes from zzso However, it suffers from poor signal to noise ratio because of the high sampling bandwidth zzso This work presents an approach for increasing the efficiency of functional studies that use conventional zzso echo zzso In this approach, small numbers of image data sets are acquired and zzso to generate composite zzso with minimized motion zzso The technique is introduced, and several zzso for combining the data are zzso A receiver operator characteristic analysis and in zzso studies are performed to examine the efficacy of this approach for improving functional MR imaging zzso
