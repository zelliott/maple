Typical time intervals between acquisitions of three-dimensional zzso images of the same cell in live cell imaging are in the orders of zzso In the meantime, the live cell can move in a water basin on the zzso This movement can hamper the studies of zzso zzso We propose a fast zzso image registration method for the suppression of the movement of a cell as a whole in the image zzso First, zzso of certain zzso objects are zzso for each image in a zzso zzso Then, a matching between the zzso which have the zzso number of pairs, is sought between consecutive point sets by a 3-D extension of a two-dimensional fast point pattern matching method, which is zzso to zzso translation, local zzso and zzso zzso The proposed 3-D extension assumes zzso only around the zzso axis to retain the complexity of the original zzso The final step involves computing the optimal fully 3-D transformation between images from corresponding points in the zzso zzso The zzso of the method was evaluated on generated zzso The results of the simulations show that the method is very precise and its correctness can be zzso This article also presents two practical application examples, namely the registration of images of zzso zzso and the registration of images of zzso More than zzso of zzso images were successfully zzso The results show that the method is very well suited to live cell zzso
