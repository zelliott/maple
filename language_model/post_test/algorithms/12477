zzso factor binds to sequence specific sites in regulatory region to control nearby zzso zzso It is termed as the major regulator of zzso However, identifying DNA binding preference of zzso factors systematically is still a zzso By using the nearest neighbor algorithm, a novel zzso approach was developed to predict zzso factor DNA binding preference based on the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso Ball, zzso Blake, zzso Botstein, zzso Butler, zzso Cherry, zzso Davis, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Harris, zzso Hill, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Lewis, zzso zzso zzso Richardson, zzso zzso zzso Rubin, zzso Sherlock, Gene zzso tool for the unification of biology, zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso and zzso zzso system of zzso The overall success rate of zzso zzso test for our predictor reaches zzso which indicates the DNA binding preference is closely correlated with its biological functions and zzso method developed in this contribution could be a powerful tool to investigate zzso factor DNA binding zzso especially for those novel zzso factors with little prior knowledge on its DNA binding zzso
