Assessment of zzso zzso using zzso tools based on zzso sequences zzso poorly with results provided by zzso zzso zzso particularly for recognizing zzso zzso This may represent an obstacle for the use of zzso zzso An zzso combining several zzso tools might improve the correlation with zzso zzso zzso A total of 200 zzso sequences from zzso zzso B, available in several databases with known zzso zzso results, were used to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of seven different zzso tools zzso zzso zzso decision tree generator and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The best zzso zzso tools were identified, and a model combining several of these was zzso Using the 200 reference zzso zzso and zzso showed the highest sensitivity for detecting zzso viruses zzso and zzso zzso however, their specificity was relatively low zzso and zzso zzso For zzso zzso zzso and zzso gave the same results and outperformed other zzso tools zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso When results from three out of these four tools were zzso the sensitivity and zzso taking as reference the results from zzso zzso zzso were over zzso in predicting either zzso or zzso viruses zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso combining four distinct zzso tools zzso zzso zzso and zzso improves the zzso prediction of zzso zzso and merits further zzso as it might prove useful as a screening strategy in clinical zzso
