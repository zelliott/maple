The conventional phase difference method for MR zzso suffers from disturbances caused by the presence of zzso zzso zzso error, and field zzso A signal model is presented with zzso zzso echo zzso sequence using a fat signal as an internal reference to overcome these zzso The internal reference signal model is fit to the water and fat signals by the extended zzso zzso and the zzso zzso to estimate the chemical shifts between water and fat which contain temperature zzso A noise analysis of the signal model was conducted using the zzso lower bound to evaluate the noise performance of various zzso the effects of imaging zzso and the influence of the zzso signal ratio in a sample on the temperature zzso zzso of the calculated temperature map and zzso temperature zzso shows that the maximum temperature zzso error is zzso degrees C, with a standard zzso of zzso degrees C, confirming the feasibility of this zzso temperature mapping zzso The influence of sample zzso signal ratio on the accuracy of the temperature estimate is evaluated in a zzso mixed phantom experiment with an optimal ratio of approximately zzso
