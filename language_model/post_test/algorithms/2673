Recent advances in zzso mobile phones have made it possible for users to collect a large number of zzso zzso by recording their location zzso However, these mobile phones with built-in zzso devices usually record far more data than needed, which brings about both heavy data storage and a zzso expensive burden in the rendering process for a Web zzso To address this practical problem, we present a fast zzso approximation zzso in zzso space for the zzso trajectory zzso under the so-called integral square zzso distance error criterion in a linear time zzso The underlying zzso is designed and implemented using a bottom-up zzso method, where the input of zzso approximation in the zzso resolution is the zzso curve achieved in the finer zzso For each resolution zzso zzso zzso structure is exploited in graph construction to construct the zzso zzso zzso Once the zzso curve is zzso two fine-tune zzso are employed in order to achieve the desirable quality zzso Experimental results validated that the proposed zzso is fast and achieves a better approximation result than the existing competitive zzso
