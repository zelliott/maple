zzso the assessment of the physical condition of a zzso depends on the evaluation of different tests, based on zzso zzso The data acquisition in these tests is usually hand made, because its zzso is zzso But when movements are constrained by means of their specific nature, simple tools can be used to achieve that data zzso In this paper, a simple and inexpensive system is described to make use of the timing capabilities of a personal computer zzso to use it as a timer, with applications in zzso and sport zzso The data acquisition method is based on a PC that, using a specific programming dealing with event timing, gets signals through the printer port, from a zzso device that detects cuts in an infrared cell zzso Low level procedures are provided that can be used in higher level zzso designs, problem dependent, to build specific zzso The case of the evaluation of the zzso zzso Test is zzso
