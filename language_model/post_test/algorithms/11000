The performance of the zzso zzso zzso zzso algorithm, aimed at minimizing right zzso pacing by operating in the zzso mode with switch to the zzso mode if zzso zzso zzso loss is zzso is not well zzso 

To determine the appropriateness of the zzso episodes available from patient follow-up data at our zzso 

Patients with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso activated were zzso The zzso episodes with available zzso were analyzed and classified as appropriate zzso zzso zzso or inappropriate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso percentage of zzso pacing and amount of premature zzso complexes zzso were zzso 

Of 21 patients, zzso episodes had occurred in 19 of them, with a mean of zzso episodes per zzso Of the zzso zzso episodes available for analysis, 27 zzso were classified as appropriate and 145 zzso as zzso Almost all zzso inappropriate zzso episodes were due to zzso and there was a positive correlation between the number of total zzso episodes per month and the number of zzso per month zzso zzso zzso Considering patients with only inappropriate zzso episodes zzso zzso zzso there was a positive correlation between the percentage of zzso pacing and the number of zzso episodes per month zzso zzso zzso 

A large majority of the zzso episodes available for analysis inappropriately triggered switch from the zzso mode to the zzso mode zzso to zzso Patients with the zzso zzso and elevated zzso burden are probably at risk of a high percentage of unnecessary right zzso zzso
