Classical neural networks are composed of zzso whose nature is determined by a certain function (the zzso zzso usually zzso In this paper, a type of neural network zzso is presented in zzso zzso each zzso may have its own zzso model in the form of a general function, zzso any layout zzso network zzso is possible, and zzso no bias zzso or weights are associated to the connections, zzso or zzso The general functions associated to a zzso are learned by searching a function zzso They are not provided a zzso but are rather built as part of an zzso zzso process based on zzso zzso The resulting network solutions are evaluated based on a fitness measure, which may, for example, be based on zzso or zzso zzso Two real-world examples are presented to illustrate the promising zzso on zzso problems via construction of a zzso representation of a zzso zzso space associated to the set of all network zzso
