The degree of zzso in brain zzso needs to be assessed by zzso findings and clinical data before zzso There have been previous attempts to solve this problem with a fuzzy rule extraction zzso based on fuzzy zzso neural zzso We zzso support zzso machines with floating search method to select relevant features and to predict the degree of zzso zzso results show that the feature subset selected by our techniques can yield better zzso zzso In contrast with the base line method, which generated two rules and obtained zzso accuracy on the whole data set, our method generates one rule to yield zzso zzso
