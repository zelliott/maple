zzso sequence alignments generally are constructed with the aid of a zzso zzso that specifies a score for aligning each pair of zzso zzso Assuming a simple random protein model, it can be shown that any such zzso when used for evaluating zzso local zzso is implicitly a zzso zzso with a specific probability distribution for zzso acid pairs to which it is uniquely zzso Given a model of protein evolution from which such zzso may be zzso a substitution zzso adapted to detecting relationships at any chosen evolutionary distance can be zzso Because in a database search it generally is not known a zzso what evolutionary distances will characterize the similarities found, it is necessary to employ an appropriate range of zzso in order not to overlook potential zzso This paper zzso this concept by defining a scoring system that is sensitive at all zzso evolutionary zzso The statistical behavior of this scoring system is zzso and it is shown that for a typical protein database search, zzso the originally unknown evolutionary distance appropriate to each alignment costs slightly over two bits of information, or somewhat less than a factor of five in statistical zzso A much greater cost may be zzso however, if only a single substitution zzso corresponding to the wrong evolutionary distance, is zzso
