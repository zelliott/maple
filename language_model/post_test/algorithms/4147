zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is used to study white matter zzso in normal and clinical zzso In zzso studies, diffusion zzso imaging zzso models the zzso zzso with one dominant direction, detecting possible zzso abnormalities only in large and highly coherent fiber zzso However, more general zzso models like zzso imaging zzso may provide more sensitive zzso zzso in single zzso The present study aimed to compare zzso and zzso models in a zzso population analysis, using zzso zzso zzso zzso as a pathological case model of zzso tract zzso zzso was performed in 19 ALS patients and 19 age and zzso healthy zzso zzso and zzso estimates were compared in zzso zzso spatial statistics zzso and volume of interest zzso zzso and correlated with ALS clinical scores of zzso A significant decrease of the zzso generalized fractional zzso zzso was observed in both motor and zzso fibers of ALS patients compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso maps were only partially overlapping with zzso zzso zzso the left zzso tracts resulted more markedly depicted by the zzso than by the zzso model, with zzso predicting ALS disability better than zzso The present findings demonstrate that zzso model is suitable for studying zzso tract zzso in zzso clinical zzso zzso zzso studies of fiber integrity may benefit from zzso when zzso is biased towards low values, such as in cases of fiber zzso and in regions with more than one dominant fiber zzso
