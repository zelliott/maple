The zzso zzso zzso zzso System zzso for acquiring and processing synthetic zzso zzso data for research purposes is zzso The specifications and design of the system are detailed, along with its performance for zzso zzso and 3-D flow zzso zzso zzso acquires individual channel data simultaneously for up to zzso zzso elements for a couple of heart beats, and is capable of zzso any kind of zzso The 64 boards in the system house 16 transmit and 16 receive channels each, where sampled channel data can be stored in 2 zzso of zzso and processed using five zzso gate zzso zzso The fully zzso focusing unit zzso delays and zzso values in real time in 3-D space and can produce 350 million complex samples per channel per second for full zzso synthetic zzso zzso imaging at roughly 30 high-resolution zzso Both zzso element data and zzso data can be stored in the system for later storage and zzso The stored data can be transferred in parallel using the system's zzso zzso zzso zzso at a theoretical rate of zzso zzso to a zzso Linux zzso
