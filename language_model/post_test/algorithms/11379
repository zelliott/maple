zzso mode zzso zzso has been recognized as a significant barrier to sensitive and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso optical zzso zzso zzso Here, we present a signal processing strategy that reconstructs the local zzso robustly in the presence of system zzso The zzso uses a spectral zzso approach to limit the zzso impact of system zzso and benefits from the final averaging of the zzso zzso zzso of the spectral zzso The zzso was validated with zzso simulations and experimental zzso of a rubber zzso When applied to the imaging of human zzso coronary zzso the zzso was found to yield a substantial improvement in the reconstructed zzso zzso
