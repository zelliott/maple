In this paper, we propose a genetic zzso based approach to determine the pose of an object in zzso Visual zzso having three degrees of zzso We have investigated the effect of noise at 20 zzso zzso and also mismatch resulting from incorrect zzso between the object space points and the image space points, on the zzso of pose zzso The maximum error in translation parameters is less than zzso zzso and zzso error is less than zzso degree at 20 zzso zzso The error in zzso zzso is insignificant zzso 7 pairs of mismatched points out of 24 points in object space and the results zzso when 8 or more pairs of points are zzso We have compared our result with that obtained by least square technique and it shows that zzso based method outperform the zzso based technique when the number of zzso of the object to be inspected is zzso These results have clearly established the zzso of zzso in zzso the pose of an object with small number of zzso in automated visual zzso
