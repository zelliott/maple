Managers need zzso and resource managers need the zzso of a variety of items including that of animals, logs, streams, plant zzso man-made objects, zzso habitat, vegetation patches and other things important in resource monitoring and land zzso These types of zzso can now be easily and accurately obtained from very large scale aerial zzso imagery having spatial resolutions as fine as 1 zzso per zzso by using the three new software programs described zzso zzso images have small fields of view and are used for intermittent sampling across extensive zzso zzso among images is influenced by small changes in airplane altitude above ground level zzso and orientation relative to the ground, as well as by changes in zzso These factors affect the zzso distance used for zzso zzso zzso offers a zzso interface for accounting for zzso variation among images by utilizing a zzso zzso records and displays airplane altitude zzso measured from a high frequency laser zzso and displays the vertical zzso zzso sorts through large amounts of data generated by zzso and matches precise airplane zzso with camera trigger times for input to the zzso zzso We discuss application of these tools, including error zzso We found zzso from aerial images zzso zzso zzso zzso as projected on the zzso using zzso zzso and zzso were accurate to zzso with an error less than zzso We recommend these software packages as a means for expanding the utility of aerial image zzso
