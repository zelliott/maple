The accuracy for determining pancreatic zzso volume with commonly used zzso and zzso methods is zzso The role of CT zzso in zzso assessment of pancreatic zzso needs to be zzso 

To compare volumes of the pancreatic zzso by CT zzso zzso and zzso methods and determine their accuracy by zzso with actual volume as determined by zzso zzso Setting This is a retrospective analysis performed at a zzso care zzso Patients zzso zzso proven pancreatic zzso evaluated with CT and zzso ultrasound zzso were zzso Design The volume of zzso zzso that had been fully zzso by zzso was compared to CT zzso and the routinely used methods zzso and zzso zzso Two independent observers measured all zzso using commercially available software to evaluate zzso zzso for CT zzso 

The volume of pancreatic zzso as determined by various methods was compared using repeated measures analysis of zzso zzso plot and zzso correlation zzso were used to determine mean difference and correlation between observers and zzso The error was calculated as the percentage of the difference between the CT estimated volumes and the zzso volume divided by the zzso zzso 

CT zzso was comparable to zzso volume zzso with very high zzso correlation zzso zzso and small mean difference zzso zzso and error zzso Mean difference with zzso volume and error were larger for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso volumes than CT zzso There was excellent zzso correlation in zzso of the entire cohort zzso zzso 

CT zzso is accurate and zzso zzso and zzso volume overestimate the true volume of pancreatic zzso
