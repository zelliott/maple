In this work we propose a method to extract zzso features from zzso images for an automated zzso of zzso zzso This method is based on the density of pits as used in the pit pattern zzso scheme which is commonly used for the zzso of zzso zzso For the detection of pits we employ a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso To be able to be robust against local texture variations we extend this operator by an zzso zzso Based on the detected pit candidates we zzso a Delaunay zzso and use the edge lengths of the resulting zzso to construct zzso These are then used in conjunction with the zzso zzso to zzso zzso We show that, compared to a previously developed method, we are not only able to almost always get higher zzso results in our application scenario, but that the proposed method is also able to significantly outperform the previously developed method in terms of the zzso zzso
