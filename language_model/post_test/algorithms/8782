zzso efforts have been directed at identifying zzso markers for rapidly progressing coronary zzso zzso that may advance into a high-risk zzso zzso zzso ultrasound zzso has become a valuable clinical tool to study the natural history of coronary artery disease zzso While zzso zzso studies have provided tremendous insight on zzso zzso and its association with independent markers zzso wall zzso zzso they are limited by the inability to examine the focal association between zzso zzso variables (in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso we present a framework to automatically zzso zzso zzso virtual zzso ultrasound zzso imaging data in the zzso direction zzso rotate follow-up image so zzso basis zzso with corresponding baseline zzso zzso zzso cross correlation was performed on paired images zzso zzso zzso from five patients using three independent zzso defined zzso artery zzso zzso defined plaque constituents, and zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso exhibited high correlation between zzso rotation angles determined automatically versus manually by an expert reader ( zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, no significant difference between automatic and manual zzso angles was observed ( zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso analysis yielded excellent agreement ( bias zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, we have developed, verified, and validated an zzso that automatically zzso zzso imaging data that will allow for the focal examination of zzso zzso
