The use of zzso zzso to increase the sensitivity in zzso and zzso is a well-known technique, however very high Q values are associated with several zzso This paper explores the zzso zzso zzso detection of zzso zzso zzso ratio as a function of the pickup zzso Q factor, with a particular emphasis on the zzso regime, where probe bandwidth becomes zzso than the zzso zzso We have used a mixed zzso approach to find the TNT zzso zzso value which avoided the inconvenient construction of a probe at every zzso The process has been repeated for a range of zzso zzso and a zzso sensitivity map was zzso Our analysis suggests, that sensitivity is maximum and practically zzso when zzso However, because the conflicting requirements of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso only a gain of approximately 6 zzso is obtained compared to a conventional Q approximately 100 zzso
