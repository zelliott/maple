Current literature describes several methods for the design of efficient zzso with 19 perfectly matched base pairs and 2 zzso zzso Using four independent databases totaling zzso zzso verified zzso we compared how well several of these methods predict zzso zzso zzso According to receiver operating characteristics zzso and correlation zzso the best programs were zzso zzso and zzso We also studied individual parameters that significantly and consistently correlated with zzso efficacy in different zzso As a result of this work we developed a new method which zzso linear zzso fitting with local duplex stability, zzso zzso preferences and total zzso content of zzso duplexes as input zzso The new zzso discrimination ability of efficient and inefficient zzso is comparable with that of the best methods identified, but its parameters are more obviously related to the mechanisms of zzso action in comparison with zzso This permits insight to the underlying physical features and relative importance of the zzso The new method of predicting zzso efficiency is faster than that of zzso because it does not employ time-consuming zzso secondary structure calculations and has much less parameters than zzso It is available as a web tool called zzso zzso
