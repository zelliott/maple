Given a lifting task with predetermined starting and ending positions, the angular zzso are usually very consistent with a distinctive zzso This paper derives a set of equations that can describe the joint zzso during a zzso lifting zzso Three optimal motion patterns were also expressed by the zzso minimal hand zzso minimal center of gravity zzso zzso and minimal muscle zzso rate zzso The zzso of the joint movements were zzso by overlapping the optimal zzso
