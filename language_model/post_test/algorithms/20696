To improve the zzso regulation in zzso a modification of the zzso least squares zzso zzso to be applied to any zzso zzso control zzso has been zzso It has been used in combination with a pole assignment zzso and its results have been compared through computer simulation in 12 test models with 3 other zzso It produces an improvement in the efficiency and the control cost, and it shows indications of zzso the zzso It also has been observed that for zzso control, a minimum zzso controller zzso advance moving average controller zzso is very efficient, whereas an empirical type of controller zzso requires low control zzso Some recommendations are made for the use of the zzso in clamping in a hypothetical zzso zzso artificial zzso
