A decrease of elasticity of walls of zzso and large arteries in the process of human natural aging leads to a significant zzso of pulse zzso pressure (AP) due to a reflected wave and accordingly to a rise of the load on zzso and zzso zzso zzso an enhancement of the zzso wall zzso is considered as a possible mechanism and at the same time as a zzso factor of risk of development of diseases of the cardiovascular system zzso For detection and quantitative zzso of this factor, we applied method of zzso zzso which allowed revealing characteristic age peculiarities of dynamic structure of zzso pulse waves that were used at development of the way and zzso of zzso of functional state of the human zzso The perspective use of this method for detection of signs of the age-related CVS readjustment as a factor of the zzso aging is zzso
