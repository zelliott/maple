The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso factor that binds DNA in the vicinity of the genes it zzso The affinity of zzso for specific binding sites relative to other DNA sequences is an inherent driving force for zzso all other things being zzso We measured the binding affinities of systematically zzso consensus zzso zzso sequences using automated zzso zzso zzso Based on zzso of the effects of every possible single zzso substitution of a consensus zzso we defined the DNA sequence with the highest affinity for full-length zzso and zzso the effects of zzso from it on the strength of zzso zzso The contributions of individual zzso were to a first approximation independent and zzso But, in some cases we observed significant zzso from zzso Based on affinity data, we constructed a binding predictor that mirrored the existing zzso consensus sequence zzso We used it to search for zzso binding sites in the zzso and to predict the effects of zzso zzso in these zzso Although there was some correlation between the zzso and biological function, the spread of the zzso by itself was not sufficient to explain the zzso of different pathways by changes in zzso concentration zzso
