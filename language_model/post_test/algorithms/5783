The cellular events leading to severe and complicated malaria in some zzso zzso infections are poorly zzso Additional tools are required to better understand the zzso of this zzso In this technical report, we describe a zzso culture system and image processing zzso that were developed to observe zzso interactions of zzso zzso zzso zzso rolling on primary brain zzso zzso We isolated and cultured human primary zzso brain zzso cells in a closed loop zzso culture system where a zzso pump and media reservoirs were integrated onto a microscope stage zzso We developed image processing methods to enhance contrast of rolling zzso zzso on zzso cells and to estimate the local wall zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso rolling on primary brain zzso cells was then measured under zzso relevant wall zzso zzso Finally, we deployed this method successfully at a field site in Blantyre, zzso The method is a promising new tool for the investigation of the zzso of severe zzso
