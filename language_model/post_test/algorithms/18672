Here, we present a diverse, structurally zzso data set of zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso Using a sequence zzso structural comparison zzso and zzso zzso zzso interface clusters are zzso These yield 103 clusters with at least five zzso zzso We divide the clusters into three zzso In Type I zzso the global structures of the chains from which the zzso are derived are also zzso This cluster type is expected because, in general, related proteins associate in similar zzso In Type II, the zzso are zzso however, zzso the overall structures and functions of the chains are zzso The functional spectrum is zzso from zzso to zzso and zzso The fact that structurally different zzso associate in similar ways, suggests zzso binding zzso This observation extends a paradigm in protein science: It has been well known that proteins with similar structures may have different zzso Here, we show that it extends to zzso In Type III zzso only one side of the interface is similar across the zzso This structurally zzso data set provides rich data for studies of zzso interactions and recognition, cellular networks and drug zzso In particular, it may be useful in addressing the difficult question of what are the favorable ways for proteins to zzso (The data set is available at zzso and zzso
