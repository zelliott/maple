zzso phase contrast zzso zzso zzso is an zzso imaging method that uses the wave properties of imaging photons as the contrast zzso It has been demonstrated that zzso images can be obtained using a conventional zzso tube and a zzso zzso Due to the limited size of the zzso current data acquisition systems only offer a limited field of view, and thus are prone to data zzso As a result, the reconstructed zzso image may suffer from image artifacts and increased inaccuracy in the reconstructed image zzso In this paper, we demonstrate that a small region of interest zzso within a large object can be accurately and zzso reconstructed using fully truncated projection zzso provided that a zzso information on electron density is known for a small region inside the zzso The method reconstructs an image zzso to satisfy a group of physical conditions by using a projection onto convex set zzso zzso In this work, this zzso zzso is validated using both zzso simulations and physical phantom experimental zzso In both cases, the root mean square error is reduced by an order of magnitude with respect to the truncated zzso zzso zzso artifacts observed in the latter reconstructions are eliminated using the zzso zzso
