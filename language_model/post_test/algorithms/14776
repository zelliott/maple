Security is a critical issue for sensor networks used in hostile zzso When wireless sensor zzso in a wireless sensor network are distributed in an insecure hostile environment, the sensor zzso must be zzso a secret key must be used to protect the zzso zzso zzso If the zzso are not protected and become compromised, many types of attacks against the network may zzso Such is the case with existing schemes, which are vulnerable to attacks because they mostly provide a zzso zzso which is insufficient to defend against known zzso We propose a zzso dynamic zzso management protocol for zzso wireless sensor zzso The proposed protocol improves the security of a secret zzso The proposed scheme also includes a key that is zzso zzso This dynamic update can lower the probability of the key being guessed zzso Thus currently known attacks can be zzso By utilizing the local information, the proposed scheme can also limit the flooding region in order to reduce the energy that is consumed in discovering zzso zzso
