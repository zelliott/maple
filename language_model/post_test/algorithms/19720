To describe a novel method of safe and effective intensive management of zzso zzso with use of cost-effective protocols directed by a zzso management service zzso 

An intravenous insulin protocol was designed to achieve a zzso target of 80 to 110 zzso When stable zzso were transferred from the intravenous protocol to a subcutaneous insulin zzso which consisted of zzso zzso and zzso and supplemental zzso zzso the blood zzso target was 80 to 150 zzso zzso levels were reviewed by the zzso at least daily for protocol adjustments, when zzso 

The intravenous insulin protocol was used in 276 patients, and zzso zzso blood zzso levels were zzso zzso target levels zzso to 110 zzso were zzso on average, zzso zzso zzso hours after initiation of insulin drip zzso The mean zzso blood zzso level during the study zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso 60 zzso was recorded in zzso of zzso values, and zzso zzso or zzso 400 zzso was recorded in only zzso The subcutaneous insulin protocol was used in 922 patients, and zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso The mean blood zzso level was zzso zzso zzso zzso during the study zzso The blood zzso target of 80 to 150 zzso was achieved in zzso whereas zzso of zzso values were in the clinically acceptable range zzso to 180 zzso zzso zzso or zzso 60 zzso occurred in zzso of zzso blood zzso values, and zzso zzso or zzso 400 zzso occurred in zzso of zzso 

zzso protocols dedicated to the achievement of strict zzso goals were implemented by a zzso and resulted in substantial improvements in zzso control on the surgical zzso services, with a reduced frequency of zzso The protocols and the zzso have been well received by the zzso nursing and surgical staff members, and all of this has been done in a cost-effective zzso
