zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso interface of the natural zzso zzso zzso was zzso The examined zzso originated from Croatia consisting of zzso of zzso zzso observations confirmed the zzso nature of zzso which can be described in terms of zzso of many small zzso with diameters in the range of 1 zzso zzso the zzso properties of zzso it was found that the average pore diameter zzso zzso between zzso zzso allows penetration of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso potential indicated that in zzso samples with zzso concentration in the range between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso fill the zzso of zzso By further increase in zzso zzso the zzso zzso on the external zzso surface, as revealed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed that in the zzso samples with initial zzso concentration from zzso to zzso zzso zzso chains adopt mainly zzso zzso whereas in the zzso samples with higher initial zzso zzso trans zzso are zzso and form a highly ordered structure on the zzso zzso
