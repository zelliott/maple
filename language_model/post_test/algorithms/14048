We introduce an zzso that uses the information gained from simultaneous consideration of an entire group of related proteins to create multiple structure alignments zzso zzso alignment zzso first zzso the information contained within regions that are consistently aligned among a set of zzso zzso in order to zzso pairs of proteins through both global and local refinement zzso It then zzso a multiple alignment that is zzso consistent with the improved zzso zzso We validate zzso alignments by assessing their accuracy in regions where at least two of the aligned structures contain the same zzso sequence zzso 

zzso correctly zzso well over zzso of motif zzso in zzso of proteins belonging to the same family or zzso and it zzso a number of previously reported zzso zzso
