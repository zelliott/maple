zzso zzso flow around a fully opened zzso valve in an zzso is obtained by solving the three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso Used is a zzso implicit zzso zzso code developed by the authors, which makes use of the well-known finite difference zzso zzso The code zzso zzso zzso and efficient zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso results show that the three-dimensional zzso flow is zzso with large zzso in the zzso region of the valve zzso Passing through the zzso the flow is split into major upper and lower jet zzso The spiral zzso generated by the disk are zzso in the wake and attenuated rapidly downstream by zzso It is shown also that the zzso stress becomes maximum near the leading edge of the disk zzso
