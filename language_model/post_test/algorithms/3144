Solid zzso zzso zzso have been extensively investigated as a promising drug delivery system for controlling the release of therapeutic zzso Currently, there are many manufacturing methods available for zzso including the high pressure homogenization method and the zzso zzso In addition, the zzso diffusion method has been discussed as an alternative technique in the literature, and has attracted great interest due to its simplicity and ease of zzso In order to gain a deeper understanding of this method, a statistical central composite design was applied in this study to examine how the zzso properties of the zzso were influenced by the variation of process zzso including injected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso temperature, and stirring zzso Our study showed that zzso concentration and temperature seemed to be the crucial parameters for the particle size of the zzso zzso prepared by the zzso diffusion zzso However, neither of these factors had a significant zzso relationship with the zzso zzso
