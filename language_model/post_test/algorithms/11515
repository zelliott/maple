zzso states in the evolution of zzso systems zzso zzso solutions of weak zzso acids and bases are zzso The mathematical model is based on the system of zzso partial differential zzso expressing the mass and charge conservation laws while assuming local chemical zzso It was implemented using a high resolution zzso algorithm, which correctly predicted the behavior of the zzso pH and zzso fields at low zzso zzso Both the regular and the irregular modes of separation in zzso zone zzso and zzso are zzso It is shown that the results of zzso particularly zone order, strongly depend on pH zzso zzso data as well as simple zzso assessments may help to predict and correctly interpret the experimental zzso
