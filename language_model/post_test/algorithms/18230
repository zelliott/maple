In the dynamic clamp technique, a typically zzso feedback system delivers electrical current to an excitable cell that represents the actions of zzso zzso channels zzso channels that are gated by local membrane potential or by electrical activity in neighboring biological or virtual zzso Since the conception of this technique, there have been a number of different zzso of dynamic clamp systems, each with differing levels of flexibility and zzso Embedded zzso systems typically offer feedback that is very fast and precisely timed, but these systems are often expensive and sometimes zzso zzso systems, on the other hand, allow the user to write software that defines an arbitrarily complex feedback system, but real-time performance in zzso systems can be deteriorated by imperfect real-time zzso Here, we systematically evaluate the performance requirements for artificial dynamic clamp zzso of transient sodium and delayed zzso zzso zzso Specifically, we examine the effects of controller time step zzso differential equation integration method, jitter zzso in time zzso and zzso (the time lag from reading zzso to updating zzso Each of these control system flaws is artificially introduced in both simulated and real dynamic clamp zzso We demonstrate that each of these errors affect dynamic clamp accuracy in a way that depends on the time zzso and zzso of the differential equations being zzso In simulations, time steps above zzso lead to catastrophic zzso of spike shape, but the zzso relationship is much more zzso zzso (the part of the time step that occurs between measuring membrane potential and injecting zzso membrane zzso is a crucial factor as zzso Experimental data are substantially more sensitive to zzso than simulated zzso
