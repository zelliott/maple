In order to analyze the effects of electrical zzso in heavy metal contaminated sites, we established the zzso model of typical contaminated sites and simulate the DC zzso method with Wenner zzso using the finite element zzso The simulation results showed that the electrical method was influenced by the contamination concentration and the location of zzso The more serious the degree of pollution was, the more obvious the low zzso anomaly, thus the easier the identification of the contaminated area; otherwise, if there was light pollution, Wenner array could not get obvious low zzso anomalies, so it would be hard to judge the contaminated zzso Our simulation results also showed that the closer the contaminated areas were to the surface, the more easily the pollution was detected and the low zzso anomalies shown in the apparent zzso zzso were influenced by the zzso zzso The actual field survey results using zzso method also show that the zzso method can correctly detect the area with serious zzso
