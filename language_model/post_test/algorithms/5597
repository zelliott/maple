We have developed a new technique based on light scattering experiments for tracing an alien particle with deterministic potential in a random collection of zzso We have shown that, via a sequence of zzso of light scattered to a far field of a scattering collection, it is possible to locate the center of the alien zzso The analysis of the stability of reconstruction is zzso and it is demonstrated via simulations that the results are stable for sufficiently large wavelength of the incident light and in cases when the size of the alien particle is comparable with the size of the typical particle in the zzso
