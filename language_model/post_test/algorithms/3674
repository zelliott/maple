It has been observed that heavy zzso zzso propels zzso filaments to higher zzso than native zzso in the in zzso zzso zzso yet the reason for this difference has remained zzso Since the major difference between these two proteins is the presence of the tail in native myosin, we tested the hypothesis that unknown interactions between zzso and the tail zzso slow zzso in native zzso zzso zzso and zzso were mixed in a range of zzso ratios zzso zzso and compared to native rat skeletal zzso in the in zzso zzso zzso at 30 degrees zzso zzso proportions of zzso to zzso slowed zzso filament zzso becoming equivalent to native zzso at a ratio of 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso on the surface were constant and independent of zzso zzso arguing against a simple displacement zzso zzso between zzso and the number of available heads suggested that the duty cycle of zzso was not altered by the presence of zzso zzso prepared with a lower zzso concentration and with very short zzso times moved zzso at the same high zzso The difference between zzso of zzso filament propelled by zzso and zzso decreased with increasing zzso strength, suggesting that zzso bonds between zzso tail and zzso filaments may play a role in slowing filament zzso These data suggest the high zzso of zzso filaments over zzso result from the absence of drag generated by the zzso tail, and not from zzso zzso of the motor zzso
