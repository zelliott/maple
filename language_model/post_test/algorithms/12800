Reliable prediction of the zzso acid zzso involved in zzso zzso can provide valuable insight into protein function, and inform zzso studies, and drug design zzso A fast-growing number of methods are being proposed for predicting protein zzso using structural information, energetic criteria, or sequence conservation or by zzso multiple criteria and zzso zzso however, their performance remains zzso especially when applied to zzso protein complexes, where the individual components are also stable on their zzso Here, we evaluate interface predictions derived from zzso zzso zzso To this end we measure the overlap between the zzso in models of protein complexes submitted by 76 participants in zzso zzso Assessment of zzso zzso and those of 46 observed zzso in 20 zzso targets corresponding to zzso zzso Our evaluation considers multiple models for each target zzso submitted by different participants, using a variety of zzso zzso Although this results in a substantial zzso in the prediction performance across participants and targets, clear trends zzso zzso methods that perform best in our evaluation predict zzso with average recall and precision levels of about zzso for a small majority zzso of the analyzed zzso These levels are significantly higher than those obtained for zzso complexes by most extant interface prediction zzso We find zzso that a sizable fraction zzso of the zzso in models ranked as incorrect in the zzso assessment are actually correctly predicted zzso and precision zzso and that these models contribute to zzso of the correct zzso interface predictions zzso Our analysis proves that zzso methods are much more successful in identifying zzso than in predicting complexes, and suggests that these methods have an excellent potential of addressing the interface prediction zzso
