zzso associated with zzso zzso flow patterns has recently been demonstrated to play a potentially important role in zzso transport and deposition deep in the lung zzso zzso Butler and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but the origin of this potent mechanism is not well zzso In this study we hypothesized that even a small degree of zzso in otherwise zzso zzso wall motion is sufficient to cause flow zzso and zzso zzso zzso We tested this hypothesis using a large-scale zzso model consisting of a zzso junction of three short, straight, square zzso The model was filled with silicone oil, and zzso wall motion was simulated by pistons in two of the zzso The pistons were driven to generate a zzso zzso flow with a small amount of zzso in boundary motion adjusted to match the degree of geometric (as distinguished from zzso zzso found in rabbit lungs zzso zzso zzso zzso Butler, zzso zzso Rogers, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dye was introduced into the system, and its motion was zzso The results showed that even a slight zzso in boundary motion leads to flow zzso with complicated swirling zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso resulted in stretching of the zzso with narrowing of the separation between adjacent zzso lines, and when the zzso narrowing of lateral distance reached the slowly growing diffusion distance of the zzso mixing abruptly took zzso This zzso of evolving zzso flow patterns with diffusion is the essence of the zzso zzso We conclude that even a small degree of boundary zzso can give rise to zzso zzso zzso thereby leading to transport and deposition of fine and zzso zzso particles deep in the zzso
