zzso causes or zzso a host of medical conditions, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso Recently obesity in elderly women was associated with greater risk of zzso white matter zzso changes, and greater brain zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether body type affects global brain volume, a marker of zzso in middle-aged men and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess global brain volume for 114 individuals 40 to 66 years of age zzso zzso zzso years; standard zzso zzso zzso years; 43 men and 71 zzso Total zzso fluid and brain volumes were obtained with an automated tissue zzso zzso A zzso model was used to determine the effect of age, body mass index zzso and other cardiovascular risk factors on brain volume and zzso 

Age and zzso were each associated with decreased brain zzso zzso did not predict zzso in this zzso however elevated zzso blood pressure was associated with poorer episodic learning zzso 

These findings suggest that middle-aged obese adults may already be experiencing zzso greater brain zzso and may potentially be at greater risk for future cognitive zzso
