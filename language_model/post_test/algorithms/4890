We explored the use of a fiber-optic probe for in zzso zzso zzso of breast zzso during zzso zzso breast zzso A total of 121 biopsy samples with accompanying zzso diagnosis were obtained clinically and investigated in this zzso The tissue zzso were analyzed using partial zzso analysis and represented using a set of principal components zzso with dramatically reduced data zzso For zzso tissue samples, a set of PCs that account for the largest amount of zzso in the zzso displayed correlation with the percent tissue zzso For all tissue samples, a set of PCs was identified using a zzso zzso test as showing statistically significant differences between: 1) zzso and zzso 2) zzso and zzso and 3) zzso and zzso breast zzso These PCs were used to distinguish zzso from other zzso tissue types using a zzso zzso scheme based on both linear and zzso support zzso machine zzso and zzso zzso zzso For the sample set investigated in this study, the zzso zzso provided a zzso sensitivity and specificity of up to zzso and zzso respectively, for discrimination between zzso and zzso samples, and up to zzso and zzso respectively, for discriminating between zzso and zzso zzso zzso based on zzso was used to generate receiver operator zzso with an area under the curve zzso of zzso for discriminating zzso versus zzso zzso and an zzso of zzso for discriminating zzso from zzso tissue zzso This study demonstrates the feasibility of performing zzso zzso during clinical core needle breast zzso and the potential of this technique for identifying breast zzso in zzso
