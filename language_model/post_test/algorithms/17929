We investigate the dynamics of DNA zzso through a zzso using zzso zzso dynamics simulations, focusing on the dependence of the zzso dynamics on the details of DNA zzso The DNA molecules studied in this work are built from two types of bases A and C, which have been shown previously to have different interactions with the zzso We study DNA with repeating blocks zzso for various values of zzso and find that the zzso time depends strongly on the block length zzso as well as on the orientation of which base enters the pore zzso Thus, we demonstrate that the measurement of zzso dynamics of DNA through a zzso can yield detailed information about its zzso We have also found that the zzso of the block sequences is contained in the zzso of the residence time of the individual zzso inside the zzso
