zzso attention zzso the neural response, zzso spike rates, brain zzso and zzso activity at gamma frequency zzso 30 zzso In this study we show that when a visual target is attended enhanced zzso between gamma phase (30 to 50 zzso and zzso phase (4 to 7 zzso representing bottom-up and zzso activity, respectively, can be zzso This is interpreted as memory matching between incoming visual information and stored zzso zzso The results highlight the function of zzso brain activity in the integration of memory and attention zzso This seems to be true in particular for zzso zzso showing increased zzso zzso We conclude that memory information is stored within a distributed zzso network and it is matched with an incoming sensory trace at zzso brain zzso
