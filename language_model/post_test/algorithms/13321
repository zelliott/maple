The zzso nature of excess electrons accompanying an oxygen vacancy in a zzso surface has been studied by several theoretical zzso According to previous studies, zzso + U and hybrid functional methods predict different sites of zzso of the zzso In this paper, we conducted a thorough comparison of the results obtained by zzso + U zzso zzso approximation + Hubbard zzso and zzso zzso hybrid zzso zzso Considering initial symmetry breaking in the geometry zzso process, we show that regardless of the approximations used, electrons zzso at two particular subsurface zzso sites in a state with mixed zzso character in the global coordinate frame with a spatial extent of the order of 7 zzso The lowest state of the zzso is a zzso but the zzso is only about zzso zzso higher in zzso Our results agree with previous experiments and calculations, wherever zzso We stress that the hybrid functional has been first applied on this surface with a realistic coverage of oxygen vacancies corresponding to the experimental situation zzso
