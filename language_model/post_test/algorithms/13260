A zzso zzso imaging zzso system using sequential architecture is presented in this zzso Feature zzso are collected using the principal component analysis zzso zzso The linear Wiener operator and a zzso method based on the zzso zzso prior model are used for object zzso Experimental results are given to demonstrate the superior reconstruction performance of the zzso method over the Wiener zzso In addition, the effects of system zzso such as the object block size, the number of features per block, and the noise level to the zzso reconstruction performance are discussed with different kinds of zzso Then an optimal block size is defined and studied for zzso
