Urban drainage models are important tools used by both practitioners and scientists in the field of zzso zzso These models are often conceptual and usually require zzso using local zzso The zzso of the uncertainty associated with the models is a must, although it is rarely zzso The International Working Group on Data and zzso which works under the zzso Joint Committee on Urban zzso has been working on the development of a framework for defining and assessing uncertainties in the field of urban drainage zzso A part of that work is the assessment and comparison of different techniques generally used in the uncertainty assessment of the parameters of water zzso This paper compares a number of these zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso Complex Evolution zzso zzso zzso an approach based on a zzso zzso (a zzso genetically zzso zzso method, zzso and a zzso approach based on a simplified zzso zzso zzso Carlo method zzso in the software zzso To allow a meaningful comparison among the different uncertainty techniques, common criteria have been set for the likelihood zzso defining the number of simulations, and the measure of uncertainty zzso Moreover, all the uncertainty techniques were implemented for the same case study, in which the same zzso quantity and quality model was used alongside the same zzso The comparison results for a zzso zzso model showed that the four methods provide similar probability zzso of model zzso and model prediction zzso For zzso water quality model the differences between the results were much zzso and the paper provides the specific advantages and disadvantages of each zzso In relation to zzso efficiency zzso number of zzso required to generate the probability distribution of zzso it was found that zzso and zzso produce results quicker than zzso in terms of required number of zzso However, zzso requires the lowest zzso skills and is easy to zzso All zzso methods have problems with the way they accept zzso zzso sets, zzso zzso zzso and zzso have zzso acceptance zzso while zzso has usually problem with its hypothesis on zzso of zzso It is concluded that zzso should select the method which is most suitable for the system they are zzso zzso complexity of the zzso structure including the number of zzso their zzso level, the available information, and the purpose of their zzso
