zzso zzso zzso is the process of transforming a set of points in a zzso space to a zzso one while preserving the relative distances between pairs of zzso Although effective methods have been developed for solving a variety of zzso problems, they mainly depend on the zzso in the zzso space having zzso zzso For some applications, the training of neural networks in particular, it is preferable or necessary to obtain zzso in a zzso zzso zzso Unfortunately, zzso into a zzso discrete space appears to be a significantly harder problem than zzso into a continuous zzso This article introduces and analyzes several methods for performing approximately zzso zzso zzso
