Brain activity was measured by zzso zzso to investigate whether the early auditory system can detect changes in zzso patterns when the visual part is presented zzso We hypothesized that a template underlying the mismatch field zzso phenomenon, which is usually formed by past sound zzso is also used in visually based sound zzso zzso similar to the zzso may be zzso by comparing an incoming sound with the zzso The stimulus was modeled after a zzso an animation in which one of two keys was depressed was accompanied by either a lower or higher zzso zzso zzso pairs were designed to be frequent and zzso pairs to be zzso zzso were instructed to predict an incoming sound based on key movement in two sets of trials zzso zzso whereas they were instructed not to do so in the other two sets zzso zzso For each condition, the movement took 50 zzso in one set zzso zzso 50 zzso and 300 zzso in the other zzso zzso 300 zzso to reach the bottom, at which time a tone was zzso As a result, only under the prediction condition with Delta zzso 300 zzso was additional activity for zzso pairs observed zzso in the zzso area within zzso zzso of the auditory stimulus zzso this activity had zzso properties similar to those of zzso We concluded that a template is created by the visually based sound prediction only after the visual zzso and sound prediction processes have already been zzso
