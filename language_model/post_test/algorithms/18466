zzso and fast evaluation of zzso interactions in molecular systems is still one of the most challenging tasks in the rapidly advancing field of zzso chemistry, including molecular recognition, protein modeling and drug zzso One of the most convenient and accurate approaches is based on a zzso approximation that uses the zzso moment expansion of zzso charge zzso In the mid-1980s it was shown that the zzso model commonly used in experimental X-ray charge density studies can be easily combined with the zzso approach for calculation of zzso zzso plus zzso zzso for evaluation of the total interaction energies in molecular zzso While many such studies have been reported, little attention has been paid to the accuracy of evaluation of the purely zzso interactions as errors may be absorbed in the zzso zzso zzso that have to be used to account for exchange zzso and zzso zzso This study is aimed at the evaluation of the accuracy of the calculation of zzso interaction energies with the Buckingham zzso To eliminate experimental zzso the atomic moments are based on theoretical zzso electron zzso calculated at various levels of zzso The zzso interaction energies for a total of 11 zzso of zzso zzso and zzso acid structures calculated according to Buckingham with zzso zzso and zzso moments are compared with those evaluated with the zzso energy decomposition zzso For zzso a comparison with direct zzso integration method, recently developed zzso is also zzso It is found that the theoretical zzso moments combined with the Buckingham model do predict the correct relative zzso interactions zzso although the absolute interaction energies are underestimated in some zzso The good agreement between zzso interaction energies zzso with zzso zzso zzso method, and the Buckingham approach with zzso moments demonstrates that reliable and accurate evaluation of zzso interactions in molecular systems of considerable complexity is now zzso
