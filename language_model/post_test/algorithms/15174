zzso resonance zzso zzso has been introduced in clinical practice as a possible surrogate for mechanical zzso but its application to study the human brain in zzso has been limited by low spatial resolution and the complexity of the inverse problem associated with zzso property zzso Here, we report significant improvements in brain zzso data acquisition by reporting images with high spatial resolution and zzso ratio as zzso by zzso zzso strain zzso Specifically, we have developed a sequence for brain zzso based on zzso zzso spiral imaging, and three-dimensional displacement acquisition and implemented a correction scheme for any resulting phase zzso A zzso zzso model of brain tissue mechanics was adopted to represent the zzso and was integrated via a finite zzso zzso inversion zzso A zzso phantom study demonstrates the need for obtaining high-resolution zzso data when zzso focal mechanical zzso zzso on three healthy volunteers demonstrate satisfactory resolution of gray and white matter, and mechanical zzso zzso well with white matter zzso Together, these advances enable zzso scans that result in zzso zzso resolved estimates of in zzso brain tissue mechanical properties, improving upon lower resolution zzso brain studies that only report volume averaged zzso zzso
