zzso are molecules made from simple zzso that form complex tree zzso zzso constitute one of the most important protein modifications and identification of zzso remains a pressing problem in zzso Unfortunately, the structure of zzso is hard to predict from the zzso sequence of an zzso In this paper, we consider the problem of zzso the zzso of a zzso solely from tandem mass zzso zzso zzso We study, how to generate zzso tree candidates that sufficiently match the sample mass spectrum, avoiding the zzso explosion of zzso zzso Unfortunately, the resulting problem is known to be zzso zzso We present an efficient exact zzso for this problem based on zzso zzso that can process a spectrum in a matter of zzso We also report some preliminary results of our method on experimental data, combining it with a preliminary candidate evaluation zzso We show that our approach is fast in applications, and that we can reach very well de zzso identification zzso Finally, we show how to count the number of zzso zzso for a fixed size or a fixed zzso We zzso this result to count the number of zzso trees with bounded out degree, improving on results obtained using zzso zzso zzso
