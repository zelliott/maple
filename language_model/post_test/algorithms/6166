The accuracy of depth zzso based on zzso effects has been essentially limited by the depth of field of the imaging zzso We show that depth zzso can be improved significantly relative to classical methods by exploiting three-dimensional zzso zzso We formulate the problem by using information theory analysis and present, to the best of our knowledge, a new paradigm for depth zzso based on zzso rotating zzso functions zzso Such zzso are fundamentally more sensitive to zzso thanks to their zzso zzso zzso Our system acquires a frame by using a rotating zzso and jointly processes it with an image acquired by using a standard zzso to recover depth zzso zzso zzso and experimental evidence suggest that the approach is suitable for applications such as zzso and machine zzso
