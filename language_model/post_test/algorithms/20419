zzso zzso attachment level change zzso identified from serial relative attachment level zzso zzso is the principal indicator of zzso of zzso zzso Many variables confound zzso zzso and affect measurement zzso The zzso zzso was designed to reduce measurement error and improve accuracy and sensitivity of zzso zzso The study aimed to evaluate the performance of the zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso recorded full mouth zzso with a third generation disc probe on 4 occasions over 6 months in 16 subjects zzso age zzso zzso with moderately advanced chronic adult zzso zzso zzso zzso allowed up to 4 zzso recordings per site per visit until 2 values had differences zzso or zzso zzso and their mean was zzso or zzso zzso from the previous visit zzso the zzso made the selection if these criteria were zzso 

zzso agreement zzso or zzso zzso was zzso or zzso all zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso At each visit, mean difference in zzso values was zzso zzso zzso mean absolute difference zzso zzso was zzso or zzso zzso Mean zzso zzso ranged from zzso zzso to zzso zzso across all zzso zzso thresholds for zzso attachment level change (from estimated zzso confidence limits of visit 1 zzso ranged from zzso zzso to zzso zzso Linear zzso (by linear zzso and zzso patterns of zzso were zzso zzso was detected in zzso subjects and at zzso measured zzso Linear zzso zzso zzso or zzso P zzso or zzso occurred at 105 sites zzso 32 sites zzso zzso 73 sites zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred at zzso sites zzso 391 sites zzso zzso 295 sites zzso improved, and 388 sites zzso showed zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso produced high zzso zzso zzso attachment level change was detected in both directions in zzso subjects and at zzso measured zzso
