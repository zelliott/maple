We address the problem of degree of polarization zzso in polarization diversity zzso We consider active imaging techniques with laser zzso which have the appealing feature of revealing contrasts that do not appear in conventional intensity zzso These techniques provide two images of the same scene that are zzso with zzso zzso Because of the presence of zzso in the reflected intensity, it can be preferable to perform image analysis of the zzso contrast image, which is a measure of the degree of polarization of the reflected light when the zzso zzso is zzso It has been shown that a simple zzso transformation of this zzso contrast image leads to an image zzso with additive symmetrical noise on which simple and efficient zzso and detection techniques can be zzso We propose to precisely analyze zzso properties of the degree of polarization using this natural zzso In particular, we determine the zzso bound of the polarization degree zzso and the zzso of the proposed zzso and we study the zzso efficiency as a function of the zzso order for different measurement zzso
