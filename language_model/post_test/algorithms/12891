A zzso method of zzso optical systems is zzso The method is based on selectively zzso main zzso aberration zzso This selective compensation is achieved by the optimal adjustment of chosen alignment zzso It is shown that this optimal adjustment can be obtained by solving a linear zzso equation of the zzso zzso terms of primary field zzso A significant result from the adjustment is to place the centers of the primary field zzso initially scattered over the field due to zzso to a desired common field zzso This aberration zzso naturally results in recovery of image quality across the field of zzso zzso analyses and zzso tests show the zzso feasibility in efficient removal of zzso aberrations in the face of measurement and model zzso The extension of the method to the zzso zzso of a zzso system with zzso zzso aberrations is also zzso
