zzso root system architecture zzso is essential to understanding the development and function of vascular zzso zzso zzso genes also represents an zzso opportunity for crop zzso Software tools are needed to accelerate the pace at which quantitative traits of zzso are estimated from images of root zzso 

We have developed zzso Roots zzso Image Analysis of zzso a zzso software tool designed specifically for the zzso analysis of root system zzso zzso Roots includes zzso zzso to distinguish root from background and a fully automated pipeline that extracts dozens of root system zzso zzso information on each zzso along with intermediate steps for full zzso is returned to the zzso for downstream zzso zzso Roots has a zzso front end and a zzso interface for zzso the software into large-scale zzso zzso Roots can also be extended to estimate novel zzso specified by the zzso 

We demonstrate the use of zzso Roots on a set of zzso images of rice roots representing 12 zzso from the species zzso zzso We validate trait zzso against prior analyses of this image set that demonstrated that zzso traits are likely zzso and associated with zzso zzso Moreover, we demonstrate that zzso Roots is zzso and an zzso can add functionality so that zzso Roots can estimate novel zzso zzso In zzso we show that the software can function as an efficient tool as part of a zzso to move from large numbers of root images to downstream zzso
