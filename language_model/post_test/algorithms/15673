To determine whether computer zzso testing zzso can be used to decrease the number of zzso trade mark instrument motor component items administered in assessing persons with spinal zzso injury zzso 

For a zzso zzso a zzso zzso was used to select 6 zzso items for each zzso items were selected according to the zzso motor ability as estimated by 2 initial zzso Separate estimates of motor ability for admission, zzso and follow-up data (plus combined time points) derived from 6 items were compared statistically with estimates derived from 14 items zzso and wheelchair mobility were zzso 

Records from the Spinal zzso zzso Model Systems zzso 

Patients served by the zzso for whom complete motor zzso information was available for rehabilitation admission zzso discharge zzso or follow-up at a first or later anniversary zzso 

Not zzso 

zzso of mean, standard zzso zzso zzso and zzso reliability and separation of persons and items based on 6 and 13 items; zzso correlation zzso zzso for parallel zzso 

zzso for zzso items and zzso steps differed for the 3 time points, but showed sufficient agreement zzso zzso that combined zzso was zzso Means and other distribution characteristics differed minimally between the 6- and zzso zzso The person and item zzso and zzso were somewhat lower and the mean measurement errors somewhat higher for the zzso estimates, but only marginally zzso zzso between 6- and zzso estimates were zzso or zzso 

zzso can be used to reduce data collection time; the level of precision of estimates is minimally less than that provided by traditional assessment zzso
