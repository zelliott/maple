In this work we describe a parallel system consisting of zzso neural networks supervised by a local genetic zzso The system is implemented in a zzso architecture and is used to predict the secondary structures of zzso zzso This method allows a wide search in the zzso space of the neural networks and the determination of their optimal zzso for the zzso zzso Different neural network zzso are selected by the genetic zzso on the basis of minimal values of mean square errors on the testing zzso When the zzso zzso and random zzso motifs of secondary structures are zzso the zzso efficiency obtained is zzso with correlation zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso This level of accuracy is similar to that previously attained by means of neural networks without hidden layers and using single protein sequences as zzso The results validate the neural network zzso used for the prediction of protein secondary structures and highlight the relevance of the input information in determining the limit of their zzso
