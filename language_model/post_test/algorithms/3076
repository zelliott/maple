We examine the properties of a recently proposed model for zzso variation in malaria which incorporates multiple zzso and both long-lasting and transient immune zzso We show that in the case of a vanishing zzso rate for the long-lasting immune response, the system exhibits the so-called zzso without zzso due to the existence of a zzso of zzso in the phase zzso When the zzso rate of the long-lasting immune response is different from zero, the zzso of zzso zzso and a multitude of other steady states are born, many of which are related by a zzso symmetry of the zzso The zzso of the fully zzso state of the system was investigated by means of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The results of this exercise indicate that for a vanishing zzso of long-lasting immune response, the fully zzso state is not robust in the substantial part of the zzso space, and instead all zzso develop their own zzso dynamics contributing to the overall time zzso At the same time, if the zzso rate of the long-lasting immune response is increased, the fully zzso state can become robust provided the growth rate of the long-lasting immune response is zzso
