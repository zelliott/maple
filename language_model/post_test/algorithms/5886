zzso zzso of globally optimal surfaces representing object boundaries in zzso data sets is important and challenging in many medical image analysis zzso We have developed an optimal surface detection method capable of simultaneously detecting multiple interacting surfaces, in which the zzso is controlled by the cost functions designed for individual surfaces and by several geometric constraints defining the surface zzso and zzso The method zzso the surface zzso problem by transforming it into computing a minimum zzso cut in a derived zzso directed zzso The proposed zzso has a zzso zzso time complexity and is zzso zzso It has been extensively validated on more than 300 zzso zzso images, 72 zzso data sets of zzso zzso tubes, and tens of medical images spanning various imaging zzso In all cases, the approach yielded highly accurate zzso Our approach can be readily extended to zzso image zzso
