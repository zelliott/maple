Since there was a scientific need to conduct zzso zzso to detect possible zzso zzso zzso central zzso zzso zzso zzso and cardiac zzso zzso effects in animals used in certain regulatory studies, the acquisition of suitable automated PC software systems were zzso This article describes the process by which these systems were validated to ensure that they met the scientific requirements, while also addressing the principles of Good zzso Laboratory zzso zzso After a thorough search of existing commercial packages, a plan was developed specific for each zzso collection system selected for zzso The common elements of each plan included consideration of both scientific and zzso zzso such as necessary biological response zzso raw data acquisition and zzso acceptance criteria, security, protection, storage media, data integrity, audit requirements and standard operating zzso The zzso approach to validation for each zzso system was to determine scientific needs for zzso precision, and detection limit of biological effects concurrent with zzso zzso The selected software systems were employed in separate scientific zzso studies conducted in dogs, rats, and zzso to demonstrate the ability to detect zzso effects due to multiple infusions of zzso based on parallel measurement of zzso zzso Since the systems were designed for human zzso certain adaptations were zzso A critical assumption to be tested was the ability of the system's zzso to adequately capture and zzso the data in an accurate zzso zzso the related zzso needs, such as data integrity, security, zzso zzso and personnel training requirements were zzso zzso and defined to accommodate the application and process zzso The biological approach to validation of these zzso zzso systems met the necessary scientific acceptance criteria as well as compliance requirements in order to be used in regulatory zzso
