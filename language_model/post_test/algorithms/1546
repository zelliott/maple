We present a zzso zzso method to reconstruct the zzso membrane potential of zzso populations from a single-channel zzso zzso zzso We consider a class of neural mass models that share a general structure, specifically the models by zzso et al zzso zzso zzso 110 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 73 zzso and zzso et al zzso zzso zzso zzso 22 zzso Under idealized zzso we prove the global exponential convergence of our zzso Then, under more realistic zzso we investigate the zzso of our filter against model uncertainties and zzso Analytic zzso are provided for all results and our analyses are further illustrated via zzso
