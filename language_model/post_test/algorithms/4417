zzso is an automated system that measures zzso evoked compound action potential zzso thresholds from the auditory nerve with the zzso Freedom cochlear zzso zzso thresholds along the zzso array are useful in zzso fitting cochlear implant systems for individual zzso This paper provides the first detailed description of the zzso zzso and its expert systems, and reports the clinical success of zzso to zzso 

zzso determines thresholds by visual zzso using two decision tree expert systems that automatically zzso zzso The expert systems are guided by a zzso of zzso neural response zzso The zzso approaches threshold from lower stimulus levels, ensuring recipient safety during zzso zzso zzso zzso use the same zzso but proceed faster by beginning at stimulus levels much closer to zzso When searching for zzso zzso uses a highly specific expert system zzso of zzso during training, zzso during zzso sensitivity of zzso during training, zzso during zzso Once zzso are established, zzso uses an unbiased expert system to determine an accurate zzso Throughout the execution of the algorithm, recording parameters (such as implant amplifier zzso are automatically zzso when zzso 

In a study that included 29 zzso and 29 zzso subjects (a total of zzso zzso zzso determined a threshold in zzso of cases where a human expert also determined a zzso When compared to the median threshold of multiple human observers on 77 randomly selected electrodes, zzso performed as accurately as the zzso zzso 

zzso has demonstrated a high success rate and a level of performance that is comparable with human zzso It has been used in many clinics worldwide throughout the clinical trial and commercial launch of zzso Custom Sound zzso significantly streamlining the clinical procedures associated with cochlear implant zzso
