Previously we demonstrated that a computer zzso based on bedside airway examinations and facial photographs accurately classified easy and difficult zzso The extent of the ability of zzso to perform the same task is zzso We hypothesized that providing photographs would add to the zzso ability of zzso over that achieved when provided only with the zzso zzso score and the zzso distance zzso We further hypothesized that human observers would implicitly bias their predictions toward more sensitive determination of difficult zzso rather than more specific determination of easy zzso 

zzso zzso and attending zzso with varying levels of experience (N zzso zzso were presented with zzso and zzso information from 80 Caucasian men zzso The same subjects' data, accompanied by 3 facial photographs in head-on and right and left profiles, were also zzso Anesthesiologists classified the airways as easy or difficult according to specified criteria zzso defined as a single attempt with a Macintosh 3 blade resulting in a grade 1 zzso zzso zzso defined as zzso attempt by an operator with at least 12 months zzso experience, grade 3 or 4 zzso view, need for a second operator, or zzso use of an alternative airway zzso zzso sensitivity, and specificity were calculated for each zzso We further developed a cost function to zzso a relative bias toward avoiding an unexpectedly difficult zzso versus zzso for an easy zzso 

One hundred sixty respondents completed the zzso zzso photographs improved zzso sensitivity and accuracy in zzso zzso though specificity decreased zzso zzso accuracy when given photographs was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso which was significantly lower than the computer's performance of zzso zzso test, P zzso zzso zzso of photographs, compared with zzso and zzso alone, caused zzso to change their prediction from easy to difficult more frequently if the patients were obese zzso or body mass zzso despite not having data on weight or height zzso The cost function demonstrated that zzso strongly preferred to enhance sensitivity zzso difficult zzso as compared with specificity zzso easy zzso with a ratio of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso 

Anesthesiologists can derive useful information from facial appearance that enhances the prediction of a difficult airway over that achieved when presented with zzso and zzso data zzso Anesthesiologists implicitly bias their predictions toward detection of difficult zzso compared with the true zzso of difficult zzso at the expense of accuracy and zzso This behavior may be rational for cognitive tasks in which the costs of failure are strongly zzso
