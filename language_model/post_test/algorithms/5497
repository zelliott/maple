The zzso syndrome zzso a zzso condition for cardiovascular disease, presents disturbances in zzso zzso zzso zzso can assess these zzso In subjects with zzso the zzso of the zzso present in the zzso time series is more zzso than in normal zzso zzso the aim of the present study was to zzso assess the complexity of zzso times series in 53 patients, with or without zzso through a zzso analysis algorithm, the approximate zzso a method employed in recent years for the study of several biological signals, which provides a zzso index, zzso We correlated zzso zzso from zzso times series data during zzso and zzso phase with the presence of zzso in the parameters defining zzso zzso Treatment Panel zzso III zzso zzso Brewer HB zzso zzso zzso Smith SC zzso zzso zzso National Heart, zzso and Blood zzso American Heart zzso Circulation zzso zzso 2004) and the International Diabetes Federation zzso zzso zzso show that zzso was significantly higher in subjects with zzso compared with those without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso means zzso zzso P zzso zzso with zzso III zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso with the zzso zzso We also demonstrated that zzso increase parallels the number of components of zzso zzso was then correlated to each zzso zzso mean zzso values of subjects belonging to the first and fourth zzso of the distribution of zzso parameters were statistically different for all parameters but HDL zzso No difference was observed between zzso values evaluated in zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, we identified that zzso is characterized by an increased complexity of zzso zzso this may have a zzso relevance in subjects with this zzso
