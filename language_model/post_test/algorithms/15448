In Canada, zzso zzso is managed with partial zzso or zzso needle zzso zzso zzso zzso will soon be zzso The optimal management of zzso zzso is controversial and zzso exist between the different zzso Using a zzso analysis approach, our aim was to identify the most cost-effective form of treatment for managing zzso zzso it and the threshold at which zzso is zzso We developed an zzso decision analysis model for zzso zzso affecting a single finger, comparing the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso from a zzso zzso zzso one-way sensitivity and zzso analyses were performed using standard thresholds for cost effective treatment zzso zzso to $100 zzso zzso zzso needle zzso was the preferred strategy for managing zzso affecting a single zzso The zzso of primary zzso improved when repeated to treat zzso zzso was not zzso zzso was cost-effective relative to and preferred over zzso at $875 and $470 per course of treatment, zzso In zzso our model supports the trend towards zzso interventions for managing zzso zzso affecting a single zzso zzso zzso will only be feasible in our publicly zzso zzso system if it costs significantly less than current United States zzso
