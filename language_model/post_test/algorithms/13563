zzso zzso assembly has attracted considerable interest from the zzso modeling community as a model system for complicated zzso zzso zzso methods have proven valuable for characterizing the space of possible zzso and mechanisms of zzso zzso but they have so far been able to say little about the assembly zzso or pathways of any specific zzso It is not possible to directly measure the detailed interaction rates needed to zzso a model, and there is only a limited amount of experimental evidence available to zzso possible zzso with almost all of it gathered from in zzso studies of zzso coat zzso In prior work, we developed methods to address this problem by using zzso zzso to learn rate parameters consistent with both zzso rule sets and experimental zzso data on bulk assembly progress in zzso We have since improved these methods and extended them to fit simulation parameters to one or more experimental zzso zzso Here, we apply the improved zzso approach to three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B virus zzso and zzso zzso zzso virus zzso assess both the range of zzso types the methods can learn and the diversity of assembly strategies in use between these zzso The resulting fits suggest three different in zzso assembly mechanisms for the three systems, with zzso zzso fitting a model of assembly via a zzso zzso of zzso of individual zzso while zzso and zzso zzso fit similar but subtly different models of zzso assembly through ensembles of pathways involving zzso zzso The results demonstrate the ability of such data fitting to learn very different zzso types and show some of the versatility of pathways that may exist across real zzso
