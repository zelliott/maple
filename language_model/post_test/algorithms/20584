The goal of the present study was to develop a novel approach that zzso the prescription of fluid therapy in patients with abnormal serum sodium zzso 

The novel approach is based on a simple zzso derived from established principles on the distribution of sodium in body zzso that estimates the impact of a unit dose, zzso 1 zzso of any zzso on the patient's serum sodium zzso In accordance with the zzso the expected change in the patient's serum sodium concentration in response to 1 zzso of any zzso zzso is obtained by zzso the sodium concentration of the patient's serum from the sodium concentration of the zzso each expressed in zzso and dividing the result by the patient's estimated total body water expressed in zzso zzso 1 zzso to account for the volume of the zzso The amount of the particular zzso to be administered over the course of any given time period can be easily zzso by dividing the desired zzso at the end of the period by the calculated zzso zzso by 1 zzso of the zzso The utility and limitations of the proposed approach are zzso 

The novel equation is not a means for zzso zzso Rather, it provides, simply and zzso quantitative projections that can assist the physician in implementing the selected treatment plan for patients with zzso
