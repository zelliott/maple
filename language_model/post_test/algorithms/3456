Human embryonic stem cells zzso have generated enormous interest due to their ability to zzso and produce many different cell zzso In conjunction with zzso technology, human zzso provide a powerful tool for employing a zzso approach to deciphering the molecular mechanisms that control zzso and early zzso Recent work has focused on defining zzso and zzso based on different experimental and zzso approaches in both mouse and human zzso Using a mixed linear model statistical approach, we report a stringent direct comparison between data sets obtained from two human zzso zzso and zzso in order to obtain a list of genes that are enriched in zzso In addition, we used another zzso population derived from zzso zzso to obtain a list of genes that we consider important to the maintenance of zzso A total of 133 genes overlapped between the three zzso zzso A majority of the 133 genes were classified under the key functional categories of zzso regulation, zzso and regulation of zzso Key genes expressed were zzso zzso zzso and zzso Also found to be enriched in all three populations is zzso a gene zzso a hypothetical protein of unknown function that has been shown in earlier studies to possess a zzso in mouse zzso and also to cluster tightly with zzso in human zzso Although there were many genes unique to each zzso population, they shared similarities based on functional zzso that define zzso The significance of our studies underscores the need for direct comparison of stem cell populations that share biological similarities using uniform stringent zzso approaches, in order to better define zzso Our findings have important implications for the maintenance of zzso and in developing directed differentiation strategies for various zzso zzso
