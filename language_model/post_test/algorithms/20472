zzso developed therapies for early gastric zzso attempt to consider patients' quality of life, but the zzso and effectiveness of these treatments remain zzso 

zzso data of zzso consecutive patients with early gastric zzso all of whom were treated by D1 and zzso zzso were zzso Patients with and without zzso zzso zzso were compared in relation to age and gender zzso surgical procedures, zzso of the tumors, zzso zzso and in reference to the zzso and zzso zzso 

The overall zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso depth and size were related to zzso zzso zzso judged by zzso and zzso zzso Patients with zzso tumors showed no relation between zzso rate and tumor size, whereas those with zzso tumors showed an increasing zzso rate with tumor zzso In all cases but one, zzso zzso zzso were confined to zzso zzso stations defined as Group 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso diagnostic accuracy in determining tumor depth and a zzso sensitivity in diagnosing zzso zzso zzso 

Patients with early gastric zzso may be candidates for zzso zzso zzso if their tumor is confined to the zzso and measures zzso 1 zzso in greatest zzso Other limited zzso including D1 zzso or standard zzso zzso based on tumor depth and size are zzso Based on the current study findings, the authors propose a useful zzso for managing such zzso
