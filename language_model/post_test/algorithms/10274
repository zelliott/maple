zzso breathing is a chronic syndrome that may bring about zzso zzso Finding characteristic patterns of changes occurring in the complex musculoskeletal system of zzso children has been a zzso Learning zzso zzso zzso is an artificial neural network model that can be applied for this zzso 

The aim of the present study was to apply zzso to determine the characteristic zzso profiles shown by zzso children, in order to further understand abnormal posture among mouth zzso 

zzso training data on 52 children (30 mouth zzso and 22 nose zzso and zzso validation data on 32 children zzso mouth zzso and 10 nose zzso were zzso The performance of zzso and other zzso models was compared in relation to zzso zzso zzso applied to zzso zzso zzso networks, zzso zzso zzso decision trees, zzso and zzso zzso zzso accuracy was assessed by means of zzso zzso area under zzso curve zzso and zzso agreement zzso zzso 

By using the zzso model, five zzso profiles for zzso children could be zzso zzso showed satisfactory results for zzso and zzso zzso sensitivity and specificity rates of zzso and zzso respectively, when using the training zzso and zzso and zzso respectively, when using the validation zzso 

The five zzso profiles for zzso children suggested by zzso were incorporated into application software for zzso the severity of mouth zzso abnormal zzso
