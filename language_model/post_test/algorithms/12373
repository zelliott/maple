This paper presents a unified approach to zzso detection of transient evoked zzso emissions zzso Using statistical detection theory, it is shown that the optimal detector involves a time zzso operation where the window can be estimated from ensemble correlation zzso The detector performs zzso splitting of the signal into different frequency bands using either zzso or zzso packet zzso A simplified detector is proposed in which signal energy is zzso The results show that the simplified detector performs significantly better than existing zzso detectors based on wave zzso or the modified zzso ratio, whereas the detector involving signal energy does not offer such a performance zzso
