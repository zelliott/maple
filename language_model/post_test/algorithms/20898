To determine whether zzso or zzso zzso zzso is better for the medical students to be used while studying the clinical zzso zzso 

zzso patients who underwent surgical intervention due to focal zzso pathology at the Department of General zzso University of zzso and at zzso of zzso zzso University Hospital were included in the retrospective cohort zzso Before the surgical intervention, the zzso zzso zzso liver scan and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso A total of 58 zzso and zzso digital liver images, mixed up in random sequence not to follow each other with a specially designed zzso were presented to the students of Faculty of Medicine, zzso zzso Their aim was to determine zzso liver zzso to plan which liver segments should be zzso and to predict anatomical difficulties for liver zzso zzso were compared with the data of real zzso 

The students achieved better results for tumor zzso analyzing zzso liver images zzso CT zzso This was especially evident determining the zzso of tumor in segments 5, 6, 7, and 8 zzso Furthermore, the results of proposed extent of liver zzso have been found to be better with zzso zzso zzso - zzso in comparison with CT scans zzso - zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso of the liver images helped the medical students to determine the tumor zzso and to plan the prospective liver zzso operations more precisely comparing with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso should be used as a means of studying liver zzso
