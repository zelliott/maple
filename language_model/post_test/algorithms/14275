zzso zzso zzso gas zzso has the potential to assess pulmonary zzso The zzso state of zzso zzso results in the continual depletion of the signal level over the course of zzso Under zzso conditions the relationship between the zzso ratio zzso and the number of zzso significantly deviates from that established in the equilibrium zzso In many circumstances the zzso increases or remains the same when the number of data acquisitions zzso This provides a unique opportunity for performing parallel zzso in such a way that both the zzso and spatial resolution will increase without the conventional decrease in the zzso In this study an zzso relationship between the zzso and the number of zzso for any flip angle was zzso Second, the zzso function zzso was zzso to zzso demonstrate the unconventional zzso behavior for parallel imaging in zzso gas zzso Third, a zzso zzso receive and zzso zzso transmit zzso system was developed to zzso prove the theoretical predictions with zzso zzso The in zzso experimental results prove that significant zzso resolution can be gained without the usual zzso loss in an equilibrium system, and that the entire lung can be scanned within one zzso zzso 13 zzso by applying parallel imaging to zzso data zzso
