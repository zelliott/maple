Task analysis may be useful for assessing how zzso alter their behavior in response to different clinical zzso In this study, the authors examined the zzso and zzso reliability of an established task analysis zzso 

During 20 routine zzso procedures, a trained observer sat in the operating room and zzso in real-time the zzso activities into 38 task zzso Two weeks later, the same observer performed task analysis from videotapes obtained zzso A different observer performed task analysis from the videotapes on two separate zzso Data were analyzed for percent of time spent on each task category, average task zzso and number of task zzso zzso reliability and agreement were assessed using zzso correlation zzso 

zzso reliability was generally good for categorization of percent time on task and task occurrence zzso zzso correlation zzso of zzso There was a comparably high zzso between real-time and video zzso zzso reliability was generally good for percent time and task occurrence zzso However, the zzso reliability of the task duration metric was zzso primarily because of the technique used to capture zzso 

A task analysis technique used in zzso research for several decades showed good zzso zzso zzso analysis of videotapes is a viable alternative to real-time data zzso zzso zzso reliability requires the use of strict task zzso sophisticated software, and rigorous observer zzso New techniques must be developed to more accurately capture zzso zzso effort is required to conduct task analyses that will have sufficient reliability for purposes of research or clinical zzso
