zzso of a zzso particle normal to an zzso interface is considered theoretically in this zzso The presence of the zzso interface is found to reduce the particle mobility in general, especially when the double layer is very zzso This boundary effect diminishes as the double layer gets very zzso The higher the surface potential, the more significant the reduction of mobility due to the polarization effect from the double layer deformation when the particle is in zzso Local zzso are observed in the mobility profiles with varying double layer thickness as a zzso zzso with a solid zzso boundary is zzso It is found that the particle mobility near an zzso interface is smaller than that near a solid one when the double layer is thick, and vice versa when the double layer is thin, with a critical threshold value of double layer thickness corresponding roughly to the touch of the zzso The reason behind it is clearly explained as the buildup of electric potential at the zzso zzso which reduces the driving force as a zzso
