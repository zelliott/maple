Using simulated viral load data for a given zzso zzso study design, the feasibility of different zzso to perform zzso zzso for a zzso dynamics zzso model was zzso The assessed zzso are the zzso conditional zzso method with interaction zzso implemented in zzso VI and the zzso zzso implemented in zzso version zzso zzso data were also used to test if an effect compartment and/or a lag time could be distinguished to describe an observed delay in onset of viral zzso using zzso The preferred model was then used to describe the observed zzso zzso plasma concentration and viral load data using zzso In this last step, three zzso approaches were zzso zzso sequential zzso with fixed individual zzso zzso Estimates zzso for zzso zzso sequential zzso with fixed population zzso parameters and including zzso and zzso simultaneous zzso Using zzso many convergence problems zzso were experienced with fitting the sequential zzso model to the simulated zzso For the sequential zzso approach, zzso (with default settings) took less time to generate population and individual estimates including zzso than with zzso without zzso For the given zzso zzso sampling design, it was difficult to separate the viral dynamics system delay from a zzso zzso delay or delay due to zzso binding and subsequent cellular zzso The preferred model included a viral load lag time without zzso zzso zzso estimates from the zzso analysis of observed data were comparable among the three zzso zzso For the sequential methods, zzso time is approximately zzso less when fixing individual zzso of zzso parameters with omission of the concentration data compared with fixed population zzso parameters and retention of concentration data in the zzso zzso zzso zzso times were similar for the sequential method with fixed population zzso parameters and the simultaneous zzso zzso zzso The current analysis demonstrated that the zzso zzso in zzso is useful for fitting complex zzso models requiring multiple differential zzso The zzso zzso allowed simultaneous zzso of zzso and viral dynamics zzso as well as investigation of different model zzso during the model building zzso This was not possible with the zzso method zzso version VI or zzso zzso provides a more feasible alternative to zzso when facing lengthy zzso times and convergence problems with complex zzso
