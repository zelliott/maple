To develop a model of experimental allergic zzso guinea pigs were given repetitive and topical applications of Japanese cedar zzso as an zzso and the resulting allergic reaction was zzso 

Male zzso guinea zzso 

zzso pigs were zzso by zzso of small gelatin sponge pieces (3 zzso both zzso containing the zzso extracts + zzso into the zzso zzso zzso of both eyes for 8 zzso for 6 zzso Then the animals were challenged by dropping zzso suspension in each eye once every zzso 

zzso changes of conjunctivitis intensity score zzso which represents zzso and zzso and scratching frequency, and zzso and zzso levels in zzso were assessed following the respective zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed to zzso for zzso leakage and migrated zzso at each of the zzso zzso 

At relatively early stages of the repeated challenge, only a gradual increase of zzso was zzso However, thereafter, considerably higher zzso with the maximum at 30 zzso after the challenge was provoked at the zzso zzso Quite interestingly, there were differences in the zzso between the right and left eyes, depending on the zzso zzso and zzso leakage and zzso influx into the zzso fluid were also developed during the zzso Although the zzso zzso against the zzso were detected in the zzso from half of the animals, the levels were not correlated to severity of the zzso 

The present zzso procedures are unique in terms of topical application of zzso The lack of any correlation between the levels of the zzso zzso and severity of zzso symptoms, and the difference of zzso between the left and right eyes of an individual strongly suggest that the zzso zzso are formed in locally limited tissue surrounding an zzso The present method should be useful for zzso the mechanisms of allergic zzso
