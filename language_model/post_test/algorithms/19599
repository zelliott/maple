zzso between the zzso zzso and several occupying peptides obtained from zzso zzso made to the zzso zzso are zzso The exploration was carried out using a zzso composed of the first three terms of the zzso expansion of the zzso field, zzso charge zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Comparisons between zzso interactions established that the binding pockets for this zzso zzso are ordered in terms of their importance for binding zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A set of zzso distinct zzso acids that determine interaction stability and specificity were identified for each zzso The zzso zzso was especially identified as being the key zzso acid zzso the occupying zzso binding for pocket 4; this zzso has been recently associated with zzso zzso
