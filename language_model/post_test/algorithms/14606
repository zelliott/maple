zzso restructuring refers to changes in the strategy with which people solve a given zzso Two types of knowledge restructuring are supported by existing category learning zzso The first is a zzso process, which involves incremental updating of knowledge as learning zzso The second is a zzso process, which involves novel changes in the way existing knowledge is applied to the zzso Whereas zzso is supported by both zzso and zzso models of category learning, only zzso models support zzso To date, only zzso has been directly supported zzso We report two category learning experiments that provide direct evidence of zzso People can zzso alternate between different categorization strategies, and moreover, can reinstate an old strategy even after prolonged use of an zzso The knowledge restructuring data are not well fit by a zzso model zzso By contrast, a zzso model zzso zzso accounts for zzso zzso changes in the distribution of zzso attention are shown to subsequently affect how zzso coordinates its modular zzso We argue that learning about complex tasks occurs at the level of the partial knowledge elements used to generate a response zzso
