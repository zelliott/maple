A Twin Support zzso zzso zzso as a zzso of a zzso zzso Support zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso attempts to improve the zzso of zzso whose solution follows from solving two zzso programming problems zzso each of which is smaller than in a standard zzso Unfortunately, the two zzso still lead to rather high zzso zzso Moreover, although zzso has better zzso performance than zzso a major disadvantage is it fails to exploit the underlying correlation or similarity information between any pair of data points with the same labels that may be important for zzso performance as much as zzso To mitigate the above deficiencies, in this paper, we propose a novel zzso plane zzso called zzso Twin Support zzso Machines with Local Information zzso zzso mines as much underlying similarity information within samples as zzso This method not only retains the superior characteristics of zzso but also has its additional zzso zzso comparable or better zzso accuracy compared to zzso zzso and zzso zzso taking motivation from standard zzso the concept of support zzso is zzso zzso more efficient than zzso in terms of zzso zzso and zzso only one penalty zzso is considered as opposed to two in zzso Finally, experiments on both simulated and real problems confirm the effectiveness of our zzso
