Experimental studies of second harmonic generation zzso from zzso zzso zzso - zzso system show occurrence of a maximum in diagonal and off diagonal zzso components zzso at 15 zzso % concentration and a rapid decrease above, with a zzso The origin of the observed concentration dependence is studied using the zzso Carlo zzso zzso We find that presence of maximum is zzso by the zzso history of the sample, when entanglement of linear zzso structures takes zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is an important kinetic zzso which zzso between various zzso zzso of zzso of polar phase responsible for zzso zzso zzso
