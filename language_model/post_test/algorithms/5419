A new system is presented and evaluated for real-time monitoring of blood leakage during zzso isolated limb zzso zzso surgery, the zzso zzso zzso This system incorporates two software models to determine blood zzso a zzso zzso and a newly developed zzso zzso The latter zzso has the advantage that, in principle, it is independent of system sensitivity and thus independent of changes in geometrical zzso A physical description of the system is given, together with the required hardware and software zzso 

zzso zzso corresponding to the intended clinical use, are presented to investigate the relevant performance characteristics of the system: count rate zzso measurement uncertainty, response time, and zzso As the zzso zzso system provides the opportunity to use different filter settings and averaging time, the influence of these settings on the time response and measurement uncertainty is zzso 

Count rate zzso was better than zzso for the count rate domain typically observed during zzso zzso The response time of the system degrades with increasing total averaging zzso In contrast, measurement uncertainty in the blood leakage factor improves with increasing zzso count rates and increasing total averaging zzso For both blood leakage zzso measurement accuracy is better than zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso have shown that the system is well suited for the real-time monitoring of blood leakage during zzso zzso Furthermore, a good agreement was observed between the theoretical and measured response time and measurement zzso
