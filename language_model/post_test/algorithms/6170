zzso left zzso zzso volume has been documented to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular zzso Less is known about the zzso ability of zzso LA diameter, a simpler measure of LA size obtained routinely during zzso zzso 

We investigated the zzso value of LA diameter for incident cardiovascular events in zzso American Indians free of clinical cardiovascular disease, zzso disease, and zzso zzso zzso variables were obtained using standardized methods, and previously derived zzso partition values were used to define left zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso (in zzso and LA enlargement zzso zzso zzso in men, zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso events included nonfatal stroke, coronary heart disease, zzso heart failure, and fatal cardiovascular disease based on validated zzso 

During a median follow-up of 7 years, 368 events zzso LA diameter, both as a continuous and as a zzso zzso was significantly associated with incident cardiovascular events in zzso zzso In multivariable analyses that adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, total zzso zzso cholesterol, smoking, zzso zzso zzso zzso abnormal zzso zzso and zzso function, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso both LA diameter zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and LA enlargement zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso remained independent zzso of first cardiovascular zzso 

In this zzso zzso LA diameter independently predicted incident cardiovascular events after adjustment for established clinical, zzso and inflammatory risk zzso This simple measure of LA zzso can identify individuals at heightened risk who may warrant more aggressive risk factor zzso
