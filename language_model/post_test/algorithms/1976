This chapter describes approaches for learning models of zzso organization from zzso The primary utility of these models is expected to be from incorporation into complex simulations of cell zzso Most current cell simulations do not consider spatial organization of proteins at all, or treat each zzso type as a single, idealized zzso The ability to build zzso models for all proteins in a zzso and use them for zzso accurate simulations is expected to improve the accuracy of models of cell zzso A second use, of potentially equal importance, is expected to be in testing and comparing software for analyzing cell zzso The complexity and sophistication of zzso used in zzso screens and zzso zzso referred to as zzso zzso zzso analysis, or zzso zzso is continuously zzso and zzso models can be used to produce images for testing these zzso in which the expected answer is zzso
