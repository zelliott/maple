We describe some new developments in the methodology of making zzso and zzso zzso experiments in solid state zzso insensitive to zzso by phase alternating the zzso on the spin system every zzso zzso By incorporating delays of half zzso periods in the pulse zzso these phase alternating experiments can be made gamma zzso The proposed methodology is zzso different from the standard methods of making zzso experiments robust by the use of ramps and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso We show how the concept of phase zzso can be incorporated in the design of zzso zzso experiments that are both insensitive to chemical shift zzso and zzso
