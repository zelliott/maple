A zzso strategy to model flexible molecules zzso to a rigid zzso surface is zzso The strategy is able to provide zzso relaxed zzso at the zzso zzso It combines an zzso to generate molecules zzso to the surface without atomic zzso a method to insert zzso molecules and zzso in the simulation box, and a powerful relaxation zzso The reliability of the strategy has been investigated by simulating two different zzso zzso mixed zzso consisting of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of different lengths zzso on a rigid zzso surface and zzso zzso zzso a short linear zzso that recognizes zzso plasma proteins and selectively homes to tumors, zzso zzso to a rigid zzso surface in zzso zzso In the first, we examined the segregation of the two species in the zzso using different zzso ratios, whereas in the second, we explored the zzso space of zzso and zzso distribution considering zzso of peptides per zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso indicate a spontaneous segregation in zzso zzso zzso which enhances when the concentration of longest chains zzso However, the whole zzso profile of zzso depends on the number of molecules zzso to the surface pointing out the large influence of molecular density on the zzso zzso even though the zzso zzso was found as the most stable in all zzso
