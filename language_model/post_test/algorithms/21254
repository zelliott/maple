The zzso of cellular zzso by zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of the rat was studied in the dose range of zzso to zzso zzso per zzso zzso of 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 zzso per week for several weeks were zzso The number of zzso tumor cells per tumor in the course of the different treatment schedules was determined using an in zzso colony zzso The results show that the proliferation of zzso tumor cells is zzso in the course of a zzso zzso The zzso persists for several days after end of treatment, until accelerated zzso is zzso The fraction of tumor cells zzso per week was only dependent on the total dose per week, that is the cellular response was the same whether the weekly dose was applied in zzso or 10 zzso Thus, the zzso regimens were considerably more effective than expected from calculations based on zzso in zzso survival zzso
