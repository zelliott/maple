The aim of this work was to zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso by zzso zzso The nature of the organic zzso to zzso the zzso the method of incorporation of the drug in the organic phase (with or without a zzso namely zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso ratio, and the nature of the zzso zzso were investigated as zzso zzso The zzso investigated as zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of respective molecular weight zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso At zzso ratio of zzso the zzso zzso activities were higher zzso zzso for zzso and zzso but relatively lower for the zzso zzso zzso probably due to the zzso relatively higher zzso The obtained zzso exhibited average volume mean diameter of zzso zzso the smaller for zzso and the larger for zzso zzso zzso The in zzso release profile showed that zzso was completely zzso released from zzso in 48 zzso and from zzso and zzso within 72 zzso These results showed that zzso with incorporation of zzso such as zzso zzso may efficiently zzso zzso into zzso zzso Such zzso may improve the zzso of zzso and similar zzso
