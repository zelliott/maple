zzso zzso hosts two zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso (called zzso is zzso to the zzso domain of zzso and it has been proposed to protect the zzso against zzso zzso The second zzso is called zzso zzso zzso belongs to truncated zzso group III, and has been hypothesized to be involved in zzso zzso Here, the zzso and thermodynamics of cyanide binding to zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are reported and analyzed in parallel with those of related zzso zzso with particular reference to those from zzso zzso The affinity of cyanide for zzso is higher than that reported for any known zzso zzso by more than three orders of magnitude (K zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This can be fully attributed to the highest zzso observed for a zzso zzso zzso association rate constant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso even though the binding process displays a zzso step zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shows a very high affinity for cyanide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso however, cyanide association zzso are independent of cyanide zzso displaying a zzso step zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso rate constant for cyanide zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso are similar to those reported for zzso zzso The very high affinity of cyanide for zzso reminiscent of that of zzso zzso suggests that this zzso may participate in cyanide zzso
