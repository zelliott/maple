Mechanical zzso of the ankle is known to influence key aspects of ankle zzso We investigated the effects of zzso ankle training in people with chronic stroke on the zzso zzso passive zzso and its relationship to zzso gait zzso Over 6 zzso eight participants with residual zzso deficits engaged in a zzso task while seated that required zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of their zzso ankle with an ankle robot zzso assisting as zzso zzso ankle zzso zzso was measured in both the trained zzso and untrained frontal zzso After 6 zzso the zzso decreased in both zzso and zzso and reverted into the zzso of zzso controls in zzso Changes in zzso zzso correlated strongly with gains in zzso step lengths zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso stride lengths zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso during independent floor zzso Moreover, baseline zzso zzso were correlated with gains in zzso step lengths zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso stride lengths zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso stance duration zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and baseline zzso zzso were correlated with gains in cadence zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso These findings suggest that ankle zzso zzso isolated ankle training has a positive effect on zzso ankle zzso that strongly influences key measures of gait zzso
