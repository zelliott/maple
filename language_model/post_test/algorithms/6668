Using a model based on the totally zzso exclusion process, we investigate the effects of slow zzso along zzso zzso zzso density profiles near neighboring clusters of slow zzso zzso enhancing suppression of zzso zzso when such bottlenecks are closely zzso zzso the slow zzso cluster size beyond approximately zzso zzso does not significantly reduce the zzso zzso Our results are verified by both extensive zzso Carlo simulations and zzso zzso and provide a biologically motivated explanation for the zzso observed zzso of zzso zzso
