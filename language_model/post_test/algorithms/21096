For most diseases, single zzso do not have adequate sensitivity or specificity for practical zzso We present an approach to combine several zzso into a composite marker score without assuming a model for the distribution of the zzso Using sufficient dimension reduction techniques, we replace the original markers with a zzso version, obtained through linear transformations of markers that contain sufficient information for zzso of the zzso on the zzso We combine the linear transformations using their zzso properties into a zzso diagnostic score via the likelihood ratio zzso The performance of this score is assessed by the area under the zzso characteristics curve zzso a popular summary measure of the zzso ability of a single continuous diagnostic marker for zzso disease zzso An zzso zzso test for assessing individual zzso contribution to the diagnostic score is also zzso
