zzso play a crucial role in genetic analysis and have many applications such as gene disease diagnoses, association studies, ancestry zzso and so zzso The development of DNA sequencing technologies makes it possible to obtain zzso from a set of aligned reads originated from both copies of a zzso of a single zzso This approach is often known as zzso zzso zzso zzso that can give optimal solutions to the zzso assembly problem are highly zzso Unfortunately, previous zzso for this problem either fail to output optimal solutions or take too long time even executed on a PC zzso 

We develop an approach to finding optimal solutions for the zzso assembly problem under the zzso zzso zzso Most of the previous approaches assume that the columns in the input zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso This zzso assumption is correct for most zzso but it may be incorrect for a small number of zzso In this article, we consider the zzso model with or without the zzso zzso In our approach, we first use new methods to decompose the input read zzso into small independent blocks and then model the problem for each block as an zzso linear programming problem, which is then solved by an zzso linear programming zzso We have tested our program on a single PC zzso Linux zzso zzso PC with zzso zzso using the filtered zzso and the zzso zzso zzso (after applying some zzso calling zzso With the zzso zzso our approach can zzso solve the whole zzso data set within a total time of 31 h zzso h for the most difficult block of the 15th zzso and only 5 h for the other zzso To our knowledge, this is the first time that zzso optimal solutions are completely obtained for the filtered zzso zzso Moreover, in the general case (without the zzso zzso for the zzso zzso our approach can zzso solve all the zzso except the most difficult block in zzso 15 within a total time of 12 zzso For both of the zzso and zzso zzso the optimal costs in the general case are sometimes much smaller than those in the zzso zzso This implies that some columns in the input zzso (after applying certain zzso calling zzso still zzso to zzso zzso 

Our program, the optimal solutions found for the zzso zzso available at zzso
