The maximum zzso of an zzso zzso zzso treatment field is usually smaller than the conventional maximum zzso opening because of design limitations inherent in some zzso zzso zzso To increase the effective field zzso zzso zzso can be split and delivered with multiple carriage zzso However, not all zzso systems and zzso support this technique, and if they do, the maximum field zzso in multiple carriage position delivery is still significantly less than the maximum zzso zzso For target volumes with dimensions exceeding the field size limit for multiple carriage position delivery, such as liver tumors or other zzso in the abdominal zzso zzso treatment can be accomplished with multiple zzso or with an extended treatment zzso To study zzso statistics of large field zzso planning, an elliptical volume was chosen as a target within a cubic phantom centered at a depth of zzso zzso Multiple zzso plans (one zzso and two zzso beams with 160 degrees between them to avoid parallel opposed zzso with constraints designed to give zzso dose to the elliptical target were zzso Plans were designed with a single anterior field with dual carriage positions, or with the anterior field split into two fields with separate zzso 8 zzso apart with the beams being forcibly matched at the zzso or with a 1 zzso 2 zzso 3 zzso and 4 zzso zzso The zzso beams were planned with a single carriage position in all zzso All beams had a nominal energy of 6 zzso In the dual zzso plans, jaws were manually fixed and dose constraints remained zzso zzso statistics were studied for plans developed for treatment delivery using both dynamic leaf motion zzso zzso and multiple zzso segments zzso and zzso with the number of segments varying from 5 to zzso All plans were analyzed based on the dose zzso in the zzso plane, 2 zzso anterior and 2 zzso zzso to it, along with their corresponding zzso zzso zzso All the dual zzso plans had slight zzso anterior to the match point and slight zzso zzso to it, while the dual carriage plan had a nice blending of the dose distribution without the accompanying hot or cold zzso Based on the dose statistics, it was noted that the dual zzso plans can be clinically acceptable if they have at least a zzso zzso In the case of step and shoot zzso the number of segments used in a dual carriage plan was found to affect the overall plan zzso zzso
