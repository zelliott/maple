zzso zzso zzso zzso is an emerging imaging zzso for zzso soft tissue elasticity deduced from displacement zzso within the tissue obtained by phase sensitive zzso zzso Imaging zzso zzso zzso has potential to detect a range of zzso diseases and cancer zzso especially zzso The mechanical model commonly used in zzso is linear zzso zzso An alternative zzso zzso zzso model for soft tissue zzso is used with a zzso zzso inversion zzso zzso to reconstruct zzso properties, energy zzso mechanisms and zzso zzso behavior of the zzso zzso This research performs a thorough evaluation of the zzso model in zzso focusing on unique identification of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso show the zzso of the zzso model at a single input frequency based on a structural analysis with a series of supporting experimental phantom zzso The estimated real zzso zzso values zzso were substantially correct in zzso various material types and correlated well with the expected zzso contrast of the physical zzso However, estimated zzso parameters displayed consistent poor reconstruction accuracy leading to unpredictable trends in zzso zzso To overcome this issue, two alternative approaches were developed: zzso simultaneous zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Overall, the zzso model estimates the real zzso zzso zzso zzso well, but identifying zzso parameters zzso and zzso is not possible without an alternative zzso
