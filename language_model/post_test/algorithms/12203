The zzso of zinc and lead zzso removal by modified zzso has been zzso The rate of the zzso exchange process for lead zzso is faster than for zinc zzso as well as the time needed to reach the zzso The zzso exchange capacity of zzso of lead zzso is doubly higher than that of zinc zzso zzso models according to the zzso zzso the zzso diffusion model and the homogeneous diffusion model have been tested with the experimental data of zzso exchange for zinc and zzso For both systems zzso the best fit of the models proposed with the experimental data was shown by the zzso approximation and the homogeneous diffusion model with zzso The diffusion zzso are calculated from kinetic models of lead zzso they are of the order of zzso constant for all examined initial zzso and not dependent on zzso The diffusion zzso in the system of zinc zzso is of the order of zzso also independent of initial zzso but decreasing with time from the beginning of zzso exchange to the zzso
