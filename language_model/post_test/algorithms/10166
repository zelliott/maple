The objective of this study was to examine the associations of brain zzso with radio frequency zzso fields from mobile zzso 

Patients with brain zzso from the zzso Canadian, French, Israeli and New Zealand components of the zzso zzso whose zzso were zzso by zzso were zzso zzso were matched on age, sex and region and allocated the zzso zzso of their matched zzso zzso included zzso zzso and zzso zzso cases and zzso and 1911 controls, zzso zzso dose was estimated as total cumulative specific energy zzso zzso absorbed at the zzso estimated zzso taking into account multiple zzso exposure zzso 

zzso with ever having been a regular mobile phone user were zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for zzso zzso for zzso were below 1 in the first four zzso of zzso but above 1 in the highest zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso The OR increased with increasing zzso zzso years before diagnosis zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso in the highest zzso A complementary analysis in which 44 zzso and 135 zzso cases in the most exposed area of the brain were compared with zzso and zzso located elsewhere in the brain showed increased zzso for zzso in the most exposed part of the brain in those with zzso years of mobile phone use zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for zzso zzso for zzso were similar, but zzso were lower, many below zzso 

There were suggestions of an increased risk of zzso in long-term mobile phone users with high zzso exposure and of similar, but apparently much smaller, increases in zzso zzso The uncertainty of these results requires that they be zzso before a zzso interpretation can be zzso
