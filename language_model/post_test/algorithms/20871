zzso theory plays a central role in understanding cognitive processes that have emotional zzso however, there has been very limited attention to its neural zzso After reviewing classical studies in social psychology in which attribution has been zzso manipulated we developed a new approach that allows the investigation of state zzso and emotional consequences using zzso zzso Participants responded to the zzso zzso zzso but, in order to maintain the zzso beliefs about the nature of the task and to produce a significant number of error responses, an zzso zzso tuned the available time to respond such that, dependent on the zzso current performance, the negative feedback rate was held at chance zzso In order to initiate variation in attribution participants were informed that one and the same task was either easy or zzso As a result of these two different instructions the two groups differed significantly in error attribution only on the locus of causality zzso Additionally, zzso were found to be stable over a large number of trials, while accuracy and reaction time remained the zzso Thus, the new paradigm is particularly suitable for cognitive zzso research that evaluates brain zzso relationships of higher order processes in zzso achievement zzso
