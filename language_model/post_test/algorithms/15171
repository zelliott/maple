A zzso study was used to investigate the zzso of zzso and prediction of zzso cartilage loss by analysis of the zzso zzso bone from magnetic resonance images of zzso The zzso Lawrence zzso grades were determined by zzso and the levels of cartilage loss were assessed by a zzso zzso zzso to zzso and potentially capture the structure of the zzso bone zzso a machine learning approach used a set of texture features for training a zzso to recognize the zzso bone of a knee with zzso zzso Using zzso the bone structure marker was used to estimate for each knee both the probability of having zzso zzso zzso zzso and the probability of rapid cartilage volume zzso The diagnostic ability reached a median area under the zzso curve of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the prognosis had odds ratio of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso The medians of cartilage loss of the subjects classified as slow and rapid zzso were zzso and zzso per year, zzso A preliminary zzso reading of the high and low risk knees put forward an hypothesis of which zzso the bone marker could be capturing to define the prognosis of cartilage zzso
