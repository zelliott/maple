The expressions that describe the sound field focused by an acoustic lens with different sound speed distribution zzso in lens are zzso zzso calculation results are zzso in which the zzso and lateral sound pressure zzso and the zzso zzso sound beam profile along the focused field are given out for three types of the acoustic focused lens with zzso curved outer surface and four zzso zzso zzso It is shown that, when sound beam is focused by a lens with zzso the best focal point moves away from the lens and achieves a large focal region compared with the zzso zzso The maximum zzso focused intensity at the best focal point is smaller than that of the zzso case, but the focused beam zzso at the best focal point is larger than that of the zzso zzso The larger the zzso of the zzso the larger the focused beam zzso and the larger focal region, but the divergent angle is almost the zzso
