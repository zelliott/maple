This study aimed to determine if zzso zzso for zzso of zzso zzso detection with zzso zzso zzso require zzso of zzso placement and inclusion of normal zzso A phantom containing fixed zzso of varying size zzso zzso zzso and zzso was scanned at various exposure and slice thickness zzso Two image sets were zzso All images in the first image set contained zzso with known zzso the second image set contained images with zzso in random zzso Following Institutional Review Board approval, nine experienced observers scored zzso zzso using a 4-point confidence zzso Comparisons between image sets were performed using zzso zzso and zzso zzso Observer scores demonstrated strong correlation between both approaches when all zzso sizes were combined zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and for the zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no significant correlation for the zzso zzso A significantly higher sensitivity score for the known compared with the unknown location was found for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso for a single slice thickness and exposure condition zzso zzso zzso of CT zzso examinations requires zzso zzso location when investigating challenging zzso however, a standard phantom with fixed zzso location is suitable for the zzso of routine liver zzso The development of more sophisticated zzso or methods than those currently available is indicated for the zzso of CT protocols for diagnostic tasks involving the detection of subtle zzso
