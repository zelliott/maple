zzso sequence alignment zzso use zzso scoring schemes based on biological expertise, which cannot be used as objective distance zzso As a result one relies on crude measures, like the p- or zzso zzso or makes zzso and often too simplistic, a zzso assumptions about sequence zzso Information theory provides an alternative, in the form of mutual information zzso zzso is, in principle, an objective and model independent similarity measure, but it is not widely used in this context and no zzso for zzso zzso from a given alignment (without assuming an evolutionary zzso is zzso zzso can be estimated without zzso by zzso and zipping zzso but so far this has only produced estimates with uncontrolled zzso despite the fact that the zzso zzso distance based on it has shown promising zzso 

We describe a simple approach to get robust estimates of zzso from global zzso zzso Our main result uses zzso zzso information theory, but we show that similar results can also be obtained from Shannon zzso For animal zzso DNA our approach uses the alignments made by popular global alignment zzso to produce zzso estimates that are zzso close to estimates obtained from the alignment free methods mentioned zzso We point out that, due to the fact that it is not zzso zzso zzso distance is not an optimal metric for zzso but we propose a simple modification that overcomes the issue of zzso We test several versions of our zzso based distance measures on a large number of randomly chosen quartets and demonstrate that they all perform better than traditional measures like the Kimura or zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Several versions of zzso based distances outperform conventional distances in zzso zzso Even a simplified version based on single letter Shannon zzso which can be easily incorporated in existing software packages, gave superior results throughout the entire animal zzso But we see the main virtue of our approach in a more general zzso For example, it can also help to judge the relative merits of different alignment zzso by zzso the significance of specific zzso It strongly suggests that information theory concepts can be exploited further in sequence zzso
