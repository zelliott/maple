We introduce a method for zzso imaging zzso proteins at zzso spatial zzso Numerous sparse zzso of zzso fluorescent protein molecules were zzso localized (to approximately 2 to 25 zzso and then zzso The zzso position information from all zzso was then assembled into a zzso zzso We used this zzso zzso zzso zzso image specific target proteins in thin sections of zzso and zzso in fixed whole cells, we zzso zzso at focal zzso zzso within a zzso and the distribution of the zzso protein zzso at the plasma zzso
