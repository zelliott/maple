zzso functional theory calculations of zzso zzso zzso were carried out to obtain the electronic zzso zzso and zzso zzso moments of 76 zzso zzso No simple relationships were found for the electronic zzso with the relevant zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso binding affinities of zzso which suggests that they alone may not be sufficient to explain the variation in zzso However, quantitative zzso relationships zzso were developed with the zzso and zzso zzso moments, explaining about zzso and 59% of variation in zzso binding affinities of zzso zzso To explain the nature of toxic interaction, a mathematical model based on the zzso binding and zzso interaction was zzso and then a multiple zzso analysis of all the above parameters was performed to evaluate the contributions of the parameters to the bonding zzso Other data for zzso found in the literature were also included in the zzso analysis to minimize data zzso The results suggest that zzso and zzso interactions are equally important for the interaction of zzso with the zzso
