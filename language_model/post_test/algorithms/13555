Swiss zzso was established in 1970 as a composite of zzso zzso and Red zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso composition is currently reported based on pedigree zzso Information on a large number of molecular markers potentially provides more accurate zzso For the analysis, we used zzso zzso zzso zzso data for 90 pure zzso 100 pure zzso and zzso zzso zzso The scope of the study was to compare the performance of hidden zzso models, as implemented in structure software, with methods conventionally used in zzso selection zzso partial least squares zzso zzso least absolute shrinkage and selection operator zzso variable zzso for predicting breed zzso We checked the performance of zzso for a set of zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso of evenly distributed zzso and zzso with different zzso zzso in the pure zzso using zzso as an zzso Key results are correlations of zzso levels estimated with the various zzso with zzso based on pedigree zzso For the full set, zzso zzso and structure performed in a very similar manner zzso of zzso whereas the correlation of zzso and pedigree zzso was lower zzso With decreasing number of zzso correlations decreased substantially only for zzso or zzso of all zzso With zzso chosen according to zzso , results were similar to results obtained with the full zzso Only when using 96 and 48 zzso with the highest zzso , correlations dropped to zzso and zzso zzso zzso the number of pure animals in training sets to 50, 20 and 10 each did not cause a drop in the correlation with pedigree zzso
