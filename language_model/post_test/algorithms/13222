A zzso zzso method is reported for solving the mode characteristics of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The coupled equations are formulated in terms of zzso zzso zzso and zzso solutions are obtained through an zzso zzso The proposed scheme applies in a zzso medium with zzso zzso of practical zzso The accuracy and efficiency of this scheme are demonstrated by solving the mode zzso of a zzso zzso optical zzso analyzed by the well-known zzso zzso beam propagation zzso Furthermore, the relationship between geometry and input power is studied by analyzing the power zzso curve of the long-range surface zzso zzso modes of a zzso zzso zzso
