The problem of the enormous amount of scattered radiation in zzso zzso zzso zzso cone beam computer zzso is zzso zzso causes zzso zzso and zzso and results in a quantitative inaccuracy of reconstructed CT numbers, so that an accurate dose calculation might be zzso Image contrast is also significantly zzso Therefore we checked whether an appropriate zzso of the fast zzso scatter correction zzso we have developed for zzso zzso zzso zzso reduces the scatter contribution in a zzso zzso as zzso This scatter correction method is based on a zzso of zzso zzso Carlo generated pencil beam scatter zzso The zzso requires only a system zzso by measuring homogeneous slab zzso with known zzso zzso In this study we compare scatter corrected zzso images of several zzso to the fan beam CT images acquired with a reduced cone angle (a zzso of 14 zzso in the zzso at the same zzso Additional zzso at a different zzso system were made zzso energy spectrum and zzso distance) and a first order approach of a fast beam zzso correction will be zzso The observed image quality of the scatter corrected zzso images is comparable concerning resolution, noise and zzso ratio to the images acquired in fan beam zzso Compared to the zzso without any corrections the contrast of the zzso phantom with scatter correction and additional beam zzso correction is improved by a factor of about zzso The reconstructed zzso zzso and the CT numbers of the scatter corrected zzso images are close to the values of the images acquired in fan beam geometry for the most pronounced tissue zzso Only for extreme dense tissue types like cortical bone we see a difference in CT numbers of zzso which can be improved to zzso with the additional beam zzso zzso zzso is reduced from zzso to zzso with scatter correction and zzso with an additional beam zzso zzso After 3 zzso zzso zzso and 6 to 7 zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso Therefore the zzso is very fast, that means zzso seconds per projection for 3 zzso on a standard zzso
