zzso zzso zzso is the most commonly diagnosed zzso in clinical zzso However, the mechanisms responsible for its induction and maintenance still are not fully zzso To this respect, analysis of the electrical activity organization within the zzso could play an important role in their proper zzso Although many zzso to zzso zzso organization from invasive zzso can be found in the literature, a reduced number of indirect zzso from the standard zzso have been proposed to zzso Furthermore, these surface methods can only yield a global zzso organization assessment, blurring the possible information that each individual zzso zzso wave may zzso To this respect, the present manuscript proposes a novel method for direct and zzso zzso organization zzso from zzso surface zzso zzso Through the zzso of zzso variations among f waves, the zzso zzso organization is zzso The f waves are individually extracted and delineated from the zzso activity zzso making use of a dynamic time zzso zzso The proposed zzso was tested on real zzso surface recordings in order to discriminate zzso signals with different organization degrees, obtaining a diagnostic accuracy higher than zzso In addition, its performance was validated by comparison with two zzso organization measures from invasive zzso zzso of both zzso providing statistically significant linear correlations between invasive and zzso zzso As a consequence, new zzso are opened through this work in the zzso analysis of zzso where the individualized study of each f wave could assess zzso zzso organization, would improve the understanding of zzso mechanisms and become useful for its clinical zzso
