Image display settings zzso and zzso have a substantial impact on zzso of coronary artery and plaque dimensions in zzso zzso zzso and their influence on measurement accuracy has not been systematically zzso We analyzed the influence of window zzso settings on the accuracy for determining zzso zzso and outer vessel diameters in zzso CT zzso compared with zzso ultrasound zzso 

We evaluated the data sets of 35 zzso zzso CT zzso was performed as part of a research protocol before invasive coronary zzso A zzso volume data set was acquired using a zzso CT zzso scanner zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ultrasound was performed using a zzso zzso zzso zzso Boston Scientific Corporation, zzso zzso and motorized zzso at zzso zzso One hundred exactly corresponding sites within the coronary artery system were identified in both zzso and zzso using zzso points as zzso zzso In zzso data sets, zzso reconstructions zzso slice zzso were rendered zzso to the zzso of the coronary artery at each of the 100 zzso zzso zzso images were displayed using 4 previously published settings zzso zzso and zzso zzso units zzso and 1 zzso of the mean zzso intensity zzso and zzso of the mean zzso intensity zzso for window zzso as well as with a visually adjusted setting for zzso optimal zzso and outer vessel area zzso zzso zzso and zzso vessel areas were manually traced using all 5 display settings and compared with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso vessel area zzso correlation was close and significant compared with zzso using all settings zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso for all zzso zzso analysis revealed a good agreement between both zzso with a systematic bias toward zzso in zzso zzso bias was demonstrated using the setting zzso of the mean zzso intensity for window zzso with a mean zzso difference of zzso zzso zzso For the measurement of the zzso area, the window setting using a zzso of 1 zzso and a level of zzso of the mean zzso intensity showed the lowest correlation to zzso zzso zzso zzso with a systematic bias toward zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso analysis revealed a moderate agreement with a mean zzso difference of zzso zzso zzso For all other settings, a very close correlation was observed zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso analysis revealed a slight trend toward zzso zzso in CT, yet with a good zzso The least bias was demonstrated using the setting zzso zzso for window zzso with a mean zzso difference of zzso zzso zzso 

Previously published window settings and visually adjusted window setting correlate very well with zzso zzso regarding coronary artery zzso and zzso area, with a better agreement for zzso area zzso A systematic bias toward zzso of vessel area in CT was observed as well as a slight trend toward zzso zzso This bias was least for vessel area measurement using zzso of the mean zzso intensity zzso for window zzso whereas for zzso area zzso the setting zzso zzso for window zzso yielded the least zzso
