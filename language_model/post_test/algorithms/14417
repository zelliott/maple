The zzso zzso zzso is a new zzso based zzso zzso technique designed for zzso highly correlated networks from noisy zzso zzso Conventional zzso techniques are successful in zzso zzso sources that are zzso under poor zzso ratio zzso zzso However, they fail to reconstruct multiple highly correlated zzso Though previously published zzso techniques can successfully zzso multiple correlated sources, they are zzso expensive and zzso requiring a zzso zzso The zzso is able to automatically calculate optimal zzso and zzso orientation for zzso greatly reducing the zzso cost of the zzso zzso zzso with a modified Powell algorithm, the zzso can quickly identify multiple sets of correlated sources contributing to the zzso zzso Through computer simulations, we show that the zzso quickly and accurately reconstructs source locations and their zzso under widely varying zzso degrees of zzso and source zzso zzso also show that the zzso identifies multiple simultaneously active correlated zzso Additionally, zzso performance was tested using zzso data in zzso In an auditory task, the zzso localized and reconstructed highly correlated left and right auditory zzso In a zzso stimulation task, the zzso identified multiple meaningful networks of zzso without any a zzso zzso Altogether, our results indicate that the zzso is an effective and valuable tool for reconstructing correlated networks of neural activity from zzso zzso
