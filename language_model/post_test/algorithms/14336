The management zzso has successfully treated 11 limbs in 11 patients with zzso vascular zzso zzso over the period 1995 to 2003, with no instances of limb zzso Five of these patients required surgical zzso 

The authors recommend a multidisciplinary approach involving plastic surgeons and zzso for all cases of suspected or confirmed zzso zzso A consensus zzso that determines the role of zzso zzso and acute surgical interventions, and the sequence of such interventions, is useful in providing the framework of zzso The early recognition of the limb at risk is a key factor in obtaining a successful zzso
