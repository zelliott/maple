This study evaluated zzso zzso by using internal and external zzso zzso The effect of zzso addition on the zzso activity of zzso which was used as a model drug during the zzso zzso process, was also zzso The powder mixture zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso with zzso zzso cellulose zzso solution and then zzso using an zzso zzso equipped with a zzso mesh screen at 20 zzso After zzso the sample zzso were passed through a zzso screen zzso zzso A zzso sample was compressed by using zzso zzso and dies at 49, 98, zzso or 388 zzso zzso zzso at a speed of 25 zzso The external zzso zzso was performed using zzso without zzso in the zzso and zzso The zzso were already dry coated by the zzso In contrast, the internal zzso zzso was performed using sample zzso (without dry zzso containing zzso zzso At 98 zzso for example, the zzso level using the external zzso addition method was about zzso higher than that for internal zzso The significantly higher zzso energy was also observed at other zzso By comparison, the friction energy for the external addition method calculated based on upper and lower zzso forces was only slightly zzso The zzso of zzso prepared using the internal addition method was zzso to zzso lower than that for the external addition zzso The total pore volume of the tablet prepared using the external addition method was significantly zzso The maximum ejection pressure using the zzso method zzso the tablet was prepared using neither zzso zzso nor added zzso was significantly higher than that of other addition zzso The order was as zzso no addition, external addition, and then internal zzso The ejection energy zzso for internal addition was the zzso for no addition, zzso was the zzso In the dissolution test, the zzso obtained using external addition immediately disintegrated and showed faster drug release than those prepared using internal zzso This result occurred because the water penetration rate of the tablet using the external addition was much zzso The zzso activity in zzso prepared using the external addition method was significantly higher than that produced using the internal addition method at the same zzso All these results suggest that the external addition method might produce a zzso zzso Because the drug will be compressed using low pressure only, an unstable bulk drug may be zzso without losing zzso
