A new real-time zzso method for zzso zzso signals has been developed based on the zzso transform zzso The method is specifically adaptable for zzso zzso zzso The signal is segmented into beats and a beat template is zzso from them, producing a residual zzso Beat templates and residual signals are coded with a zzso zzso zzso is achieved by selecting a subset of zzso zzso The number of selected zzso depends on a threshold which has different definitions depending on the operational mode of the zzso zzso performance has been tested using a subset of zzso records from zzso zzso zzso This method has been designed for real-time zzso zzso scenarios both in wired and wireless zzso
