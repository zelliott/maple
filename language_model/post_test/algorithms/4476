The zzso phenomenon in zzso zzso scattering is investigated on the basis of the direct Taylor expansion of the electric zzso transition moments in zzso zzso zzso with respect to zzso normal zzso A zzso density functional theory treatment is applied to zzso the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso model for zzso zzso and the model zzso agree favorably with zzso This direct evaluation approach may provide a method of predicting zzso and studying its zzso
