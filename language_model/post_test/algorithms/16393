Conventional CT requires generation of separate images utilizing different zzso kernels to zzso zzso zzso Our goal was to develop and test a hybrid CT zzso to simultaneously zzso bone and zzso zzso potentially zzso the number of images that need to be zzso zzso and zzso 

CT images generated with separate zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso kernels were zzso combined so that zzso zzso zzso less than zzso zzso or greater than 150 zzso are zzso with corresponding zzso kernel reconstructed zzso A total of 38 CT examinations were reviewed using the hybrid technique, including 20 head, eight spine, and 10 head and neck zzso Three zzso independently reviewed all 38 hybrid cases, comparing them to both standard zzso and zzso kernel zzso images for characterization of anatomy and zzso zzso The zzso of bone, soft zzso and related anatomy were compared for each CT reconstruction zzso 

For the depiction of bone, in all 38 cases, the three zzso scored the hybrid images as being equivalent to zzso kernel reconstructions but superior to the zzso zzso For depiction of zzso soft zzso and brain, the hybrid kernel was rated equivalent to the zzso kernel but superior to that of the zzso zzso 

The hybrid zzso kernel is a promising technique zzso zzso bone and soft tissue evaluation while potentially zzso the number of images needed to be zzso zzso and zzso
