The zzso model developed in our recent publications zzso is used to investigate the zzso of zzso diffusion from a source to a detector on the membrane zzso In most cases the observed zzso shows a single zzso maximum with the exponential ascending front and the zzso descending zzso The zzso depends on the distance between the source and the zzso If the detector is located inside the zzso collecting zzso the zzso zzso to the surface diffusion at the times near the maximum and shortly thereafter, and it turns into the bulk diffusion zzso at longer times, after the equilibrium is established between the membrane surface and the bulk zzso If the detector is located outside the zzso the zzso zzso to the bulk diffusion at all times where the signal is zzso What is seen at locations near the antenna radius depends on the exchange zzso In the regime of fast exchange between the surface and the bulk as compared to the bulk zzso the zzso shows a single peak whose location is intermediate between the zzso for the surface and bulk zzso In the regime of slow exchange there are two zzso corresponding to the surface and bulk zzso In zzso solutions the antenna radius decreases with increasing buffer zzso which changes the zzso from the surface to bulk zzso The theory is applied to zzso recent experiments on a zzso membrane zzso It is found that zzso the fast exchange regime is operating since only a single maximum is zzso zzso the shift of the maximum toward longer times with increasing buffer concentration is a manifestation of the transition from the surface to bulk diffusion zzso
