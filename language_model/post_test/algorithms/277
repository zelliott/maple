To examine the performance of the new zzso in screening for zzso 21 by a combination of maternal age, fetal zzso zzso zzso and maternal serum free zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso plasma zzso zzso 

This was a prospective screening study for zzso 21 in singleton zzso at 11 + 0 to 13 + 6 weeks of gestation using an zzso combining maternal age, fetal zzso thickness based on the mixture model for the assessment of zzso and maternal serum free zzso and zzso based on a multiple zzso model for the assessment of serum zzso The zzso zzso were performed by 60 operators who had obtained The Fetal Medicine Foundation certificate of competence in the zzso zzso 

The study population consisted of 19 zzso zzso with a normal zzso or delivery of a zzso normal baby zzso zzso and 122 cases of zzso zzso In the zzso fetuses the zzso was above the previously defined zzso zzso and zzso zzso in 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 123 zzso cases and the respective values for zzso 21 were 117 zzso 94 zzso and 57 zzso The median fetal zzso was within zzso zzso of the expected in 47 zzso of the 60 zzso and within zzso zzso in zzso In the zzso fetuses the median free zzso was zzso zzso zzso multiples of the median zzso and the median zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso The median zzso values were zzso or close to zzso zzso for each zzso of pregnancy zzso including zzso of 11, 12 and 13 weeks, maternal weight of zzso 60 zzso zzso zzso and zzso 80 zzso different ethnic origins, cigarette smokers and zzso natural conception and in zzso zzso For a zzso rate of zzso the detection rate of zzso 21 in screening by maternal age and fetal zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso by maternal age and maternal serum zzso it was zzso zzso zzso zzso and by combined screening based on maternal age, fetal zzso and maternal serum zzso it was zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This study has validated the new risk zzso and demonstrated that in combined screening for zzso 21 based on maternal age, fetal zzso and free zzso and zzso the detection rate is about zzso for a zzso zzso zzso
