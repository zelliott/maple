When recording zzso responses from neural systems, a common problem is the accurate detection of spikes zzso zzso in the presence of competing unwanted zzso zzso While some sources of noise can be readily dealt with through filtering or established zzso zzso techniques, other sources present a more difficult zzso In particular, noise components introduced by power supplies, which contain zzso of the zzso frequency, can be particularly troublesome in that they can mimic the shape of the desired zzso The aforementioned standard techniques typically fail to effectively deal with such zzso In this study, we propose the use of a novel zzso scheme that involves zzso the zzso noise zzso and using zzso techniques to subtract it from the zzso This technique requires two key steps: zzso zzso analysis of each recorded zzso to extract a robust representation of the zzso noise zzso and zzso a second level of zzso to successfully subtract that representation from each recorded zzso This paper describes this zzso and provides examples of its zzso using actual recorded zzso that were contaminated with these zzso noise zzso An improvement zzso in the noise level is reported, as are suggestions for future zzso of this zzso
