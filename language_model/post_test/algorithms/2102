The zzso and zzso zzso laboratories at the University of Minnesota Medical School zzso have collaborated to develop a diagnostic zzso to identify all factor zzso zzso carriers without performing unnecessary and expensive genetic zzso The zzso uses a zzso zzso for activated protein C resistance zzso to determine the need for genetic zzso We report the results of our experience zzso this zzso We compared the sensitivity, zzso and positive and negative zzso values of two measures of zzso the zzso ratio and the zzso zzso We found that the zzso ratio was the more sensitive but less specific zzso to determine the need for genetic zzso By using the zzso ratio as the standard by which to refer patients to the zzso zzso Laboratory, all zzso carriers were zzso We found a large overlap in both measures of zzso between symptomatic patients with normal zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that increased factor VIII levels with a normal zzso are associated with apparent zzso In this article we also review other zzso of apparent zzso
