We provide theoretical comparisons of the physical properties of zzso proteins with the zzso proteins of class 10 zzso fold, which is characterized by a large zzso cavity enclosed between a curved zzso and a variable zzso Our novel zzso to calculate the volume of internal cavities within protein structures is used to demonstrate that, although the sizes of the cavities of the investigated zzso proteins vary significantly, their other physical properties, such as zzso and mechanical parameters or parameters related to zzso are very zzso The largest variations (in the order of zzso are predicted for the optimal folding zzso We show that, on zzso the zzso proteins behave differently from typical virus zzso
