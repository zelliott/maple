Up to now, fiber zzso in the clinical routine is mostly based on diffusion zzso imaging zzso However, there are known drawbacks in the resolution of crossing or kissing fibers and in the vicinity of a tumor or zzso These restrictions can be overcome by zzso based on High zzso Resolution zzso Imaging zzso which in turn requires larger numbers of zzso resulting in longer acquisition zzso Using compressed sensing zzso techniques, zzso signals can be obtained by using less zzso diffusion zzso thus enabling the use of zzso fiber zzso in the clinical zzso 

Eight patients with zzso in the zzso zzso in proximity to the zzso radiation zzso underwent zzso zzso including a zzso zzso with 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso of the OR using a deterministic streamline zzso based on zzso was compared to zzso based on reconstructed diffusion signals using zzso 

zzso based zzso displayed the OR more zzso compared to the zzso results in all eight zzso In particular, the potential of zzso zzso was observed for cases of high grade zzso with significant zzso zzso larger tumor size or closer proximity of tumor and reconstructed fiber zzso 

zzso the problem of long acquisition times, zzso seems to be a promising basis for fiber zzso of the OR in regions of disturbed zzso areas of high interest in zzso zzso
