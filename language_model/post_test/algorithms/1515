zzso zzso growth models are of interest for cancer risk assessment because they can explicitly incorporate data on cell zzso Both approximate and exact zzso of the two stage growth model have been zzso The exact solution considers the conditional probability of tumors arising in previously zzso zzso the approximate solution estimates total probability of tumor zzso The exact solution is much more zzso intensive when zzso cell growth parameters are zzso The approximate solution deviates from the exact solution at high zzso and probabilities of zzso This report describes a zzso zzso zzso zzso to the exact zzso Our improved approximation includes a correction term to adjust the unconditional expectation of intermediate cells based on the time history of formation of intermediate cells by zzso of normal cells zzso or by cell division in the intermediate cell population zzso The improved approximation provided a much better match to the exact solution than the approximate solution for a wide range of zzso zzso The correction term also appears to provide insight into the biological factors that contribute to the zzso of the expectation for the number of intermediate cells over zzso
