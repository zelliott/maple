zzso episodes of zzso of zzso activity in particular frequency ranges are thought to zzso zzso zzso mode decomposition phase zzso zzso analysis is a method for determining the frequency and timing of phase zzso that is zzso to intrinsic zzso within data, alleviating the need for arbitrary zzso filter zzso zzso It is extended here to address the choice of reference zzso and removal of zzso zzso resulting from volume zzso zzso zzso transformation and independent component analysis zzso are performed as zzso steps, and preservation of phase zzso between synthetic signals, combined using a simple forward model, is zzso The method is contrasted with use of zzso filtering following the same zzso steps, and filter zzso are shown to influence zzso detection zzso Furthermore, an approach to the assessment of multiple zzso trials using the method is introduced, and the assessment of statistical significance of phase zzso episodes is extended to render it zzso to local phase zzso zzso zzso is validated in the analysis of real zzso data, during finger zzso The time course of zzso zzso zzso is shown to differ from that of longer range phase zzso episodes, zzso different roles for these different types of zzso It is suggested that the increase in phase zzso which occurs just prior to movement, coinciding with a reduction in power (or zzso may result from selection of the neural assembly relevant to the particular zzso
