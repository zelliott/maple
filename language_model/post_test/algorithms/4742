Failure to rescue zzso the rate of death in patients suffering 1 of 6 zzso zzso is an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality zzso Patient Safety zzso calculated from administrative zzso 

: We sought to assess the accuracy of the zzso zzso zzso 

We undertook a retrospective chart review of 60 zzso cases of zzso identified by the zzso at each of 40 University zzso zzso zzso The primary outcome was the overall accuracy of the zzso compared with chart zzso We also assessed accuracy by complication type, patient zzso institution, service assignment, and zzso 

Of zzso cases, zzso zzso were accurately identified by the zzso as having had at least one of the zzso complications during zzso Of the zzso complications identified in these patients, zzso zzso were correctly flagged by the algorithm, zzso zzso were present on admission, zzso zzso were not confirmed by chart review, and 250 zzso met a zzso zzso criterion for zzso The case accuracy rate varied significantly by institution zzso zzso range, zzso P zzso zzso service assignment zzso service, zzso zzso zzso service, zzso P zzso zzso and mortality zzso zzso zzso dead, zzso P zzso zzso but was not affected by patients' age, zzso race, or insurance zzso 

As currently calculated from administrative data, the zzso zzso zzso half of the cases on average, is least accurate for zzso cases, and is widely variable across zzso This indicator may be useful internally to flag possible cases of quality failure but has limitations for external institutional zzso zzso in coding quality and consistency across institutions are zzso
