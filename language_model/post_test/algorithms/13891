A general method of zzso forecasting employing the dynamic linear model has been adapted to the problem of zzso individual zzso zzso The zzso forecasting method incorporates an efficient Kalman filter zzso for updating zzso zzso estimates when further observations are zzso The Kalman filter is more general and flexible than other zzso methods currently used and simulation studies have demonstrated its practicality for three different zzso zzso The method serves as the basis for a computer program for general clinical zzso
