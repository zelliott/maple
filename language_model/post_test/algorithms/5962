zzso evidence indicates that zzso has a role for peripheral zzso signaling in animals and zzso However, the mechanisms of the zzso effects of zzso have not been fully zzso The current study investigated the effects of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso response of cultured adult mice zzso root zzso zzso zzso root zzso were harvested from adult male zzso mice and were zzso With a digital image analysis system, we detected the zzso image of cultured zzso root zzso cells after loading with zzso zzso In addition, zzso of protein zzso zzso with transient zzso potential zzso and the zzso of protein zzso zzso were investigated using zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso enhanced an increase in zzso by zzso (10 zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso (71 of 156 zzso The zzso of zzso A zzso zzso significantly suppressed the enhancing effect of zzso In addition, a zzso protein zzso C inhibitor zzso I) significantly suppressed the enhancing effect of zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also significantly suppressed the enhancing effect of zzso In the zzso study, protein zzso zzso zzso was found in most of transient zzso potential zzso zzso After zzso application, protein zzso zzso zzso was observed to be zzso from the zzso to the cell membrane in transient zzso potential zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso enhances the response of zzso root zzso zzso to zzso in a protein zzso zzso zzso Our findings may lead to a new strategy to treat pain associated with zzso
