Tracking objects in video using the mean shift zzso technique has been the subject of considerable zzso In this work, we aim to remedy one of its zzso zzso like other zzso ascent zzso methods, is designed to find local zzso In many situations, however, we seek the global mode of a density zzso The standard zzso tracker assumes that the zzso point falls within the basin of attraction of the desired zzso When tracking objects in video this assumption may not hold, particularly when the target's displacement between successive frames is zzso In this case, the local and global modes do not zzso and the tracker is likely to zzso A novel zzso zzso procedure is proposed which zzso to the global mode of the density function, regardless of the zzso zzso We term the procedure zzso zzso as it shares similarities with the zzso importance sampling zzso The bandwidth of the procedure plays the same role as the temperature in conventional zzso We observe that an zzso density function with a sufficiently large bandwidth is zzso Using a continuation principle, the influence of the global peak in the density function is introduced zzso In this way, the global maximum is more reliably zzso Since it is imperative that the zzso complexity is minimal for real-time applications, such as visual zzso we also propose an accelerated version of the zzso This significantly decreases the number of zzso required to achieve zzso We show on various data sets that the proposed zzso offers considerable promise in reliably and rapidly finding the true object location when zzso from a distant zzso
