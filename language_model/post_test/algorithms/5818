zzso based on electrical stimulation could potentially help disabled zzso They are based on neural interface that aim at creating an intimate contact with neural zzso The efficacy of zzso can be improved by increasing the selectivity of the neural zzso used to stimulate specific zzso of zzso zzso is strongly influenced by interface zzso Computer models can be useful for exploring the high zzso space of design parameters with the aim to provide guidelines for the development of more efficient electrodes, with minimal animal use and zzso of manufacturing zzso The purpose of this study was to implement a realistic model of the performance of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso implanted into the rat zzso zzso A realistic finite element method zzso model was developed taking into account the anatomical and zzso features of the rat zzso zzso Electric zzso were calculated and zzso zzso were applied to the model of a rat zzso nerve zzso based on experimental zzso zzso zzso indicate that high zzso and zzso selectivity values with low current levels can be achieved with zzso The selectivity of zzso was also compared to an zzso zzso showing that higher selectivity with less current can be zzso Using this model, the zzso of zzso performances for zzso and zzso zzso were zzso
