The structural properties of the cluster series zzso zzso zzso zzso and Li, m zzso or zzso 6) are studied by density functional theory zzso employing a plane wave zzso The equilibrium zzso and energetic properties of these clusters are obtained by use of the simulated zzso procedure in conjunction with the zzso thermostat zzso The lowest energy zzso thus obtained is analyzed by density functional theory at the zzso level including all zzso zzso ground state structures derived from the zzso equilibrium zzso of both zzso and zzso are obtained for zzso with m zzso zzso The zzso zzso in contrast, tend toward zzso zzso where m Li atoms are attached to a zzso with pronounced negative zzso For both zzso and zzso a marked decrease of the energy gap is found as the number of metal atom constituents zzso
