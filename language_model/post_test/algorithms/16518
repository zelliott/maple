zzso zzso zzso zzso enables full reconstruction of the complex transmission function of an isolated object to zzso resolution without relying on any optical elements between the sample and zzso In combination with zzso also specimens of unlimited lateral extension can be zzso Here we report on an application of zzso coherent zzso imaging zzso in the soft zzso regime, more precisely in the so-called water window of zzso energies where the high scattering contrast between carbon and oxygen is zzso to image biological zzso In particular, we have reconstructed the complex sample transmission function of a fossil zzso at a zzso energy of 517 zzso In imaging a zzso zzso test sample a resolution on the order of 50 zzso zzso zzso has been zzso Along with this zzso for zzso at soft zzso zzso we discuss the experimental and technical challenges which can occur especially for soft zzso zzso
