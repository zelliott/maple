A zzso model is developed to match aerospace ocean color observation to field zzso and derive the spatial zzso of zzso zzso The performance of the model is tested against populations of zzso zzso and full and reduced resolutions of zzso zzso The model derived the scale difference between zzso satellite zzso and point zzso with zzso zzso zzso and relative error zzso zzso in the spectral range from 400 zzso to zzso zzso The zzso zzso of reduced resolution zzso image are derived with less than zzso of relative errors in zzso zzso The method is generic and zzso to different zzso
