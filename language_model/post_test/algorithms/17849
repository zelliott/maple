To effectively postpone zzso birth, cervical zzso needs to be detected and zzso As the zzso zzso the spacing between the collagen fibers increases and fills with water, zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso of the zzso should zzso The decrease in zzso zzso may be zzso leading to an effective means of detecting cervical zzso zzso the traditional zzso zzso zzso based on measuring the zzso in center frequency of the zzso zzso signal with propagation depth was modified and applied to the zzso of zzso The modified zzso was verified using computer simulations and an ex zzso tissue sample before being evaluated in in zzso animal zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso center zzso and with zzso focal lengths were used in both the simulations and zzso The accuracy was better than zzso in the simulations, and the zzso slope of the zzso in the ex zzso experiment was zzso zzso which is comparable to zzso zzso measured using a zzso zzso loss zzso For the in zzso experiments, a statistically significant effect of zzso zzso with zzso age was not zzso The large zzso in the in zzso results were most likely due to the natural variation in zzso for biological tissue between zzso
