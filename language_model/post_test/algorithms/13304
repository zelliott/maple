zzso zzso ratio zzso tracking is often used to measure speech reception in zzso Because zzso varies with performance using this method, data interpretation can be zzso when measuring an zzso effect such as the zzso benefit zzso (the zzso improvement afforded by brief dips in the zzso zzso One way to overcome this zzso and allow zzso comparisons across listener groups with different zzso performance, is to adjust the response set size to zzso performance across groups at a fixed zzso However, this technique is only valid under the assumption that changes in set size have the same effect on zzso performance for different zzso zzso This assumption was tested by measuring zzso identification for zzso listeners as a function of zzso set size and zzso zzso noise, zzso and zzso modulated noise and an interfering zzso zzso adjustment had the same impact on performance scores for all zzso confirming the independence of zzso (at matched zzso and set zzso These results, along with those of a second experiment evaluating an zzso zzso zzso to adjust performance levels, establish set size as an efficient and effective tool to adjust baseline performance when comparing effects of zzso fluctuations between listener zzso
