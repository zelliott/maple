zzso protein complexes are abundant in the living zzso zzso their atomic structure can shed light on the mechanism of many important biological zzso zzso zzso methods aim to predict the structure of these complexes given the zzso structure of a single zzso or its zzso zzso constraints reduce the zzso of these methods and make the prediction easier compared to zzso zzso zzso However, the challenge of modeling the zzso changes that the zzso might undergo is a major zzso In this article, we present zzso a novel method for refinement and zzso of zzso zzso zzso The method models backbone and zzso movements and zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso The backbone movements are modeled by normal modes zzso and the zzso of the zzso are modeled by selecting optimal zzso Since solved structures of zzso zzso show zzso zzso zzso we do not use symmetry constraints in the zzso zzso zzso The refined models are zzso according to an energy zzso We tested the method on a benchmark of zzso zzso zzso The results show that the method significantly improves the accuracy and the ranking of zzso rigid zzso zzso zzso is available for download at zzso zzso
