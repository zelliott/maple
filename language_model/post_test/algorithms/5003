When replicate count data are zzso it is common practice to incorporate this zzso zzso by including zzso parameters at the observation zzso For example, the negative zzso and zzso zzso models are obtained by using gamma and zzso zzso zzso zzso Several recent publications have employed the zzso information criterion zzso to choose between these two models, with the zzso defined using the zzso likelihood that is obtained from conditioning on these zzso zzso The results zzso show that this use of zzso is zzso Instead, zzso was seen to perform well if calculated using likelihood that was marginalized at the group level by zzso out the zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso is explicit in the case of the negative zzso but requires zzso integration for the zzso zzso Similarly, zzso performed well to judge whether zero inflation was required when calculated using the zzso form of the zzso zzso In the context of comparing zzso zzso models, the zzso zzso was obtained using likelihood that was further marginalized by additional integration over the zzso zzso zzso and the marginal zzso of the models were calculated for the purpose of providing zzso zzso The zzso viability and zzso of these different measures is zzso
