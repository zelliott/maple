We propose novel zzso for the timing correlation of streaming sensor zzso The sensor data are assumed to have zzso zzso so that they can represent zzso zzso The proposed zzso can support efficient timing correlation for various timing zzso such as deadline, zzso and zzso In addition to the classical techniques, lazy evaluation and result zzso are zzso to improve the zzso zzso The proposed zzso are implemented and compared under various zzso
