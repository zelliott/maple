We develop reconstruction zzso for local zzso zzso for use with generalized scanning zzso The zzso are grounded theoretically in a recently developed zzso theory for exact image reconstruction and principles of zzso zzso Being chord based, they are distinct zzso and zzso from conventional local zzso reconstruction zzso The salient feature of our zzso is that they permit reconstruction of zzso in the profiles of the object function along zzso By consideration of all possible zzso a zzso image that describes the locations of object zzso can be zzso zzso from zzso analysis are applied for understanding the object features that can be reconstructed zzso by use of the zzso A zzso study is conducted to demonstrate the zzso and compare their performance with an existing zzso
