Automatic discrimination between zzso and retrograde zzso zzso would prevent endless loop zzso and contribute to zzso detection zzso We tested its feasibility by comparing zzso and retrograde zzso zzso in 129 patients at the time of zzso lead zzso Only zzso zzso zzso right zzso zzso leads were zzso The mean zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and retrograde zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso less than zzso the mean zzso slew rate was zzso zzso zzso zzso and retrograde zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso less than zzso zzso was similar in 84 patients zzso The zzso zzso exceeded the retrograde by zzso zzso in zzso and by zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso and slew rate contributed little to the discriminating power of zzso zzso Thus, zzso criteria reliably distinguish zzso from retrograde zzso zzso
