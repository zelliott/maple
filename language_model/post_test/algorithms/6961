We propose to investigate the use of zzso zzso observers zzso in conjunction with zzso for the computerized zzso of suspicious regions in chest zzso for being zzso requiring follow zzso Previously, 239 regions of interest zzso each containing a suspicious zzso with proven zzso were zzso We chose to investigate the use of zzso as part of a zzso zzso to determine the presence of a zzso Each zzso incorporates information about zzso background, and noise correlation for zzso For this study, 225 separate zzso observers were set up in a grid across each zzso Each separate observer discriminates an 8 by 8 zzso zzso A round robin sampling scheme was used to generate the 225 features, where each feature is the output of the individual zzso These features were then rank ordered by the magnitude of the weights of a zzso Once rank ordered, zzso of increasing number of features were selected to be used in another zzso This zzso was trained to minimize mean squared error and the output was a continuous variable representing the likelihood of the region being a zzso Performance was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic zzso analysis and reported as the area under the curve zzso The zzso was zzso by adding additional features until the zzso zzso The zzso subset of observers then were combined using a third zzso A subset of 80 features was selected which gave an zzso of zzso Additionally, at zzso sensitivity, the zzso had a specificity of zzso and increased the positive zzso value from zzso to zzso zzso zzso results suggest that using zzso in combination with zzso can provide a successful zzso scheme for pulmonary zzso This approach could be incorporated into a larger computer aided detection system for decreasing false zzso
