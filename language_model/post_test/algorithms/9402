This study was carried out to assess the effects of zzso and zzso upon isolated zzso as an in zzso model of human zzso zzso were isolated from healthy volunteer skin samples of unknown metal sensitivity zzso and were compared with cells from patient zzso of known metal sensitivity zzso zzso were zzso with a concentration range of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and cellular zzso activity, zzso metal zzso and zzso release were zzso zzso of primary versus zzso zzso were also zzso zzso data from primary and zzso zzso was statistically zzso by the zzso Hill zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso was significantly more zzso associated more with zzso and induced a dose zzso release of zzso compared to zzso zzso differences were observed between primary and zzso zzso with regard to the toxicity of zzso and zzso and variation of zzso No differences were observed in the zzso or zzso release induced by zzso or zzso for the known zzso biopsy patient samples zzso compared to patch test negative controls zzso The results from this study suggest human zzso in zzso respond very differently to zzso and zzso
