Novel zzso zzso experimental techniques have prompted a growing need to develop refined zzso models of zzso zzso As a necessary first step towards useful molecular simulations of zzso zzso we have derived a force field for the commonly used zzso zzso zzso zzso A novel automated method is used that includes fitting the molecular mechanics potential to both zzso zzso and zzso projections derived from quantum chemical zzso The method is zzso on a series of aromatic molecules then applied to derive new parameters for zzso The force field derived reproduces well the crystal structure of zzso
