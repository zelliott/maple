To zzso the zzso impact of zzso zzso zzso zzso pulmonary ventilation zzso functional treatment planning that avoids zzso lung zzso 

zzso ventilation images were created from 15 zzso lung cancer patients using zzso image registration and quantitative analysis of the zzso displacement zzso zzso For each patient, zzso and functional plans were created for zzso zzso zzso and zzso modulated arc therapy zzso zzso beam angles and zzso constraints were used for all zzso The plans with zzso zzso Oncology Group zzso zzso major zzso were modified until clinically zzso zzso planning spared the zzso zzso and zzso planning treated the lungs as zzso zzso We zzso the impact of functional planning compared with zzso planning using the two- or zzso zzso zzso 

zzso planning led to significant reductions in the zzso lung dose, without significantly increasing other critical organ doses, but at the expense of significantly zzso the planning target volume zzso conformity and zzso The average reduction in the zzso lung mean dose was zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso larger changes occurred in the metrics for patients with a larger amount of zzso lung adjacent to the zzso 

The results of the present study have demonstrated the impact of zzso ventilation zzso functional planning for zzso and zzso for the first zzso Our findings indicate the potential of functional planning in lung functional avoidance for both zzso and zzso particularly for patients who have zzso lung adjacent to the zzso
