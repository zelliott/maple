The zzso concentration range actually useful for zzso predictions is significantly zzso than the total range scanned in a zzso zzso This range, called zzso zzso zzso zzso if known with the highest zzso allows to predict zzso retention times zzso with minimal zzso The small size of the zzso supports the application of the linear zzso strength theory zzso Furthermore, zzso allows a zzso solution to the integral required to predict zzso retention times, which eliminates zzso integration, needed with other retention zzso A methodology that zzso the zzso by applying error analysis, and uses it to improve the accuracy in the prediction of zzso from zzso experiments, is zzso The importance of those zzso compositions that do not contribute significantly to the prediction of zzso is selectively attenuated within the prediction algorithm, relying the predictions more heavily on the zzso As a result, zzso was found to be predicted with similar accuracy using zzso training data with regard to predictions based on zzso training zzso The approach is useful for all situations where the zzso is able to provide predictions of retention at constant zzso zzso and wish to predict the retention in zzso zzso
