Image registration of zzso images is an essential task in numerous applications in three-dimensional medical image zzso Medical diagnosis can benefit from the complementary information in different zzso zzso zzso registration techniques, while still widely used, were succeeded by zzso registration zzso that appear to be theoretically advantageous in terms of reliability and zzso Several applications of such zzso for the registration of zzso zzso zzso and zzso images have emerged in the literature, using local zzso techniques for the matching of zzso Our purpose in this work is the development of automatic techniques for the registration of real CT and zzso images, based on either zzso or zzso zzso zzso is achieved using genetic zzso that are known for their zzso The two techniques are compared against a well-established method, the zzso zzso zzso The correlation zzso was employed as an independent measure of spatial match, to produce unbiased zzso The repeated measures zzso indicates the significant impact of the choice of registration method on the magnitude of the correlation zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The zzso method achieves an average correlation zzso value of zzso with a standard zzso of zzso as opposed to an average of zzso with a standard zzso of zzso achieved by the zzso method and an average of zzso with a standard zzso equal to zzso achieved by zzso The zzso technique performs significantly better compared to both zzso zzso Neuman zzso zzso and the zzso technique zzso zzso zzso zzso registration and zzso do not differ significantly in zzso
