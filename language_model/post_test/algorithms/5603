zzso zzso reconstruction of electron zzso zzso has emerged as an important technique in analyzing structures of complex biological zzso However most of existing reconstruction methods are not suitable for extremely noisy and incomplete data zzso We present an zzso simultaneous zzso reconstruction technique zzso in which a modified zzso access scheme and an zzso relaxation zzso adjustment method are developed to improve the quality of the reconstructed zzso zzso The reconstruction process is facilitated by using a zzso substitution zzso This modified zzso access scheme is adopted to arrange the order of projections so as to minimize the correlations between consecutive views within a limited angle zzso In the zzso relaxation zzso adjustment method, not only the weight zzso (as in the existing zzso but the gray levels of the zzso are employed to adjust the relaxation parameters so that the quality of the reconstruction is improved while the convergence process of the reconstruction is zzso In the zzso substitution approach, the zzso to obtain the zzso of the sum for the columns in each view is avoided so that the needed zzso for each iteration can be zzso Experimental results show that the proposed technique zzso is better based on objective quality measures than other methods, especially when data is noisy and limited in tilt zzso At the same time, the reconstruction by zzso zzso that of simultaneous zzso reconstruction technique zzso in zzso
