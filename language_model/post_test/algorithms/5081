A design of a zzso for continuous separation of particles based on alternating current zzso is zzso The geometric design parameters are determined by analyzing the zzso force field inside the zzso corresponding to the most efficient zzso The zzso of 5 and 10 zzso zzso particles are derived zzso using zzso tracking method to examine the feasibility and the effectiveness of the zzso The effects of the mean flow zzso inside the channel and the applied zzso across the channel on the performance of the separation are also zzso
