zzso genetic studies in humans and model systems increasingly involve both high-resolution zzso and zzso quantitative zzso We present a novel method to zzso and interpret genetic interactions that exploits the complementary information in multiple zzso We applied this approach to a population of zzso strains with randomly assorted zzso of five genes involved in zzso We zzso zzso response at the molecular level and overall mating zzso These zzso were jointly analyzed to derive a network of genetic interactions that mapped zzso zzso To determine the distinct biological processes driving the zzso zzso we analyzed patterns of gene expression to find that the zzso response zzso is specific to cellular fusion, whereas mating efficiency was a combined measure of cellular fusion, cell cycle arrest, and modifications in cellular zzso We applied our novel method to global gene expression patterns to derive an zzso interaction network and demonstrate zzso to global transcript zzso Our approach provides a basis for interpretation of genetic interactions and the generation of specific hypotheses from populations zzso for multiple zzso
