This work explores the effect of virtual fixture zzso on the performance, defined by error and time, of task execution with a zzso cooperative zzso A desired path is obtained using computer vision, and virtual fixtures for assistance in zzso path following were implemented on an zzso zzso The zzso controller uses a zzso gain, so that the speed of the robot is zzso to the force applied by the zzso The level of virtual fixture guidance is determined by the zzso ratio, which is the ratio of the zzso gain of the force components zzso to the path to the gain of the force components parallel to the zzso In zzso 1, we found a linear relationship between zzso ratio and zzso In zzso 2, we examined the effect of zzso ratio on the performance of three tasks: path following, zzso zzso and obstacle zzso An zzso was developed to select an appropriate zzso ratio based on the nature of the zzso Automatic zzso ratio tuning is recommended for next-generation virtual zzso zzso or potential applications of this research include surgery, zzso and manipulation at the zzso and zzso zzso
