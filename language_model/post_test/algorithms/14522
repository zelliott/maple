During zzso zzso zzso undergo zzso folding and zzso which leads to a hole in the zzso zzso zzso covered by an zzso tissue called the zzso zzso closure zzso consists of the migration of lateral zzso towards the zzso covering the zzso It has been extensively studied since numerous physical mechanisms and signaling pathways present in DC are zzso in other zzso events and wound healing in many other species (including zzso We present here a simple mathematical model for DC that involves a reduced number of parameters directly linked to the intensity of the forces in the presence and which is zzso to a wide range of zzso of the leading edge zzso This model is a natural zzso of the very interesting model proposed in zzso et zzso zzso Being based on an ordinary differential equation zzso approach, the previous model had the advantage of being even zzso but this restricted significantly the variety of zzso that could be considered and thus the number of modified zzso zzso that could be zzso A partial differential equation zzso approach, as the one developed here, allows considering much more general situations that show up in genetically or physically zzso zzso and whose study will be essential for a proper understanding of the different components of the DC zzso Even for native zzso our model has the advantage of being zzso since an early stages of DC when there is no zzso symmetry zzso verified only in the late zzso of zzso We validate our model in a native setting and also test it further in zzso where the zipping force is zzso through the expression of zzso (a zzso severing zzso We obtain variations of the force zzso that are consistent with what was previously described for this zzso
