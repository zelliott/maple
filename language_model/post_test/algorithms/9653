We study the problem of zzso an electromagnetic beam of any state of zzso and polarization into a zzso optical zzso Using the well-known concept of the zzso density zzso we derive a general expression for the zzso efficiency of a zzso electromagnetic beam into a zzso fiber in terms of the zzso density zzso of the incident beam and another zzso representing field zzso of fiber zzso We apply this result to a specific case in which the incident beam belongs to a broad class of so-called electromagnetic zzso zzso beams and obtain a simple zzso expression for the zzso efficiency in the case of zzso zzso We use this expression to study how zzso efficiency depends on the zzso and polarization properties of the incident zzso
