Parallel evolutionary zzso over the past few years, have proven zzso zzso but there seems to be a lack of understanding of their zzso In this paper we concentrate on cellular zzso models, our objectives being: zzso to introduce a suite of statistical measures, both at the zzso and zzso levels, which are useful for analyzing the workings of cellular evolutionary zzso and zzso to demonstrate the application and utility of these measures on a specific zzso cellular programming evolutionary zzso The latter is used to evolve solutions to three distinct zzso problems in the zzso zzso density, zzso and random number zzso zzso our statistical measures, we are able to identify a number of trends common to all three problems (which may represent intrinsic properties of the zzso zzso as well as a host of zzso zzso We find that the evolutionary zzso tends to undergo a number of zzso which we are able to zzso zzso The results obtained lead us to believe that the measures presented zzso may prove useful in the general case of analyzing zzso evolutionary zzso
