This study presents applying recurrence zzso analysis zzso on zzso recordings and their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and gamma for zzso seizure zzso zzso is adopted since it does not require assumptions about zzso length of zzso and zzso The decomposition of the original zzso into its five constituent zzso helps better identification of the zzso system of zzso zzso This leads to better zzso of the database into three groups: Healthy subjects, zzso subjects during a zzso zzso zzso and zzso subjects during a seizure course zzso The proposed zzso is applied to an zzso zzso zzso provided by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso Center, University of Bonn, Bonn, zzso Combination of zzso measures of the original signal and its zzso results in an overall accuracy of zzso that indicates high accuracy of the proposed zzso
