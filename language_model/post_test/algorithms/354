zzso prediction of survival rates of cancer patients is often key to zzso patients for prognosis and zzso Survival prediction is often accomplished by the zzso system that involves only three factors: tumor extent, zzso zzso involvement, and zzso This prediction from the zzso has been zzso because other potential zzso factors are not used in the zzso Based on availability of large cancer zzso it is possible to establish powerful prediction systems by using machine learning procedures and statistical zzso In this paper, we present an ensemble zzso approach to develop zzso systems of cancer zzso Our method starts with grouping combinations that are formed using levels of factors recorded in the zzso The zzso measure between combinations is obtained through a sequence of data partitions produced by multiple use of zzso zzso This zzso measure is then used with a zzso zzso method in order to find clusters of zzso zzso of survival is made simply by using the survival function derived from each zzso Our approach admits multiple factors and provides a practical and useful tool in outcome prediction of cancer zzso A demonstration of use of the proposed method is given for lung cancer zzso
