We have extended a previously implemented zzso for using optimal control theory within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The new zzso allows the use of arbitrary zzso operators for generating the optimal laser zzso A zzso that does not require saving the zzso wave function has been developed, where simultaneous forward and backward zzso are zzso zzso parameters are concentrated in a single input file analogous to the input files used elsewhere in zzso We use here two simple examples to demonstrate the use of zzso the modified zzso potential and a two-dimensional model of zzso For both systems, a controlled transition between two zzso states is zzso zzso obtained with zzso and exact calculations are zzso
