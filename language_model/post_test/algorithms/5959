zzso are capable of recognizing objects, often despite highly adverse viewing conditions zzso zzso The term zzso zzso has been used to refer to the neural processes responsible for zzso missing information in the visual image under such zzso zzso phenomena have been linked to a group of object recognition areas, the so-called zzso complex zzso Here, we investigated the zzso dynamics of zzso closure processes by zzso data from zzso electrical recordings zzso and functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso while subjects participated in a zzso closure zzso zzso were presented with highly fragmented images and control scrambled zzso zzso images were zzso to be zzso recognizable as objects zzso is, zzso closure was zzso whereas the scrambled images were zzso zzso of responses to these two stimulus classes revealed the neural processes underlying zzso zzso zzso revealed an object recognition system that mediates these closure zzso the core of which consists of the zzso zzso zzso recordings resulted in the zzso zzso component (for zzso associated with zzso a robust relative zzso over bilateral zzso scalp that occurs in the zzso zzso zzso Our investigations further revealed an extended network of zzso and frontal regions, also involved in zzso closure zzso zzso source analysis showed that the major generators of zzso localized to the identical regions within zzso revealed by the zzso recordings and detailed the zzso dynamics across these zzso regions including interactions between zzso and these other zzso of the object recognition zzso
