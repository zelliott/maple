We investigate two approaches to improving the resolution of zzso based zzso imaging zzso First, we show that a substantial improvement in the reconstruction of zzso zzso fields is achieved by increasing the system's zzso zzso via a zzso technique adapted from ultrasound zzso Second, a zzso reconstruction zzso is developed as an alternative to zzso zzso imaging and its performance is demonstrated for cases with and without a zzso
