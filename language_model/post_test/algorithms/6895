This article presents a method for zzso zzso mapping in zzso species for a zzso family derived by crossing two zzso For each zzso the marker information on each zzso is used to identify possible zzso of zzso inherited from the two parents and the locations of crossovers on these zzso A branch and bound zzso is used to identify zzso with the minimum number of zzso From these zzso the conditional probability of each possible zzso zzso for a series of positions along the zzso can be zzso An zzso weighted zzso is then used to relate the trait values to the zzso zzso zzso A simulation study is performed to assess this approach and to investigate the effects of the proportion of zzso to dominant zzso the zzso and the population zzso We conclude that the method successfully locates zzso and estimates their parameters accurately, and we discuss different modes of action of the zzso that may be zzso
