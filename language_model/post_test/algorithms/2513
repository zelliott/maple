By increasing the usage of radiation in all aspects of lives, the human body is becoming more exposed to zzso zzso The purpose of this study is to find the optimal radiation shielding materials to protect humans from the radiation hazards of zzso Some elements and compounds such as zzso zzso zzso W, zzso were chosen on the basis of their zzso zzso and other characteristics to produce zzso radiation shielding zzso zzso zzso sorting genetic zzso was used to zzso the weight fraction of the elements in compounds based on the dose equivalent rate, shield weight and zzso zzso sets of suitable compounds were obtained depending on various applications for energy zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso lead free compounds were zzso The results presented in a series of zzso should enable radiation shield designers to choose an appropriate combination according to their zzso
