To assess the similarities and differences in predicted high-risk individuals identified by different cardiovascular risk calculation zzso Research design and zzso A representative population of zzso individuals was zzso in a computer using baseline data from the National Health zzso for zzso The effects of biological groups identified by each calculator depend on the variation in each major model parameters were then applied to each hypothetical zzso The zzso capacities of 3 different risk identification systems based on computer calculation (the zzso zzso or on tabular methods (the Sheffield tables and the General Rule to zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

All three models predict that similar numbers would receive treatment with zzso and zzso receiving treatment at 30 and zzso 10 year risk zzso zzso However, zzso is limited as zzso or zzso are positive on all three zzso zzso or zzso on any two calculators at the 30 and zzso zzso zzso The risk baseline assumptions in each zzso 

Care needs to be taken with applying risk calculators to populations different from which they were zzso Any cardiovascular risk scoring system needs to be thoroughly evaluated against zzso data before it is introduced and also needs to be updated in line with changing trends in risk zzso
