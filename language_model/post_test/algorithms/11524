For the past two decades, an important paradigm in protein chemistry has been the assertion that a biologically active protein is at zzso equilibrium and therefore adopts its minimum free energy zzso Although some evidence now suggests that not all proteins conform to this notion, it is true often enough to remain an important guiding principle in structure determination, whether by direct zzso or by the zzso assisted approaches of zzso and zzso Among the difficulties in predicting structure from sequence are the lack of a useful potential function incorporating the influence of zzso and the inability to sample the phase space efficiently or even to determine whether a free energy minimum is, in fact, the global zzso These problems are zzso Although they are greatly zzso by experimental information, they become increasingly severe as empirical constraints are zzso We review the difficulties involved in the general problem of protein structure prediction and discuss the impact of increased computer power in the context of new approaches to zzso and parallel zzso zzso A general focus of our discussion is the need to understand the theoretical basis for effective theories and to accommodate in zzso methods the interplay of different zzso and spatial zzso
