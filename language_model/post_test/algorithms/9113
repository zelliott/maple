The zzso network zzso is a knowledge representation form, which has been proven to be valuable in the gene regulatory network reconstruction because of its capability of capturing zzso relationships between zzso Learning zzso structures from a database is a zzso zzso time zzso problem that remains one of the most exciting challenges in machine zzso Several zzso searching techniques have been used to find better network zzso Among these zzso the classical zzso zzso is the most zzso Nonetheless, the performance of the zzso zzso is greatly affected by a prior ordering of input zzso The proposed method in this paper is based on the chaotic particle swarm zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Because the zzso zzso completely zzso the local minimum in later zzso we combined the zzso zzso with the chaos theory, which has the properties of zzso zzso and zzso Experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the convergence rate of particles and identify networks more efficiently and zzso
