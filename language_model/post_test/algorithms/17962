zzso DNA display is a simple separation method that provides a fast and economical way of visualizing zzso and comparing zzso The DNA fragments are separated first according to their size by standard gel zzso and then according to their sequence composition using zzso zzso gel zzso First developed by Fischer and zzso zzso 1979, 16, zzso this method has recently been used to distinguish strains within a bacterial zzso The zzso restriction fragments are displayed as spots on a zzso zzso Although most of the relevant physical mechanisms are zzso this technique is mostly empirical and remains essentially zzso In view of zzso this zzso we combine our understanding of the different physical mechanisms at play to develop a complete zzso model to predict the relative coordinates of the spots as a function of the corresponding DNA sequence and of the experimental zzso We zzso validate our model by predicting the outcome of a zzso display of the zzso zzso zzso It thus becomes possible to zzso in zzso the experimental zzso to predict whether specific zzso as well as yet zzso genetic zzso can be zzso and to assist in interpreting the experimental zzso
