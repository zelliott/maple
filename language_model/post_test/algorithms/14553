To eliminate zzso channel distortion in chaotic communication systems, a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso based on a zzso zzso neural network zzso is proposed, using a modified real-time zzso learning zzso zzso Furthermore, an zzso zzso zzso zzso is adopted to overcome the deteriorating effect introduced by the zzso zzso Computer simulations illustrate that the proposed zzso zzso the zzso zzso neural network zzso and zzso neural network zzso zzso
