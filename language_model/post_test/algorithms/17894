The successful design and application of the ordered weighted averaging zzso method as a decision-making tool depend on the efficient zzso of its order zzso The most popular methods for determining the order weights are the fuzzy linguistic zzso approach and the minimal zzso method, which give different behavior patterns for the zzso These two methods will be first analyzed in detail by using sensitivity analysis on the zzso of the zzso with respect to the optimism degree of the decision maker, and then the two methods will be zzso The fuzzy linguistic zzso approach gives more information about the behavior of the zzso zzso in comparison to the minimal zzso zzso However, in using the minimal zzso method, the zzso has a linear behavior with respect to the optimism degree, and, therefore, it has better zzso zzso Since maximizing the combined goodness measure and minimizing its sensitivity to optimism degree are conflicting zzso a new composite measure of goodness will be defined to have more reliability in obtaining optimal zzso The theoretical results will be illustrated in a water resources management zzso
