zzso alignment is one of the most important zzso tools for modern molecular zzso The statistical characterization of gapped alignment scores has been a long-standing problem in sequence alignment zzso Using a zzso of the directed path in random media model, we investigate the score statistics of global sequence alignment taking into account, in particular, the compositional bias of the sequences zzso Such statistics are used to distinguish accidental similarity due to compositional similarity from biologically significant zzso To accommodate the compositional bias, we introduce an extra zzso p indicating the probability for positive matching scores to zzso When p is small, a high scoring alignment obviously cannot come from compositional zzso When p is large, the highest scoring point within a global alignment tends to be close to the end of both zzso in which case we say the system zzso By applying zzso zzso theory on percolating probability functions of various sizes zzso zzso the critical p at infinite size is zzso For alignment of length zzso the fact that the score fluctuation grows as zzso is confirmed upon investigating the zzso form of the alignment zzso Using the zzso statistics test, we show that the random variable , if properly zzso follows the zzso zzso zzso zzso ensemble for p slightly larger than zzso and zzso zzso ensemble for larger zzso Although these results deepen our understanding of the distribution of alignment scores, the use of these results in practical applications remains somewhat zzso and needs to be further zzso Nevertheless, the possibility of characterizing score statistics for modest system size zzso zzso via proper zzso of alignment scores, is zzso
