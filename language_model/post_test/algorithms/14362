In this paper, we present a zzso framework for both generating zzso large deformation transformations between two zzso image sets of the brain and for forming zzso brain zzso In this zzso the estimated transformations are generated using zzso information about the underlying zzso present in each of the different zzso This zzso independent registration framework is achieved by jointly zzso the zzso probabilities associated with the zzso image sets and the zzso registration transformations mapping these zzso To zzso use the information present in all the zzso for zzso zzso divergence between the estimated zzso is zzso Registration results for image sets composed of zzso MR images of healthy adult human brains are zzso zzso formation results are presented for a population of five infant human zzso
