In this paper, we present a zzso zzso for zzso heartbeat zzso based on a previously developed automatic zzso and a zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso include features from the zzso zzso series and zzso zzso calculated from the zzso zzso zzso the decisions of both zzso the presented zzso can work either automatically or with several degrees of zzso The zzso was zzso evaluated in several zzso databases for comparison zzso Even in the fully automatic mode, the zzso slightly improved the performance figures of the original automatic zzso just with less than two manually zzso zzso zzso per recording, the zzso obtained a mean improvement for all databases of zzso in accuracy A, of zzso in global sensitivity S and of zzso in global positive zzso value zzso An assistance of just 12 zzso per recording resulted in a mean improvement of zzso in A, of zzso in zzso and of zzso in zzso For the assisted mode, the zzso outperformed other state-of-the-art zzso with less expert zzso zzso The results presented in this paper represent an improvement in the field of automatic and zzso zzso zzso concluding that the performance of an automatic zzso can be improved with an efficient handling of the expert zzso
