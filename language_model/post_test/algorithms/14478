We consider the problem of zzso and temporally registering multiple video sequences of zzso scenes which contain, but are not limited to, zzso objects such as fireworks, flags fluttering in the wind, zzso taken from different vantage zzso This problem is extremely challenging due to the presence of complex variations in the appearance of such dynamic zzso In this paper, we propose a simple zzso for matching such complex zzso Our zzso does not require the cameras to be zzso and is not based on frame-by-frame or zzso zzso Instead, we model each video as the output of a linear zzso system and transform the task of registering the video sequences to that of registering the parameters of the corresponding zzso zzso As these parameters are not uniquely zzso one cannot directly compare them to perform zzso We resolve these ambiguities by jointly identifying the parameters from multiple video zzso and converting the identified parameters to a zzso zzso This reduces the video registration problem to a multiple image registration problem, which can be efficiently solved using existing image matching zzso We test our zzso on a wide variety of challenging video sequences and show that it matches the performance of significantly more zzso expensive existing zzso
