zzso zzso zzso is a frequent and costly health care problem representing the most common zzso resulting in hospital zzso Total mortality and cardiovascular mortality are significantly increased in patients with zzso compared to zzso In addition to symptoms of zzso patients with zzso have an increased risk of stroke and may also develop decreased exercise tolerance and left zzso zzso All of these problems may be reversed with restoration and maintenance of zzso zzso External electrical zzso has been a remarkably effective and safe method for termination of this zzso Originally described by zzso et zzso in 1963, it has been a well accepted mode of acute zzso However, this technique requires general zzso or heavy zzso Internal zzso zzso has been evaluated as an alternative approach to the external technique for over 2 zzso Recent studies have shown that low-energy internal zzso zzso using zzso shocks is an effective and safe means in restoring zzso rhythm in patients with zzso and should be considered especially in patients in whom external zzso attempts have zzso zzso zzso zzso Recently, a stand alone zzso the Metrix System zzso zzso and zzso has entered clinical zzso zzso zzso is accomplished by a shock delivered between zzso in the right atrium and the coronary zzso The right atrium lead has an active fixation in the right zzso The coronary zzso lead has a natural spiral zzso for retention in the coronary zzso and can be zzso with a zzso Both leads are 7 French in diameter and the zzso coils are each 6 zzso in zzso The zzso may be placed using separate zzso or very soon by using a single bipolar zzso A separate bipolar right zzso lead is used for R wave synchronization and post shock zzso The Metrix zzso can be used to induce zzso by using R wave zzso shocks and can store zzso zzso zzso for up to 2 minutes from the most recent 6 zzso zzso The device can be programmed into one of the following operating modes: fully zzso patient zzso monitor mode, zzso pacing only, and zzso As zzso is not zzso in the automatic mode the device is only zzso active in detecting and treating zzso and this zzso zzso cycle zzso is zzso The device employs extensive processing both for detection and R wave zzso In April 1996, the phase I Metrix zzso clinical trial was zzso As of May 1997, a total of 51 Metrix systems had been implanted as part of the phase I zzso clinical zzso zzso data suggest that both zzso thresholds and zzso are stable over time zzso to 3 zzso zzso accuracy has been excellent zzso zzso zzso zzso and there have been no errors of R wave selection for zzso No zzso have resulted from over zzso shocks zzso The device is effective in zzso converting zzso of the spontaneous episodes of zzso In zzso of episodes several shocks were required because of early recurrence of zzso In 5 patients, the zzso zzso was zzso 2 infections, 1 cardiac zzso 1 permanent loss of zzso 1 patient required zzso zzso because of frequent episodes of drug zzso zzso with rapid zzso zzso zzso clinical experience under controlled conditions with the Metrix system suggests that the zzso zzso zzso may offer a therapeutic alternative for a zzso of patients with drug zzso zzso long zzso and zzso episodes of zzso Further efforts must be undertaken to reduce the patient discomfort associated with internal zzso zzso in an attempt to make this new therapy acceptable to a larger patient population with zzso zzso zzso
