The Edinburgh Mouse zzso and Gene zzso Database project has developed a digital zzso of mouse development to provide a zzso framework for zzso mapped data such as in zzso gene expression and cell zzso As part of this database, a mouse zzso anatomy zzso has been zzso A zzso of this anatomy is required to document its precise zzso and how it is used in the context of the Mouse zzso 

The paper describes the existing anatomy zzso and zzso aspects of it using a zzso logic based zzso It therefore provides a guide for users of the current version of the zzso as well as the basis for a description of the anatomy using an zzso language, such as zzso thus enabling future work on reasoning about the Mouse zzso in the context of an intelligent gene expression zzso zzso zzso The logic has been implemented in a zzso zzso 

The Mouse zzso is available zzso at zzso
