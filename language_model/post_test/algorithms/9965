zzso discovery that word frequency zzso obey a power law established parallels between biological and physical zzso and language, laying the groundwork for a complex systems perspective on human zzso More recent research has also identified zzso zzso in the dynamics underlying the successive zzso of events, suggesting the possibility of similar findings for language as zzso 

By considering frequent words in zzso discussion groups and in disparate databases where the language has different levels of zzso here we show that the zzso of distances between successive zzso of the same word display zzso zzso from a zzso process and are well characterized by a stretched exponential zzso zzso The extent of this zzso depends strongly on semantic type -- a measure of the zzso of each word -- and less strongly on zzso We develop a zzso model of this behavior that fully determines the dynamics of word zzso 

zzso patterns of words are well described by a stretched exponential distribution of recurrence times, an empirical zzso that cannot be anticipated from zzso zzso Because the use of words provides a uniquely precise and powerful lens on human thought and activity, our findings also have implications for other overt manifestations of collective human zzso
