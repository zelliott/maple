A necessary initial step for the application of small angle X-ray scattering zzso as an zzso probe for structural investigations of membrane proteins in solution is the precise knowledge of the structure of spontaneously formed zzso zzso around the zzso Following our recent article zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2012, 134, zzso on the study of the zzso zzso zzso zzso surrounding zzso zzso in solution, we aimed at the development of more elaborate models, exploiting the information content of the scattering zzso Two additional approaches are developed here for the fit of zzso experimental data, one based on a generalized zzso zzso zzso for the construction of a zzso representation of the zzso zzso and a second based on zzso molecular zzso zzso we are able to fit the zzso experimental data and obtain a better insight concerning the structure of the zzso zzso around the zzso part of the zzso zzso The present analysis scheme represents an additional step toward future zzso studies of zzso proteins in zzso
