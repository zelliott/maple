The objective of this study is to assess the performance of existing zzso time zzso zzso for zzso data collected in the zzso environment using a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso in older zzso 

zzso adults age 76 to 96 zzso wore wrist zzso for approximately 24 h per day and waist zzso during waking for approximately 7 d of free zzso Wear and zzso times were classified by existing zzso zzso zzso and zzso and compared with wear and zzso times identified by data plots and diary zzso With the use of bias and probability of correct zzso the performance of the zzso two time windows zzso and 90 zzso and zzso magnitude zzso versus vertical axis zzso counts from a zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso classified zzso time intervals more accurately from zzso than V zzso The use of the zzso time window improved zzso zzso accuracy when compared with the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso performed better than the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso performed better than the zzso for zzso time zzso using the data collected by both zzso 

zzso zzso zzso can be used for an accurate zzso time zzso in zzso older zzso The use of the zzso window and the zzso counts improves the performance of commonly used zzso for zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso
