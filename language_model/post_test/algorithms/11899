Disorders of zzso zzso zzso zzso are now recognized as major causes of human zzso diseases and several zzso of zzso and nuclear genes zzso respiratory chain components have been zzso Interestingly, zzso of nuclear genes involved in zzso respiratory chain zzso protein trafficking, and iron metabolism are also known to alter zzso zzso While several hundred of these genes have been described in zzso only a few nuclear genes have been zzso identified in zzso zzso gene databases present therefore an invaluable tool for identification of human zzso that should be regarded as candidate genes in zzso zzso In an attempt to identify the human counterparts of zzso zzso we developed a systematic comparison of zzso protein sequences to the zzso zzso zzso Starting from 340 zzso protein sequences as templates, we searched the human zzso counterparts using the zzso similarity searching program and identified 102 groups of human zzso likely to represent zzso of zzso genes because of significant zzso This collection of human genes possibly related to zzso zzso may help identify nuclear genes responsible of zzso zzso
