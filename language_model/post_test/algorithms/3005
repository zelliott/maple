The analysis of individual cell fates within a population of stem and zzso cells is still a major experimental challenge in stem cell zzso However, new monitoring techniques, such as high-resolution zzso video zzso facilitate tracking and quantitative analysis of single cells and their zzso Information on cellular development, divisional history and differentiation are naturally comprised into a zzso structure, zzso as cellular zzso To extract reliable information concerning zzso variables and control mechanisms underlying cell fate decisions, it is necessary to zzso a large number of cellular zzso 

Here, we propose a set of statistical measures that are specifically tailored for the analysis of cellular zzso These measures address the degree and symmetry of cellular expansion, as well as occurrence and correlation of characteristic events such as cell zzso Furthermore, we discuss two different methods for reconstruction of lineage fate decisions and show their impact on the interpretation of zzso zzso In order to illustrate these techniques, and to circumvent the present shortage of available experimental data, we obtain cellular zzso from a zzso mathematical model of zzso stem cell zzso 

Based on statistical analysis of cellular zzso we conclude that effects of external zzso such as growth conditions, are imprinted in their zzso Moreover, we demonstrate that it is essential to zzso timing of cell zzso changes and of occurrence of cell death events in the divisional context in order to understand the mechanisms of lineage zzso
