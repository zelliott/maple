In this chapter, we describe an zzso for the design of zzso libraries required in zzso drug zzso This zzso addresses simultaneously the two key criteria of diversity and zzso of compounds in the resulting library and is zzso efficient when applied to a large class of zzso design zzso At the same time, additional constraints on experimental resources are also incorporated in the framework presented in this zzso A zzso efficient zzso zzso is developed, where the ability of the deterministic zzso zzso to identify clusters is exploited to zzso zzso over the entire zzso to zzso over individual zzso An analysis of this zzso zzso the zzso between the error due to zzso and zzso zzso zzso applied on test zzso corroborate the analysis and show improvement by factors as large as ten or more depending on the zzso
