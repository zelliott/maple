Since Global zzso Satellite Systems zzso show zzso performance in dense urban and indoor areas, a positioning sensor based on Digital Video zzso zzso systems is presented in this zzso zzso signals can be considered as zzso for zzso due to their good zzso One of the challenges to overcome is to distinguish the signals from different zzso Here, we suppose that the user can first zzso his position by zzso during an zzso phase, which is used for solving all the ambiguities concerning zzso zzso Starting from there, zzso signals can be used for aiding positioning when the user enters a zzso area, up to a limit case, where all the zzso satellites are not in view and only zzso signals are used for zzso We tested this method by zzso by adopting the zzso model for the zzso zzso and the zzso model for zzso The obtained results show good performance if the receiver correctly associates the signal to the user's zzso
