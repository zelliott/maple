zzso tests are popular components of zzso screens but no single scoring system has been universally zzso We sought to identify an optimal subset of clock errors for zzso screening and compare them with three other systems representative of the existing wide variations in approach zzso Mendez, zzso as well as with the zzso system used in the zzso which combines clock drawing with delayed zzso 

The clock drawings of an zzso and educationally diverse sample (N zzso zzso were analyzed for the association of 24 different errors with the presence and severity of zzso defined by independent research zzso The final sample included 364 subjects with zzso or zzso 5 years of education, as preliminary examination suggested different error patterns in subjects with zzso years of education and inadequate numbers of normal controls for reliable zzso 

Eleven of 24 errors were significantly associated with zzso in subjects with zzso or zzso 5 years of education, and six were combined to identify zzso with zzso specificity and zzso zzso inaccurate time setting, no hands, missing numbers, number zzso or zzso or refusal to attempt clock zzso Time setting was the most prevalent error at all zzso zzso refusal occurred only in moderate and severe zzso and ethnicity and language of administration had no zzso All critical errors increased in frequency with zzso zzso This simplified scoring system had much better specificity than two other systems zzso vs zzso for zzso system - zzso for zzso and much better sensitivity than zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso found the simplified system to be more strongly zzso of zzso than the three other zzso systems of zzso Substituting the new zzso zzso for that used in the original zzso zzso improved the zzso specificity from 89 to zzso with minimal change in zzso 

Only six errors need be assessed to capture most of the power of clock drawing to discriminate between people with zzso and normal subjects, and improves specificity over older systems in subjects with zzso or zzso 5 years of zzso These errors require minimal conceptual zzso and are easily detected and scored by zzso
