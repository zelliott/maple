zzso measurement is a challenge for a variety of remote sensing systems such as zzso and radar zzso However, current zzso techniques require a comparatively long data acquisition zzso It has been suggested to use coded signals, such as linear zzso signals zzso for zzso zzso zzso by zzso the needed information from a set of several sequential coded zzso In this study, a method for zzso zzso using a single linear zzso zzso transmission is presented and implemented for zzso zzso The complex zzso function between the transmitted and reflected signals is initially zzso The zzso is then calculated from the phase of the peak of the envelope of this zzso zzso The suggested method was verified using computer simulations and experimental zzso in an zzso zzso zzso linear zzso to the data has yielded very good correlation zzso zzso zzso With the suggested technique, higher frame rates of zzso mapping can be potentially achieved relative to current zzso Also, the same data can be zzso for both zzso mapping and image zzso
