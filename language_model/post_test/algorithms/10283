When analyzing computer simulations of zzso of lipids and water, the questions to be answered are often of a zzso zzso They can deal with global properties, like the kind of phase that is adopted or the presence or absence of certain key features like a pore or zzso or with local properties, like the local zzso present at a particular part of the zzso zzso While in principle all of the information relating to the global and local zzso properties of a system can be obtained from the set of atomic coordinates generated by a computer zzso the extraction of this information is a tedious task that usually involves using a zzso program and performing the analysis by zzso Here we present a tool that employs the technique of zzso image analysis zzso to automatically extract the global zzso given by zzso zzso a set of atomic zzso and creates an image of the system onto which the local zzso are mapped as a color zzso
