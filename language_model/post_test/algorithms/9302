This paper presents a practical and effective approach to the zzso of zzso spatial linkages for zzso zzso A zzso mechanical linkage with zzso zzso is designed and in-house manufactured for this zzso In order to assess the zzso of the proposed zzso technique and to distinguish between geometrical and electrical parameters zzso zzso optical zzso are used and zzso is addressed from a zzso point of view zzso The proposed technique is based on a zzso method, in which the end segments of the linkage are connected to each other by zzso zzso A zzso model of the system is formulated using a standard zzso transformation zzso zzso Continuous data collection is carried out and a zzso identification of zzso parameters is implemented by the use of an extended Kalman filter zzso zzso shows that the proposed technique, zzso its zzso is effective in improving the accuracy of the system up to its theoretically zzso resolution, which limits the performance of the real zzso
