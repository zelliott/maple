While zzso is usually an zzso operation, there are circumstances in which we believe (with varying degrees of zzso that items A and B should be assigned to the same zzso while items A and C should zzso We would like such zzso relations to influence cluster assignments of zzso data in a manner consistent with the prior knowledge expressed in the training zzso Our starting point is zzso zzso based on zzso mixture models zzso of the data zzso We express zzso preferences in a prior distribution over assignments of data points to zzso This prior penalizes cluster assignments according to the degree with which they violate the zzso The model parameters are fit with the zzso zzso zzso Our model provides a flexible framework that encompasses several other zzso zzso models as its special zzso zzso on artificial and real-world problems show that our model can consistently improve zzso results when zzso relations are zzso The experiments also demonstrate the superiority of our model to other zzso zzso methods on handling noisy zzso zzso
