zzso zzso Analysis zzso is a well-known technique for finding the correlations between two sets of zzso zzso It projects both sets of variables onto a zzso space in which they are zzso zzso zzso is commonly applied for supervised zzso reduction in which the two sets of variables are derived from the data and the class labels, zzso It is well-known that zzso can be formulated as a zzso problem in the zzso class zzso However, the extension to the more general setting remains zzso In this paper, we show that under a mild condition which tends to hold for zzso data, zzso in the zzso case can be formulated as a zzso zzso Based on this zzso relationship, efficient zzso for solving zzso problems can be applied to scale zzso to very large data zzso In addition, we propose several zzso zzso including the sparse zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso We further extend the zzso zzso to partial least zzso In addition, we show that the zzso projection for one set of variables is independent of the zzso on the other set of zzso zzso providing new insights on the effect of zzso on zzso We have conducted experiments using benchmark data zzso zzso on zzso data sets confirm the established zzso zzso zzso also demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed zzso zzso
