Manual tracking of zzso targets, with and without feedback zzso as well as discrete prediction of chaotic maps have each been demonstrated by zzso zzso tracking of chaotic targets, on the other hand, has not been well zzso To this end, 10 participants were asked to track a chaotically moving target presented on a computer display by means of controlling a similar zzso object using a pressure sensitive tablet and hand-held zzso The participants were given delayed visual feedback of their own zzso Task success subsequently required anticipation on the part of the zzso Using 6 values of delay from 20 zzso to 1 zzso evidence shows that zzso participants are able to zzso with a chaotic target, even with some amount of applied zzso zzso task performance varies systematically with applied zzso and zzso this same systematic dependence is predicted for systems exhibiting anticipating zzso
