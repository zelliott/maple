It necessary to use highly accurate and zzso systems for viral and zzso zzso zzso The zzso systems for zzso in virus and zzso zzso suffer from some basic zzso This paper puts forward an alternative approach for viral and zzso zzso to improve the quality of zzso particularly for newly zzso zzso 

The new system zzso has been run for zzso viral and 212 zzso zzso respectively, and satisfactory results are zzso To have a fair comparison with the currently available software of similar function, zzso a total of 30 viral zzso that have not been zzso by zzso are selected to be zzso zzso the average specificity of both systems is well zzso however the average sensitivity of zzso for smaller viral zzso zzso 100 zzso which constitute the main parts of viral zzso zzso so far, is higher than that of zzso Additionally, for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso probably with the lowest zzso zzso content among the zzso organisms, the accuracy of zzso is much better than that of zzso because the later predicts hundreds of zzso zzso zzso is also used to analyze well-studied zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso the performance of zzso is generally better than that of zzso Finally, zzso may be downloaded and run locally, particularly zzso its zzso whereas zzso is not zzso Based on the above comparison, it is suggested that zzso may serve as a preferred zzso tool for viral and zzso zzso newly zzso However, it is also shown that the joint application of both systems, zzso and zzso leads to better zzso zzso The system zzso is freely available at: zzso 

zzso may serve as a preferred zzso tool used for viral and zzso zzso especially for anonymous viral and zzso zzso newly zzso
