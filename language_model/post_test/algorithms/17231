Color separation is an essential step of the data processing in the zzso zzso detection strategy used in automated DNA zzso In this paper, we propose a model to describe the zzso phenomenon, and show how the assumptions of the model are supported by experimental zzso The zzso zzso is estimated via a zzso based on a mapping between the distribution of zzso zzso and that of dye zzso An zzso zzso is designed to implement the zzso To evaluate the zzso quality of a zzso zzso we propose a quantitative measure based on the distribution of the zzso zzso We illustrate this method by applying it to a sequencing trace of slab gel zzso obtained at the Human Genome Center at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and that of zzso zzso provided by the Department of zzso at zzso zzso The accuracy of this method is also assessed by the zzso zzso
