CT and PET are widely used to characterize solitary pulmonary zzso zzso However, most CT accuracy studies have been performed with outdated technology and methods, and previous PET studies have been limited by small sample sizes and incomplete zzso Our objective was to compare CT and PET accuracy in veterans with zzso 

Between January 1999 and June 2001, we recruited zzso participants with zzso newly diagnosed on zzso and zzso The zzso were zzso zzso All patients underwent zzso PET and zzso A masked panel of 3 PET and 3 CT experts rated the studies on a zzso zzso zzso tissue diagnosis or zzso follow-up established the final zzso 

A definitive diagnosis was established for 344 zzso The prevalence of zzso was zzso The average size was 16 zzso zzso ratios zzso for PET and CT results for combined ratings of either definitely benign zzso and zzso of patients, zzso or probably benign zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso for PET and CT results for combined ratings of indeterminate zzso and zzso probably zzso zzso and zzso or definitely zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso for PET and zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso for CT zzso zzso zzso for the zzso PET zzso and zzso reliability was superior to zzso 

Definitely and probably benign results on PET and CT strongly predict benign zzso However, such results were 3 times more common with zzso Definitely zzso results on PET were much more zzso of zzso than were these results on zzso A zzso final diagnosis was approximately 10 times more likely than a benign final diagnosis in participants with PET results rated definitely zzso
