Analysis of zzso evolving via zzso events leads to a zzso problem of sorting by zzso which has been studied recently to evaluate the evolutionary relationship in distance between two biological species since zzso can be considered as a zzso of zzso However, for zzso consisting of multiple zzso their evolutionary history should also include events of zzso zzso and zzso where fusion zzso two zzso into one and zzso splits a zzso into zzso 

In this paper, we study the problem of zzso zzso between two zzso of circular and multiple zzso by considering fusion, zzso and zzso events zzso By use of zzso groups in algebra, we propose an O zzso time zzso to efficiently zzso and obtain a minimum series of zzso zzso and zzso required to transform one circular zzso zzso into another, where zzso is the number of genes shared by the two studied zzso In addition, we have implemented this zzso as a web server, called zzso and have also applied it to analyzing by gene orders the whole zzso of three human zzso zzso each with multiple and circular zzso to zzso their evolutionary zzso zzso our experimental results coincide well with our previous results obtained using the zzso comparisons by landmark orders between any two zzso zzso sequences as well as using the traditional comparative analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso is a useful tool for the zzso analysis of circular and multiple zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso
