Complex zzso zzso zzso are continuous zzso zzso of very short cycle length zzso representing zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso may result in zzso zzso zzso and zzso but identifying them can be zzso 

The purpose of this study was to zzso assess zzso whether an automated zzso can identify zzso regions, zzso the acute effects of zzso these regions on zzso and zzso the long-term efficacy as an zzso strategy to pulmonary vein zzso isolation zzso 

Thirty-five patients (three centers, 61 zzso 9 years, left atrium zzso 43 zzso 9 zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso zzso with symptomatic zzso zzso zzso zzso or persistent zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso A zzso lasso zzso zzso was used for zzso A three-dimensional shell of the LA and pulmonary veins zzso was zzso If not already in zzso zzso was induced by burst pacing (with or without zzso zzso zzso during zzso were zzso using an automated zzso zzso The zzso measures the time between discrete zzso in a local zzso over 5 seconds (based on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso of the local zzso is projected onto the LA shell as a color-coded zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso (published zzso were targeted for zzso zzso zzso cycle length zzso and zzso were measured from the zzso After zzso zzso further zzso was done to achieve complete zzso 

zzso was spontaneous zzso zzso zzso or induced zzso zzso zzso in all zzso zzso were most commonly found along the zzso zzso anterior LA zzso zzso zzso zzso base of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso alone prolonged the zzso zzso zzso 27 zzso 304 zzso 41 zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso flutter zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso terminated zzso in 19 patients zzso other 16 were zzso zzso became zzso in zzso zzso zzso alone did not cause zzso isolation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After combined zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso success rate was zzso zzso 13 zzso 4 zzso versus zzso in matched controls who had zzso alone zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso guided by an automated zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso and zzso in most zzso zzso terminated in zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso has a high efficacy and may be superior to zzso zzso
