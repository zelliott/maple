This paper aims to predict and control the probability of firing of a zzso in response to zzso electrical stimulation of the type delivered by neural zzso such as the cochlear zzso zzso eye or in deep brain zzso Using the cochlear implant as a model, we developed an efficient zzso model that predicts the responses of auditory nerve fibers to electrical stimulation and evaluated the zzso accuracy by comparing the model output with pooled responses from a group of guinea pig auditory nerve zzso It was found that the model accurately predicted the changes in neural firing probability over time to constant and variable zzso electrical pulse trains, including zzso signals, delivered at rates up to zzso zzso zzso A simplified version of the model that did not incorporate adaptation was used to zzso zzso within its limitations, the zzso electrical stimulus required to cause a desired response from zzso up to 250 zzso zzso Future stimulation strategies for cochlear implants and other neural zzso may be enhanced using similar models that account for the way that neural responses are altered by previous zzso
