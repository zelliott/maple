In recent years, the use of zzso for source zzso has significantly improved the spatial accuracy of zzso In this paper, we examine techniques by which to zzso experimental design, and ensure that the application of zzso yields accurate zzso We show that variation in the experimental zzso or variation in the bandwidth of a signal of interest, can significantly affect the accuracy of a zzso reconstruction of source zzso Specifically, power will usually be underestimated if zzso windows are made too short, or zzso too zzso The accuracy of spatial zzso may also be zzso We conclude that for optimum zzso zzso should aim to collect as much data as possible, and use a bandwidth spanning the entire frequency distribution of the signal of zzso This zzso distortion to reconstructed source images, time courses and power zzso In the case where experimental duration is short, and small zzso windows are therefore used, we show that accurate power zzso can be achieved by zzso zzso However, large amounts of zzso cause a loss in the spatial resolution of the zzso zzso hence zzso should be used carefully, particularly if multiple sources in close proximity are zzso
