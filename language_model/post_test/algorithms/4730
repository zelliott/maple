To probe the zzso structure and domain organization of native zzso zzso protein 2 zzso the zzso human zzso zzso was zzso to zzso and characterized by zzso zzso CD, and zzso zzso The location of intrinsic disorder in the zzso sequence was predicted using the zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso in low and high salt and over a nearly zzso concentration zzso CD indicated that the zzso zzso was nearly zzso zzso under conditions where it could zzso recognize zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrate that zzso is composed of at least six structurally distinct zzso two of which zzso to the well characterized zzso DNA binding domain and zzso repression zzso These zzso collectively are organized into a zzso structure with zzso zzso properties, reflecting the extensive disorder in the zzso zzso When expressed as individual fragments, the zzso DNA binding domain and zzso repression domain both could function as zzso DNA binding zzso The unusual structural features of zzso provide a basis for understanding zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso These studies also establish an experimental paradigm for characterizing the zzso structures of other highly zzso zzso
