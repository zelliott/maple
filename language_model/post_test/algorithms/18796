To zzso evaluate the diagnostic performance of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis for zzso zzso zzso without visible fat from zzso cell zzso zzso at CT, by using zzso analysis and clinical diagnosis as the reference zzso 

This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board; informed consent was zzso The authors reviewed the medical records of 144 patients with zzso confirmation of zzso or zzso zzso men, 39 zzso mean age, 52 zzso Analysis of zzso CT zzso was performed on 34 zzso without visible fat at CT and 110 zzso zzso The percentages of zzso and zzso were compared in the two groups according to the CT number zzso The diagnostic performance of CT zzso analysis in zzso zzso from zzso was determined by using receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso 

The percentages of zzso and zzso with a CT number less than zzso zzso zzso and zzso vs zzso and zzso less than zzso zzso zzso and zzso vs zzso and zzso less than zzso zzso zzso and zzso vs zzso and zzso and less than 0 zzso zzso and zzso vs zzso and zzso were significantly greater in the zzso group than in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso The area under the zzso curve was as high as zzso when a zzso percentage with a CT number less than zzso zzso was used as a zzso zzso zzso to the specificity of zzso for zzso zzso from zzso the sensitivity was as high as zzso when a zzso percentage of zzso with a CT number less than zzso zzso was used as a zzso 

CT zzso analysis may be useful for zzso zzso without visible fat from zzso at zzso
