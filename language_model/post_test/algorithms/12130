Fisher linear zzso zzso has recently emerged as a more efficient approach for zzso features for many pattern zzso problems as compared to traditional principal component zzso However, the constraint on the total number of features available from zzso has seriously limited its application to a large class of zzso In order to overcome this zzso a zzso procedure of calculating the zzso features is suggested in this zzso The new zzso incorporates the same fundamental idea behind zzso of seeking the projection that best separates the data corresponding to different classes, while in contrast to zzso the number of features that may be derived is independent of the number of the classes to be zzso zzso experiments of comparing the new zzso with the traditional approaches have been carried out on face recognition problem with the Yale database, in which the resulting improvement of the performances by the new feature extraction scheme is zzso
