To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of an zzso in the prevention of zzso surface disease in zzso and unconscious patients in the intensive care unit zzso 

The eyes of all zzso and unconscious patients admitted to an zzso between September and December 1998 were managed according to an eye care zzso The applications of the preventive measures were assessed by a single observer twice zzso The lid position, the presence and degree of zzso sedation score, and the treatment received were documented at every zzso 

Thirty-four patients were recruited for management according to the eye care zzso over a period ranging from 1 to 28 zzso Four patients were excluded because of failure by staff to adhere to the zzso In 18 patients no active treatment was zzso Out of six patients who had zzso exposure and were given zzso zzso four maintained clear zzso No zzso or zzso zzso was noted in two of the four patients whose lids required closure with zzso tape for zzso zzso Use of lid taping and zzso prevented zzso abrasion in two patients who were prone zzso The prevalence of zzso surface abnormalities was zzso % where the zzso was properly followed zzso zzso 

The proposed eye care zzso appears to be effective in preventing zzso surface abnormalities in the zzso and unconscious patients in the zzso and efficient in that it may reduce the workload required for critically ill zzso
