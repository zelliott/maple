The zzso activity pattern of the monkey visual zzso was mapped zzso with zzso during the performance of a visually guided reaching zzso After zzso filtering of the reconstructed two-dimensional zzso maps of areas zzso and zzso alternating bands of high and low zzso activity were apparent in control and experimental zzso The spatial arrangement of active bands was studied with two-dimensional spectral analysis, and bands were found to be more organized in the experimental zzso In area zzso of the control monkey the spectral zzso was spread over a wider range of directions and zzso than in the experimental zzso The finding that layer IV is characterized by more complex zzso than layers I through III suggests the coexistence of more than one active zzso system in the zzso zzso In area zzso stripes running almost perpendicular to the zzso border were found along with superimposed patches of enhanced zzso zzso In the experimental zzso the corresponding zzso were extremely sharp yielding a constant zzso It is suggested that the well-organized zzso arrangement within areas zzso and V2 of the experimental zzso emerges from the zzso organized background network of activity patterns in the control zzso
