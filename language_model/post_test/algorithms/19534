We propose a novel zzso zzso energy to automatically extract objects of interest from zzso Previous zzso only incorporate local region zzso which are sensitive to incorrectly classified zzso during zzso We introduce a global likelihood potential to achieve better zzso of the foreground and background models and, thus, better extraction zzso zzso experiments demonstrate its zzso
