With the aim of detecting the attitude of a rotating carrier, the paper presents a novel, digital angular rate zzso The sensor consists of zzso elements zzso and zzso signal processing circuit and zzso zzso The sensor has the feature of detecting three angular rates of a rotating carrier at the same zzso The key techniques of the zzso including sensing construction, sensing principles, and signal processing circuit design are zzso The test results show that the sensor can sense rolling, pitch and zzso angular rate at the same time and the measurement error of zzso (or zzso angular rate and rolling rate of the rotating carrier is less than zzso
