Chemical zzso enhancers zzso are known to increase skin zzso to therapeutic zzso Single zzso however, offer limited enhancements of skin zzso zzso of chemicals can overcome this limitation zzso to their synergistic zzso However, identification of potent zzso of chemicals requires screening of a large number of zzso Discovery of zzso zzso can be significantly accelerated by identifying patterns that occur in the existing data on zzso In this study, we systematically mine through a huge database on skin zzso effect of over zzso zzso zzso generated by high zzso screening and extract general principles that govern the effect of zzso combinations of chemicals on zzso barrier zzso zzso and synergies of these zzso are analyzed to identify the role played by the zzso composition and zzso The analysis reveals several intuitive but some largely zzso zzso For example, zzso made from zzso zzso are most potent when participating zzso are present in nearly equal zzso zzso zzso a small zzso is particularly effective in forming potent and synergistic zzso zzso and zzso zzso are more likely to feature in potent zzso zzso but invaluable rules like these will provide guiding principles for designing libraries to further speed up the zzso discovery zzso
