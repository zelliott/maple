A large-scale molecular dynamics simulation of the behavior of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso environment has been zzso All atoms (including zzso of two protein molecules and the surrounding zzso of zzso consisting of both water and salt zzso were explicitly represented, and a relatively long range of interactions (up to 15 zzso were zzso The simulation is the longest so far reported for a protein in such an environment zzso zzso The use of the full zzso environment allows a direct comparison of the structure and dynamic properties of the protein and surrounding zzso to be made with the experimental X-ray zzso Here we report the comparison of the protein structures and analyze the zzso of the system, including interaction with the zzso zzso zzso papers will deal with other aspects of the zzso The overall root mean square differences between the zzso molecular dynamics structure and that from zzso for all zzso zzso zzso are zzso and zzso A for the two molecules taken as the zzso zzso An extensive analysis of the zzso of zzso elements and individual zzso and their zzso from experiment has revealed a strong influence of the zzso medium on their zzso zzso of the results for free energy calculations and for future directions are also zzso
