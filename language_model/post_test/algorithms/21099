We apply a mathematical zzso which processes discrete time series data to generate a complete list of zzso net structures containing the minimal number of zzso required to reproduce the data zzso The zzso of the list as guaranteed by a mathematical proof allows to define a minimal set of experiments required to discriminate between alternative network zzso This in principle allows to prove all possible minimal network structures by zzso all alternative candidate zzso The dynamic zzso of the networks in terms of a switching rule for the transitions of the zzso net is part of the zzso In addition to network zzso the zzso can be used to determine how many yet zzso components at least must be involved in a certain zzso The zzso also reveals all alternative structural modifications of a network that are required to generate a zzso zzso
