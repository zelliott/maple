Analysis of the shape of the zzso spikes that originate from the zzso of zzso molecules released during the fusion of individual zzso zzso provides valuable data about molecular steps involved in zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity of zzso permits the detection of the zzso released from individual zzso giving information about zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation, zzso zzso and about the release probability zzso availability and sensitivity of fusion machinery to zzso Furthermore, zzso resolution of zzso allows for the observation of the real-time zzso of zzso release during zzso Here, we provide zzso for computerized analysis of the zzso signal with emphasis on routines that zzso consistent determination of spike parameters on recordings with different sampling rates, zzso levels, spike zzso and surrounding zzso
