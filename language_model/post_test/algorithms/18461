The Root Zone Water Quality Model zzso is a zzso zzso model for simulating water movement and chemical transport under a variety of management and weather scenarios at the field zzso The zzso module of zzso includes detailed zzso that describe the complex interactions between pesticides and the zzso We have simulated a range of situations with zzso including zzso interception and zzso of a multiply applied zzso zzso to growing corn, and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso soil zzso to examine whether the model appears to generate reasonable zzso The model was also tested using zzso and zzso for the sensitivity of its predictions of chemical fate and water and zzso zzso to various input zzso The model appears to generate reasonable representations of the fate and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso or basic zzso processes that are becoming increasingly important for describing adequately the environmental behavior of newer zzso However, the kinetic zzso zzso for charged pesticides appear to be zzso Of the 29 parameters and variables zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso the fraction of kinetic zzso sites, air temperature, soil bulk density, zzso content at 33 zzso zzso head and zzso were most sensitive for predictions of zzso zzso in zzso The latter three zzso and the saturated zzso zzso of the soil and surface zzso were most sensitive for predictions of surface water zzso and zzso loss of zzso In addition, predictions of zzso (a weak zzso zzso and dynamics in soil were sensitive to the zzso equilibrium zzso constant, soil pH and its zzso zzso
