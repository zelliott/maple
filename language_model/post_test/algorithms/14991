We report on the development of an zzso image reconstruction scheme for optical zzso that is based on the equation of zzso zzso Unlike the commonly applied diffusion zzso the equation of zzso transfer accurately describes the zzso propagation in zzso media without any limiting assumptions regarding the optical zzso The reconstruction scheme consists of three major zzso zzso a forward model that predicts the detector readings based on solutions of the zzso zzso transfer zzso zzso an objective function that provides a measure of the differences between the detected and the predicted data, and zzso an updating scheme that uses the zzso of the objective function to perform a line zzso to get new guesses of the optical zzso The zzso is obtained by employing an zzso differentiation zzso which makes use of the structure of the zzso zzso zzso of the transport forward zzso Based on the new guess of the optical properties a new forward calculation is performed to get new detector zzso The reconstruction process is completed when the minimum of the objective function is found within a defined zzso To illustrate the performance of the code we present initial reconstruction results based on simulated zzso
