Red blood cell zzso zzso is the zzso and regular zzso in the presence of certain zzso This is a clinically important phenomenon, being significantly enhanced in the presence of acute phase zzso zzso zzso Both light reflection zzso and light transmission zzso from or through thin layers of zzso suspensions during the process of zzso are accepted to reflect the time course of zzso It has been recognized that the time courses of zzso and zzso might be different from each zzso We aim to compare the zzso zzso zzso based on simultaneous recordings of zzso and zzso The results indicate that zzso during zzso zzso is characterized by a faster time course compared to simultaneously recorded zzso This difference in time course of zzso and zzso is reflected in the calculated parameters reflecting the overall extent and zzso of zzso zzso Additionally, the power of parameters calculated using zzso and zzso time courses in detecting a given difference in zzso are significantly different from each zzso These differences should be taken into account in selecting the appropriate calculated parameters for analyzing zzso or zzso time courses for the assessment of zzso zzso
