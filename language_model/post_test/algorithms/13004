zzso of zzso activity by zzso zzso in zzso PET is severely limited by partial volume zzso A maximum likelihood zzso expectation zzso zzso zzso considering regional basis functions zzso had been previously zzso Regional basis functions are zzso segmented and zzso thus identifying the volume and the activity of the zzso 

Improvement of zzso when analyzing zzso interfering hot objects is addressed by proper zzso zzso steps and models of zzso and partial volume zzso zzso relevant to lung zzso studies are zzso 1) zzso close to hot organ zzso chest wall, heart and zzso 2) two close zzso 

CT image was considered for zzso hot anatomical structures, never for zzso zzso solely defined by zzso on PET zzso Further resolution recovery beyond the smooth standard clinical image was necessary to start zzso zzso A watershed zzso was used to separate two close zzso A zzso of the zzso from a nearby hot organ was introduced to enhance a zzso for the initial zzso and start the further zzso zzso zzso scanner blurring was modeled from phantom data in order to implement the procedure for zzso clinical lung zzso 

In simulations, the procedure was able to separate structures as close as one zzso zzso zzso zzso against the input zzso errors defining the addressed objects was tested showing that convergence was not sensitive to initial volume zzso up to zzso Poor zzso was found against zzso A clinical study of a small lung zzso close to chest wall displayed a good recovery of both zzso activity and zzso 

With proper zzso and models of zzso from hot zzso zzso can be successfully applied to lung zzso zzso
