zzso zzso contains a novel class of zzso zzso zzso that inhibit DNA zzso zzso zzso and quantitative analysis by zzso were performed in order to zzso and evaluate zzso zzso A standard fingerprint of zzso zzso zzso from the root extract was first established by zzso and the major zzso in the fingerprint profile were preliminarily determined using zzso The principal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were isolated and identified using a combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso spectral zzso zzso analysis indicated that 1 was the principal component in the zzso and that 2 was the major component in the zzso The average extraction rates of 1 and 2 were zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso respectively, and zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso zzso
