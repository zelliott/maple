In this paper, we study two recent theoretical zzso zzso model and a convergence zzso examine their assumptions to gain insights into the conditions under which zzso zzso work zzso We use these insights to formulate several design rules to develop competent zzso for practical zzso To test the usefulness of the design rules, we consider as a case study the zzso problem, an zzso problem from zzso We compare the predictions of the theoretical models with the actual performance of the zzso for the zzso zzso zzso show that the predictions match the observed zzso behavior of the zzso thereby strengthening our claim that the design rules can guide the design of competent zzso zzso for realistic zzso
