zzso zzso are a class of zzso zzso that regulate gene zzso expression in animals and zzso zzso zzso zzso methods have been developed to predict new zzso in zzso humans, and zzso Here we present an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso combined approach for the detection of novel zzso in zzso zzso This was initiated by using previously known zzso sequences from zzso rice and other plant species and an zzso called zzso to blast the databases of zzso zzso zzso and zzso A total of 37 potential zzso were detected following a range of filtering zzso Using these potential zzso zzso we further blasted the publicly available zzso database and detected 96 potential targets in zzso zzso According to the zzso information provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information zzso zzso most of the zzso targeted genes were predicted to zzso zzso factors that regulate cell growth and development, zzso and zzso So far, little is known about experimental or zzso identification of zzso in zzso zzso zzso These new zzso and their targets in zzso zzso have been run through zzso to yield data that may help us better understanding of the possible role of zzso in regulating the growth and development of zzso zzso
