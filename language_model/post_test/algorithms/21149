Although zzso functional zzso zzso provides a useful tool for probing zzso activities, large zzso variations in signal zzso are commonly zzso zzso the zzso basis for these variations will have a significant impact on many zzso zzso First, the zzso zzso can be used as a zzso to reduce variations across subjects, thereby improving statistical power for detecting group zzso Second, if a zzso condition or a drug treatment is shown to change zzso responses, monitoring this zzso zzso is useful in correctly interpreting the zzso changes to zzso zzso Here we present evidence that the zzso zzso signals are modulated by baseline blood zzso To measure global blood zzso we used a recently developed technique, zzso relaxation under zzso zzso zzso which yielded baseline zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso with an zzso error of zzso It was found that individuals with higher baseline zzso tend to have a smaller zzso zzso and vice zzso For every zzso difference in baseline zzso across subjects, zzso and cerebral blood flow zzso signals differ by zzso and zzso respectively, when using visual zzso zzso zzso is a useful measurement for zzso studies to control for the zzso effects of baseline zzso that are unique to each zzso
