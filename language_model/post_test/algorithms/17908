Conventional zzso profiles for zzso zzso for zzso zzso correction of the cornea are of zzso zzso zzso they induce additional imaging aberrations into the optical system of the eye, most notably zzso zzso This is a major cause of the observed deterioration of visual quality after such corrections, especially under low zzso and ensuing larger zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso profiles zzso the zzso zzso quality of the eye as little as possible are currently being developed and zzso for all laser zzso zzso methods include customized correction profiles on the basis of individual zzso data of the anterior zzso topography on the one hand, and correction profiles that minimize the induced zzso aberration in a zzso way on the other zzso We demonstrate for a particular laser platform how such profiles must be developed and zzso zzso theoretical calculations appear to be an indispensable but insufficient zzso The biological reaction of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso can only be determined zzso and must lead to adjustment of the calculated zzso zzso The results show that zzso profiles developed on this basis can lead to significant reduction of induced zzso zzso The zzso effect is, however, limited by the biological response and the ensuing peripheral zzso depth and zzso
