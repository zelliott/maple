A new method for the zzso zzso of zzso kinetic parameters from blood zzso concentration zzso continuously measured during a dialysis session is zzso The method, based on the zzso zzso model, is evaluated through a simulation approach in order to easily consider a large set of zzso test zzso The model is characterized by six zzso knowledge of which enables early prediction of the end dialysis zzso concentration and the dose of zzso The sensitivity of the model predicted zzso with respect to the parameters was first analyzed to investigate which can be reliably estimated from blood zzso zzso taken at a suitable zzso This analysis showed that the model predicted zzso is highly sensitive to the initial blood zzso concentration and to the zzso zzso zzso with respect to the total initial distribution volume, while it is scarcely influenced by the zzso zzso and zzso generation zzso The new zzso zzso technique keeps these two last parameters constant and takes advantage of an original zzso solution of the second order zzso zzso The results of the zzso process on realistic simulated data showed that the proposed method provides early and reliable estimates of the zzso clearance and of the end dialysis zzso The zzso mass transfer zzso and the zzso cellular volume ratio can also be estimated, although with less zzso Moreover, it was shown that the use of the zzso model, instead of the zzso one, provides systematic errors on the zzso
