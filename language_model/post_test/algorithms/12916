We propose a new method for implementing zzso convertible feature in the zzso integral imaging by using zzso half mirror zzso The zzso half mirror array has the partially reflective characteristic to the incident zzso And the reflected term is modulated by the zzso mirror array structure, while the transmitted term is zzso With such unique zzso zzso conversion or even the simultaneous display of zzso and zzso images is also zzso The zzso was zzso by the aluminum coating and the zzso molding zzso We could zzso verify the zzso conversion and the display of zzso image on zzso background with the zzso zzso
