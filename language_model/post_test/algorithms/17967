The accuracy of zzso stroke volume index zzso is questionable as studies report inconsistent zzso It remains unclear whether the zzso alone are responsible for these zzso We analyzed the raw zzso data with three zzso and compared zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso 

Prospective zzso clinical study in a university zzso 

Twenty adult patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso parameters were simultaneously obtained before surgery zzso after bypass zzso after zzso closure zzso at the intensive care unit zzso at zzso zzso after zzso zzso and before discharge zzso zzso data were analyzed zzso using cylinder zzso zzso zzso zzso and truncated cone based zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and precision between the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, while the mean error was abundantly above zzso Analysis of data per time moment resulted in a mean error above zzso except for zzso at zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso by cylinder or truncated cone based zzso is not reliable for clinical decision making in patients undergoing zzso zzso A more robust approach for zzso zzso based zzso may exclude inconsistencies in the underlying zzso in existing zzso zzso zzso zzso
