It was previously demonstrated that zzso elements are zzso zzso We exploited this relationship between location and function by comparing zzso zzso between all possible zzso zzso around a database of human zzso zzso The distance measure used in this study found point zzso that produced higher distances disrupted zzso whereas point zzso with smaller distances generally had no effect on zzso zzso the idea that functional zzso elements have signature zzso zzso around zzso spliced zzso we introduce zzso online tool that predicts how likely distant zzso around zzso zzso sites were to disrupt zzso zzso takes a set of DNA sequences with point zzso and returns a ranked list to predict the effects of point zzso on zzso zzso The current zzso included the analyses of 11 zzso human, zzso zzso zzso zzso dog, cat, chicken, guinea zzso zzso and zzso
