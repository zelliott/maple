In the framework of this study quantitative parameters are presented which, derived from zzso zzso aid in making a conclusion about zzso in the zzso The analysis is based on the examination of 86 patients with unstable zzso of which 53 exhibited zzso zzso with high probability zzso I: zzso proven zzso of at least 50% in a coronary artery of first or second order and positive zzso while in the 33 other patients zzso zzso could be ruled out with high probability zzso II: zzso clean coronary bed and normal zzso zzso The negative zzso value (the probability that there is no zzso zzso when the zzso zzso is zzso is zzso the positive zzso value (the probability that there is actually coronary heart disease when the zzso is zzso is zzso A zzso zzso taken at the same time as the zzso achieved a positive zzso value of zzso but a negative zzso value of zzso zzso the boundary values of the parameters selected lead to a markedly distinct separation between patients with zzso zzso from those zzso For ruling out coronary heart disease in patients with unstable angina the zzso is superior to zzso zzso
