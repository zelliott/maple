zzso synchronization has been shown to occur in beta zzso zzso and gamma range zzso zzso during zzso compensation of zzso and dynamic zzso zzso low-level forces, zzso However, it is still unknown to what extent these synchronization processes in beta and gamma range are modified with increasing modulated zzso We addressed this question by investigating the zzso zzso zzso between the electroencephalogram zzso and zzso zzso from the first zzso zzso muscle zzso as well as the cortical and muscular spectral power during a zzso task where different levels of a dynamic zzso force were zzso Seven healthy right-handed female subjects compensated dynamic forces at 8, 16, and zzso of the zzso voluntary contraction zzso zzso with their right index zzso Under the three conditions investigated, we found a zzso zzso zzso both beta and gamma range and zzso at approximately 22 zzso within the beta zzso This zzso zzso increased zzso with higher force zzso A separate analysis of the gamma range zzso did not show significant zzso of the zzso by the force zzso zzso and zzso spectral power did not show any significant difference among the three force zzso Our results favor the view that the function of beta range zzso is not specific for low-level zzso forces zzso The zzso system may resort to stronger and also broader zzso zzso to generate stable zzso interaction during increased force level, as well as when zzso for dynamic modulated zzso This finding zzso the importance of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
