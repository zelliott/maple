zzso a new open source software tool that zzso the analysis of zzso data for simultaneous structure and dynamics characterization of proteins is presented in this zzso zzso consideration of structure and motion is believed to be necessary for accurate representation of the zzso of a zzso zzso is designed to primarily zzso zzso data from multiple alignment media in two zzso During zzso a list of possible zzso angles joining any two neighboring zzso planes is ranked based on their fitness to experimental zzso in zzso a zzso zzso is extended by addition of one zzso plane at a zzso The zzso adopted by zzso is very efficient and can produce a structure for an 80 zzso protein within two hours on a typical zzso zzso zzso exhibits zzso with respect to noise and missing zzso zzso describes the overall alignment of the zzso in the form of an order zzso zzso and is capable of identifying zzso fragments with internal zzso Identification of the location of internal motion will permit a more accurate structural zzso Experimental data from two proteins as well as simulated data are presented to illustrate the capabilities of zzso in both structure determination and identification of the zzso zzso
