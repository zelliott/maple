To enable zzso screening of molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso Object of our study is zzso which invade human zzso One important basis for our collaborative project is the development of methods for automatic and accurate evaluation of zzso zzso As a part of this, we focus on the question of how to measure the accuracy of microscope image zzso by human experts or a computer zzso Following standard practice we use methods motivated by receiver operator characteristics to discuss the zzso of human experts and of neural network-based zzso For images of good quality the zzso achieve the accuracy of the zzso zzso In images with increased noise, the zzso are outperformed by some of the zzso Furthermore, the neural network-based cell detection is much faster than the human zzso
