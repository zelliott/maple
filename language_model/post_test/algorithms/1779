To fit a zzso distribution to a complex set of microbial data, including detection data zzso presence or absence in zzso and zzso data zzso zzso we compared two models: a model called zzso based on data expressed as zzso (in zzso or censored zzso zzso zzso or zzso versus a model called zzso that directly uses raw data zzso in test portions, and plate colony zzso We used these two models to simulated data sets, under standard conditions zzso of detection zzso limit of zzso zzso and used a maximum likelihood zzso method zzso for the model zzso and via the zzso zzso zzso for the model zzso The comparison suggests that in most cases estimates provided by the proposed model zzso are similar to those obtained by model zzso accounting for zzso Nevertheless, in some cases, the proposed model zzso leads to less biased and more precise estimates than model zzso
