This article illustrates practical applications to molecular dynamics simulations of the recently developed zzso zzso zzso Rev E 2006, 73, zzso for ordinary differential zzso This method consists of extending any set of ordinary differential equations in order to define a time zzso function, and then use the techniques of zzso zzso decomposition and zzso composition to obtain zzso zzso in the extended phase zzso Here, we have developed the technique by constructing multiple zzso zzso in order to enhance the handling in actual zzso and by zzso higher order zzso to obtain further zzso Using these zzso we perform constant temperature molecular dynamics simulations of liquid water, liquid zzso and zzso in liquid water zzso The temperature control is obtained through an extended version of the zzso zzso zzso the effects of the simulation conditions including time step zzso initial values, boundary conditions, and equation zzso we investigate local zzso global zzso zzso cost, and sensitivity along with the sampling zzso According to the results of these simulations, we show that the zzso zzso developed by the current method are more effective than traditional zzso that lack the zzso zzso
