We combine computer simulations and zzso arguments to develop a unified view of zzso entanglement based on the primitive path analysis of the microscopic zzso zzso Our results agree with zzso measured plateau zzso for three different zzso classes over a wide range of reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso solutions of synthetic zzso zzso the corresponding dense melts above the glass transition or zzso temperature, and zzso solutions of zzso zzso such as zzso or suspensions of zzso zzso Together, these systems cover the entire range from loosely to tightly zzso zzso In particular, we argue that the primitive path analysis zzso a loosely to a tightly zzso system and provide a new explanation of the successful zzso packing conjecture for zzso zzso
