The availability of the complete chicken zzso sequence provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the global zzso organization at the sequence zzso zzso zzso homogeneous G + C zzso in DNA sequences can provide much insight into the understanding of the organization and biological functions of the chicken zzso A new zzso algorithm, which is simple and fast, has been proposed to partition a given zzso or DNA sequence into zzso distinct zzso By applying the new zzso zzso to the draft chicken zzso zzso the mosaic organization of the chicken zzso can be confirmed at the sequence zzso It is shown zzso that the chicken zzso is also characterized by a mosaic structure of zzso long DNA segments that are fairly homogeneous in the G + C zzso zzso 25 zzso longer than 2 zzso zzso have been identified in the chicken zzso These zzso have a fairly homogeneous G + C content and often zzso to meaningful biological zzso With the aid of the technique of cumulative zzso profile, we proposed an intuitive picture to display the distribution of zzso zzso The relationships between G + C content and the zzso of genes zzso islands, and other zzso zzso were analyzed in a zzso zzso The cumulative zzso profile, equipped with the new zzso algorithm, would be an appropriate starting point for analyzing the zzso structures of higher zzso zzso
