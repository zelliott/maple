The purpose of this study was to determine whether muscle balance is influenced by fatigue in a zzso way, toward creating novel defensive activity strategies for manual wheelchair users zzso Wheelchair propulsion to a point of mild fatigue, level 15 on the zzso of zzso zzso scale, was investigated at two different zzso Surface zzso zzso activity of 7 muscles was recorded on 14 nondisabled zzso zzso variables were measured using a zzso No significant effect was found of percentage endurance time on kinetic variables for the two propulsion zzso zzso changes in the zzso zzso were identified as an increase of zzso intensity and a decrease of mean power frequency as a function of percent endurance time for the tested muscles under both fast and slow speed zzso The greater increases in activity for propulsive muscles compared with recovery muscles during fast speed wheelchair propulsion indicated muscle imbalance associated with fatiguing wheelchair zzso This study shows how kinetic and zzso information might be used as feedback to zzso to ensure that they conduct activity in ways that do not zzso zzso
