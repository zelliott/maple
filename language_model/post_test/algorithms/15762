zzso analysis of the functional changes occurring in the rat brain are most often performed on zzso sections that allow a good insight into the events occurring at the structural level but lacks the zzso context which is necessary to fully understand the involvement of the brain structures in specific situations like focal zzso with or without zzso Therefore a zzso zzso zzso for the registration of serially acquired zzso sections is zzso The method accounts for the main difficulties of zzso alignment: corrupted data zzso and zzso zzso or zzso between zzso non parallel or missing zzso The approach relies on the zzso of a global energy function based on robust zzso The energy function measures the similarity between a slice and its neighborhood in the zzso zzso No particular direction is privileged in the method, so that global zzso biases in the zzso or error zzso are zzso The method is evaluated zzso and zzso on real zzso zzso zzso brain zzso volumes are reconstructed with registration errors less than 1 degree in rotation and less than 1 zzso in zzso
