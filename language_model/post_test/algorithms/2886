Visual zzso are zzso zzso that are implanted in early processing stages of the visual system of blind zzso In an effort to induce light zzso visual zzso zzso via zzso of stimulating electrodes, zzso trains of current zzso which zzso the adjacent neural zzso Human experiments with current zzso art retinal zzso have revealed that, although visual zzso can be zzso by electrical zzso these zzso are not closely related to the spatial patterns of zzso One of the main reasons for this failure is that present methods of prosthetic stimulation result in zzso zzso of multiple retinal zzso Recent evidence, however, suggests that the specificity of neural zzso can be increased by zzso of the zzso parameters of zzso Before these notions are evaluated in human experiments, which are zzso and prone to patient fatigue and frustration, it is imperative that they are assessed in animal models using cortical zzso Toward this end, we have developed a zzso method for analyzing the cortical zzso local field potential zzso evoked in response to electrical stimulation of a site zzso to where zzso are zzso This method applies a zzso decoding technique on the recorded zzso signal to zzso the information transmitted downstream from the stimulation zzso zzso of this method using an implant attached to the zzso surface of cats and zzso recordings from layer 4 of cat primary visual cortex, demonstrates that the spatial origin, the duration and the zzso of injected current zzso can all be zzso simultaneously from zzso zzso zzso Our findings indicate that the developed method is a highly sensitive probe for characterizing the efficacy of visual prosthetic zzso
