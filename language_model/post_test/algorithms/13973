zzso trees constructed from molecular sequences contain information about the evolutionary or population zzso processes that created zzso Here we describe a computer package zzso that uses zzso methods to allow researchers to make zzso about these processes from their zzso zzso analyses can be performed to test the consistency of the data with various competing zzso 

zzso can be obtained by zzso from zzso and by anonymous zzso from zzso This file contains the compiled application, the manual and a test zzso
