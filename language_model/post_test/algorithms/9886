Time reversal active sensing using Lamb waves is investigated for health monitoring of a metallic zzso zzso were conducted on an aluminum plate to study the time reversal behavior of zzso and zzso Lamb wave modes under narrow band and broad band pulse zzso zzso in the form of a notch was introduced in the plate to study the changes in the characteristics of the time reversed Lamb wave modes zzso zzso analysis of the time reversed signal was carried out to extract the damage zzso A measure of damage based on zzso transform was derived to zzso the hidden damage information in the time reversed zzso It has been shown that time reversal can be used to achieve zzso zzso of Lamb waves under broadband signal zzso Further, the broad band zzso can also improve the resolution of the technique in detecting closely located zzso This is demonstrated by picking up the reflection of waves from the edge of the plate, from a zzso close to the edge of the plate and from defects located near to each zzso This study shows the effectiveness of Lamb wave time reversal for zzso zzso of zzso Lamb waves for damage detection in health monitoring zzso
