zzso the rate of zzso protein production in Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells is an important consideration in controlling the cost of zzso We present the first zzso model of productivity in zzso zzso culture based on gene expression zzso The zzso used to construct the model consisted of zzso data from 70 stationary phase, zzso zzso production cell line samples, for which the zzso productivity had been zzso These samples were zzso to investigate gene expression over a range of high to low zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso We zzso a supervised zzso algorithm, partial least squares zzso incorporating zzso gene selection, to produce a model of zzso productivity zzso capable of predicting zzso to within zzso zzso root mean squared error in cross model validation zzso The final model, consisting of zzso zzso was capable of accurately predicting zzso in a further panel of 10 additional samples which were incorporated as an independent zzso Several of the genes zzso the model are linked with biological processes relevant to protein zzso
