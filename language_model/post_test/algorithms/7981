Biological zzso possess the ability to adapt according to the respective local loading conditions, which results in growth and zzso zzso The main goal of this work is the development of a new zzso approach that, on the one hand, reflects the alignment of zzso soft biological tissue with respect to representative loading zzso On the other hand, the zzso approach proposed is based on a sound zzso motivated zzso To be specific, use of a zzso chain model is made to describe the zzso of zzso molecules as present in, for instance, zzso zzso The extension of such a one-dimensional zzso equation to the three-dimensional zzso level is performed by means of a zzso zzso Inherent with the zzso treatment of this type of zzso approach, a finite number of unit zzso is considered for the zzso integration over the domain of the unit zzso As a key aspect of this contribution, zzso is incorporated by setting up evolution equations for the zzso zzso of these integration zzso zzso the unit zzso considered now allow interpretation as internal zzso which characterize the zzso zzso zzso Several zzso studies underline the zzso of the model that, moreover, nicely fits into zzso finite element zzso so that general boundary value problems can be zzso
