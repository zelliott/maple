A major source of error in the zzso assessment of the zzso thickness zzso is the difficulty in retrieving the same zzso view of the zzso 

To present a method for increasing the zzso of zzso zzso by ultrasound in large zzso 

The zzso zzso is a well-known means of describing an zzso zzso By means of the discrete zzso transform zzso the shape was represented in a frequency zzso the zzso advantages of the zzso then permitted a measure of zzso between different shapes (the 'distance' zzso zzso to be defined and used as a criterion for zzso the zzso When the zzso compared successive images of a complex vascular segment, like the carotid zzso the identity of the zzso cut was deduced from the identity of the zzso zzso The best match of the baseline image was the view that minimized the zzso zzso 

zzso studies in the carotid artery zzso of eight subjects showed that the zzso responds to systematic variations in the ultrasound interrogation angle and reveals minimal changes in zzso zzso zzso scans of 12 subjects were performed by three zzso with different strategies for acquisition of the same zzso a low zzso was associated with a low difference in pairs of zzso zzso Data were classified into two groups zzso or borderline vessels with a pooled mean zzso of zzso zzso and overtly thickened segments with a pooled mean zzso of zzso zzso When zzso of the zzso was the criterion for the acquisition of replicate scans, the mean absolute difference of paired data for the mean zzso of the zzso common carotid artery was zzso zzso zzso zzso for the first group and zzso zzso zzso zzso for the second zzso This is a significant reduction in comparison with zzso alternative criteria for image zzso For the maximum zzso of the same segments the mean absolute differences were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the first and second groups, zzso 

This method can be applied to the serial assessment of single zzso zzso The zzso time is zzso By reducing the scatter in sequential zzso data, zzso investigations zzso of the results of zzso zzso with shorter zzso and smaller sample groups may be rendered zzso
