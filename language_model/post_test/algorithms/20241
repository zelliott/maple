zzso light scattering calculations, when applied to models based on structures seen in electron zzso of zzso zzso require knowledge of the constituent zzso positions and zzso zzso this information manually is a difficult and time-consuming zzso In order to facilitate this problem, we present a simple and flexible computer zzso that allows the process to be automated using a Macintosh zzso The accuracy of the results is checked by comparing light scattering calculations using zzso positions and zzso found manually with those found by the zzso The results show that the computer zzso is a viable and accurate means of obtaining the needed zzso
