Left zzso zzso function provides zzso information regarding the morbidity and mortality of zzso An automated cardiac phase selection zzso has the potential to support the assessment of zzso function with zzso zzso zzso This zzso is clinically evaluated for zzso cardiac zzso 

zzso of zzso consecutive patients were zzso zzso gated zzso CT was zzso zzso were performed using an automated and a manual method, followed by the determination of the global zzso zzso zzso were tested using zzso zzso zzso Reduction in post processing time and storage capacity were zzso A slightly smaller mean zzso volume was found with the automated method zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso ejection fraction was slightly larger with the automated method zzso vs zzso zzso zzso The estimated reduction in post processing time was zzso 5 zzso per patient with a potential zzso data storage zzso 

zzso of the automated phase selection zzso are similar to the manual zzso The automated tool reduces post processing time, reconstruction time and transfer zzso
