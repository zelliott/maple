A heightened zzso to delayed rewards is associated with substance abuse and numerous other zzso zzso Many of these disorders are zzso raising the possibility that delay zzso may also have a significant genetic or zzso zzso To examine this possibility, we compared delay zzso in six zzso strains of rats zzso Norway, zzso Lewis, zzso Noble and zzso zzso using the adjusting amount zzso which provides a measure of the zzso value of delayed zzso The zzso value of rewards decreased as the delay to zzso increased for all zzso However, a main effect of strain and a strain zzso delay interaction indicated that some strains were more sensitive to the imposition of delays than zzso Fitting a zzso discount equation showed significant strain differences in sensitivity to delay zzso These data indicate that there are significant strain differences in delay zzso All strains strongly preferred the zzso zzso solution (the zzso in the delay zzso zzso over water and the amount of zzso consumed was correlated with sensitivity to zzso zzso activity was not correlated with delay zzso zzso Additional research will be required to zzso genetic influences from maternal effects and to determine how these factors influence the underlying association between heightened delay zzso and zzso zzso
