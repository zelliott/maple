To develop and evaluate a semiautomatic zzso for zzso and zzso assessment of the dimensions of the zzso muscle in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Geometric zzso in zzso images analyzed as zzso files were assessed by imaging an optical flat and human donor zzso The appropriate zzso conversion factor to use for air zzso zzso 1) was estimated by imaging zzso zzso A semiautomatic zzso was developed to extract the dimensions of the zzso muscle from zzso zzso zzso were also made manually using zzso software zzso zzso correlation zzso and zzso analyses were used to compare the zzso A zzso model was fitted to estimate the zzso of zzso zzso that was due to differences zzso and zzso in zzso spur selection zzso biological zzso 

The optical flat and the human donor tissue were zzso and appeared without geometric zzso in zzso file zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso zzso tended to underestimate zzso muscle thickness at 3 zzso zzso to the zzso spur in subjects with the thickest zzso muscles zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The percent zzso due to zzso or zzso differences in zzso spur selection was found to be small zzso when compared with the zzso because of biological difference across subjects zzso Using the mean of zzso from three images, achieved an estimated zzso correlation zzso of zzso 

The semiautomatic zzso successfully segmented the zzso muscle for further zzso Using the zzso to follow the zzso zzso to locate more zzso zzso is critical to avoid zzso thickness zzso This semiautomatic zzso will allow for zzso efficient, and masked zzso muscle zzso in large zzso
