This paper studies the problem of state feedback controller design for a class of zzso systems, which are described by zzso zzso fuzzy zzso A convex zzso zzso controller design method is proposed based on a new zzso linear zzso inequality zzso zzso where the system zzso is separated from zzso zzso such that the controller zzso is independent of the zzso zzso In contrast to the existing work, the derived zzso condition leads to less conservative zzso zzso and much wider scope of the zzso Furthermore, the results are extended to zzso state feedback zzso Finally, two zzso examples illustrate the superiority and effectiveness of the new zzso
