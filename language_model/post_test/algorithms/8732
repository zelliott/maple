To examine whether established diabetes risk factors and diabetes risk zzso are associated with future zzso 

Prospective cohort zzso zzso zzso at baseline zzso were the zzso zzso Cambridge, and Finnish diabetes risk zzso 

Civil service departments in London, United zzso 

There were zzso participants zzso zzso aged 45 to 69 years at baseline assessment and free of zzso 

zzso factors zzso sex, family history of diabetes, body mass index, waist zzso zzso and zzso blood pressure, zzso and zzso treatments, history of high blood zzso smoking status, physical activity, consumption of fruits and vegetables, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used to construct the risk zzso zzso assessed during a zzso in zzso was zzso by the presence of 3 or more of the following zzso zzso exhaustion, low physical activity, slow walking speed, low grip strength, and weight zzso zzso was defined as having 2 or fewer of these zzso 

After a mean follow-up of zzso years, zzso of the sample was classified as frail and zzso as zzso Increased age, being female, stopping smoking, low physical activity, and not having a daily consumption of fruits and vegetables were each associated with frailty or zzso The Cambridge and Finnish diabetes risk scores were associated with zzso with odds ratios per 1 zzso increase zzso in score of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso diabetes risk factors and risk scores are associated with subsequent zzso zzso scores may have utility for frailty prediction in clinical zzso
