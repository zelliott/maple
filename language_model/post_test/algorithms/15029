A finite zzso zzso inversion scheme for magnetic resonance zzso zzso is zzso The zzso operates on small overlapping zzso of the total region of interest, processed in a zzso order as determined by progressive error zzso This zoned approach allows for a high degree of spatial zzso taking advantage of the zzso environment afforded by the zzso The inversion technique is tested in simulation under zzso conditions zzso random noise applied to the displacement zzso with both complicated zzso zzso zzso and realistic tissue zzso obtained by zzso MR image zzso In both cases the process has proved successful and has been capable of discerning small inclusions near 4 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
