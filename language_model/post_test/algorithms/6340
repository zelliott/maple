A public zzso facility to zzso zzso and zzso represent the likely modes of a protein motion, starting from a zzso structure, is zzso This facility is based on the use of zzso to generate an ensemble of feasible protein structures that are subsequently zzso by principal component analysis to identify probable concerted zzso The user is returned the ensemble of feasible structures, together with associated zzso including zzso and zzso representations of both the principal component of the ensemble zzso and indicators of strongly correlated zzso atomic zzso zzso users are warned that completely reliable zzso about protein motion may be beyond even substantially more rigorous tools for exploring zzso space, it is hoped that the service will allow a much wider community to benefit from the insights that simple dynamic data may zzso
