The accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is important in early zzso detection and treatment zzso Most of current studies formulate the zzso diagnosis scenario as a zzso problem and solve it using various machine learners trained with zzso zzso However, the diagnosis accuracy is usually constrained by the performance of the machine learners as well as the methods of zzso the zzso zzso In this study, we propose a novel diagnosis algorithm, the zzso zzso zzso zzso which models the diagnosis process as a synthesis analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso a kernel for each zzso that zzso the local neighborhood zzso and further evaluates the contribution of each zzso based on a zzso zzso zzso adopts a novel diagnosis scheme that could zzso the zzso diagnosis by zzso the output diagnosis probabilities of individual zzso The proposed algorithm, validated using zzso zzso data from the zzso baseline cohort with 85 zzso 169 zzso and 77 cognitive normal subjects, achieves significant improvements on all diagnosis groups compared to the state-of-the-art zzso
