Since scattered radiation in zzso volume CT implies severe degradation of CT images by zzso zzso artifacts, and noise increase, scatter suppression is one of the main issues related to image quality in zzso zzso The aim of this review is to zzso the variety of scatter suppression methods, to analyze the common structure, and to develop a general framework for scatter correction zzso In general, scatter suppression combines hardware techniques of scatter rejection and software methods of scatter zzso The authors emphasize that scatter correction procedures consist of the main components scatter zzso (by measurement or mathematical zzso and scatter compensation zzso or statistical zzso The framework comprises most scatter correction approaches and its zzso also goes beyond transmission zzso Before the advent of zzso CT, a lot of papers on scatter correction approaches in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso CT had been zzso The opportunity to avail from research in those other fields of medical imaging has not yet been sufficiently zzso Therefore additional references are included when ever it seems zzso zzso zzso and scatter compensation are typically intertwined in zzso zzso It makes sense to recognize zzso approaches in the light of the concept of zzso The importance of incorporating scatter compensation approaches into a statistical framework for noise zzso has to be zzso Signal and noise propagation analysis is zzso A main result is the preservation of zzso zzso in CT projection data by ideal scatter zzso The objective of scatter compensation methods is the restoration of quantitative accuracy and a balance between zzso restoration and noise zzso In a synopsis section, the different deterministic and statistical methods are discussed with respect to their properties and zzso The current paper is focused on scatter compensation zzso The multitude of scatter zzso models will be dealt with in a separate zzso
