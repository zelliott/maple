In zzso wireless sensor network zzso applications, a high degree of reliability is commonly zzso A zzso jumping real-time zzso zzso protocol zzso is proposed in this zzso Each zzso zzso the remaining transmission time of the data packets and the state of the forwarding candidate zzso set to zzso choose the next zzso Once zzso failure, network congestion or void region occurs, the transmission mode will switch to jumping transmission mode, which can reduce the transmission time zzso guaranteeing the data packets to be sent to the destination zzso within the specified time zzso By using feedback zzso each zzso zzso adjusts the jumping probabilities to increase the ratio of successful zzso zzso results show that zzso can not only efficiently reduce the effects of failure zzso congestion and void region, but also yield higher ratio of successful transmission, smaller transmission delay and reduced number of control zzso
