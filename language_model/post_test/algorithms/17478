zzso is an important part of image processing, which often has a large impact on quantitative image analysis zzso zzso automated operator independent zzso procedures that successfully work in a population with a larger biological variation are extremely difficult to design and usually some kind of operator intervention is required, at least in pathological zzso We developed a variety of zzso editing tools that can be used to correct or improve results of initial automatic zzso zzso zzso we will discuss and show examples for three types of editing tools that we zzso zzso zzso 1), zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Each tool comes in a number of zzso all of which are implemented in a truly zzso zzso We describe the principles, evaluate efficiency and flexibility, and discuss advantages and disadvantages of each zzso We further demonstrate the superiority of the zzso approach over the time-consuming zzso editing of zzso zzso which is still widely used in medical image processing zzso We conclude that performance criteria for automatic zzso zzso may be eased significantly by including zzso editing tools early in the design zzso
