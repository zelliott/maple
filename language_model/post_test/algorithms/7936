In this work we report a zzso zzso avalanche zzso with an enhanced zzso of zzso zzso at a wavelength of zzso zzso The corresponding gain value is 65 and the electrical bandwidth is 13 zzso at an optical input power of zzso zzso The unconventional high zzso is investigated using device physical simulation and optical pulse response zzso The analysis of the electric field distribution, electron and hole concentration and drift zzso in the device shows that the enhanced zzso at high bias zzso is due to a decrease of the transit time and avalanche zzso time limitation at high zzso
