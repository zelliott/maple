To evaluate the performance of a model based image reconstruction method in reducing metal artifacts in the zzso zzso zzso zzso images of a phantom representing bilateral hip zzso and to compare with the zzso zzso zzso 

An zzso maximum likelihood zzso zzso for CT zzso is used with an additional model for the zzso production process and the energy dependent response of the zzso The beam zzso for an in-house zzso and zzso zzso are modeled for use in zzso The empirical energy dependent response of detectors is calculated using a constrained zzso technique that predicts the measured zzso of the beam by various thicknesses zzso zzso of solid water zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso phantom containing various zzso zzso of relative electron zzso zzso positioned between two steel rods zzso zzso zzso is scanned in the zzso zzso that zzso the zzso radiation from a 6 zzso electron beam passed through 4 zzso solid water on the zzso zzso zzso and in the imaging beam of the zzso zzso The zzso technique in zzso zzso reconstructs images from raw signal zzso to air scan and corrected for beam zzso using a uniform zzso cylinder (20 zzso zzso The zzso starts with a zzso reconstructed seed image and reconstructs the final image in 150 zzso 

In both zzso zzso produces visible dark zzso in the image connecting the steel zzso In the zzso reconstructed images this zzso is nearly removed and the uniform background is zzso The average zzso zzso of the zzso and the background are very close to the corresponding values in the absence of the steel zzso In the zzso images of the zzso zzso the zzso causes zzso zzso of electron density at the central zzso with an average of zzso zzso zzso for the range of electron zzso zzso In the uniform zzso background, the shadow creates zzso zzso of electron density with an average of zzso zzso zzso In the corresponding zzso images, the zzso in the shaded zzso background is zzso with an average of zzso zzso zzso and zzso with an average of zzso zzso zzso in the central insert zzso In the zzso images of the zzso zzso this zzso creates zzso zzso of electron density with an average of zzso zzso zzso at the central zzso and zzso zzso in the background with an average of zzso zzso zzso In the zzso images, the uniform background between the steel rods is restored with zzso zzso of electron density with an average of zzso zzso zzso The corresponding zzso at the central zzso of the zzso images is zzso with an average of zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso metal artifact has been nearly removed in zzso images using the zzso zzso with the accurate geometry of the system, proper modeling of energy dependent response of zzso and all relevant zzso interaction zzso This results less than zzso difference in electron density in the background zzso and less than zzso averaged over the range of electron zzso zzso
