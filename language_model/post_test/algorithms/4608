The zzso transform was proposed to address the limited directional resolution of the zzso zzso zzso One way to guarantee good approximation behavior is to let the directional filters in the zzso filter bank have sharp frequency zzso This requires filters with large support zzso We seek to isolate the key filter property that ensures good zzso In this direction, we propose filters with directional vanishing moments zzso These zzso we show, zzso information along a given zzso We study zzso filter banks with zzso zzso We provide conditions under which the design of zzso filter banks is zzso A complete characterization of the product filter is, thus, zzso We propose a design framework that avoids zzso zzso using the mapping zzso The filters zzso when used in the zzso zzso exhibit zzso approximation comparable to the conventional filters while being shorter and, therefore, providing better visual quality with less ringing zzso Furthermore, experiments show that the proposed filters outperform the conventional ones in image approximation and zzso
