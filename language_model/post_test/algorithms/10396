This paper proposes an extension to conventional zzso neural networks zzso for replacing the point predictions they produce with prediction intervals that satisfy a required level of zzso Our approach follows a novel machine learning zzso called zzso zzso zzso for assigning reliable confidence measures to predictions without assuming anything more than that the data are independent and zzso distributed zzso We evaluate the proposed method on four benchmark zzso and on the problem of predicting Total zzso Content zzso which is an important zzso in zzso zzso for the latter we use a zzso of more than zzso zzso zzso collected over a period of 11 zzso Our experimental results show that the prediction intervals produced by our method are both well zzso and tight enough to be useful in zzso
