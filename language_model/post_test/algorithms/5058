zzso zzso zzso poses a typical zzso inverse problem with a large number of unknowns and a relatively limited number of boundary zzso It is indispensable to incorporate a zzso information into the inverse problem zzso in order to obtain viable zzso In the paper, zzso approach has been zzso suggested to incorporate multiple types of a zzso information for BLT zzso Meanwhile, a generalized zzso zzso zzso random field zzso prior model for unknown source density zzso is developed to further reduce the zzso of BLT on the basis of finite element zzso Then the distribution of zzso source can be acquired by maximizing the log zzso probability with respect to a noise zzso and the unknown source zzso Furthermore, the use of finite element method makes the zzso appropriate for complex zzso zzso The zzso was validated by zzso simulation of a 3-D zzso mouse zzso and physical phantom zzso The reconstructed results suggest that we are able to achieve high zzso efficiency and accurate zzso of zzso zzso
