zzso is a frequent complication during mechanical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso tool that allows real-time imaging of regional zzso The purpose of this study was to 1) identify characteristic changes in the zzso signals associated with zzso 2) develop and fine-tune an zzso for their automatic zzso and 3) zzso evaluate this zzso for its sensitivity and specificity in detecting zzso in real zzso 

Prospective controlled laboratory animal zzso 

Experimental zzso Laboratory of the University of zzso zzso 

Thirty-nine zzso mechanically zzso zzso pigs zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso 

In a first group of 18 animals monitored by zzso we either injected progressive amounts of air (from 20 to 500 zzso through chest tubes or applied large positive zzso pressure zzso increments to simulate extreme lung zzso This first data set was used to zzso an zzso zzso detection zzso zzso we evaluated the real-time performance of the detection zzso in 21 additional animals (with normal or zzso zzso submitted to multiple zzso interventions or traumatic zzso of the zzso 

zzso zzso relative images were acquired online zzso zzso and processed according to a few zzso routines running automatically and in zzso zzso as small as 20 zzso could be detected with a sensitivity of zzso and specificity zzso and could be easily distinguished from zzso zzso induced by zzso or recruiting zzso Their location was correctly identified in all cases, with a total delay of only three respiratory zzso 

We created an zzso zzso capable of detecting early signs of zzso in high-risk situations, which also identifies its zzso It requires that the zzso occurs or zzso at least minimally during the monitoring zzso Such detection was zzso and in zzso zzso opening opportunities for improving patient safety during mechanical zzso
