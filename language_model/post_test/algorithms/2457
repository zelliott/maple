To investigate the ability of zzso diffusion zzso imaging zzso applied at 3 zzso to dissect breast tissue architecture and evaluate breast zzso 

All protocols were approved and a signed informed consent was obtained from all zzso The study included 21 healthy women, 26 women with 33 zzso zzso and 14 women with 20 benign zzso Images were recorded at 3 zzso with a protocol zzso for breast zzso at a spatial resolution of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Image processing zzso and software, applied at zzso resolution, yielded zzso maps of prime diffusion direction and zzso maps of the 3 zzso diffusion zzso and of the fractional zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso maps and zzso maps revealed the architecture of the entire zzso zzso tissue and allowed a reliable detection of zzso zzso Cancer zzso exhibited significantly lower values of the zzso diffusion zzso zzso zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso index zzso as compared with normal breast tissue zzso zzso zzso and to benign breast zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso exhibited the highest zzso ratio enabling zzso of the cancer zzso These maps also provided high zzso of zzso for zzso zzso from benign zzso which were similar to the zzso of dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging of zzso zzso of zzso provided a secondary independent diagnostic zzso with high sensitivity of zzso but low specificity of zzso for zzso zzso from benign zzso 

zzso the diffusion zzso parameters at high spatial resolution provides a potential novel means for zzso breast zzso zzso maps of zzso and zzso facilitate the detection and diagnosis of breast zzso
