An experimental model which can simulate physical changes that occur during aging was developed in order to evaluate the effects of change of mineral content and zzso on zzso properties of bovine zzso zzso Timed immersion in zzso acid was used to selectively alter the mineral zzso zzso electron zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso demonstrated a zzso structure consisting of a zzso core and a zzso zzso The presence of organic zzso contributed very little to zzso broadband ultrasound zzso zzso and speed of zzso All three zzso zzso speed of sound, zzso and zzso zzso were sensitive to changes in apparent density of bovine zzso zzso A zzso model utilizing a combination of two zzso functions (a densely populated model and a zzso zzso was used to approximate the zzso zzso The predicted zzso due to scattering constituted a significant part of the measured total zzso zzso to both scattering and zzso zzso for bovine zzso zzso Linear regression, performed between zzso thickness values and estimated from the model correlation zzso showed significant linear zzso with zzso before and zzso after zzso The accuracy of zzso was found to increase with zzso zzso
