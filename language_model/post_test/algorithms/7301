zzso zzso imaging is dependent on finding the positions of individual zzso in a sample by fitting the observed zzso intensity pattern to the microscope point spread function zzso For three-dimensional imaging, zzso aberrations of the optical system can lead to inaccurate zzso when the zzso model does not account for these zzso Here we describe the use of zzso zzso functions to generate a more accurate zzso and therefore more accurate zzso zzso The zzso zzso function contains information about the zzso aberrations and can thus be used to generate the zzso for arbitrary zzso Further, it can be modified to include depth dependent zzso We describe the phase retrieval process, the method for including depth dependent zzso and a fast fitting zzso using graphics processing zzso The superior zzso accuracy of the zzso function generated zzso is demonstrated with dual focal plane zzso zzso imaging of biological zzso
