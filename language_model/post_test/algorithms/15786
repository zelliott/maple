The modeling of system dynamics of genetic networks, zzso networks or signal zzso zzso from zzso data is formulated as a zzso Previous studies focused on the zzso of only network structures, and they were ineffective in zzso a network structure with feedback zzso We previously proposed a method to predict not only the network structure but also its dynamics using a zzso Algorithm zzso and an zzso zzso However, it could predict only a small number of parameters and could rarely obtain essential zzso In this work, we propose a unified extension of the basic zzso zzso improvements are as zzso zzso an additional term in its evaluation function that aims at eliminating futile zzso zzso a crossover method called zzso zzso zzso to improve its zzso zzso and zzso a gradual zzso strategy to increase the number of predictable zzso 

The proposed method is implemented as a C program called zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Its performance was compared with the basic zzso The comparison showed that: zzso the convergence rate increased about zzso zzso the zzso speed was raised about zzso and zzso the number of predictable parameters was increased about zzso Moreover, we successfully zzso the dynamics of a small genetic network constructed with 60 parameters for 5 network variables and feedback zzso using only zzso data of gene zzso
