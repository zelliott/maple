This paper extends the classical linear mixed model by considering a zzso zzso assumption for the distribution of random zzso We present an efficient hybrid zzso zzso for the zzso of zzso estimates of zzso A score test statistic for testing the existence of zzso preference among random effects is zzso The technique for the prediction of future responses under this model is also zzso The methodology is illustrated through an application to zzso cholesterol data and a simulation zzso
