We describe comprehensive zzso zzso based on presence or absence of a supple zzso plate using the 3 surgical techniques of zzso zzso plate, zzso zzso graft and zzso zzso zzso 

We reviewed prospective data from all zzso zzso zzso performed by one of us zzso between 2000 and zzso Patient age, number of operations, indications for additional surgery, zzso location, zzso surgical technique and outcomes were zzso 

A total of 133 patients underwent zzso by zzso zzso plate zzso zzso zzso graft zzso or zzso zzso graft zzso zzso Mean number of prior failed repairs was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was available in 121 patients zzso with 90 zzso undergoing 1 successful zzso zzso zzso occurred in zzso zzso and 38% of patients, respectively, and most often consisted of zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso zzso can be accomplished using these 3 techniques without skin zzso a potential advantage given the relative paucity of skin after failed zzso zzso after zzso zzso plate zzso correlate with barrier layers used, while zzso zzso is more likely in zzso zzso graft repairs when cheek rather than lip is used within the zzso
