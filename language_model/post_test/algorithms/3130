An almost zzso comprehensive two-dimensional liquid zzso was developed for the separation of zzso and zzso natural antioxidants by using combinations of a zzso zzso zzso zzso in the first dimension and a zzso zzso zzso column in the second dimension, both in the zzso zzso System zzso was improved using parallel zzso of zzso in zzso mobile zzso A new approach was proposed to zzso matching segmented zzso profiles in the two zzso An zzso was developed for automatic corrections of the shifts in retention in the second dimension induced by the parallel two-dimensional zzso operation zzso Using the zzso zzso column in the second dimension at elevated temperature zzso degrees zzso and high pressure zzso zzso with zzso segmented profiles of the parallel zzso in the two dimensions, the overall separation time for comprehensive zzso zzso zzso was reduced to 30 zzso
