A circular scanning trajectory is and will likely remain a popular choice of trajectory in zzso zzso zzso imaging because it is easy to implement and zzso zzso zzso zzso have been developed previously for approximate and exact reconstruction of the entire image or a region of interest within the image in circular zzso and zzso zzso Recently, we have developed a zzso zzso zzso for image reconstruction on zzso segments in a zzso zzso zzso In this work, we demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso indeed provided a rather general zzso for image reconstruction from divergent projections (such as zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of this zzso we derived new approximate or exact zzso for image reconstruction in circular zzso or zzso scans, which can be interpreted as special cases of the zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the derived zzso were zzso We also performed a preliminary zzso study to verify our theoretical results in each of the zzso The results in the work can readily be generalized to other zzso zzso
