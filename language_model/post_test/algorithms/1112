This report describes an zzso for identifying acceptable zzso zzso for highly zzso patients without the need for extensive serum zzso This zzso is based on the concept that zzso zzso are represented by zzso acid triplets on exposed parts of protein sequences of human zzso zzso chains zzso zzso and zzso accessible to zzso A computer program zzso has been developed to determine class I zzso zzso at the molecular zzso It makes zzso and zzso comparisons of zzso triplets in sequence positions to determine the spectrum of zzso triplets on donor zzso zzso In most cases is it possible to identify certain mismatched zzso zzso that share all their zzso triplets with the patient's zzso zzso and could therefore, be considered fully zzso zzso permits also the identification of additional zzso that are acceptable as determined from the zzso information on zzso panel cells that do not react with patient's zzso provides an assessment of zzso zzso zzso at the structural level and this zzso is different from conventional methods based on the mere counting of numbers of mismatched zzso zzso or zzso This donor selection strategy is suitable especially for zzso patients in need of a compatible transplant or zzso zzso
