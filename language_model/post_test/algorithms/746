We have developed an automated technique to accurately register the CT and zzso scans of the liver of patients treated with radioactive zzso for zzso targeting zzso An zzso phantom was used to validate the accuracy of the registration zzso The phantom liver and three zzso markers placed on its surface were filled with zzso The phantom was scanned with CT and zzso scanners in different zzso The liver volume was contoured on the CT scans from which a three-dimensional liver mask was zzso By constraining the liver volume to the volume obtained from the CT scans, another liver mask was automatically created from the zzso zzso An zzso simulated zzso zzso was used to minimize the difference between the two volumes formed by the two sets of zzso The zzso involved rigid transformation of the zzso mask to reach the zzso zzso The accuracy of the zzso was evaluated by the zzso of the zzso markers on the CT and zzso The registered zzso zzso on the CT scan of the phantom showed zzso of the zzso markers on CT and zzso images within 1 zzso The technique was applied to a patient image set who received the zzso infusion zzso The registered CT and zzso images of the patient showed that the majority of the activity was concentrated in the zzso indicating a successful zzso zzso
