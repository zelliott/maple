Many problems in computer vision can be formulated as a zzso problem for an energy zzso If this functional is given as an integral of a zzso weight function over an unknown zzso then the sought-after minimal surface can be determined as a solution of the zzso zzso zzso This paper deals with a general class of weight functions that may depend on surface point coordinates as well as surface zzso We derive the zzso equation in arbitrary zzso space without the need for any surface zzso zzso existing zzso Our work opens up the possibility of solving problems involving minimal zzso in a dimension higher than three, which were previously impossible to solve in zzso We also introduce two applications of our new zzso We show how to reconstruct temporally coherent geometry from multiple video streams, and we use the same framework for the zzso reconstruction of zzso and transparent natural phenomena, here bodies of flowing zzso
