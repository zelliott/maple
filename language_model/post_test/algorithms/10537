zzso for automatic pacing output adjustment have been implemented in zzso and zzso zzso zzso and recently in cardiac zzso therapy zzso zzso We assessed the impact and effectiveness of these automatic zzso 

We zzso enrolled patients successfully implanted with the following zzso zzso Concerto zzso automatic left zzso zzso output management zzso zzso zzso management of zzso right zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso manual zzso zzso Patients with complete device data available for at least 12 months were included in the zzso We zzso data from zzso patients zzso zzso 335 zzso 44 zzso During the first 6 months, the zzso pacing zzso underwent more frequent adjustments in Concerto zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso patients than in zzso zzso Similarly, RV and zzso zzso at 6 months differed from the zzso value more frequently in zzso zzso and zzso zzso than in zzso patients zzso and zzso both zzso zzso The zzso pulse zzso for Concerto and the zzso in the three chambers of zzso were significantly lower than the corresponding values programmed in zzso at 6 and 12 zzso The proportion of zzso interrogations involving manual zzso was 97 zzso zzso for zzso 79 zzso zzso for zzso and 56 zzso zzso for zzso (all zzso zzso 

zzso for the automatic management of the pacing output reduced pacing output in comparison with the standard manual management approach, with potential zzso of battery zzso Moreover, they reduced the need to manually zzso zzso suggesting the possibility to simplify zzso management and facilitate remote zzso
