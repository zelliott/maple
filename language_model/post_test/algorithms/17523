In this paper, we propose a novel approach for electron zzso resonance zzso mixture zzso analysis based on blind source separation zzso zzso zzso spectrum of a free radical is often superimposed by overlapping zzso of other zzso It is important and challenging to accurately identify and zzso the zzso zzso from such zzso In this study, an automated zzso method implementing independent component analysis is used to extract the components from mixed zzso zzso that contain overlapping components of different zzso zzso To apply this method, there is no requirement to know the component zzso or the number of components in zzso The method is applied to analyze free radical zzso zzso which are collected from standard chemical system, cultured cell zzso and ex zzso rat zzso by spin zzso zzso zzso zzso show that the zzso method proposed here is capable of identifying the component zzso zzso from zzso with unknown zzso The zzso technique can offer powerful aids in resolving spectral overlapping problems in general zzso zzso zzso
