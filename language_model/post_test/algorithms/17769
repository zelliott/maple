An zzso has been proposed for the detection of white coat hypertension among subjects with elevated blood pressure zzso on at least three clinic visits using home zzso monitoring zzso zzso and, if this is low, ambulatory zzso monitoring zzso zzso This study aims to test this strategy in zzso The proposed zzso was applied in 133 zzso subjects with elevated zzso assessed in a previous prospective study using repeated clinic, home and ambulatory zzso zzso The proportions of detected and missed cases of white coat hypertension and the diagnostic value of the zzso were zzso By applying the algorithm, 99 subjects zzso were found eligible for home zzso and 35 zzso for ambulatory zzso There were 38 subjects with white coat hypertension zzso of whom 15 zzso were not detected by the proposed zzso The sensitivity, zzso and the positive and negative zzso value of the zzso to diagnose white coat hypertension were 61, 81, 66 and zzso zzso Of the 34 subjects with normal zzso on the third clinic visit, 15 zzso had elevated home and/or ambulatory zzso These data suggest that, using the proposed strategy, many white coat zzso may remain zzso and may receive unnecessary long-term drug zzso zzso more research is needed on the optimal strategy for detecting white coat hypertension in clinical zzso
