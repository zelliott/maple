We present the design of a zzso zzso zzso zzso with flexible geometry dedicated to in zzso studies of small animals zzso The scanner uses two pairs of zzso Each detector consists of 400 small individual zzso aluminum zzso zzso zzso zzso of dimensions 2 zzso 2 zzso 15 zzso zzso isolated and glued together, which are coupled to zzso zzso tubes zzso The detector zzso can be moved in a zzso direction so that the zzso spacing can be zzso Special hardware has been built for coincidence zzso position zzso and real-time data zzso which is performed by a zzso The zzso data are transferred to zzso where the zzso distribution is zzso The dimensions of the zzso and the detector layout are the result of extensive simulations which are described in this report, taking into account sensitivity, spatial resolution and additional parameters like zzso error or scatter zzso For the three-dimensional zzso reconstruction a genuine 3-D zzso zzso which can include the characteristics of the detector system has been zzso The reconstruction software is flexible and matches the different detector zzso The main advantage of the proposed animal PET scanner is its high flexibility, allowing the realization of various zzso zzso By changing the zzso zzso the system is capable of either providing good spatial resolution or high sensitivity for dynamic studies of zzso
