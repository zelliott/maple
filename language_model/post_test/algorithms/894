zzso cancer is the most common tumor in zzso The most commonly used diagnostic and tumor recurrence marker is zzso zzso zzso zzso After surgical removal or radiation treatment, zzso levels drop zzso zzso and subsequent elevated or increased zzso levels are indicative of zzso disease zzso zzso For clinical follow-up and local care zzso zzso and recurrence is often hand calculated for patients, which can result in the application of zzso zzso For large zzso of prostate cancer patients used in clinical studies zzso zzso are used as surrogate measures of disease zzso In these zzso a method to measure zzso recurrence is needed for the subsequent analysis of outcomes data and as such need to be applied in a uniform and zzso zzso This method needs to be simple and zzso and based on known aspects of zzso zzso 

We have created a simple zzso zzso for the calculation of zzso zzso outcomes results based on the initial zzso and multiple zzso values obtained after zzso The zzso tracks the zzso zzso zzso and if present, subsequent zzso zzso Times to zzso recurrence or recurrence free intervals are supplied in zzso 

Use of the zzso is demonstrated with a sample zzso from prostate cancer zzso The results are compared with zzso zzso recurrence zzso The strengths and limitations are zzso 

The use of this simple zzso zzso allows for the standardized analysis of zzso recurrence in large zzso of patients who have undergone treatment for prostate zzso The script is freely available, and easily modifiable for desired user parameters and zzso
