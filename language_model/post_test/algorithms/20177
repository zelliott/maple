We present and analyze the behavior of an evolutionary zzso designed to estimate the parameters of a complex organ behavior zzso The model is adaptable to account for patient's zzso The aim is to finely tune the model to be accurately adapted to various real patient zzso It can then be embedded, for example, in high zzso simulations of the human zzso We present here an application focused on zzso zzso The zzso is automatic and zzso A compound fitness function has been designed to take into account for various quantities that have to be zzso The zzso efficiency is zzso analyzed on several real test zzso 1) three patient zzso have been acquired with the zzso zzso zzso and 2) two zzso zzso to zzso CT zzso Its performance is compared with two traditional methods zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a random search and a basic zzso genetic zzso The results show that our evolutionary scheme provides more significantly stable and accurate zzso
