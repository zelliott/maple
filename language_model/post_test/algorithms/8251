The different zzso abnormalities are secondary to the progressive loss of zzso mass and zzso function that leads to retention of zzso and a decrease in the levels of zzso which are responsible for the skeletal resistance to the action of zzso 

The main clinical manifestations of abnormal bone mineral metabolism are zzso osteoporosis and zzso producing an increase in fractures, zzso and bone zzso 

zzso parameters zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso X-ray bone zzso and bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It is recommended for the treatment and prevention of zzso - osteoporosis in transplant patients based on data from clinical evidence available from other study zzso such as in patients with chronic kidney zzso In addition to specific treatment, we must take into account the preventive measures to reduce the risk of zzso Treatment includes specific measures for the prevention of bone loss zzso zzso of vitamin D zzso and zzso and the treatment of persistent zzso zzso zzso zzso
