zzso accuracy for predicting zzso in whole blood was studied based on zzso zzso zzso wavelength regions, zzso and the influence of zzso were examined using partial zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso were measured from 98 whole blood zzso In order to study the influence of zzso which is the most dominant component in blood, 98 samples were arranged such that zzso and zzso zzso were distributed in their zzso zzso zzso were grouped into three depending on zzso zzso The results showed that zzso prediction was influenced by zzso zzso in the zzso zzso It was necessary for samples used in the zzso model to represent the entire range of zzso zzso The zzso errors were the smallest when the wavelength regions of zzso to 1888 zzso and zzso to zzso zzso were zzso However, prediction accuracy was not very dependent on zzso methods in this optimal zzso The standard error of zzso prediction was zzso zzso and the zzso of variation in prediction was zzso
