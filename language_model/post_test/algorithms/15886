zzso and novel long-range order restraints available from zzso systems have been used to determine the backbone solution structure of the zzso zzso protein to atomic resolution in the complete absence of restraints derived from the nuclear zzso zzso By exploiting the complementary geometric dependence of zzso zzso shifts and the recently proposed zzso cross correlated relaxation effect, in combination with zzso constraints derived from residual zzso zzso zzso rate ratios and secondary structure constraints, it is possible to define uniquely the fold and refine the zzso structure of the protein zzso A backbone zzso for zzso zzso acid zzso starting from random atomic Cartesian zzso The structure calculation zzso developed using specific models to describe the novel constraint zzso is zzso requiring no precise a zzso zzso of the various interaction strengths, and provides zzso convergence based only on the value of the target zzso zzso zzso and their component zzso are allowed to float zzso and are thus simultaneously determined, and found to zzso during the structure zzso
