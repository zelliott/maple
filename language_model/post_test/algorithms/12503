The quality of the data generated in a high zzso screening zzso run is fundamental for selecting bona fide zzso and for ensuring the capture of the full richness of zzso present in a chemical zzso For this purpose a quality control filter based on three one zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments is zzso The approach called zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso requires the acquisition of a zzso reference spectrum, a zzso spectrum and/or a selective zzso relaxation filter spectrum for the identified hits dissolved in zzso solution and in the presence of a water soluble reference zzso This palette of experiments permits the rapid characterization of the identity, zzso zzso and zzso state of the active zzso This knowledge is crucial for zzso accurate zzso and zzso values of the zzso for identifying false zzso and for detecting zzso zzso Only compounds that pass through the zzso zzso can be considered as starting points for medicinal chemistry efforts directed toward lead zzso Examples of this approach in the identification of false zzso in a screening run against the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the rescue of a false negative in a screening run against the zzso zzso zzso are zzso
