The purpose of this study was to determine the recovery period of basketball players after zzso zzso Thirteen male subjects, aged zzso years, took part in this zzso They performed an incremental zzso test using an zzso zzso bike zzso zzso zzso and gas exchange were assessed and measured by zzso method using zzso zzso card and Sensor zzso gas flow zzso Heart rate parameters were established during continuous zzso monitoring and analysis integrated zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso changes of heart rate, oxygen consumption, double rate product, respiratory quotient, and zzso equivalent were calculated or established by zzso application zzso A recovery was defined through such zzso zzso needed for zzso heart rate decreasing from heart rate zzso zzso needed for heart rate decreasing to 90 zzso zzso needed for zzso decreasing from a zzso double rate zzso zzso needed for zzso decreasing from zzso oxygen zzso zzso needed for zzso decreasing from peak respiratory zzso zzso needed for respiratory zzso zzso to zzso - to a standard zzso Full recovery after zzso load was too long and completed during 1200 zzso but some processes were completed earlier zzso acid zzso within 95 zzso oxygen requirement within zzso zzso and zzso of heart action within 730 zzso Further research is needed to explain this zzso of zzso
