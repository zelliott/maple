The zzso cube is a next-generation zzso detector for PET that we are developing to offer higher resolution and higher sensitivity than is available with present zzso It is constructed from a cubic monolithic zzso crystal and silicon zzso which are coupled on various positions of the six surfaces of the zzso A zzso technique is applied to produce zzso optical boundaries composed of zzso inside the monolithic zzso zzso The current zzso is based on an empirical trial of a zzso zzso There is room to improve the spatial resolution by zzso the setting of the zzso zzso In fact, the zzso technique has high freedom in setting the parameters of the boundary such as size, pitch, and zzso Computer simulation can effectively zzso such zzso In this study, to design optical characteristics properly for the zzso zzso we developed a zzso Carlo simulator which can model arbitrary arrangements of zzso optical boundaries zzso The optical characteristics of the zzso were measured by use of a setup with a laser and a zzso and then modeled in the zzso The accuracy of the simulator was confirmed by comparison of position zzso obtained from the simulation and from experiments with a zzso detector composed of a cubic zzso monolithic crystal with zzso segments and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the simulator was accelerated by parallel computing with zzso computing on a graphics processing zzso The calculation speed was about 400 times faster than that with a zzso
