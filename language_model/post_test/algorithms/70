In this work a method for considerably improving the zzso ratio zzso in zzso maps based on the variable flip angle approach is proposed, employing zzso fast low angle shot zzso zzso imaging zzso hybrid sequences with two echoes per zzso In phantom zzso it could be verified that the zzso improvement in the underlying images translated into an zzso increase in the zzso maps exceeding theoretical zzso Even a hybrid sequence with an zzso shorter measurement time than a standard zzso zzso with identical spatial coverage and resolution yielded an zzso gain of zzso in the resulting zzso zzso zzso sequences with either identical measurement time zzso zzso or bandwidth zzso zzso yielded gains of zzso and zzso zzso These results could be confirmed by zzso on four healthy zzso The image quality of zzso maps based on hybrid sequences was excellent and the zzso improvement was clearly zzso The measured zzso gains in zzso maps were between zzso zzso zzso white zzso and zzso zzso with identical zzso gray zzso The resulting zzso values were comparable, with a slight tendency toward higher values in the hybrid zzso In zzso without zzso experiment zzso the method proposed yields zzso gains that are commonly achieved by acquiring two zzso
