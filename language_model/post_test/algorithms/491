zzso is a secondary protein structure type that plays an important role in protein zzso and zzso Here, we introduced an approach of zzso prediction that used the support zzso machine zzso zzso combined with predicted secondary structure zzso The secondary structure information was obtained by using zzso a new secondary protein structure prediction zzso A zzso cross validation based on the benchmark zzso of zzso zzso protein chains was used to evaluate the performance of our zzso The prediction results broke the zzso Q zzso barrier and achieved Q zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Q zzso higher zzso when compared with the best zzso The results in our research are zzso with the conclusion that zzso prediction accuracy can be improved by inclusion of secondary structure zzso
