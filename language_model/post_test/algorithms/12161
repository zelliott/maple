This paper proposes a new zzso zzso system using zzso fusion of hand shape and palm zzso The proposed combination is of significance since both the zzso and zzso images are proposed to be extracted from the single hand image acquired from a digital zzso Several new zzso features that can be used to represent the hand shape and improve the performance are zzso The new approach for zzso recognition using discrete zzso transform zzso which can be directly obtained from the camera hardware, is zzso None of the prior work on zzso or zzso recognition has given any attention on the critical issue of feature zzso Our experimental results demonstrate that while majority of zzso or zzso features are useful in predicting the subjects identity, only a small subset of these features are necessary in practice for building an accurate model for zzso The comparison and combination of proposed features is evaluated on the diverse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso estimated, zzso decision trees zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Although more work remains to be done, our results to date indicate that the combination of selected zzso and zzso features constitutes a promising addition to the zzso personal recognition zzso
