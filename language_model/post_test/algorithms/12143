zzso of images and shapes has long been the central theme of computer zzso Its importance is increasing rapidly in the field of computer graphics and multimedia communication because it is difficult to process information efficiently without its zzso In this paper, we propose a new approach for object matching based on a global zzso zzso The key idea behind our methodology is to represent an object by a zzso shape zzso that measures the global zzso distance between two arbitrary points on the surface of an zzso In contrast to the zzso distance which is more suitable for linear spaces, the zzso distance has the advantage to be able to capture the intrinsic geometric structure of the zzso The matching task therefore becomes a one-dimensional comparison problem between probability zzso which is clearly much simpler than comparing three-dimensional zzso Object matching can then be carried out by an zzso zzso measure calculations between zzso shape zzso and is additionally zzso efficient and zzso
