The most critical step in zzso medical image retrieval systems is feature zzso zzso the zzso between the characteristics of zzso images and corresponding imaging features is crucial for image training, as well as for features zzso A zzso zzso is developed based on different imaging properties of zzso and on the zzso in density between the zzso and their surrounding normal liver zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso includes mainly two zzso zzso distance zzso which is used to divide the zzso into distinct regions and represents the spatial structure distribution and zzso representation using bag of visual words zzso based on zzso The evaluation of this system based on the proposed feature extraction zzso shows excellent retrieval results for three types of liver zzso visible on zzso scans CT zzso The results of the proposed feature extraction zzso show that although zzso scans achieve the average precision of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso scans achieve zzso and zzso
