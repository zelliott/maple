In order to explore the potential of zzso zzso in the treatment of head and neck zzso zzso a planning study comparing our routinely delivered zzso technique zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso against two different zzso planning approaches was zzso 

In the first zzso plan zzso we merely applied the same constraints used for the zzso zzso in the second one zzso we tried to stress the sparing of zzso and zzso while keeping zzso coverage and spinal zzso zzso similar to their values in the zzso zzso Five patients with locally advanced zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cancer were zzso For each patient, zzso including neck zzso and the zzso was defined and was expanded with a margin of zzso zzso zzso then, zzso including high risk zzso and zzso including only T were defined and the corresponding zzso were defined by a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso planning were zzso to deliver 54 zzso in 30 zzso on zzso and zzso zzso in 9 zzso on zzso in the case a zzso was zzso 15 zzso were zzso delivered while delivering zzso zzso on zzso zzso plans for the two zzso zzso 1: first 30 zzso Phase zzso last 9 zzso were compared in terms of zzso zzso zzso and dose statistics on zzso and zzso 

When considering Phase 1, zzso improved the zzso of the dose distribution within zzso while delivering the same prescribed dose zzso to be the median dose to zzso the fraction of zzso receiving more than zzso of the prescribed dose zzso increased from zzso zzso to zzso for zzso zzso zzso within zzso decreased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Spinal zzso zzso decreased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso No attempts to further reduce spinal zzso zzso were zzso Mean dose to the zzso decreased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly better spared with zzso mean dose decreased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso When considering phase 2, the average gains zzso vs zzso were more modest and depended on the location of zzso 

zzso findings obtained in a sequential approach for zzso suggest that zzso has the potential to significantly improve the therapeutic ratio with respect to a conventional zzso delivery zzso
