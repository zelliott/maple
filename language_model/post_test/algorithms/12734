A first demonstration of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso oxide zzso addressing its strong electronic zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso band is zzso The zzso was constructed around a fully zzso laser system producing zzso powers of ultraviolet light targeting the overlapping zzso and zzso transitions at zzso zzso The work verifies a new zzso model of zzso addressing the electronic transitions in NO given in an accompanying zzso Although the experimental zzso could address neither the zzso space of the theory nor the optimum conditions, the line shapes and the pressure dependence could be verified under zzso zzso NO could be detected down to a partial pressure of 13 zzso roughly corresponding to 10 zzso for an atmospheric pressure sample, which demonstrates the feasibility of zzso for sensitive detection of NO addressing its strong electronic zzso
