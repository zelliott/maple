The zzso of a bent rod may be defined in several different, but equivalent zzso The best way of describing the zzso of zzso DNA is by an angle of turning per base zzso zzso comes mainly from the angle of roll between successive zzso and this is defined as positive when the angle opens up on the minor groove side of the zzso DNA forms a plane curve if the roll angle values along the zzso alternate periodically between positive and negative, with a complete period equal to the zzso zzso It is known from studies of zzso zzso that the roll angles for particular zzso steps have preferred values, or lie in preferred ranges of zzso Therefore the formation of a plane curve will be easier with some base sequences of DNA than with zzso We set up a computer zzso for determining the ease with which DNA of given sequence will adopt a curved zzso The zzso has two different sets of zzso in model 1 the base step parameters come from an inspection of zzso zzso and in model 2 data from a statistical survey of the zzso of zzso steps in a large number of samples of chicken zzso core DNA is zzso Both forms of the zzso successfully locate the zzso of the zzso sequence zzso 10) in a zzso zzso and suggest strongly that zzso zzso properties of DNA play a part in the recognition of binding sites by zzso zzso
