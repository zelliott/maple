zzso gene regulatory networks from expression data is difficult, but it is common and often zzso Most network problems are zzso are more parameters than data zzso therefore data or zzso set reduction is often zzso zzso between variables in the model also contributes to confound network zzso zzso In this paper, we present an zzso that uses zzso zzso zzso to ease the problems of zzso and correlated variables within a fully zzso zzso Specifically, ours is a dynamic zzso network with integrated zzso mixture zzso which we fit using zzso zzso zzso We show, using public, simulated zzso data sets from the zzso zzso that our zzso zzso zzso methods in many cases (7 out of 25) with fewer samples, rarely underperforming (1 out of zzso and often selects a zzso model if it better describes the zzso zzso code zzso zzso for zzso zzso Over Networks zzso and sample data are available at: zzso
