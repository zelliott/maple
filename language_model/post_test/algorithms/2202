An automated zzso zzso based on mutual information metric zzso as a mapping cost function is zzso Mutual information zzso is calculated from a two-dimensional zzso gray scale zzso of an image pair, and zzso zzso zzso provides a matching cost function which can be effective in registration of two- or three-dimensional data sets independent of zzso Most zzso image data, though information rich and high resolution, present zzso zzso due to the zzso zzso and need zzso into zzso volumes prior to geometric mapping to an anatomical volume for spatial zzso Section alignment via automatic zzso registrations employing zzso as a global cost function and zzso zzso zzso is applied to zzso zzso image slices of a rat brain with video reference images of the zzso block face to zzso a cerebral zzso zzso volume zzso Unlike the traditional zzso zzso zzso zzso initial control points are defined independently from feature zzso Registration quality using automated zzso image zzso is validated by comparing zzso of the image pair registered by automated zzso registration and manual zzso zzso The zzso proves to be a robust objective matching cost function effective for automatic zzso zzso for zzso data sets and can be readily applied to volume zzso
