As a major indicator of lake zzso that is harmful to human health, the zzso concentration zzso is often estimated using remote zzso and one method often used is the spectral zzso zzso zzso zzso processing may magnify the noise, thus making spectral smoothing zzso This study aims to use spectral smoothing as a zzso and to test the zzso of the spectral zzso zzso for zzso zzso in zzso Lake, China, based on the in zzso zzso zzso Data from zzso of 2004 were used to build the model, and data from zzso of 2005 and March of 2011 were used to validate the model, with zzso ranges of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso model was first used and then compared with the band ratio, zzso and zzso zzso The results show that the zzso zzso model at zzso zzso had satisfactory accuracy zzso zzso zzso after kernel zzso smoothing and had smaller validation root mean square errors of zzso zzso in 2005 and zzso zzso in zzso The distribution map of zzso in zzso Lake based on the zzso image showed the actual distribution trend, indicating that the zzso zzso model after spectral smoothing can be used for zzso zzso in zzso zzso
