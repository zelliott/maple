More than 200 open reading frames zzso from the human zzso zzso have been reported as potentially coding for zzso We have used two zzso in zzso approaches to analyze this set of putative viral zzso With the help of an objective zzso method that is based on the zzso a comprehensive collection of zzso acid patterns that describes the currently known natural sequence space of zzso we have zzso all of the previously reported putative genes of the human zzso Also, with the help of zzso a zzso multiple sequence alignment algorithm, we have zzso the original human zzso gene family zzso Our analysis of the zzso shows that many of the coded proteins comprise zzso acid combinations that are unique to either the human zzso or the larger group of zzso We have confirmed that a surprisingly large portion of the analyzed zzso zzso membrane zzso and we have discovered a significant number of previously zzso proteins that are predicted to be zzso zzso zzso The analysis also indicates that many of the zzso proteins undergo zzso modifications such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins with similar functional behavior appear in neighboring regions of the human zzso zzso All of the results of the present study can be found and zzso explored online zzso
