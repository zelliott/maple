In many wireless sensor network applications, the possibility of exceptions occurring is relatively small, so in a normal situation, data obtained at sequential time points by the same zzso are time zzso while, spatial correlation may exist in data obtained at the same time by adjacent zzso A great deal of zzso energy will be wasted if data which include time and space correlation is zzso zzso this paper proposes a data zzso zzso for wireless sensor networks based on optimal order zzso and distributed zzso zzso can obtain correlation parameters based on optimal order zzso by exploring time and space zzso included in data which is obtained by zzso Then the sink restores all data based on time and space correlation parameters and only a little necessary data needs to be transmitted by zzso Because of the decrease of zzso the average energy cost per zzso will be reduced and the life of the wireless sensor network will obviously be extended as a zzso
