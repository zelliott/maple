We have developed a sparse mathematical representation of speech that zzso the number of active model zzso needed to represent typical speech zzso The model learns several well-known acoustic features of speech such as harmonic zzso zzso zzso and zzso but we also find more exotic structures in the zzso representation of sound such as localized zzso patterns and zzso zzso zzso flanked by zzso zzso Moreover, several of these novel features resemble zzso receptive fields reported in the zzso zzso zzso as well as auditory zzso and cortex, and our model zzso exhibit the same zzso in zzso resolution as has been observed in zzso To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that receptive fields of zzso in the ascending zzso auditory zzso beyond the auditory nerve can be predicted based on coding principles and the statistical properties of recorded zzso
