The software commonly used for assembly of shotgun sequence data has several zzso One such limitation becomes obvious when repetitive sequences are zzso zzso assembly is a difficult task, even for zzso regions, but the use of quality assessments of the data and efficient matching zzso have made it possible to assemble most sequences zzso In the case of highly repetitive zzso however, these zzso fail to distinguish between sequencing errors and single base differences in regions containing nearly identical zzso None of the currently available zzso assembly programs are able to correctly assemble highly similar repetitive data, and we, therefore, present a novel shotgun assembly program, zzso Repeat Assembly Program zzso The main feature of this program is the ability to separate long repetitive regions from each other by distinguishing single base zzso as well as zzso from sequencing zzso This is accomplished by using a novel zzso based analysis zzso Since repeats are a common complication in most sequencing projects, this software should be of use for the whole sequencing zzso
