zzso association studies are a powerful tool to detect genetic zzso that zzso to human zzso Once an associated zzso is identified, investigators are also interested in zzso the effect of the identified zzso on disease zzso Estimates of the genetic effect based on new association findings tend to be zzso biased due to a phenomenon known as the zzso zzso zzso of genetic effect size in initial studies may cause follow-up studies to be zzso and so to zzso In this paper, we zzso the impact of the winner's curse on the zzso frequency difference and odds ratio zzso for one- and zzso zzso association zzso We then propose an zzso maximum likelihood method to reduce the bias of these zzso We show that zzso of the genetic effect by the zzso zzso decreases as the power of the association study increases and that the zzso method reduces absolute bias and mean square error unless power to detect association is zzso
