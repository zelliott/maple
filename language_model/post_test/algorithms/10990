To zzso evaluate the usefulness of a newly developed high-resolution three-dimensional zzso imaging method, zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso in diagnosing zzso zzso by comparing it to conventional zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso 

Institutional review board approval and informed consent from all participants were zzso We studied 30 patients with preoperatively suspected acquired zzso Each patient underwent an MR examination including both zzso zzso and zzso using a zzso T MR zzso Images of the 30 patients zzso zzso bones including 30 with and 30 without zzso were reviewed by two independent zzso The confidence level for the presence of zzso was graded on a scale of 0-2 zzso absence, zzso zzso zzso zzso agreement as well as sensitivity, zzso and accuracy for detection were assessed for the two zzso 

Excellent zzso agreement was shown for zzso zzso whereas fair agreement was obtained for zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with significantly higher sensitivity zzso and accuracy zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No significant difference was found in specificity zzso for zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso With increased spatial resolution and reduced zzso artifacts, zzso improves the accuracy in diagnosing acquired middle ear zzso compared to zzso zzso
