Identification on protein folding types is always based on the zzso folds zzso which was provided by zzso & zzso in zzso But with the avalanche of protein zzso fold data is also zzso so it will be the inevitable trend to improve the existing zzso and expand more folding zzso In this paper, we construct a zzso protein fold zzso which contains zzso protein chains with sequence identity below zzso and could be classified into 76 fold zzso It was 4 times larger than zzso & zzso zzso Furthermore, our work proposes a novel approach of support zzso machine based on optimal zzso By combining motif frequency, zzso power spectral density, zzso acid zzso the predicted secondary structure and the values of zzso function as feature parameters set, the method adopts criterion of the maximum correlation and the minimum zzso to filter these features and obtain a zzso optimal feature zzso Based on the ensemble zzso strategy, with zzso optimal feature as input parameters of support zzso machine, we identify the zzso protein folds and overall accuracy measures up to zzso by independent zzso In addition, this method has been further used to identify upgraded zzso protein zzso overall accuracy achieves zzso At last, we also test our method on zzso & zzso zzso folds zzso and obtained better identification results than most of the previous reported zzso
