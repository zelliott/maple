The purpose of this study was to determine the importance of model and zzso angle sequence for calculating zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso often show a significant lateral zzso and large trunk rotation over the gait zzso The zzso pattern and zzso of these zzso are important for clinical zzso Two common zzso models and two orders of rotation in calculating the zzso zzso are zzso 

zzso zzso in eight zzso patients were studied zzso Four markers were placed on the trunk in addition to the lower limb zzso Each child walked at a self-selected speed over the walkway in bare zzso The spatial position and orientation of each segment were zzso from the marker position at zzso of the gait zzso zzso angles for two zzso models were calculated using two different orders of rotation with respect to both the laboratory and the pelvic reference zzso 

The results showed that differences between models in the zzso and zzso planes were greater than in the zzso zzso The changes in the zzso technique yielded the greatest differences when comparing between zzso 

Clinical significant differences were found between changes in different zzso models and between the sequences of rotation for subjects with pathological zzso zzso This clearly indicates that existing zzso models based on indirect marker placement may give misleading zzso zzso Different rotation sequences also lead to different results and an analysis of these suggests that the conventional sequence zzso lateral bending, zzso zzso is preferable for the zzso 

zzso measurement of zzso motion will enhance our understanding of both the pathological and zzso mechanism in the gait pattern of children with zzso Furthermore, the current investigation on zzso zzso will lead to calculation of the motion of the center of mass and future methodology to calculate zzso zzso
