We present an extension of the random walker zzso to images with uncertain gray zzso Such zzso uncertainty may result from noise or other imaging artifacts or more general from measurement errors in the image acquisition zzso The purpose is to zzso the influence of the zzso uncertainty onto the result when using random walker zzso In random walker zzso a weighted graph is built from the image, where the edge weights depend on the image zzso between the zzso For given seed regions, the probability is evaluated for a random walk on this graph starting at a zzso to end in one of the seed zzso Here, we extend this method to images with uncertain gray zzso To this end, we consider the zzso values to be random variables zzso thus introducing the notion of zzso zzso We end up with zzso weights for the graph in random walker zzso and a zzso partial differential equation zzso that has to be zzso We zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso by the method of generalized zzso chaos, combining the recent developments in zzso methods for the zzso of zzso zzso and an interactive zzso zzso The resulting zzso allows for the detection of regions where the zzso result is highly influenced by the uncertain zzso zzso Thus, it gives a reliability estimate for the resulting zzso and it zzso allows determining the probability density function of the segmented object zzso
