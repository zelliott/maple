Good statistical models for analyzing and simulating zzso zzso data exist but are not accessible to many biologists because their use requires reasonably sophisticated mathematical and zzso zzso While some labs have direct access to zzso or programmers competent to carry out such zzso many labs do zzso We have created a platform independent application with an zzso zzso user interface that will carry out such analyses including the simulations needed to zzso confidence intervals for the parameters of zzso This software should make zzso techniques accessible to labs that previously relied on less powerful and potentially statistically zzso single zzso or double zzso zzso 

We introduce zzso an zzso with a zzso zzso interface incorporating previously developed zzso for the analysis and simulation of zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate the use and features of the program with an example of zzso zzso data from the mustard plant, zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso provides easy access to the powerful and appropriate statistical tools for the zzso analysis of genetic zzso
