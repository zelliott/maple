zzso zzso zzso cells express zzso zzso channels which have a high zzso zzso These channels are thought to have an important role in the zzso of zzso zzso The possible relationship between these channels and the zzso zzso channel was investigated in the present zzso zzso using specific zzso zzso amplified a zzso zzso zzso of zzso from rat zzso zzso which was 99 % identical to the zzso sequence of rat zzso A 2005 zzso clone was isolated from a rat zzso zzso zzso library using a probe for zzso The clone showed greater than 99 % identity with the sequence of rat zzso zzso zzso channels were observed in zzso recordings of zzso zzso zzso cells isolated from zzso zzso zzso The mean inward zzso was zzso plus minus zzso zzso zzso zzso 8) in controls (3 zzso zzso and zzso plus minus zzso zzso zzso zzso 10) in three zzso zzso The relative zzso of the zzso to zzso and zzso zzso : zzso was zzso zzso was more zzso than zzso in both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) and zzso animals zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that rat zzso zzso expresses the zzso zzso that was originally reported in other zzso zzso does not contribute significantly to zzso zzso zzso in mouse zzso zzso which must therefore express a novel zzso zzso zzso
