Health status has evolved as a clinical outcome measure that is of great interest in medical zzso However, there is still debate about the appropriateness of scoring zzso for the often used short form zzso zzso our aim was to evaluate the consequences of the traditional scoring procedure based on zzso factor rotation for clinical applications by zzso re-evaluating the results of zzso controlled trials zzso on the effectiveness of zzso in improving health status in cardiac patients and zzso comparing empirical evidence on depression and health status using zzso and zzso factor rotation zzso scoring zzso in a community sample and a heart failure zzso zzso 

This is a systematic literature review and zzso analysis among zzso community sample participants and 282 zzso zzso 

zzso rotation artificially forces the mental component summary zzso and physical component summary zzso to be zzso which is illustrated in two of the three included zzso Two zzso showed improvements in zzso but no improvement in zzso over zzso zzso analysis in the two zzso showed that employing the alternative scoring zzso resulted in higher negative correlations of zzso and zzso with depression, and a gradual decline in zzso with each zzso of decline in zzso 

Our data showed that appropriate zzso is needed when calculating and interpreting summary zzso The traditional scoring zzso seems inappropriate to zzso evaluate the effects of interventions on both the zzso and the zzso Awareness in the design and evaluation of interventions using these outcomes is zzso
