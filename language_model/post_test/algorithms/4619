This paper considers the issues of scheduling and zzso zzso data in zzso interactive browsing applications, under memory and channel bandwidth zzso It analyzes how the conveyed data have to be selected at the server and managed within the client zzso so as to maximize the zzso of the browsing zzso zzso to render the dynamic nature of the browsing session, we assume the existence of a reaction model that defines when the user zzso a novel command as a function of the image quality displayed at the zzso As a main outcome, our work demonstrates that, due to the zzso inherent to zzso exchanges, a zzso expectation about future navigation commands may help to improve the overall zzso of the zzso In our study, the browsing session is defined by the evolution of a zzso window of interest zzso along the zzso At any given time, the zzso defines the position and the resolution of the image data to display at the zzso The expectation about future navigation commands is then zzso based on a zzso navigation model, which defines the probability that a given zzso is requested next, knowing previous zzso zzso Based on that knowledge, several scheduling scenarios are zzso The first scenario is conventional and zzso all the data corresponding to the current zzso before zzso the most promising data outside the current zzso Alternative scenarios are then proposed to anticipate zzso by scheduling data expected to be requested in the future before all the current zzso data have been sent zzso Our results demonstrate that, for predictable navigation commands, anticipated zzso improves the overall zzso of the system by up to zzso compared to the conventional scheduling zzso They also reveal that an accurate knowledge of the reaction model is not required to get these significant zzso
