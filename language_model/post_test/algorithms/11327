zzso substitution is a promising technique for zzso the loss of a sensory zzso zzso substitution devices zzso work by converting information from the impaired sense zzso zzso into another, intact sense zzso zzso However, there are a potentially infinite number of ways of converting images into sounds, and it is important that the conversion takes into account the limits of human perception and other zzso factors zzso whether the sounds are pleasant to listen zzso The device explored here is termed zzso because it generates a very large set of zzso Specifically, we adapt a procedure that has been in widespread use in the design of technology but has rarely been used as a tool to explore zzso interactive genetic zzso In this zzso a very large range of potential sensory substitution devices can be explored by creating a set of zzso with different zzso zzso zzso different ways of translating zzso into zzso The most successful devices are then zzso together, and we statistically explore the characteristics of the zzso traits after multiple zzso The aim of the present study is to produce design guidelines for a better zzso In three experiments, we vary the way that the fitness of the device is zzso by asking the user to rate the auditory aesthetics of different devices zzso 1), and by measuring the ability of participants to match sounds to images zzso 2) and the ability to zzso discriminate between two sounds derived from similar images zzso zzso In each case, the traits selected for by the genetic zzso represent the ideal zzso for that zzso Taken together, these traits can guide the design of a better zzso
