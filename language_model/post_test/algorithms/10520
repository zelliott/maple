In recent years, both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been engineered and selected for the targeting of desired human zzso for gene zzso However, zzso engineering is lengthy and expensive and the zzso effect of the manufactured zzso is difficult to zzso Moreover, zzso selected to cleave a human DNA locus may not cleave the zzso locus in the zzso of animal models because of sequence zzso thus zzso attempts to assess the in zzso efficacy and safety of any engineered zzso prior to its application in human zzso Here, we show that naturally occurring zzso can be found, that cleave desirable human zzso Some of these zzso are also shown to cleave the zzso sequence in the zzso of animal zzso In addition, the distribution of zzso effects may be more predictable for native zzso Based on our experimental zzso we present the zzso algorithm, database and web server that allow a zzso zzso search and assignment of zzso for the targeting of specific zzso in the human and other zzso We validate zzso the predicted target specificity of candidate zzso bacterial and zzso zzso using cell free, zzso and zzso zzso
