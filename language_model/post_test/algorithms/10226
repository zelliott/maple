zzso is a zzso measure of health developed to estimate utility values from the zzso The aim of this study was to estimate a weighting system for the zzso health states representing the preferences of a sample of the Southern Brazilian general zzso 

A sample of 248 health states defined by the zzso was valued by a sample of the southern Brazilian population using the standard zzso Mean and individual level zzso zzso models were fitted to the standard gamble valuation data to estimate preference weights for all zzso health zzso The models were compared with those estimated in the UK zzso 

Five hundred zzso participants were zzso but 58 zzso were excluded for failing to value the worst zzso Data from 469 subjects producing zzso health states valuations were used in the zzso zzso In contrast to the best performing model for the UK data, the best performing model for the Brazilian data was a random effects model using only the main effects zzso highlighting the importance of adopting a zzso zzso to derive zzso health states zzso zzso zzso were merged to produce the final recommended model, which has all significant zzso and a mean absolute difference between observed and predicted standard gamble values of zzso 

The results provide the first zzso value set for Brazil for zzso health states, making it possible to generate zzso life years for zzso studies using regional zzso Besides, utility weights derived using the preferences of a sample from a southern Brazilian population can be derived from existing zzso data zzso
