Previous analysis of the firing of individual rat zzso place cells has shown that their firing rate increases when they enter a place field and that their phase of firing relative to the ongoing zzso zzso zzso zzso varies systematically as the rat zzso the place field, a phenomenon termed the zzso phase zzso To study the relative contribution of zzso and zzso information, we reconstructed the zzso position on a linear track using spikes recorded simultaneously from 38 zzso zzso Two previous studies of this kind found no evidence that phase information substantially improves reconstruction zzso We have found that reconstruction is improved provided epochs with large, systematic errors are first zzso With this condition, use of both phase and rate information improves the reconstruction accuracy by zzso as compared with the use of rate information zzso Furthermore, it becomes possible to predict the zzso position on a zzso track with very high accuracy zzso of zzso zzso The best reconstructions were obtained with more than three phase divisions per zzso zzso These results strengthen the hypothesis that information in rat zzso place cells is zzso by the phase of zzso at which cells zzso
