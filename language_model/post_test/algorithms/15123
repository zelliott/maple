Here we propose a novel method for rapidly identifying proteins in complex zzso A list of candidate proteins (including provision for zzso zzso is obtained by database searching, within a specified mass range about the accurately measured mass zzso zzso zzso Da at 10 zzso of the intact zzso by zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso transform zzso zzso resonance mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On alternate scans, zzso zzso infrared zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso yields mostly b and y zzso zzso for each zzso from which the correct candidate is identified as the one with the highest zzso score zzso most b and y fragments matching the candidate database protein zzso acid sequence zzso and sequence zzso score (based on a series of zzso sequences differing in mass by 1 or 2 zzso zzso The method succeeds in uniquely identifying each of a mixture of five proteins treated as unknowns zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from more than 1000 possible database candidates within a zzso 500 Da mass zzso We are also able to identify zzso modifications of two of the proteins zzso and zzso The method is simple, zzso and definitive and is zzso to a mixture of zzso zzso to identify proteins with a common biological zzso
