To investigate the impact of an zzso statistical zzso reconstruction zzso zzso on diagnostic accuracy and confidence for the diagnosis of zzso liver zzso as well as the reader's perception of image quality, using a low tube zzso zzso zzso high tube current zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Forty patients (29 men, 11 zzso with 65 zzso liver zzso underwent dual energy zzso The 80 zzso set of the dual energy acquisition was reconstructed with standard filtered zzso zzso and zzso at different blending zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso reader's confidence for zzso detection and zzso and reader's evaluation of image quality were zzso 

zzso yielded significantly higher zzso values compared with zzso zzso for all zzso Reader's perception of zzso zzso and confidence in the diagnosis of zzso were also higher with 60 % and 80 % zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso yielded nearly significantly lower specificity for zzso detection and a substantial decrease in the reader's perception of image zzso 

Compared with the standard zzso algorithm, zzso significantly improves zzso of zzso liver zzso This improvement may come at the cost of decreased specificity and reader's perception of image zzso
