A time-consuming component of zzso zzso is the dose zzso required in each iteration for the evaluation of the objective zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Carlo zzso dose calculations are currently considered too time-consuming for zzso zzso dose zzso Thus, fast, but less accurate zzso such as pencil beam zzso zzso are typically used in most current zzso zzso This paper describes two hybrid methods that zzso the speed of fast zzso zzso yet achieve the accuracy of zzso based upon SC zzso via the application of dose correction zzso In one method, the ratio method, an infrequently zzso zzso dose ratio zzso (R zzso zzso is applied for each beam to the dose zzso calculated with the zzso method during the zzso That is, zzso zzso R is used for the dose calculation during the zzso The zzso proceeds until both the zzso beam zzso and the dose correction ratio zzso zzso In the second method, the correction method, a periodically zzso zzso correction zzso for each zzso defined to be the difference between the SC and zzso dose zzso is used to correct zzso dose zzso To validate the methods, zzso treatment plans developed with the hybrid methods are compared with those obtained when the SC zzso is used for all zzso zzso and with those obtained when zzso zzso is followed by zzso zzso In the 12 patient cases zzso no clinically significant differences exist in the final treatment plans developed with each of the dose zzso zzso However, the number of time-consuming SC zzso is reduced from zzso for pure SC zzso to four or less for the ratio zzso method and five or less for the correction zzso Because the zzso zzso is faster at computing dose, this reduces the inverse planning zzso time for our zzso by a factor of 2 to 8 compared with pure SC zzso without compromising the quality or accuracy of the final treatment zzso
