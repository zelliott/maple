Principal zzso are extensions of Principal zzso Analysis and are smooth curves, which pass through the middle of a data zzso We extend the method so that, on pairs of data sets which have underlying zzso zzso we have pairs of zzso which go through the zzso of data sets in such a way that the zzso correlations between the data sets are zzso The core of the method is to zzso average the current local projections of the data points which produces an increasingly zzso set of zzso The zzso Principal zzso are generated in three ways: by joining up the zzso in order, by performing Local zzso zzso Analysis and by performing Local zzso zzso Analysis zzso et zzso zzso The latter two are shown to improve the forecasting capability of the method but at an increased zzso zzso We show that it is crucial to terminate the zzso after a small number of zzso for the first method and investigate several criteria for doing zzso
