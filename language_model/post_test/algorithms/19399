Current studies conclude that clinical decision support systems can help reduce serious medical zzso The importance of zzso zzso Networks zzso for constructing such systems is already zzso However, the zzso complexity of zzso zzso which results in unacceptably high response times, can hinder acceptance and integration into zzso zzso This paper investigates the zzso and zzso potential of complex zzso medical decision support systems and evaluates the results of implementing a zzso high performance version of an existing decision support system concerning proper zzso treatment zzso Furthermore, it discusses distributed computing techniques for making multiple high performance decision support systems available at the time and location of decision making, by exploiting computing resources residing inside, as well as outside the hospital walls zzso
