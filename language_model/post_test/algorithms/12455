zzso scientists have developed zzso inspired by natural evolution for at least 50 zzso These zzso solve zzso and design problems by building solutions that are 'more zzso relative to desired zzso However, the basic assumptions of this approach are zzso We propose a research zzso to develop a new field: zzso zzso This approach will produce zzso that are based on current understanding of molecular and evolutionary biology and could solve previously unimaginable or intractable zzso and biological zzso
