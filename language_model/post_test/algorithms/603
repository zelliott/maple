MR zzso techniques provide a method for zzso studying white matter pathways in zzso In this study we have used diffusion zzso imaging zzso and the fast marching zzso zzso zzso to plot the structural connectivity of the human zzso zzso zzso in 10 healthy subjects, using seed points selected in the anterior zzso zzso Our results demonstrate connectivity between the zzso zzso and the anterior zzso zzso zzso areas, zzso zzso lobe and zzso zzso lobe via the zzso and zzso zzso We also demonstrate for the first time zzso direct connectivity between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso These results agree with previous zzso zzso studies in zzso The connections demonstrated between zzso areas and the zzso via the zzso zzso may provide the structural basis for theoretical models of memory and higher visual zzso
