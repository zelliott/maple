zzso to detect the stage of gestation where zzso changes of the zzso fluctuations may occur, we assessed short-term fluctuations of low risk pregnant zzso zzso six, zzso zzso recordings were collected along gestation (7 to 39 zzso zzso zzso fluctuations series were zzso to obtain the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Four groups covering first, second and last trimesters of gestation were zzso No significant changes in zzso which was close to unit, and zzso among zzso groups were zzso But, in accordance with previous findings, we did find a significant reduction of zzso along zzso and significant short-term changes that indicate a higher degree of zzso after about 26 weeks of gestation zzso These results suggest that the short-term heart rate dynamics of low risk pregnant women do not become compromised during zzso despite the increased zzso demands and other ongoing zzso Yet the complexity of the mechanisms involved in the cardiac regulation of pregnant women does seem to increase from zzso possibly zzso to new short-term control influences or to modifications regardless the strength of the regulatory zzso
