The transition of insulin between its zzso defined states T and R is connected with considerable change even of backbone zzso the zzso B chain zzso zzso zzso from extended zzso in T into zzso in zzso and vice zzso Although zzso observed only in zzso the transition of the zzso was adequate for developing and testing the method of zzso energy zzso zzso capable of coping with zzso changes of such extent at moderate zzso zzso The simulation is performed in a predetermined number of steps consisting of two atomic zzso each, one by force in the direction of the target structure, the second by energy zzso releasing the constraint caused in the zzso The transition zzso is represented by the string of energy minimized transient zzso Due to the zzso of the zzso the simulated zzso for zzso is not the reversal of that for zzso It is, therefore, not pretended that the minimum energy zzso was zzso In the zzso direction the zzso B chain first swivels while remaining largely stretched and then winds up extending the pre-existing zzso zzso The A chain advances into the space abandoned and zzso from it in the zzso zzso In the latter the extended zzso first zzso at zzso and then the zzso segment is zzso and zzso The zzso zzso of that segment are formed late in zzso and are maintained during almost half of zzso The AN zzso is less stable and more involved in the transitions than zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
