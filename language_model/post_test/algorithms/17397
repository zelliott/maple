zzso zzso provide a simple and global measure of folding in a zzso The complexity of these zzso can be expressed by the pattern of projected zzso zzso or zzso associated with the molecular zzso In this work, we use this approach to characterize zzso the range of zzso folds observed in proteins with a given chain zzso To discriminate among folding features, we use two shape zzso derived from the probability distribution of zzso the mean zzso number, zzso and the most probable zzso number, zzso The values of N and zzso relate to the content of secondary structure in a protein as well as its global three-dimensional zzso We propose a measure of folding diversity based on the properties of these zzso In addition, we discuss the application of our method to study how zzso folds evolve during protein zzso
