zzso gives access to the zzso parameters of a grating coupled slab zzso structure and permits its functional modeling without a zzso knowledge of the geometry of the zzso The evidence is shown by comparing with the exact electromagnetic modeling of a sliced zzso of a zzso grating zzso zzso chip cut by zzso and analyzed by zzso
