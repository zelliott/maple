This paper presents an zzso for fast image synthesis inside zzso zzso Given the zzso zzso of a mesh and a reference 3-D image zzso of a zzso volume, the method first maps the image zzso that need to be zzso from the zzso zzso to the nominal zzso zzso where the zzso zzso are obtained easily through zzso in the zzso structure of the reference zzso zzso This mapping requires the identification of the mesh element enclosing each zzso for every image zzso To accelerate this point location operation, a fast method of projecting the zzso mesh on image zzso is introduced in this zzso The method presented was implemented for ultrasound zzso image simulation of a synthetic tissue zzso The phantom deformation as a result of ultrasound probe motion was modeled using the finite element zzso Experimental images of the phantom under deformation were then compared with the corresponding zzso images using sum of squared differences and mutual information zzso Both this quantitative comparison and a qualitative assessment show that realistic images can be zzso using the proposed zzso An ultrasound examination system was also implemented to demonstrate that real-time image synthesis with the proposed technique can be successfully integrated into a zzso zzso
