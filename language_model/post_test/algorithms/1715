zzso mechanics zzso during zzso zzso ventilation zzso facilitate zzso zzso support zzso Yet, these are influenced substantially by zzso tube zzso contributions, which may dominate when leaks around zzso zzso are zzso We hypothesized that 1) the effective removal of zzso leaks may be confirmed via direct comparison of measured zzso zzso mean zzso pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 2) zzso respiratory system resistance zzso and compliance zzso may be derived from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso With the use of zzso zzso models, zzso airway opening zzso and zzso zzso pressures and flows were measured during zzso zzso until leaks are zzso These were repeated for combinations of zzso settings zzso mean airway pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso time zzso and varying zzso zzso zzso showed that leaks around the zzso will 1) systematically reduce the effective zzso pressures and zzso zzso volumes, and 2) derived mechanical properties are increasingly zzso as leaks zzso Mean pressures were systematically reduced along the zzso circuit and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso even for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso models were then derived for predicting zzso based on mean zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Next, in 10 of 11 studied zzso infants zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leak was confirmed based on excellent agreement between zzso zzso and zzso zzso and consequently, their zzso respiratory mechanics were zzso zzso resistance at the zzso zzso zzso resistance airway opening zzso zzso + zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased significantly with increasing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso showed a modest, zzso increase zzso zzso zzso and zzso was essentially unchanged zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso conditions is feasible by comparison of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This facilitated the reliable and accurate assessment of zzso respiratory mechanical properties that can zzso guide zzso management of zzso zzso zzso
