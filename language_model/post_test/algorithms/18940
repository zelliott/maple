To describe the growth behavior of zzso zzso cells in zzso systems, various approaches zzso deterministic and zzso single cell models as well as zzso models have been presented in the zzso The growth restriction of these often zzso cells by spatial effects is described at levels with different complexity but for the most part not taking into account their zzso zzso Compared to suspension cell lines these cells have a comparatively long lag phase required for attachment and start of proliferation on the zzso After an initial phase of exponential growth only a moderate specific growth rate is achieved due to restrictions in space available for cell growth, limiting medium zzso and zzso of growth zzso Here, a basic deterministic zzso zzso cell model for growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells used in influenza vaccine production is zzso Four classes of cells are zzso cells on zzso cells in suspension, dead cells, and zzso zzso Based on experimental data, cell attachment and detachment is taken explicitly into zzso The model allows simulation of the overall growth behavior in zzso culture, including the lag zzso In addition, it describes the time course of zzso and release of key zzso and the identification of parameters relevant for the design and zzso of vaccine manufacturing zzso
