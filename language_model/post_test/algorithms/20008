Pulmonary zzso hypertension is a major cause of mortality in systemic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has emerged as a candidate zzso that may enable the early detection of systemic zzso pulmonary zzso hypertension zzso The objective of our study was to incorporate zzso into a screening zzso for zzso that could potentially replace zzso zzso zzso as a more convenient and less costly zzso zzso zzso 

zzso levels were measured in patients from four clinical groups: a group with right heart zzso zzso zzso before zzso of therapy for zzso a group at high risk of zzso based on zzso a group with zzso lung zzso and systemic sclerosis zzso controls with no zzso zzso zzso levels were compared by using zzso and correlated with other clinical variables by using simple and multiple linear zzso zzso curve analyses were performed to determine the optimal cut point for zzso and other clinical variables in prediction of zzso 

zzso was highest in the zzso group compared with other groups zzso zzso zzso and higher in the risk group compared with controls zzso zzso zzso zzso was positively correlated with zzso pulmonary artery pressure zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso and mean zzso zzso zzso zzso pulmonary vascular resistance zzso zzso zzso and mean right zzso pressure zzso zzso zzso on zzso A composite model wherein patients screened positive if zzso was zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso was zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso had a sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso for zzso 

We have proposed a screening zzso for zzso incorporating zzso level and zzso This model has high sensitivity and specificity for zzso and, if positive, should lead to zzso and zzso testing for zzso This screening zzso must be validated zzso
