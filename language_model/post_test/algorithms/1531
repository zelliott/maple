We assessed the utility of zzso imaging zzso with relative signal intensity zzso statistical zzso for zzso prostate cancer zzso 

zzso patients with prostate cancer underwent zzso before total zzso We measured standard zzso zzso of the signal intensity zzso of the lesser pelvic space at zzso created zzso zzso displaying signal zzso with zzso of only zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and assessed correlation between the proportion of zzso area on the 4 different zzso maps and that on pathological zzso 

We could detect prostate cancer on zzso maps for all cases with zzso zzso zzso but not 2 cases with zzso zzso zzso five with zzso zzso zzso and eight with zzso zzso zzso The correlation zzso zzso between the proportion of zzso area on pathological examination and zzso maps were zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso mapping may be used to delineate the extent of prostate zzso We achieved best correlation between ratio of zzso area of the lesser pelvic space on pathological examination and on zzso map using a threshold with zzso zzso zzso of the zzso
