A new procedure for molecular replacement is presented in which an efficient zzso search is carried out using an evolutionary zzso zzso In this zzso a population of initially random zzso solutions is zzso zzso with respect to the correlation zzso between observed and calculated structure zzso The sensitivity and reliability of the method is enhanced by uniform sampling of the zzso space and the use of continuously variable zzso and zzso zzso The process is several orders of magnitude faster than a systematic zzso search, and comparisons show that it can identify solutions using significantly less accurate or less complete search models than is possible with two existing zzso zzso A program incorporating the method, zzso allows the rapid and highly automated solution of zzso problems involving single or multiple molecules in the zzso zzso zzso has been used to solve a number of difficult zzso zzso
