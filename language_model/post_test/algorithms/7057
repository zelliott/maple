A variation of simulated zzso zzso called zzso simulated zzso is used with a simple zzso schedule to automatically zzso beam weights and beam angles in radiation therapy treatment zzso This zzso technique permits the straightforward zzso of any objective function and any set of dose constraints, even those described by zzso zzso zzso simulated zzso is demonstrated using an objective function which zzso the probability of normal tissue complications subject to the constraint that the entire target volume receive a zzso dose within specified maximum and minimum zzso Target volume dose constraints are determined by points located on the perimeter of the target zzso zzso of normal tissue complications are based on published normal tissue complication probability functions and zzso from zzso zzso calculated on points spread throughout the normal zzso
