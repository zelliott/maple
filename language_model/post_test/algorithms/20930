zzso systems with zzso stable zzso may exhibit significant transient dynamics following zzso In some cases, these transient dynamics include the possibility of excursions away from the equilibrium before the eventual zzso systems that exhibit such amplification of zzso are called zzso zzso is a common property of ecological systems, and the amplification can be large and zzso The transient response of a zzso zzso depends on the parameters of the underlying zzso To investigate this zzso we develop sensitivity analyses for zzso of transient dynamics zzso the amplification zzso and the optimal zzso in both zzso and zzso models written in zzso zzso The sensitivity calculations require expressions, some of them new, for the derivatives of zzso zzso singular values, and singular zzso obtained using zzso zzso zzso analysis provides a quantitative framework for investigating the mechanisms leading to transient zzso We apply the methodology to a zzso model and a zzso food web zzso The results suggest zzso and zzso mechanisms for transient amplification resulting from zzso zzso
