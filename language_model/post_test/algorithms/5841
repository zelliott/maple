Many animals spend a large proportion of their time either zzso for food or watching out for predators zzso zzso There have been many theoretical and empirical studies investigating the zzso between these two activities, especially in zzso Previous models of zzso vigilance assume that all birds within the group spend the same amount of time zzso However, many empirical studies have shown that individuals on the edge of flocks are more zzso Here we describe a vigilance model which investigates the effect of position on the birds' strategies by dividing the feeding area into an inner and outer zzso The model examines how various parameters such as food availability and zzso risk affect the strategies of individual birds according to whether they are in the inner or outer zzso Our model predicts that birds in the outer group are always more vigilant than those in the inner zzso zzso in the zzso receive a higher payoff in each of the wide range of scenarios that we have considered, and so our model also indicates why dominant birds would choose to feed in the zzso of the zzso a prediction in zzso with several empirical zzso
