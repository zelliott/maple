Assessment of zzso duration is often recommended to avoid administration of zzso drugs in patients with prolonged zzso zzso a frequent situation in the zzso zzso zzso zzso correction inappropriately increases zzso when heart rate is increased, and the use of the zzso formula may avoid a falsely prolonged zzso zzso The authors assessed automatic zzso zzso measurement to detect prolonged zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso men zzso zzso in the zzso zzso 

Automatic and manual zzso were performed in 108 patients after zzso Automatic zzso measurement used the zzso zzso Manual zzso were made from each zzso and used as the zzso zzso between the two methods was zzso zzso and zzso zzso corrections were compared in this zzso 

zzso between automatic and manual zzso was zzso The zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso was independent from heart rate and allowed adequate zzso zzso zzso of automatic zzso to detect prolonged zzso zzso was zzso Automatic zzso zzso less than 430 zzso ruled out a manual prolonged zzso zzso When automatic zzso was greater than 430 zzso this value was converted according to zzso Automatic zzso greater than 430 zzso identified all patients with prolonged manual zzso with a negative zzso error of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso can be zzso by respectively adding or zzso zzso to the zzso zzso for each increase or decrease by 10 zzso in heart rate from 60 zzso 

Automatic zzso zzso if zzso associated with calculation of zzso reliably identifies patients in whom manual zzso measurement must be performed to confirm zzso prolonged zzso zzso
