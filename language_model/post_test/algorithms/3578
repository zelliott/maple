The values of the parameters used in zzso zzso capture therapy zzso to calculate a given dose to human tissue vary with patients due to different physical, biological and/or medical zzso zzso include the tissue dimensions, the zzso concentration and the relative biological effectiveness zzso factors for the different dose components associated with zzso Because there is still no worldwide agreement on zzso values, more often than not, average values for these parameters are zzso It turns out that the zzso can be zzso by taking into account all zzso zzso zzso zzso this quest from another zzso the outcome will also provide the parameters (and zzso which influence the optimal source zzso zzso For brain zzso it turns out that the zzso zzso the zzso factors for zzso as well as fast zzso together with the dose limit set for healthy zzso affect the optimal zzso source zzso zzso By using source zzso of a few zzso together with zzso of a few zzso it ensures that, under all zzso circumstances, a maximum of alpha (and zzso particles can be delivered in the zzso
