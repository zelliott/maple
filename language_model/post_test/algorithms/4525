zzso inclusion body zzso zzso is a progressive, acquired zzso process of unknown zzso No known, successful or proven treatment zzso zzso zzso studies including concentric needle motor unit action zzso interference pattern, zzso and fiber density have allowed different measures to be made of the motor zzso These different measures allow zzso to be made in how the muscle fibers are distributed within both the normal and diseased motor zzso The present study is an effort to use multiple quantitative zzso zzso from the biceps zzso on a serial basis in order to study chronic changes in the motor unit with disease zzso zzso studies from 9 patients over a four-year period are zzso We conclude that while the concentric needle zzso is most helpful for diagnosing zzso the less selective zzso and surface zzso are better suited to monitor disease zzso especially in very weak zzso These observations have practical applications for monitoring disease zzso or conversely, response to zzso
