One of the most difficult and time-consuming aspects of building zzso models of single zzso is assigning values to free parameters to make models match experimental zzso zzso zzso methods potentially represent a more rapid and less zzso alternative to choosing parameters zzso Here we compare the performance of four different zzso methods on several zzso zzso The methods compared are zzso zzso genetic zzso simulated zzso and zzso zzso Each method has been tested on five different zzso models ranging from simple models with between 3 and 15 parameters to a realistic zzso cell model with 23 zzso The results demonstrate that genetic zzso and simulated zzso are generally the most effective zzso zzso zzso was overwhelmingly the most effective method for simple models with small numbers of zzso but the genetic zzso method was equally effective for more complex models with larger numbers of zzso The discussion considers possible explanations for these results and makes several specific recommendations for the use of zzso searches on zzso zzso
