In this paper, a fuzzy waste index for evaluating the hazard posed by composite zzso generated from industrial processes is zzso Within this methodology, a fuzzy index as a measure of zzso of a given composite waste is derived from the crisp zzso of its zzso zzso zzso toxicity and zzso attributes based on the National Fire Protection Association zzso hazard zzso The novelty of this work lies in establishing an integrated fuzzy hazardous waste index zzso which provides a zzso representing the hazard ranking of a composite zzso This is contrary to current techniques which do not provide a final zzso hazard zzso The efficacy of the new proposed approach is illustrated through several worked zzso The results demonstrate that the fuzzy zzso can be useful in aiding policy and zzso in conducting comprehensive initial evaluation of the status of waste hazardous status without the need for costly laboratory zzso As such, the approach offers a robust and transparent decision-making zzso
