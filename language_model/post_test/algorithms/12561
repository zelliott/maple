zzso protein flexibility is an important goal for understanding the zzso principles governing biological zzso This paper presents a zzso Ensemble zzso to capture the mobility of a protein zzso such as a missing loop and its extension into a zzso Ensemble zzso to characterize the mobility of an entire protein at zzso The underlying approach in both methods is to combine a geometric exploration of zzso space with a statistical mechanics zzso to generate an ensemble of physical zzso on which zzso quantities can be measured as ensemble zzso The zzso Ensemble zzso is validated by applying it to characterize loop mobility in both instances of strongly stable and zzso loop zzso In each instance, fluctuations measured over generated ensembles are consistent with data from experiment and zzso The zzso Ensemble zzso captures the mobility of an entire protein by generating and combining ensembles of zzso for consecutive overlapping fragments defined over the protein zzso This method is validated by applying it to characterize flexibility in zzso and protein zzso zzso quantities measured over the ensembles generated for both proteins are fully consistent with available experimental zzso On these zzso the method recovers zzso data such as order zzso residual zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso presented in this work suggest that the proposed methods can provide insight into the interplay between protein flexibility and zzso
