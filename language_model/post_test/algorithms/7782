zzso imaging zzso describes the zzso transfer within zzso between mobile water zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso maps of the principle kinetic components of zzso transfer, the fraction of zzso zzso zzso and the rate constant zzso revealed detailed anatomy of white matter zzso fiber tracts at zzso zzso In this study, zzso was first adapted to zzso zzso and constraints for zzso relaxation times of water and zzso zzso were identified to enable unbiased f and k zzso zzso zzso zzso and diffusion zzso imaging zzso were performed in five healthy zzso The parameters f and k were compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso apparent diffusion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso across a range of zzso zzso In zzso neither f nor k was significantly correlated to zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, both f zzso and zzso and k zzso and zzso in gray matter zzso were strongly correlated to zzso and zzso zzso A moderate correlation between zzso and k zzso was identified in zzso while an inverse correlation was identified in zzso zzso The lack of association between zzso and zzso in zzso is consistent with differences in the underlying physical principles between techniques - fiber density zzso zzso zzso The association in zzso may be attributable to variable zzso density unique to each zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso provides distinct quantitative information compared to zzso and zzso parameters may prove constructive as zzso in neurological zzso
