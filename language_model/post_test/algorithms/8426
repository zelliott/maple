zzso transferring protein complexes form only zzso and the crystal structures of electron transfer zzso complexes involving zzso c could so far be determined only for the pairs of zzso zzso c zzso zzso with zzso c zzso c) and with horse heart zzso c zzso zzso This article presents models from zzso zzso for complexes of zzso c zzso zzso from zzso zzso with horse heart zzso zzso and with its zzso counterpart zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is performed with the zzso program, which permits an exhaustive search of zzso and zzso zzso A filtering procedure is then applied to reduce the number of complexes to a manageable zzso In a final step of structural and energetic zzso the complexes are zzso by zzso energy zzso with the molecular mechanics package zzso This methodology was first tested on the zzso c complex, in which the complex with the lowest zzso energy has an zzso from the crystal structure of only zzso A zzso carbon zzso zzso the crystal zzso has an even lower zzso The same procedure was then applied to zzso c and zzso The zzso zzso c complex is very similar to a zzso model previously described for the complex of bovine zzso c zzso with horse heart zzso zzso For the zzso complex, zzso zzso is found in two different zzso depending on whether it is zzso against zzso from a zzso or from a zzso crystal structure, zzso Both zzso are discussed critically in the light of the available experimental zzso
