Information may be zzso both in the individual activity of zzso and in the correlations between their zzso zzso whether knowledge of noise correlations is required to decode all the zzso information is fundamental for constructing zzso models, zzso zzso and zzso If correlations can be ignored with tolerable losses of information, the zzso of neural signals is simplified zzso To that end, previous studies have constructed zzso assuming that zzso fire independently and then derived bounds for the information that is zzso However, here we show that previous bounds were not tight and overestimated the importance of noise zzso In this study, we zzso the exact loss of information induced by ignoring noise correlations and show why previous zzso were not zzso Further, by studying the elementary parts of the decoding process, we determine when and why information is lost on a zzso zzso We introduce the minimum decoding error to assess the distinctive role of noise correlations under natural zzso We conclude that all of the zzso information can be zzso without knowledge of noise correlations in many more situations than previously zzso
