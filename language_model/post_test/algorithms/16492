zzso flow zzso results in complex, zzso zzso To date, tools for the zzso analysis of these zzso across multiple specimens grouped by different zzso zzso such as demographic information, have not been zzso Often, the exploration of such zzso is accomplished by zzso of patterns with pie charts or bar charts, without easy access to statistical comparisons of zzso that comprise multiple zzso Here we report on zzso and a zzso interface we developed for these zzso In particular, we discuss zzso necessary for accurate representation of data in pie charts, the implications for display and comparison of zzso versus zzso data, and the effects of averaging when samples with significant background noise are zzso Finally, we define a statistic for the zzso comparison of complex zzso to test for difference between groups of samples based on zzso zzso While originally developed to support the analysis of T cell functional profiles, these techniques are amenable to a broad range of zzso
