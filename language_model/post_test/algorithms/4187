zzso zzso field echo with zzso zzso preparation is a zzso technique for zzso which enables high-resolution zzso without field zzso image zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of zzso zzso zzso field echo in evaluating zzso in the normal zzso zzso 

First, validation of zzso zzso zzso field echo was attempted by comparing it with zzso zzso Five healthy volunteers were zzso by using zzso zzso zzso field echo and zzso zzso The imaging zzso size was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso field echo and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso measured by the 2 methods in 15 regions of interests (6 in gray matter and 9 in white zzso were compared by using the zzso correlation zzso The zzso in the zzso anterior lobe was then measured in 10 volunteers by using zzso zzso zzso field zzso and the results were compared with those in the zzso and zzso by using a paired zzso zzso 

The zzso from the 2 methods showed a strong correlation zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso confirming the accuracy of the zzso measurement with the zzso zzso zzso The zzso in the normal zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which were significantly higher than those in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

We demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso field echo is feasible in assessing zzso in the zzso zzso
