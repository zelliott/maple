The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a low tube zzso technique and hybrid zzso reconstruction zzso on image quality at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso 

Before zzso surgery, we randomly assigned 60 patients (17 women, 43 zzso mean zzso zzso age, zzso zzso zzso zzso who had undergone zzso to 1 of 2 zzso 30 patients underwent scanning under the conventional zzso zzso protocol with filtered back projection zzso and 30 patients, under an zzso zzso protocol with zzso zzso The estimated effective radiation dose, zzso zzso zzso image noise, zzso ratio, and figure of merit were zzso and the visual image quality of zzso was scored on a 4-point zzso 

The mean effective radiation dose was significantly lower under zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not significantly differ with respect to the image noise zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio, figure of merit, and the visual scores for image quality were higher under zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The use of low tube zzso and zzso can yield significantly improved image quality at zzso of the zzso
