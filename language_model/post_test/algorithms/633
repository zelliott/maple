All quantitative data evaluation techniques applied to zzso are based on the assumption that the baseline is stable in zzso If this prerequisite is zzso major concentration errors can result since drifts are evaluated along with true zzso zzso For handling baseline drifts two improved principal component zzso zzso methods are presented and compared to conventional zzso zzso followed by conventional zzso The proposed zzso methods take advantage of baseline drifts being rather broad compared to the zzso zzso The only assumption made is that drift effects can be modeled sufficiently by zzso of zzso zzso One correction method zzso principal components such that drifts of zzso shape are zzso to the zzso model and thus cannot influence the concentration zzso The second method extends the zzso model by synthetic so-called zzso zzso While the principal components model the true spectral features, the zzso components describe drifts simultaneously and zzso zzso drifts are explicitly included into the zzso and cannot cause erroneous concentration zzso It is demonstrated that both correction methods are zzso as powerful as the conventional zzso in the absence of drifts and superior if drifts are zzso The overall zzso the absence and presence of baseline zzso the novel methods makes them more versatile and reliable than the conventional zzso data zzso In almost all investigated cases, the average concentration errors were significantly smaller than those obtained by zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso do not need zzso zzso as zzso does for preventing suppression of relevant signal zzso zzso demands less zzso expense than zzso and zzso extracts the drift spectrum as additional qualitative information not provided by zzso
