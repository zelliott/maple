Recent studies have shown that the zzso response zzso to voice pitch can be a useful method to evaluate the zzso mechanisms and neural plasticity in the human zzso The purpose of this study was to examine the quantitative properties of the zzso trends with an exponential zzso zzso 

zzso trends obtained with increasing number of sweeps (up to 8000 zzso at three stimulus zzso zzso 45, and 60 zzso zzso were fit to an exponential model that consisted of estimates of background noise zzso zzso response zzso and a time zzso Five objective zzso zzso zzso Slope zzso Tracking zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used to represent different perspectives of pitch processing in the human zzso 

zzso native speakers (16 zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of Mandarin Chinese were zzso 

The results demonstrated that the exponential model provided a good fit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso trends with increasing number of sweeps for the five objective zzso 

The exponential model, combined with the five objective zzso can be used for zzso patients and may prove to be useful as an assessment and diagnostic method in both clinical and basic research zzso
