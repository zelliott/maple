The purpose of this study was to determine the zzso apparent diffusion zzso zzso values at zzso using high zzso zzso zzso zzso images zzso and compare the signal characteristics of the high b value with standard zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Institutional review board approval was obtained for this prospective study which included 20 volunteers (10 M, 10 zzso mean age: zzso without any known clinical disease or zzso zzso All brain examinations were performed with zzso MR by using similar parameters of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso maps were zzso Signal intensity, noise, signal to noise ratio zzso contrast to noise zzso contrast ratio zzso and zzso values of bilateral zzso limb of internal zzso frontal white matter, zzso gray matter, zzso thalamus, zzso of corpus zzso were measured on zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

In all zzso locations, MR signal intensity, zzso and zzso values of zzso images were significantly lower than MR signal intensity, zzso and zzso values of zzso images zzso The zzso and zzso values at the zzso limb of internal capsule and zzso were significantly increased on zzso images zzso and decreased in the other regions zzso 

The zzso values calculated from standard zzso zzso were significantly higher than those calculated from high zzso zzso These results agree with the previous zzso In the regions where zzso values increase with high b value, zzso zzso images may provide additional clinical zzso
