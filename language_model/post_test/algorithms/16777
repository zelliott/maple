The zzso scoring function consistently describes hydrogen zzso the zzso effect and zzso It relies on zzso and zzso terms which are zzso using zzso partition zzso of small zzso We do not use affinity data for zzso therefore zzso is generally zzso to all protein zzso zzso reflects the Gibbs free energy of binding while only considering the essential interactions of zzso zzso The greatest benefit of zzso is that it yields a very intuitive zzso score, which can be mapped onto the zzso and protein zzso This allows the direct zzso of the score and consequently zzso analysis of zzso complexes during the lead zzso zzso In this study, we validated our new scoring function by applying it in large-scale zzso zzso We could successfully predict the correct binding mode in zzso of complexes in zzso calculations on the zzso diverse set, while our performance in virtual screening experiments using the zzso zzso showed significant enrichment values with a mean zzso of zzso across all protein targets with little or no structural zzso As part of these studies, we also carried out a very detailed analysis of the data that revealed interesting zzso which we highlight here and which should be addressed in future benchmark zzso
