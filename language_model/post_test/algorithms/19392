zzso zzso quantum mechanics methods were applied to investigate the hydrogen bonds between CO and zzso zzso and zzso We use the zzso zzso and zzso theories with three basis sets zzso zzso and zzso and both the standard zzso and zzso zzso techniques to zzso the zzso in order to explore the effects of the theories, basis sets, and different zzso methods on this type of H zzso Eight complexes are zzso including the two types of zzso and zzso hydrogen zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso The zzso analysis shows that they have no imaginary zzso and are zzso in potential energy zzso The zzso bonds exhibit a small decrease with a zzso blue shift of the zzso stretch frequency on zzso except for zzso and zzso which are zzso at high levels of theory and with large basis zzso The zzso hydrogen bonds are very weak, with 0 K zzso energies of only zzso zzso but the zzso hydrogen bonds are stronger with zzso energies of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso It is notable that the zzso intensity of the zzso stretch zzso decreases on zzso for the zzso donor zzso but increases for zzso and zzso A calculation investigation of the zzso moment zzso leads to the conclusion that a negative permanent zzso moment zzso of the zzso donor is not a necessary condition for the formation of the zzso hydrogen zzso Natural bond zzso analysis shows that for the zzso hydrogen bonds a large electron density is transferred from CO to the donors, but for the zzso hydrogen bonds a small electron density transfer exists from the zzso donor to the zzso zzso which is unusual except for zzso From the fact that the bent hydrogen bonds in zzso are quite different from those in the others, we conclude that a greatly bent zzso zzso shall inhibit both zzso and zzso
