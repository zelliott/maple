To suggest a more precise tool when assessing the risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso the ratio between contrast medium zzso dose expressed in grams of zzso zzso and estimated zzso zzso rate in zzso zzso based on equations using zzso zzso weight, zzso age, and/or zzso here named zzso zzso 

A zzso search of published zzso investigations reporting mean zzso and mean dose of zzso CM zzso identified 10 zzso controlled zzso and 2 cohort coronary zzso and 3 zzso and 1 cohort zzso zzso zzso zzso From the zzso trials, data were collected only from the zzso or control arms, unless there was no significant difference between the control and test zzso The mean zzso ratio of each study was correlated with the mean frequency of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso or zzso or zzso and zzso zzso or requiring zzso A maximum dose according to an zzso zzso 1 in patients with zzso ranging from 100 to 300 zzso was compared with that of zzso formula and with a zzso zzso threshold published by the European Society of zzso zzso both using zzso alone to predict zzso zzso zzso formula was used to assess the risk of zzso requiring dialysis at an zzso zzso 1 with zzso 

The coronary investigations revealed a linear correlation with a correlation zzso between the zzso ratio and the frequency of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso At a mean zzso zzso 1, the zzso line indicated a zzso risk of zzso and a zzso risk of zzso At a mean zzso zzso zzso the risk of zzso and zzso increased to about 50% and zzso zzso zzso weighted data from the CT investigations revealed a zzso risk of zzso at a mean zzso ratio zzso zzso and no cases of zzso The maximum CM dose according to an zzso zzso 1 was about zzso of that of both zzso formula and the zzso zzso in elderly zzso individuals, while it was similar for middle-aged individuals weighing about 90 zzso zzso formula suggests that there will be an zzso increasing risk of zzso requiring dialysis, but at an zzso zzso 1 and using zzso it will not exceed zzso until zzso decreases below 30 zzso in diabetics and below 20 zzso in zzso 

Using the zzso ratio may be a more zzso way of improving risk assessment of zzso than today's common practice of zzso CM dose from volume alone and zzso function from zzso zzso Prospective studies based on individual patient data are encouraged to define the risk of zzso at various zzso ratios and correlated to type of zzso examination, risk factors, zzso
