zzso image reconstruction zzso in X-ray zzso zzso zzso provide improved image quality for reduced dose levels but require substantial zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso in few zzso and that are amenable to massive zzso are favorable in zzso zzso The zzso zzso surrogate zzso zzso is desirable as it is simple and updates all zzso zzso However, the standard zzso zzso requires many zzso to zzso This paper proposes an extension of the zzso zzso that leads to zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso encourages larger step sizes for the zzso that are expected to change more between the current and the final image, accelerating zzso while the derivation of zzso guarantees zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can also accelerate zzso provided suitable zzso zzso conditions zzso These conditions can fail in 3-D zzso zzso CT due to incomplete sampling outside the zzso zzso zzso This paper proposes a modified zzso zzso that is more stable outside the zzso in zzso zzso We use CT scans to demonstrate that the proposed zzso zzso handles the zzso geometry better than the conventional zzso methods and zzso in less than half the time of ordinary zzso
