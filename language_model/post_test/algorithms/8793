This article presents an inverse method for zzso the zzso parameters of a zzso loudspeaker with or without the zzso current and suspension creep zzso With known zzso zzso zzso zzso and stimulus signal as zzso four calculation procedures for the direct problem, zzso problem, sensitivity problem, and zzso zzso method are involved in zzso solving the unknown zzso zzso The proposed method features high efficiency in solving the direct problem through a hybrid zzso difference zzso It requires a small number of zzso for the zzso algorithm, while offering excellent accuracy in zzso zzso Analysis results demonstrate small differences between the estimated and measured zzso parameters under a variety of stimulus signals, zzso times, and initial zzso The results are also confirmed by experimental zzso These results indicate that the proposed method has a strong potential for zzso the zzso parameters of zzso zzso
