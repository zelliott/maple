zzso complex networks of zzso interactions zzso is one of the zzso challenges of the zzso zzso Due to the recent advances in experimental zzso including zzso zzso tandem affinity zzso zzso and other zzso methods for zzso interaction zzso zzso huge amounts of zzso network data are becoming zzso Of major concern, however, are the levels of noise and zzso For example, for zzso screens, it is thought that the false positive rate could be as high as zzso and the false negative rate may range from zzso to zzso TAP experiments are believed to have comparable levels of zzso present a novel technique to assess the confidence levels of interactions in zzso networks obtained from experimental zzso We use it for predicting new interactions and thus for guiding future biological zzso This technique is the first to zzso currently the best fitting network model for zzso networks, geometric zzso Our approach achieves specificity of zzso and sensitivity of zzso We use it to assign confidence scores to physical zzso interactions in the human zzso network downloaded from zzso Using our approach, we predict 251 interactions in the human zzso network, a statistically significant fraction of which zzso to protein pairs sharing common GO zzso Moreover, we validate a statistically significant portion of our predicted interactions in the zzso database and the newer release of zzso The data and zzso code implementing the methods are freely available from the web zzso zzso
