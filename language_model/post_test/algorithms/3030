To compare 2 automatic systems for the recognition and counting of 2 different families of cells through zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso status zzso in breast zzso 

zzso zzso strategies and the Support zzso zzso approach have been used for the accurate extraction and recognition of the zzso To achieve the highest possible zzso 2 specialized systems specially suited for zzso and zzso zzso have been zzso 

The testing set of zzso slides of zzso and zzso zzso has been assessed by our system and the results compared to the score of a human zzso The results are in good zzso The average differences are within the acceptable limits of zzso The main advantage of the system is its absolute zzso of zzso 

The proposed zzso automatic system of cell extraction and recognition through zzso zzso has confirmed sufficient accuracy for the tested images and may provide a useful tool for cell recognition and counting on the basis of zzso slides with zzso and zzso zzso
