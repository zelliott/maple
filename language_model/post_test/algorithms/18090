zzso zzso of DNA copy numbers from array comparative zzso zzso zzso data is important for characterizing the cancer zzso An important part of this process is the zzso of the zzso between the sample and control DNA along the zzso into regions of different copy zzso However, multiple zzso are available in the literature for this procedure and the results can vary substantially among zzso Thus, a zzso tool that can display the segmented profiles from a number of methods can be helpful to the biologist or the zzso to ascertain that a feature of interest did not arise as an artifact of the zzso Such a tool also allows the zzso to easily contrast his method against zzso We developed a zzso tool that applies a number of popular zzso to a single array zzso profile entered by the zzso It generates a zzso panel of the segmented profiles for each method as well as a consensus zzso The zzso zzso can be moved along the zzso and zzso in or zzso It also displays the time that each zzso took and provides zzso values of the segmented profiles for zzso The web interface calls zzso written in the statistical language zzso We encourage developers of new zzso to submit their routines to be incorporated into the zzso
