The study presents a zzso zzso zzso seizure detection system based on the Support zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A machine learning zzso zzso is used as a zzso to discriminate between seizure and zzso zzso zzso Two zzso steps are proposed to increase both the zzso precision and the zzso of the zzso The resulting system is validated on a large clinical zzso of 267 h of zzso data from 17 zzso newborns with zzso 

The performance of the system using zzso metrics is zzso The system showed the best up-to-date performance of a zzso seizure detection zzso The system was able to achieve an average good detection rate of zzso with one false seizure detection per hour, zzso with two false zzso per hour, or zzso with four false zzso per zzso An analysis of errors revealed sources of zzso in terms of both missed zzso and false zzso 

The results obtained with the proposed zzso seizure detection system allow for its practical application in zzso intensive care zzso 

The proposed zzso seizure detection system can greatly assist clinical staff, in a zzso intensive care unit, to interpret the zzso The system allows control of the final decision by choosing different confidence levels which makes it flexible for clinical zzso The obtained results may provide a reference for future seizure detection zzso
