The paper presents a zzso joint sensor with measurement zzso for biological engineering applications, such as gait analysis, gesture recognition, zzso The zzso is embodied in both zzso and dynamic environment zzso both of body pose and in motion zzso Its zzso capabilities lay in its ability of simultaneous measurement of multiple degrees of freedom zzso with a single sensor to reduce system zzso The basic working mode enables zzso spatial angle measurement over big ranges and stands out for its applications on different zzso of different individuals without zzso The optional advanced working mode enables an additional zzso measurement for various zzso By employing corrugated tube as the main body, the sensor is also characterized as flexible and zzso with less zzso zzso variations are converted to linear zzso of the sensing zzso The simple reconstruction zzso and small zzso volume are capable of providing real-time angles and long-term zzso The performance assessment of the built zzso is promising enough to indicate the feasibility of the zzso
