The phase zzso of a zzso zzso system is examined by zzso zzso of a zzso form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and glassy local zzso of the free energy are located and the phase zzso in the zzso plane is mapped out by comparing the free energies of different local zzso The zzso phase disappears and the glass becomes the equilibrium phase beyond a zzso value of the zzso A zzso transition is also observed as the density is increased at high zzso The phase zzso obtained in our study is zzso similar to that of hard spheres in a zzso random zzso
