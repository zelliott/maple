A tree was constructed from a structurally zzso area in an alignment of 83 small zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso involved zzso and zzso of a zzso zzso According to the tree, only plant zzso belong to the zzso primary kingdom, whereas animal, zzso zzso and zzso zzso branch off from an internal zzso situated between the tree primary zzso This result is at zzso with a zzso tree of similar size published by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso to be zzso and to belong to the zzso primary zzso The zzso does not follow from the use of conflicting sequence zzso hence it must be due to the use of different zzso zzso We tested our zzso on a set of sequences resulting from a simulated evolution and found it capable of faithfully reconstructing a branching zzso that involved very unequal evolutionary zzso The use of more limited or more extended areas of the complete sequence zzso zzso only very zzso or also more variable portions of the small zzso zzso structure, does have some influence on the tree zzso In all cases, however, the zzso zzso seem to branch off before the emergence of zzso and the differences are limited to the branching pattern among different types of zzso
