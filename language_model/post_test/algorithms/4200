zzso left zzso assist devices zzso are increasingly used to support patients with advanced heart failure zzso Device zzso is a serious complication of zzso but its precise prevalence and zzso remains zzso 

zzso analysis was performed in all cases with device zzso confirmed upon zzso among patients implanted with a zzso II zzso zzso from January 1, 2009 to November 15, zzso zzso position and bend relief integrity were assessed and charts were reviewed with particular attention to zzso and infection zzso 

zzso of 177 patients zzso were found to have device zzso of various zzso after a mean of zzso zzso 311 days, representing zzso zzso Of the 5 mechanically induced zzso zzso zzso was severely abnormal inflow zzso position in 3 patients and bend relief disconnect with zzso zzso graft in 2 zzso One patient had a zzso disorder with prior zzso zzso In the remaining 13 patients (age 61 zzso 14 years, zzso male, zzso zzso zzso device zzso occurred after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the time of diagnosis was zzso zzso to zzso and mean device speed was zzso zzso zzso zzso Five of 13 patients zzso had an infection during the month leading up to device zzso Of note, zzso zzso zzso was already elevated at the time of discharge in patients who would later develop zzso device zzso zzso zzso to zzso vs 352 zzso to zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

Device zzso is a zzso phenomenon, and differentiation of mechanical and zzso causes is an essential step for individual diagnosis and treatment zzso zzso studies excluding patients with obvious mechanical zzso are needed to investigate zzso and/or zzso risk factors for device zzso Our findings suggest that zzso may be an early risk zzso Due to the difficulty in treating late-stage device zzso we suggest early use of simple tests to rule out both causes of zzso such as zzso and closer zzso monitoring zzso
