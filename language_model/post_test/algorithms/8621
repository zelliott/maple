zzso zzso zzso involvement zzso remains the most accurate zzso factor for recurrence risk and survival in patients with invasive breast zzso zzso and is an essential element in therapeutic zzso However, zzso dissection zzso is responsible for several side effects and is now discussed in small zzso The objective of this study was to define a zzso model of zzso by using clinical and zzso variables available before zzso 

The authors studied zzso cases of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso treated between 1980 and 1997 by conservative surgery and radiation zzso All cases had zzso dissection with at least 10 zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed to build a zzso model of zzso The authors then used the zzso zzso technique to produce unbiased estimates of the probabilities of zzso along with their confidence zzso 

The global zzso rate was zzso The final zzso model included clinical tumor size, location, and zzso zzso and grade as variables independently associated with zzso The estimated probability of zzso varied from zzso to zzso according to case characteristics for these zzso 

These results show that the omission of zzso in surgical procedures for these tumors is zzso Even when zzso rates were low, the superior bounds of the confidence intervals could be zzso zzso we do not recommend to omit zzso in women whose estimated risks are higher than zzso Women with a risk of zzso lower than zzso could benefit from the zzso zzso zzso procedure with, likewise, a limited risk of zzso
