To study the variation of zzso zzso zzso number from a zzso scanner and the effect of this variation on zzso zzso 

CT images of a zzso phantom with multiple zzso were obtained using a zzso zzso zzso zzso Palo Alto, zzso The linear correlation zzso and zzso methods were used to determine the X-ray effective energy in a zzso CT numbers in zzso units zzso were measured as a function of phantom size, orientation, field of view zzso distance from the center, and time for various zzso The change of dose calculations due to the CT number variations was then determined using the equivalent zzso zzso and collapsed cone zzso zzso 

A significant zzso effect was observed for the zzso zzso the CT number from the zzso was more sensitive to the size of the phantom than those from a conventional zzso The zzso number is not sensitive to the locations within the phantom and is stable over a zzso zzso It is important to use the proper zzso for zzso zzso scanning a small polystyrene phantom using a large zzso may result in an increase of zzso zzso in CT number at the center of the zzso However, the zzso variations, due to the CT number uncertainty, do not exceed zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The simulator CT images were acquired with patients in the treatment position, and these CT numbers are useful for zzso dose zzso
