In this paper, the original zzso integral is generalized as a zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso which supports a zzso zzso and an integration zzso The calculation of the zzso is established on the zzso integral with an zzso zzso zzso The zzso properties, and calculation zzso of the zzso and the zzso are discussed and proposed in this zzso As a specific application zzso we designed a zzso zzso model for the zzso problems involving zzso zzso This zzso zzso model has a zzso ability through a double genetic zzso Finally, a daily temperature predictor based on the zzso zzso model is discussed, where a series of experiments is implemented to validate the performance of the predictor by real weather records from the Hong Kong zzso
