Identification of functional genetic variation associated with increased zzso to complex diseases can zzso genes and underlying zzso mechanisms linked to disease onset and zzso For genes linked to genetic diseases, most identified zzso zzso alter an zzso protein zzso zzso advances for measuring zzso abundance suggest that a significant number of undiscovered zzso zzso may alter the regulation of gene zzso However, it remains a challenge to separate zzso genetic variations from linked neutral zzso Here we present an in zzso driven approach to identify possible genetic variation in regulatory zzso The approach combines zzso zzso and zzso factor binding site prediction to identify variation in candidate zzso zzso The zzso approach has been tested on a set of zzso that are reported to have a regulatory function, as well as background zzso In the absence of additional information about an analyzed zzso the poor specificity of binding site prediction is prohibitive to its zzso However, when additional data is available that can give guidance on which zzso factor is involved in the regulation of the zzso the in zzso binding site prediction improves the selection of candidate regulatory zzso for further zzso The zzso software generated for the analysis has been implemented as a Web-based application system entitled zzso zzso analysis of variation in zzso The zzso system is available at zzso for all researchers interested in the detection and characterization of regulatory sequence zzso
