To review our experiences with giant zzso zzso zzso over a zzso period, and to formulate a treatment zzso for managing this zzso 

We zzso reviewed all zzso patients who underwent zzso zzso and immediate free zzso zzso zzso reconstruction zzso by a single zzso team from 2002 to zzso All treatment methods and outcomes were zzso 

zzso zzso patients were operated upon during this study zzso Sixteen cases had zzso of which 9 patients were included in this series zzso age: 35 zzso The defects in the zzso ranged from 7 to 16 zzso in length zzso 12 zzso The average length of the harvested fibula was 11 zzso and the number of zzso ranged from 1 to zzso The mean zzso time was 137 zzso zzso zzso zzso Neck recipient vessels were used for zzso zzso in all zzso All but one zzso were viable without any zzso whilst partial zzso necrosis occurred in 2 zzso Hospital stay was 2 weeks in most of the zzso No zzso recurrence was found during the follow-up period zzso zzso zzso zzso implants were placed in 2 zzso 

Despite several limitations of this study, we suggest that a radical approach with the zzso is an effective treatment for zzso Further well-designed, larger series with longer follow-up periods are still zzso
