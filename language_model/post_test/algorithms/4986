The zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso is a zzso zzso that causes zzso broom disease of zzso zzso cacao zzso This disease has resulted in a severe decrease in Brazilian zzso production, which changed the position of Brazil in the market from the second largest zzso exporter to a zzso zzso zzso zzso plasmids are usually zzso zzso DNA and zzso zzso zzso insertions into host zzso zzso are probably associated with modifications in host generation time, which can be involved in zzso zzso This association suggests activity of zzso and these can be used as new targets for drugs against zzso activity of zzso more specifically against zzso broom zzso zzso and zzso DNA and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were completely zzso and their models were carried out by Comparative zzso zzso The sequences of DNA and zzso zzso showed zzso of identity to zzso and zzso zzso zzso using zzso which were used as zzso The models were constructed using Swiss zzso and refined with a set of zzso Mechanics zzso and zzso zzso zzso in water carried out with zzso zzso both working under the zzso force fields, zzso zzso plots were generated by zzso zzso and exhibited models with zzso and zzso for DNA and zzso zzso zzso MD simulations in water showed models with zzso stability after 2000 zzso and 300 K of zzso 

This work contributes to the development of new alternatives for controlling the zzso agent of zzso broom zzso
