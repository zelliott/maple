This paper presents a comparative study of two indirect solution zzso a zzso and an zzso one, on a set of well-known zzso zzso design zzso The zzso representation encodes the parameters of a zzso design as a mapping from a zzso zzso The zzso representation encodes zzso design parameters as a local zzso transformation zzso several times, starting from a trivial initial zzso Both representations are tested with a zzso evolution strategy based zzso zzso as well as the state of the art zzso zzso We focus both on the best objective value obtained and the zzso cost to reach a given level of zzso The study shows that the two solution representations behave very zzso For experimental settings with equal complexity, with the same zzso scheme and settings, the zzso representation provides results which are far from zzso whereas the zzso representation delivers zzso zzso The zzso representation is also much less zzso expensive than a direct representation until very close to the global zzso The study questions the zzso of the zzso zzso while the results for the zzso representation display much better zzso
