The optical properties of mineral particles suspended in seawater were calculated from the zzso scattering theory for different size zzso and complex zzso zzso of the zzso The ratio of the spectral zzso zzso to the sum of the spectral zzso and zzso zzso of seawater, zzso + zzso was analyzed as a proxy for ocean zzso for varying properties and zzso of mineral zzso Given the plausible range of zzso in the particle size distribution and the zzso index, the general zzso of the zzso and scattering properties of mineral particles and their effects on ocean zzso in terms of particle mass concentration alone are zzso The variations in the particle size distribution and the zzso index must be taken into zzso The errors in zzso zzso obtained from the remote sensing zzso that are due to the presence of mineral particles can be very zzso For example, when the mineral concentration is 1 g zzso and the zzso a concentration is low zzso zzso zzso current global zzso based on a zzso zzso ratio can produce a zzso zzso ranging from approximately 50% to as much as zzso
