We present a novel approach to zzso the statistical zzso of two time series, referred to as zzso event zzso zzso The first step is to extract the two given time zzso The next step is to try to align events from one time series with events from the zzso The better the alignment the more similar the two series are considered to zzso More precisely, the similarity is zzso by the following zzso time zzso zzso of the time zzso fraction of zzso events, and average similarity of the aligned zzso The zzso alignment and zzso parameters are determined by statistical zzso In particular, the zzso parameters are zzso by maximum a zzso zzso zzso and the zzso alignment is obtained by applying the max product zzso This letter deals with one-dimensional point zzso the extension to zzso point processes is considered in a companion letter in this zzso By analyzing surrogate data, we demonstrate that zzso is able to zzso both timing precision and event reliability more robustly than classical measures zzso As an zzso zzso spike data generated by zzso zzso model are zzso
