In this paper we zzso demonstrate a novel, high zzso tolerant, optical dual polarization zzso zzso zzso keying zzso communication system based on zzso phase noise cancellation zzso zzso zzso cavity surface emitting zzso zzso with approximate 300 zzso zzso are used as zzso and local zzso for coherent detection of optical zzso zzso The proposed system, with central wavelength at zzso zzso operates at 40 zzso over 80 zzso single mode fiber zzso as part of a passive optical network zzso The deployment of zzso PNC zzso guarantees a bit error rate zzso performance below the forward error correction zzso zzso Moreover, we also evaluate a novel digital signal processing zzso zzso for zzso pilot tone zzso
