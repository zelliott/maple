A zzso zzso zzso detector for zzso zzso cardiac zzso is presented in this zzso The proposed zzso zzso detector consists of a zzso zzso with zzso filter banks, a zzso complex detector of hypothesis testing with zzso zzso signals, and a noise detector with zzso zzso In order to achieve high detection accuracy with low power consumption, a zzso product zzso and zzso zzso are efficiently exploited in our zzso detector zzso Our zzso and architectural level approaches have been implemented and zzso in a standard zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso including a zzso zzso zzso zzso shows a low detection zzso of zzso and low power consumption of zzso zzso with a 3 V supply zzso
