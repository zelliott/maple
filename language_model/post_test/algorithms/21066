zzso zzso zzso zzso is particularly zzso to applications where its zzso rapid acquisition speed and sensitivity give it a practical advantage over other monitoring or imaging zzso An zzso system's patient interface can potentially be adapted to match the target environment, and thereby increase its zzso It may thus be appropriate to use different zzso positions from those conventionally used in zzso in these zzso One application that may require this is the use of zzso on emergency medicine zzso in particular those who have suffered blunt abdominal zzso In patients who have suffered major zzso it is desirable to minimize the risk of spinal zzso injury by avoiding lifting zzso To adapt zzso to this requirement, we devised and evaluated a new zzso zzso (the zzso which comprises a set of eight zzso placed only on the zzso anterior zzso Images were obtained using a two-dimensional sensitivity zzso and weighted singular value decomposition zzso The zzso zzso ability to zzso bleeding was evaluated by comparing its performance with conventional zzso reconstruction methods using data gathered from a saline zzso We found that without applying corrections to reconstructed images it was possible to estimate blood volume in a two-dimensional zzso case with an uncertainty of around 27 zzso In an approximately zzso zzso case, volume prediction was possible with a maximum uncertainty of around 38 zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso After application of a QI zzso zzso average uncertainties in a two-dimensional zzso case were reduced to about 15 zzso zzso in the approximate zzso case were reduced to about 30 zzso
