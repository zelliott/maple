In this paper, we extend our greedy zzso zzso to zzso zzso With zzso networks, we can solve many complex problems that zzso networks fail to zzso In addition, the zzso zzso is used in conjunction with zzso learning that produces appropriate zzso without computing errors between targets and zzso Thus, the present zzso is a very efficient zzso zzso The new zzso was applied to three problems: the famous zzso lines detection problem, a medical data problem and a road zzso zzso In all these cases, experimental results confirmed that the method could solve problems that zzso networks failed zzso In addition, information zzso makes it possible to extract salient features in input zzso
