This paper presents a walking pattern zzso and a walking distance zzso zzso using gait phase zzso A gait phase information retrieval zzso was developed to analyze the duration of the zzso in a gait cycle zzso stance, zzso swing, and zzso zzso Based on the gait phase information, a decision tree based on the relations between gait zzso was constructed for zzso three different walking patterns zzso walking, walking zzso and walking zzso zzso phase information was also used for developing a walking distance zzso zzso The walking distance zzso zzso consists of the processes of step count and step length zzso The proposed walking pattern zzso and walking distance zzso zzso have been validated by a series of zzso The accuracy of the proposed walking pattern zzso was zzso zzso and zzso for level walking, walking zzso and walking zzso zzso The accuracy of the proposed walking distance zzso zzso was zzso over a walking zzso
