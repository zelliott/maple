We present zzso a method for identifying zzso binding sites and their corresponding zzso zzso does not rely upon zzso zzso is resilient to noise, and, unlike previous methods, it first finds putative zzso binding sites in the sequence of interest, then identifies the targeting zzso zzso we show that zzso identifies most of the currently known zzso zzso with zzso zzso we demonstrate average zzso of zzso or more for zzso of 226 tested zzso The analysis suggests that some zzso may have as many as a few thousand targets, and that between zzso and zzso of the gene transcripts in four model zzso are likely under zzso control through their untranslated and zzso acid coding zzso We also extended the zzso key idea to a zzso zzso zzso our studies suggest that the number of zzso precursors in zzso zzso likely ranges in the tens of zzso
