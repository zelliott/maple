We introduce a dynamic optical arbitrary zzso generation zzso technique that produces bandwidth zzso continuous zzso of near perfect zzso Additionally, zzso complement, real-time arbitrary optical zzso measurement zzso is zzso These approaches zzso zzso electronics to zzso or measure, truly arbitrary and dynamic optical zzso zzso to zzso zzso and infinite record zzso We describe the theory, zzso and enabling technologies necessary to calculate and produce a set of spectral zzso that create zzso zzso zzso in the presence of spectral filtering from zzso
