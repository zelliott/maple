zzso is the most commonly used screening zzso for focal liver zzso in zzso Over the past few years, to overcome the inherent limitations of zzso imaging and zzso ultrasound in identifying and zzso focal liver zzso intravenous agents capable of enhancing the ultrasound signal zzso by vascular and zzso structures have been zzso From December 1999 to December 2001, about 400 patients with a known zzso zzso chronic zzso liver disease, or with an indeterminate focal liver zzso discovered zzso were evaluated by ultrasound of the liver zzso both in baseline conditions and after administration of contrast zzso The ultrasound contrast agents used were: zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso London - zzso Our experience is based on low zzso zzso imaging, which acts zzso performed with different commercially available zzso in zzso mode alone zzso We report the zzso patterns displayed by the main benign and zzso liver zzso after the administration of second-generation ultrasound contrast material, and review the main imaging patterns able to provide effective and practical guidance in zzso a diagnosis of zzso or zzso Our clinical experience confirmed the literature findings that the introduction of low mechanical index methods in zzso imaging has allowed zzso better results for detecting and zzso focal liver zzso than those obtained with baseline and zzso zzso The ease of use, substantial zzso and predictability of the enhancement effects zzso with low mechanical index methods are the main reasons for the success of this zzso zzso the scope of studies to obtain controlled data and comparisons with the other imaging zzso is crucial for the definitive validation of the zzso
