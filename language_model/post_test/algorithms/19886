zzso zzso during long echo trains of magnetic resonance zzso imaging pulse sequences is known to cause a blurring effect, due to the peak broadening of the point spread function zzso In contrast, the simultaneous zzso effect, led by the peak reduction of the zzso has gained much less zzso In this report, we analyzed the zzso of both the zzso and zzso zzso for Cartesian zzso profile ordering and zzso zzso and spiral zzso zzso Then, we derived simple formulas to characterize both the blurring and zzso effects, which are functions of the ratios of the echo train duration zzso over zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso per unit time was thus analyzed considering both the zzso effect induced by the zzso zzso and the zzso gain from the long acquisition duration based on MR sampling zzso zzso zzso ratios to achieve maximum zzso per unit time were zzso for the Cartesian trajectory and zzso for the spiral zzso
