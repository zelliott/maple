zzso spectral zzso techniques based on zzso analysis were established for the quantitative zzso of a zzso mixture containing zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso having closely overlapping zzso The mathematical zzso of zzso spectral zzso as namely zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are based on the use of the linear zzso equations at a zzso set and a zzso set in the range of zzso zzso These zzso techniques do not require any chemical zzso and a zzso procedure of the overlapping zzso The mathematical content of zzso and zzso approaches were briefly formulated for the quantitative analysis of three- or zzso zzso The zzso of the formulated zzso models were tested by zzso the various synthetic zzso zzso consisting of these active compounds and then these models were applied to real pharmaceutical zzso It was observed that zzso and zzso models give a successful quantitative zzso The experimental results of these techniques were compared with each other as well as with those obtained by literature zzso
