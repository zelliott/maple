We propose a methodology for digitally fusing diagnostic decisions made by multiple medical experts in order to improve accuracy of zzso Toward this goal, we report an experimental study involving nine experts, where each one was given more than 8,000 digital microscopic images of individual human red blood cells and asked to identify malaria infected zzso The results of this experiment reveal that even highly trained medical experts are not always zzso in their diagnostic decisions and that there exists a fair level of disagreement among experts, even for zzso decisions zzso infected zzso zzso To tackle this general medical diagnosis problem, we propose a zzso zzso to fuse the decisions made by trained medical experts to robustly achieve higher levels of accuracy when compared to individual experts making such zzso By zzso the decisions of experts as a three component mixture model and solving for the underlying parameters using the zzso zzso algorithm, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach which significantly improves the overall diagnostic accuracy of malaria infected zzso Additionally, we present a mathematical framework for performing zzso diagnosis by using individual zzso diagnosis data, shedding more light on the statistical rules that should govern the routine practice in examination of zzso thin blood zzso zzso This framework could be generalized for various other zzso needs, and can be used by trained experts within an efficient zzso zzso
