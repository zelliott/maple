The zzso mechanical properties of sheep digital zzso zzso were studied by sequences of zzso zzso The results exhibited irreversible zzso and zzso zzso zzso effects were zzso by stress zzso during consecutive stretch cycles to the same strain level, accompanied by zzso of the zzso reference zzso They intensified with increased strain level, and were reduced or became negligible as the strain zzso The significance of intrinsic response mechanisms was studied via a structural model that includes zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso collagen zzso zzso comparisons showed good agreement and good zzso power, suggesting that zzso can be integrated into comprehensive material characterization of zzso
