In an effort to understand the basic mechanism of the action of charged particles in solid radiation zzso we extend our zzso code zzso to condensed media zzso and present new zzso calculations for electrons and zzso Modeling the energy dissipation process is based on a model zzso function, which accounts in a zzso and zzso way for zzso effects which are zzso zzso zzso these effects mostly influence zzso characteristics at the zzso scale, which is the focus of radiation action zzso Since the zzso scheme for electron transport is zzso above several zzso zzso a zzso zzso scheme has been implemented to transport the energetic delta rays produced by energetic zzso Based on the above developments, new zzso calculations are presented for two representative zzso materials, zzso liquid water and zzso zzso include zzso dose zzso in zzso and zzso zzso as well as, zzso zzso which, among other things, are important in predicting zzso damage in biological systems and prompt zzso in zzso
