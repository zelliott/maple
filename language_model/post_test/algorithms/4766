zzso zzso alignment and rotation can be difficult to determine in zzso zzso zzso zzso axis rotation is particularly difficult to assess zzso zzso zzso can cause zzso pain and secondary degenerative joint zzso The aim of this study is to develop an zzso method based on zzso zzso zzso zzso to guide alignment of zzso zzso zzso We zzso that bone surface matching can predict zzso even with severe zzso A zzso zzso was zzso at 16 zzso zzso zzso zzso degrees to zzso zzso The images were processed resulting in an zzso bone surface plot consisting of a pattern of zzso and zzso zzso gaps were simulated by removing zzso CT zzso The gaps were zzso by zzso the existing zzso and zzso fragments to the zzso of the zzso The two bone surfaces were then shifted to align zzso zzso zzso zzso was accurately assessed using surface matching zzso zzso zzso slope zzso The largest mean error was zzso degrees and the average difference between repeated zzso was zzso zzso zzso can provide zzso high-resolution images with a large field of zzso This quality of imaging enables surface matching zzso to be zzso even with large areas of zzso
