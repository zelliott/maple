Over the past two decades, zzso expression systems have been widely exploited for the zzso of many therapeutic zzso Much of the success can be attributed to the zzso of basic principles of zzso protein translation and protein folding to the problems of zzso expression zzso zzso usage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso however, expression in a zzso host still remains an empirical zzso To improve zzso protein expression further we have developed an zzso termed zzso zzso that best zzso zzso usage zzso from the native host and adjusts these for use in the zzso zzso The success of this methodology may be due to improved protein folding during zzso Although so far exclusively applied to zzso coli, zzso zzso may provide a general strategy for improving the expression of zzso functional proteins during zzso host zzso
