Although changes in gene expression are necessary for zzso zzso during hypertension, the genes altered and their mechanisms of regulation remain zzso The goal of this study was to identify cerebral artery genes altered by hypertension and define signaling pathways important in their zzso zzso cerebral arteries from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso rats were examined by zzso revealing an increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso and expression of the zzso marker zzso in arteries from zzso zzso zzso zzso analyzed by zzso and validated with zzso zzso revealed that zzso family member zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were significantly zzso in HS zzso Fisher exact test and zzso gene zzso showed that genes zzso by zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso were zzso A model of cultured rat cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells was used to test the hypothesis that zzso II zzso zzso zzso and zzso are important in the regulation of genes identified in the rat hypertension zzso zzso II induced a transient induction of zzso and a delayed induction of zzso and zzso zzso levels, which were reduced by zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso reduced zzso levels of zzso but not zzso The zzso of zzso reduced zzso induction by zzso II but enhanced the zzso of zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso zzso disease promotes changes in zzso genes that are zzso by zzso II, regulated by zzso and selectively regulated by zzso and zzso
