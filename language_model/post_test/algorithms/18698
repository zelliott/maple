zzso identification using automated zzso tandem mass zzso zzso is now a standard zzso However, in many cases zzso acquisition becomes redundant acquisition as many different peptides from the same protein are fragmented, whilst only a few are needed for zzso zzso To increase the quality of information but decrease the amount of information, a zzso zzso zzso strategy has been zzso With zzso data analysis is an integral part of the overall zzso acquisition and analysis, and not an zzso as typically zzso In this zzso zzso a zzso assisted laser zzso of zzso of flight zzso instrument is zzso zzso and restricted zzso data are searched and identified proteins are used to generate an zzso zzso after in zzso zzso zzso fragmentation is then restricted to only the most intense zzso not present in the exclusion zzso This process is repeated until all zzso are accounted for or the sample is zzso Compared to zzso zzso yielded similar results for the analysis of six pooled two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso In comparison to standard zzso zzso for sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso gel band analysis, zzso dramatically increased the number of identified zzso It was also found that this new zzso significantly increased sequence coverage by identifying unexpected zzso which can result from zzso zzso
