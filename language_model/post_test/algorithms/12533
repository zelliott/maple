zzso analysis involves performing significance tests at many zzso located throughout the zzso Traditional criteria for declaring a linkage statistically significant have been formulated with the goal of controlling the rate at which any single false positive occurs, called the zzso error rate zzso As complex traits have become the focus of linkage analysis, it is increasingly common to expect that a number of zzso are truly linked to the zzso This is especially true in mapping quantitative trait zzso zzso where sometimes dozens of zzso may zzso zzso alternatives to the strict goal of preventing any single false positive have recently been zzso such as the false discovery rate zzso zzso Here, we characterize some of the challenges that arise when defining relaxed significance criteria that allow for at least one false positive linkage to zzso In particular, we show that the zzso suffers from several problems when applied to linkage analysis of a single zzso We therefore conclude that the general zzso of zzso for declaring significant linkages in the analysis of a single trait is zzso Instead, we propose a significance criterion that is more relaxed than the traditional zzso but does not appear to suffer from the problems of the zzso A generalized version of the zzso is proposed, called zzso that allows one to provide a more liberal balance between true zzso and false zzso at no additional cost in zzso or zzso
