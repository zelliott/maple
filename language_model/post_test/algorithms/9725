This paper presents the results of a pilot study to assess the feasibility of using zzso data to estimate the severity of symptoms and motor complications in patients with Parkinson's zzso A support zzso machine zzso zzso was implemented to estimate the severity of zzso zzso and zzso from zzso data zzso zzso estimates were compared with clinical scores derived via visual inspection of video recordings taken while patients performed a series of standardized motor zzso The analysis of the video recordings was performed by clinicians trained in the use of scales for the assessment of the severity of zzso symptoms and motor zzso zzso derived from the zzso time series were analyzed to assess the effect on the zzso of clinical scores of the duration of the window zzso to derive segments (to eventually zzso data zzso from the zzso data, the use of different zzso kernels and zzso cost values, and the use of data features derived from different motor zzso zzso were also analyzed to assess which combinations of data features carried enough information to reliably assess the severity of symptoms and motor zzso zzso of data features were compared taking into consideration the zzso cost associated with zzso each data feature on the zzso of a body sensor network and the effect of using such data features on the reliability of zzso estimates of the severity of zzso symptoms and motor zzso
