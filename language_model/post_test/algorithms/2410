zzso growth of zzso sequencing technologies in the recent years resulted in rapid development of many new alignment zzso and zzso But most of them are not efficient or not zzso for reads zzso or approximately equal to 200 zzso because these zzso specifically designed to process short queries with relatively low sequencing error zzso However, the current trend to increase reliability of detection of structural variations in assembled zzso as well as to facilitate de zzso sequencing demand zzso zzso zzso platforms with zzso zzso Thus, zzso and programs for efficient mapping of longer reads are becoming zzso However, the choice of zzso zzso effective in terms of both performance and memory are limited and includes only handful of hash table zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso based zzso 

New zzso zzso that combines the advantages of both hash and zzso methods has been designed to effectively align long biological sequences zzso or approximately equal to 200 zzso against a large sequence database with small memory footprint zzso zzso zzso for the human zzso The zzso is accurate and significantly more fast than zzso or zzso but similar to zzso it can find all local zzso It is as accurate as zzso or zzso but uses zzso times less memory and zzso times faster than zzso several times faster than zzso with low error rates and almost two times less zzso 

The zzso zzso of the zzso will be available upon request for zzso use in academia zzso hit table zzso and zzso are at zzso
