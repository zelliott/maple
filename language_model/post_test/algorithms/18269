It has been shown that zzso of a network is determined by the local structure rather than the global zzso With the same global properties, networks may have very different zzso In this paper, we zzso zzso through the spectral properties, the zzso of ensembles of networks with prescribed statistical zzso Given a degree zzso it is found that the zzso and zzso characterizing network zzso have zzso zzso and zzso the networks with extremely poor zzso are zzso Moreover, we compared the zzso of three network ensembles that have the same zzso and average zzso Our work reveals that the zzso of a network can be significantly affected by the local pattern of connections, and the zzso of degree can greatly enhance network zzso for networks of a random zzso
