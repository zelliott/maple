A zzso zzso method is proposed to cluster protein sequences into families, which automatically improves clusters of the conventional single linkage zzso zzso Our approach zzso sequence zzso problem as a kind of graph zzso problem in a weighted linkage zzso which zzso zzso to zzso edges zzso to higher similarities than given threshold and are weighted by their zzso The effectiveness of our method is shown in comparison with zzso families in all mouse proteins in zzso The result clusters match to zzso families much better than the single linkage zzso zzso zzso of proteins in zzso families are classified into appropriate zzso
