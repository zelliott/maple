The purpose of the study was to compare zzso zzso scan interpretation generated by a zzso expert system with the consensus interpretation of 3 expert zzso 

The expert system was evaluated in 95 randomly selected zzso patient studies zzso zzso obtained for suspected zzso there were 55 males and 40 females with a mean age zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Each subject had a baseline zzso zzso scan followed by zzso administration and a separate zzso zzso zzso parameters were automatically extracted from baseline and zzso acquisitions and forwarded to the expert system for zzso Three experts, unaware of clinical information, independently graded each kidney as zzso zzso zzso and probably zzso experts resolved differences by a consensus zzso These 3 expert categories were compared with the zzso zzso and zzso interpretations provided by the expert zzso zzso was assessed using weighted zzso and the zzso accuracy of the expert system compared with expert readers was assessed by the area under zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The expert system agreed with the consensus reading in zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso zzso The weighted zzso between the expert system and the consensus reading was zzso and was comparable with the weighted zzso between zzso There was no significant difference in the areas under the zzso zzso when the expert system was compared with each expert using the other 2 experts as the gold zzso 

The zzso expert system showed good agreement with the expert interpretation and could be a useful educational and decision support tool to assist physicians in the diagnosis of zzso zzso To better mirror the clinical setting, zzso to incorporate clinical data must be zzso zzso and zzso
