Recent advances in structural zzso have enabled the prediction of zzso zzso based on their zzso binding zzso zzso developments in systems biology allow for prediction of the functional effects of system zzso using large-scale network zzso zzso of these two capabilities provides a framework for evaluating zzso drug response zzso in zzso This combined approach was applied to investigate the zzso side effect of the zzso zzso transfer protein inhibitor zzso in the context of human zzso zzso A zzso kidney model was generated in which to simulate drug zzso zzso drug zzso were predicted that have previously been observed to impact zzso function in zzso patients and may play a role in the adverse side effects observed in clinical zzso zzso risk factors for drug treatment were also predicted that zzso to both characterized and unknown zzso zzso disorders as well as cryptic genetic deficiencies that are not expected to exhibit a zzso disorder zzso except under drug zzso This study represents a novel integration of structural and systems biology and a first step towards zzso systems zzso The methodology introduced zzso has important implications for drug development and personalized zzso
