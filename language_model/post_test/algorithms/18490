We propose a method for zzso the left zzso zzso contours from left zzso by means of a neural edge detector zzso in order to extract the contours which zzso with those traced by a zzso The zzso is a supervised edge detector based on a modified zzso neural network, and is trained by use of a modified zzso zzso The zzso can acquire the function of a desired edge detector through training with a set of input images and the desired edges obtained from the contours traced by a zzso The proposed zzso method consists of 1) detection of zzso zzso by use of the zzso 2) extraction of rough contours by use of zzso filtering and edge zzso and 3) a zzso method based on the zzso candidates zzso from the edges detected by the zzso and the rough zzso Through experiments, it was shown that the proposed method was able to extract the contours in agreement with those traced by an experienced zzso zzso we achieved an average zzso error of zzso for left zzso at zzso and an average difference between the ejection zzso obtained from the manually traced contours and those obtained from the zzso contours of zzso
