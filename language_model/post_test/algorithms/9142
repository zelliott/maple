A new zzso zzso method zzso is applied to system of variable zzso coupled zzso equation with zzso zzso The fractional derivatives are described in the zzso fractional zzso zzso The concept of new zzso is introduced briefly, and zzso is examined for two systems of zzso zzso zzso In this approach, the solution is considered as a power series expansion that zzso rapidly to the zzso zzso The new approximate zzso procedure depends on two zzso The modified zzso provides approximate solutions in the form of zzso series with easily zzso zzso zzso indicate that the introduced method is promising for solving other types of systems of zzso zzso partial differential zzso
