zzso interactions zzso play fundamental roles in nearly all biological zzso and provide major insights into the inner workings of zzso A vast amount of zzso data for various organisms is available from zzso and other zzso The identification of communities in zzso networks is of great interest because they often reveal previously unknown functional ties between zzso A large number of global zzso zzso have been applied to protein networks, where the entire network is zzso into zzso Here we take a different approach by looking for local communities in zzso zzso 

We develop a zzso named Local zzso Community Finder, which quickly finds a community close to a zzso protein in any network available from zzso or specified by the zzso Our tool uses two new local zzso zzso zzso and zzso which look for a good cluster among the most popular destinations of a short random walk from the zzso zzso The quality of a cluster is determined by proportion of outgoing edges, known as zzso which is a relative measure particularly useful in zzso zzso We show that the two local zzso zzso find communities that not only form excellent zzso but are also likely to be biologically relevant functional zzso We compare the performance of zzso and zzso to other popular and effective graph zzso zzso and show that they find better clusters in the zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso find communities that are more functionally zzso 

The Local zzso Community Finder, accessible at zzso allows the user to quickly find a high-quality community close to a zzso protein in any network available from zzso or specified by the zzso We show that the communities found by our tool form good clusters and are functionally zzso making our application useful for biologists who wish to investigate functional zzso that a particular protein is a part zzso
