zzso analysis of CT brain scans is vital for diagnosis and treatment of zzso Brain Injuries zzso Automatic processing of these CT brain scans could speed up the decision making process, lower the cost of zzso and reduce the chance of human zzso In this paper, we focus on automatic processing of CT brain images to segment and identify the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso provides quantitative measures on the changes of zzso in the brain that form vital diagnosis zzso 

First all CT slices are aligned by detecting the ideal zzso in all zzso The initial zzso of the ideal zzso of the brain is found based on skull symmetry and then the initial estimate is further refined using detected anatomical zzso Then a zzso method is used for zzso zzso First a low-level zzso on each zzso is applied on the CT zzso For this step, both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso are evaluated and zzso The second step applies template matching zzso to identify objects in the initial low-level zzso as zzso zzso for zzso zzso are conducted using a relatively large CT zzso containing mild and severe zzso zzso 

zzso show that the acceptable rate of the ideal zzso detection is over zzso Two zzso are defined to evaluate zzso recognition zzso The first measure is a zzso measure and the second is a false zzso zzso For the first zzso the rate is zzso indicating that all zzso are identified in all zzso The false zzso measurement is zzso We also point out the similarities and differences between ICM and zzso zzso through both zzso relationships and zzso results on CT zzso 

The experiments show the reliability of the proposed zzso The novelty of the proposed method lies in its incorporation of anatomical features for ideal zzso detection and the zzso zzso zzso zzso Our method offers the following improvements over existing zzso accurate detection of the ideal zzso and accurate recognition of zzso using both anatomical features and spatial templates derived from zzso zzso zzso
