To establish and validate a formula to predict spectral domain zzso zzso zzso zzso retinal nerve fiber layer zzso thickness from time domain zzso zzso zzso and other zzso 

zzso and zzso scans were obtained on the same day from healthy participants and patients with zzso zzso and zzso linear zzso relationships were analyzed to convert average zzso zzso zzso to average zzso zzso zzso Additional baseline characteristics included age, sex, zzso pressure, central zzso zzso zzso zzso anterior chamber depth, zzso disc area, visual field zzso mean zzso and pattern standard zzso The formula was generated using a training set of 220 patients and then evaluated on a validation zzso of 105 zzso 

The training set included 71 healthy participants and 149 patients with zzso The validation set included 27 healthy participants and 78 patients with zzso zzso analysis determined that zzso zzso zzso age, zzso disc area, zzso mean zzso and pattern standard zzso were significantly associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis using available variables yielded the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the validation sample, the multiple zzso model explained zzso of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso 

The proposed formula based on zzso zzso thickness may be useful in predicting zzso zzso zzso Other factors associated with zzso zzso zzso such as age, disc area, and mean zzso did not contribute to the accuracy of the final zzso
