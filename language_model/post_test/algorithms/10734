Speech zzso tests have been widely used for advanced hearing diagnoses and in zzso However, there are no zzso speech tests for more than zzso of the world's population, who do not speak zzso A major problem in the design of a speech zzso test is that the selection of test materials is subject to multiple criteria, and its complexity rises dramatically as the structure of test items changes from zzso or monosyllabic forms to zzso or polysyllabic zzso A genetic zzso is presented that can automatically select a set of zzso words from a large Mandarin zzso The selection zzso with the following principal criteria for the items zzso a speech discrimination test: similarity in structure, familiarity to the subjects, and a zzso balanced zzso The performance of the genetic zzso was evaluated by zzso of the distance between a target zzso specifying the desired distribution of initial and final syllables and tone patterns for daily zzso word zzso and the zzso derived by the search results of the zzso The use of the genetic zzso was illustrated by its application to the selection of test lists from two Mandarin zzso The results showed that, for a given zzso at least 12 zzso word lists with a distance of less than 20 could be generated within 72 zzso The genetic zzso performed an efficient, robust and zzso search of the problem space and can be easily modified to adapt to the material selection of other zzso
