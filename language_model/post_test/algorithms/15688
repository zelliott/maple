We introduce a biologically motivated zzso principle of sequential memory which is based on zzso competition zzso of event zzso This mechanism is implemented in a zzso neural model of sequential spatial zzso We present the learning dynamics which leads to the formation of a zzso zzso After learning, the system is capable of zzso retrieval of prerecorded sequences of zzso
