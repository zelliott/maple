The zzso behavior of a suspension of zzso zzso cells has been investigated in relation to the electrical parameters of certain cell zzso In the zzso zzso zzso equations are solved for the respective zzso media, and the local charge zzso are derived by taking into account the continuity zzso The results describe both alpha and beta zzso and zzso in the corresponding limiting cases, to previous zzso The dependence of suspension zzso in zzso and zzso ranges on the zzso effects, the zzso and the zzso of zzso of zzso and of culture medium as well as on membrane thickness is pointed zzso The possibility is pointed out of characterizing cellular behavior by means of the evolution of certain electrical and zzso parameters during cell cycle progression as well the effects of different stimuli on cellular systems derived by fast zzso zzso
