zzso sleep zzso zzso places an enormous pressure load on the cardiovascular system by inducing a temporary blood pressure zzso surge zzso zzso surge zzso often resulting in target organ damage and cardiovascular events, such as left zzso zzso sudden death, zzso zzso and zzso zzso measurement of zzso would be valuable for the risk zzso of zzso zzso We developed a new zzso zzso monitoring system based on a variable zzso threshold zzso zzso to selectively detect severe zzso which are associated with zzso and evaluated its performance in comparison with a previous technique based on a fixed zzso threshold zzso zzso In 23 zzso patients, the correlation between individual minimum zzso values and zzso was not significant when the zzso zzso was used alone zzso zzso but became significant zzso zzso when the VT zzso was additionally zzso In another 13 zzso patients, when the zzso zzso was eliminated from the zzso algorithm, the number of zzso readings was drastically reduced zzso zzso zzso times, zzso with a similar correlation between minimum zzso and zzso The correlation between the zzso zzso index and zzso was significant when measured with the present method, but not when assessed with ambulatory zzso monitors zzso simulation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso monitoring with a variable threshold is able to detect severe zzso zzso surges more specifically and reduce the number of zzso readings required during sleep compared with detection using a fixed threshold or the conventional zzso zzso
