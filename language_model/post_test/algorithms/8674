We describe two design strategies that could substantially improve the performance of speech enhancement zzso zzso from a preliminary study of pulse recovery are presented to illustrate the potential benefits of such zzso The first strategy is a direct application of a zzso zzso signal processing approach for recovery of speech in zzso The second strategy zzso performance by maximizing the enhancement system's ability to evoke target speech zzso This approach may lead to better performance because the design is zzso on a measure directly related to the ultimate goal of speech zzso accurate communication of the speech zzso In both systems, recently developed zzso zzso learning zzso can be used to determine appropriate parameters for enhancement zzso
