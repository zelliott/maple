zzso is a calcium binding protein of the zzso family, with one zzso and one zzso zzso motif per zzso Although its function is still unknown, it has recently been reported to be one of the zzso proteins able to interact with the zzso for advanced zzso end zzso The zzso solution structures of zzso in both the zzso and the zzso forms have been zzso and show a zzso zzso upon calcium zzso This zzso zzso in particular, the hinge loop connecting the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso III with respect to zzso IV, as common to several zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso The details of the structural changes are important because they must be related to the different functions, still largely unknown, of the different members of the zzso zzso For the first time for a full-length zzso zzso relaxation zzso were performed on both the zzso and the zzso zzso A quite large mobility was observed in the hinge loop, which is not zzso in the calcium zzso The structural differences resulting upon calcium binding change the global shape and the distribution of zzso and charged zzso of the zzso zzso in a modest but significantly different manner with respect to the closest zzso zzso and zzso
