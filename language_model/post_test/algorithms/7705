zzso models in diffusion zzso zzso are used to describe complex white matter fiber architecture of the zzso In this paper, we propose a novel zzso zzso method based on the zzso model, which is composed of an zzso diffusion compartment zzso as well as one or more perfectly linear diffusion compartments zzso To model the noise distribution intrinsic to zzso zzso we introduce a zzso likelihood term and estimate the model parameters by means of an zzso zzso zzso zzso This paper also addresses the problem of selecting the number of fiber compartments that best fit the data, by introducing a zzso prior on the volume mixing zzso This term provides automatic model selection and enables us to discriminate different fiber zzso When applied to simulated data, our method provides accurate estimates of the fiber zzso zzso and number of zzso even at low zzso and zzso similar methods that rely on a zzso noise distribution zzso We also apply our method to in zzso brain data and show that it can successfully capture complex fiber structures that match the known zzso
