Network motif discovery is a key problem in analysis of biological zzso In this paper, we present an efficient zzso for detecting consensus zzso First, we extend zzso searching zzso zzso zzso zzso to efficiently search zzso zzso of which the probability of occurrence in random networks is zzso Then, we zzso zzso zzso into different zzso Finally, we use zzso zzso method to cluster zzso and derive a consensus motif from the zzso Our zzso is applied to the zzso zzso zzso networks and the zzso regulatory networks of zzso coli and zzso zzso The experiment results show that the zzso can efficiently discover zzso which are consistent with current biology zzso And, it can also detect several consensus motifs with a given size, which may help biologists go further into cellular zzso
