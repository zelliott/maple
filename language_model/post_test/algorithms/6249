The effects of bilateral chemical zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the surrounding areas in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso descending area of the avian zzso were examined in zzso old domestic zzso Using a zzso we analyzed the zzso effects on the choices that subject zzso made in two tasks with identical economical consequences, zzso a zzso food reward zzso a zzso food zzso In task 1, red, yellow, and green beads were associated with a zzso placed at various distances from the zzso zzso thus anticipated the spatial proximity of food by the zzso color, whereas the quantity of the food was zzso In task 2, red and yellow flags on the feeders were associated with various amount of zzso the zzso thus anticipated the quantity of food by the zzso color, whereas the proximity of the reward could be directly visually zzso In task 1, bilateral zzso of the zzso zzso (but not the zzso enhanced the zzso of the zzso choices, suggesting that choices based on the anticipated proximity were selectively zzso In task 2, similar zzso of the zzso zzso did not change zzso In both experiments, motor functions of the zzso remained zzso suggesting that the zzso did not affect the zzso efficiency, zzso objective values of zzso zzso zzso of anticipated food rewards in the zzso zzso (but not those in the zzso could allow zzso to invest appropriate amount of zzso in approaching distant food zzso
