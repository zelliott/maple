zzso is a new zzso Carlo zzso program that simulates from first principles zzso powder zzso from zzso materials and zzso zzso from materials with a defined zzso zzso This model has been written primarily for the zzso of zzso planetary zzso zzso zzso but wider applications are certainly zzso A particular strength of the model is the zzso of several zzso techniques for the zzso of execution zzso Comparisons of model output with experimental zzso and zzso data show good quantitative zzso
