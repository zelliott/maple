We present a modified master equation for a homogeneous gaseous zzso system which includes zzso corrections due to the zzso zzso of the particle zzso distribution zzso For the zzso model, the modified zzso approach predicts zzso transitions between different zzso zzso including the transformation of a zzso system into a zzso one, and vice zzso These predictions are confirmed by the comparison with microscopic simulations using the direct simulation zzso Carlo zzso Compared to microscopic simulations of the particle zzso the modified master equation approach proves to be much more zzso
