The zzso mass monitor zzso is an instrument which measures the mass concentration of airborne particles in real time by combining aerodynamic and mobility size particle zzso In this study, we evaluate the performance of the zzso by sampling exhaust from five engines and vehicles of different technologies in both zzso and transient zzso zzso results are found higher than the zzso particulate matter zzso by 39 zzso zzso zzso stands for zzso one standard zzso for 62 diesel tests conducted in total and zzso and zzso higher, respectively, in two gasoline zzso To explore whether the difference occurs because of the different measurement principles of zzso and zzso zzso the zzso operation is zzso over zzso tests by combining an electrical zzso zzso zzso and a scanning mobility particle zzso zzso The correlation of zzso and zzso derived mass and zzso PM is satisfactory zzso zzso zzso with a mean zzso of 5 zzso zzso For the same tests, the correlation of zzso with PM was also high zzso zzso zzso but zzso exceeded PM by 44 zzso zzso on zzso The comparison of zzso and zzso and zzso results reveals that the latter zzso both the geometric mean diameter and especially the zzso of the particle zzso size zzso These findings demonstrate zzso statistically significant difference between the zzso and the zzso PM cannot just originate from the different measurement principles but also from the actual zzso of the combined zzso measurement in the zzso zzso the zzso will require changes in its design and/or the calculation zzso to improve the resolution and zzso of the aerodynamic size distribution zzso
