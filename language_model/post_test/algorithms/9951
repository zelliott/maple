Previous methods for visceral zzso stimulation have lacked control of the temperature rate and visual inspection of the zzso The aims of this study was to develop a method for linear control of heat stimulation in the human zzso combined with zzso to assess the zzso of this method and to investigate sensitivity to zzso stimulation of the zzso zzso before and after acid zzso A probe with a zzso zzso zzso inside was constructed permitting heat and chemical zzso Three different temperature ramps were applied in the zzso zzso in 12 healthy subjects by zzso of heated water in a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was performed prior to experimental zzso The temperature, the time of stimulation and the area under the temperature curve zzso were measured at the pain detection zzso zzso stimulation was repeated after zzso of the zzso with zzso The method was tested on two subsequent days to assess zzso All subjects had a normal zzso zzso zzso zzso was good for the three temperature ramps zzso correlations zzso The subjects tolerated less heat zzso a decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso a decrease in time to pain detection threshold zzso zzso zzso and decreased temperature at pain detection threshold zzso zzso zzso after acid zzso The slow ramp was the most sensitive, showing a decrease in zzso of zzso The present method was easily implemented and showed good zzso It can potentially be used in basic experiments, drug and clinical studies as it provides a zzso zzso zzso
