A general zzso for zzso the complication probability for zzso zzso of a normal tissue structure has been developed and used by the zzso committee on zzso of Treatment Planning for zzso zzso zzso The approach involves reducing an zzso zzso zzso for the tissue zzso from the zzso treatment zzso to an equivalent zzso zzso this procedure is repeated until there remains a zzso zzso the complication probability of which can readily be zzso This note provides technical details concerning the zzso zzso zzso obtained using it are compared with those for two alternative zzso zzso
