Although all sequence zzso tandem zzso and some sequence zzso tandem zzso have been zzso characterized and a model has been proposed to predict the stability of previously zzso sequence zzso tandem zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 47, zzso experimental zzso data for frequently occurring tandem zzso is zzso Since experimental data is preferred over a zzso model, the zzso parameters for 25 frequently occurring tandem zzso were zzso These new experimental values, on average, are zzso zzso different from the values predicted for these zzso using the previous zzso The data for the sequence zzso tandem zzso reported here were then combined with the data for 72 sequence zzso tandem zzso that were published zzso and the parameters used to predict the thermodynamics of previously zzso sequence zzso tandem zzso were zzso The average absolute difference between the measured values and the values predicted using these updated parameters is zzso zzso This updated model improves the prediction for tandem zzso that were predicted rather poorly by the previous zzso This new experimental data and updated zzso model allow for more accurate calculations of the free energy of zzso duplexes containing tandem zzso and, zzso should allow for improved prediction of secondary structure from zzso
