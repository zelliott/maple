We show that a zzso pulse can be used to zzso selected zzso signals in zzso zzso and zzso zzso loaded with zzso oxide zzso This selective zzso method can be incorporated into zzso zzso zzso to obtain useful spectral editing zzso This new strategy has been applied to identify the zzso and the Lewis acid sites in zzso zzso using zzso as the probe zzso
