zzso zzso of the prostate is an increasingly common technique, but the optimal choice of beam zzso remains zzso This study systematically compares a number of zzso treatment plans for zzso zzso of two different clinical treatment zzso prostate only zzso and the prostate plus seminal zzso zzso 

A variety of zzso zzso treatment plans were created for PO and zzso volumes in each of ten zzso Plans included a zzso zzso plan, a zzso plan having bilateral anterior and zzso zzso fields, a plan with anterior zzso and lateral fields, a series of zzso plans, and a zzso plan having anterior and bilateral fields for zzso zzso of 64 and 74 zzso were prescribed to the zzso Plans were compared using the volume of zzso zzso to greater than 50% zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the prescribed zzso zzso control probabilities zzso and normal tissue complication probabilities zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso heads were also zzso zzso head dose was limited such that less than zzso of each zzso head received zzso of the prescribed zzso 

For the PO group, the optimal plan consisted of anterior zzso and lateral fields zzso zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso while the box technique zzso zzso zzso was less advantageous in terms of zzso sparing zzso zzso zzso Similar results were obtained for the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the two plan types, respectively, P zzso zzso The zzso plan was comparable to the optimal zzso plan but gave higher superficial body zzso With dose escalation from 64 to 74 zzso the mean zzso for the optimal plan rose from zzso to zzso Meanwhile, zzso zzso for the optimal plan rose by zzso zzso or zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso or zzso zzso for the box zzso 

For PO volumes, a plan with zzso angles of 35 degrees, 90 degrees, zzso degrees and 325 degrees offers a high level of zzso sparing and acceptable dose to the zzso heads for all patients, while for zzso volumes, the corresponding plan has zzso angles of 20 degrees, 90 degrees , zzso degrees and 340 zzso Using these plans, the gain in zzso resulting from dose escalation can be achieved with a smaller increase in anticipated zzso zzso
