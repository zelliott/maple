zzso zzso technique has been used to determine the zzso of zzso and zzso systems of zzso zzso zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso of solution zzso were obtained over a wide range of composition in the pH range zzso For all the pure drugs the zzso is zzso in zzso The zzso zzso of interaction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the drugs in zzso buffers have been zzso The zzso for all zzso systems is negative and pH dependent zzso pH zzso indicating the interaction among charged species of the zzso In case of zzso systems with zzso the magnitude of zzso indicate strong zzso The variation and magnitude of zzso for the systems is discussed in terms of hydrogen bonding and van der zzso interaction in the zzso The interaction zzso for zzso systems zzso is positive indicating repulsive interaction among the zzso The zzso zzso calculated from zzso equation for zzso systems zzso and zzso interaction zzso zzso were used to predict the zzso of the marketed zzso in pH range zzso
