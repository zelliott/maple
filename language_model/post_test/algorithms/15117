The zzso role of water in the zzso of a model zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso was used as a zzso to vary zzso glass transition temperature zzso without significantly changing water content or zzso zzso in moisture and zzso contents increased the rate of zzso zzso This increase was strongly correlated with zzso at constant water content and activity, suggesting that increased zzso mobility zzso zzso In zzso systems zzso zzso zzso zzso rates appeared to be independent of water content and activity in zzso with similar zzso However, in glassy zzso with similar zzso zzso increased with water content, suggesting a zzso effect of water on zzso in this zzso An increase in water content also affected the degradation product zzso less of the zzso zzso intermediate and more of the zzso products, zzso and zzso were observed as water content zzso Thus, residual water appears to facilitate zzso in these solid zzso zzso both by enhancing molecular mobility and by zzso effects, and also zzso as a chemical zzso in the subsequent breakdown of the zzso zzso
