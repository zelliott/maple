Using the kernel trick idea and the zzso idea, we can construct two kinds of zzso feature spaces, where linear feature extraction zzso can be employed to extract zzso zzso In this correspondence, we study the relationship between the two kernel ideas applied to certain feature extraction zzso such as linear zzso analysis, principal component analysis, and zzso correlation zzso We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis and show that they are equivalent up to different zzso on each zzso These results provide a better understanding of the kernel zzso
