The present study tested for zzso noise to examine how timing and target constraints affect cognitive processes in zzso Participants pointed to targets of varied height and zzso at preferred speed zzso 1) and as quickly as possible zzso zzso zzso show greater intensity of zzso noise, or long-range correlation in zzso at preferred speed and with increased accuracy demands perpendicular to the target zzso related to zzso Prior research suggests that increased zzso noise in movement reflects increased coordination of processes at different zzso zzso planning and zzso particularly when there is more time to complete the zzso Previous studies also suggest that target height constraints promote more reliance on both zzso and zzso control, as more time is spent during initial aiming and zzso Thus, present results expand on what we know about aiming movements in two ways: zzso by further suggesting a zzso relation between planning zzso zzso and control zzso zzso that is time zzso and zzso by demonstrating that such an integration of zzso reflected in distinct patterns of zzso noise, may be modulated by multiple environmental characteristics zzso target zzso
