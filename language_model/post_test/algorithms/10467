The calculation of zzso dose distribution can be achieved by zzso Carlo simulations or by zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso Carlo code has been considered for use in nuclear medicine zzso Up to now, zzso has mainly been dedicated to other fields, namely high energy physics, radiation protection, and zzso When first employing a zzso Carlo code for nuclear medicine zzso its results concerning electron transport at energies typical of nuclear medicine applications need to be zzso This is commonly achieved by means of calculation of a representative zzso and comparison with reference zzso zzso point kernel zzso zzso the energy deposition all around a point zzso source, is often the zzso 

zzso zzso have been calculated in both water and compact bone for zzso electrons zzso zzso and for beta emitting zzso commonly used for therapy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Point zzso sources have been simulated at the center of a water zzso sphere, and deposed energy has been tallied in concentric zzso zzso outcomes have been compared to zzso zzso results, calculated in this study as zzso Moreover, in case of zzso electrons in water, comparison with the data from the literature zzso zzso zzso has been zzso zzso percentage differences within zzso and zzso for zzso electrons zzso being the continuous slowing down approximation zzso and within zzso and zzso for zzso zzso being the radius of the sphere in which zzso of the zzso energy is zzso have been zzso together with the average percentage difference within zzso and zzso for electrons and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso within zzso (where zzso of the particle energy is zzso zzso and zzso agree mostly within zzso except for 10 and 20 zzso electrons zzso in water, zzso in zzso The discrepancies between zzso and the other codes are of the same order of magnitude than those observed when comparing the other codes among them, which can be referred to the different simulation zzso When considering the beta zzso discrepancies notably zzso within zzso zzso and zzso differ for less than zzso in water and less than zzso in bone with any of the zzso here zzso Complete data of zzso zzso are given as zzso zzso as a tool to perform zzso by zzso point kernel zzso 

zzso provides reliable results when transporting electrons in the low energy range, proving to be an adequate tool for nuclear medicine zzso
