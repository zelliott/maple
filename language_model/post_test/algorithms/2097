zzso alignment without the zzso of gap penalties or a scoring zzso is attained by using zzso zzso and a zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso sums over all possible alignments on the forward step to obtain zzso zzso essential to zzso zzso and samples from the exact zzso distribution on the backward zzso Since both terminal and intervening unrelated zzso will often be excluded from an zzso the resulting alignments may be seen as extensions of local zzso An zzso significance is assessed using the zzso zzso A zzso simulation shows that zzso evidence against the zzso hypothesis tends to be a conservative measure of significance compared to classical zzso An application to proteins from the zzso zzso shows that the zzso distribution of the number of gaps is often flat and that the zzso distribution of the evolutionary distance is often flat and sometimes zzso An alignment of zzso with zzso shows good correspondence with a structural zzso
