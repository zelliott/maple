Previous zzso controlled trials suggest that using clinical zzso based on zzso levels, a marker of bacterial infections, results in reduced zzso use without a deleterious effect on clinical zzso However, zzso differed among trials and were embedded primarily within the European health care zzso zzso we zzso the design, zzso and safety of previous zzso controlled trials and propose adapted zzso for US zzso We performed a systematic search and included all 14 zzso controlled trials (N zzso zzso zzso that investigated zzso zzso for zzso treatment decisions in adult patients with respiratory tract infections and zzso from primary care, emergency department zzso and intensive care unit zzso We found no significant difference in mortality between zzso and control patients overall zzso ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso or in primary care zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and intensive care unit zzso zzso settings zzso A consistent reduction was observed in zzso prescription and/or duration of therapy, mainly zzso to lower prescribing rates in zzso primary care and zzso patients, and shorter duration of therapy in zzso and zzso zzso and intensive care unit zzso zzso of zzso levels for zzso decisions in patients with respiratory tract infections and zzso appears to reduce zzso exposure without worsening the mortality zzso We propose specific zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso patients as a basis for future trials aiming at reducing zzso zzso
