In order to account for the phenomenon of virtual pitch, various theories assume implicitly or explicitly that each spectral component introduces a series of zzso The zzso method for pitch determination can be viewed as a direct zzso of this zzso The widespread application of this principle in pitch determination is, however, zzso by zzso problems with respect to accuracy and zzso zzso A modified zzso is described that zzso these zzso Its performance is tested for normal speech and zzso speech, zzso speech zzso filtered at 300 zzso The zzso zzso the zzso method for pitch determination, while its zzso requirements are about the zzso The zzso is described in terms of zzso system theory, zzso zzso zzso It is argued that the favorable performance of the zzso zzso stems from its corresponding more closely with current zzso theories than does the harmonic zzso
