Lack of power and zzso are zzso of genetic association studies of common complex zzso Indeed, the zzso of disease zzso demands that zzso models consider the simultaneous involvement of multiple zzso zzso zzso model, which is well known in zzso provides a framework for such a zzso In the present work, we developed a zzso zzso to construct gene clusters resembling zzso zzso model for a complex disease, starting from finding influential gene pairs followed by grouping homogeneous zzso 

The zzso was trained and tested on zzso zzso and zzso zzso extracted from four large Caucasian and Taiwanese zzso The constructed zzso each featured by a major gene interacting with many other genes and identified a distinct group of patients, reproduced in both ethnic populations and across three zzso zzso We present the 14 largest gene clusters which were capable of identifying zzso of zzso in all the zzso and zzso if one zzso was excluded for lack of zzso zzso Although a few zzso were also identified by the gene zzso they usually carried less risky zzso zzso zzso zzso than the zzso zzso After establishing a zzso percentage for risky zzso zzso in each gene zzso the 14 gene clusters achieved a zzso accuracy of zzso for all zzso and zzso if the zzso zzso was zzso Furthermore, not only 10 of the 14 major genes but also many other contributing genes in the clusters are associated with either hypertension or zzso diseases or zzso 

We have shown with the constructed gene clusters that a zzso zzso approach can indeed improve the zzso of genetic markers for complex zzso In addition, our novel findings including a major gene in each cluster and sufficient risky zzso in a cluster for disease onset (which zzso with zzso sufficient cause zzso may not only provide a new research direction for complex diseases but also help to reveal the disease zzso
