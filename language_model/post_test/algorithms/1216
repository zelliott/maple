A mathematical model and computer code have been developed to zzso interpret zzso gamma camera zzso Specifically, the zzso permits airway composition of the central, intermediate and peripheral partitions of scans to be determined zzso The zzso zzso identifies the spatial coordinates of each of the millions of airways within the adult human zzso and assigns every individual airway to a precise location within the gamma camera image format prescribed by the zzso This is done on a zzso zzso The zzso has evolved from clinical applications of the previous work of zzso et zzso zzso The objective of the current work was to advance the original protocol and derive an zzso that was: zzso from a medical perspective, more zzso zzso and zzso from a technical perspective, easier to apply in the medical zzso Regarding zzso the major elements of the zzso are that the outer boundary of the lung is formulated directly from lung zzso imaging data and that the lung is divided into distinct left and right zzso Regarding zzso the zzso has been written for use with common zzso It is our hope that the improvements will facilitate applications of the new zzso into zzso therapy zzso
