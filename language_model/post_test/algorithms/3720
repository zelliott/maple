This study evaluates zzso beam zzso zzso zzso zzso based on dynamic leaf motion of a zzso zzso zzso zzso beams, and zzso zzso therapy zzso with respect to target coverage and zzso at zzso 

zzso plans of 6 zzso treated patients were zzso for zzso by use of the same field setup and an inverse planning zzso zzso and zzso plans were calculated zzso Three different tumor shapes, zzso zzso and zzso were zzso as well as dose to zzso zzso in the vicinity of the planning target volume zzso zzso zzso were calculated from zzso data for a manual zzso for zzso guided zzso zzso zzso a dynamic zzso for zzso the zzso technique for zzso and a modified zzso technique for zzso zzso was included for a part of the zzso zzso for assessment were zzso coverage, zzso zzso zzso volumes of specific zzso and the dose to zzso 

zzso zzso to the zzso is equally good for all three techniques and tumor shapes zzso The volumes of the zzso and zzso zzso were comparable for all zzso For the 50% zzso volume, a divergence between the two modes was zzso In 3 cases, this volume is smaller for zzso and in the 3 other cases, it is smaller for zzso This difference was even more pronounced for the volumes of the zzso zzso zzso shows further improvement over conventional zzso zzso in zzso zzso the zzso were similarly well spared by zzso and zzso zzso spares critical zzso zzso Fewer zzso beams are required to achieve similar zzso 

The addition of intensity zzso improves the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of dose to the zzso is comparable for zzso zzso and zzso zzso the sparing of zzso zzso is equivalent to zzso and zzso is superior to conventional zzso The advantage of zzso lies in the lower integral zzso
