zzso of target peptides and proteins is crucial for zzso zzso zzso such as selected reaction monitoring zzso and multiple reaction monitoring zzso rely on liquid zzso and mass zzso analysis of defined zzso product zzso These methods are not very widespread because the determination of quantifiable product zzso using either zzso or zzso is a very time-consuming zzso We developed a novel approach for zzso target peptides without such an arduous process of zzso zzso This method is based on monitoring multiple product zzso (multiple products zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso of a target zzso The zzso method uses a scoring system that considers both the absolute zzso of product zzso and the similarities between the query zzso spectrum and the reference zzso spectrum of the target zzso Compared with conventional approaches, zzso greatly improves sensitivity and selectivity of zzso zzso using an zzso mass zzso
