Recently zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso has been introduced to the neurological imaging zzso However, the radiation dose delivered to patients in zzso zzso protocol is a high and potential risk associated with the zzso radiation zzso Thus, minimizing the radiation dose is highly desirable for zzso zzso In order to reduce the radiation dose delivered during zzso zzso CT applications, we introduce here the CT zzso of zzso constrained back zzso zzso zzso We explore the radiation dose reduction approaches of both acquiring a reduced number of projections for each image and lowering the tube current used during zzso We then apply zzso image reconstruction to produce image sets at a reduced patient dose and with low image zzso zzso phantom experiments and retrospective analysis of in zzso canine studies are used to assess the accuracy and quality of zzso reduced dose image sets and validate our zzso Experimental results demonstrated that a factor of zzso times radiation dose reduction is possible when the zzso zzso is applied to zzso zzso zzso
