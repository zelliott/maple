It is now well recognized that zzso and zzso interactions are important in complex diseases, and statistical methods to detect interactions are becoming zzso Traditional zzso approaches are limited in their ability to detect zzso interactions and handle sparse data, and standard zzso procedures may miss interactions that occur in the absence of zzso main zzso To address these limitations, the zzso zzso reduction zzso method zzso et zzso zzso Am J zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso is zzso for examining zzso interactions and detecting interactions without main zzso The zzso was originally designed to analyze balanced zzso zzso The analysis can use family data, but requires a single matched pair be selected from each zzso This may be a zzso zzso pair, or may be constructed from zzso data when parents are zzso To take advantage of additional affected and unaffected siblings requires a test statistic that measures the association of zzso with disease in general nuclear zzso We have developed a novel test, the zzso by merging the zzso method with the zzso zzso Test zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso allows identification of zzso effects or joint effects of multiple zzso in families of diverse zzso We present simulations to demonstrate the zzso of the test and evaluate its zzso To examine its zzso to real data, we applied the zzso to data from candidate genes for zzso disease zzso in a large family zzso These results show the utility of the zzso for understanding the zzso of complex zzso
