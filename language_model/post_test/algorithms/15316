Automatic identification of various zzso compartments from dynamic zzso contrast magnetic resonance brain images can assist in clinical diagnosis and treatment of cerebrovascular zzso The principle of zzso methods was based on the zzso of zzso zzso profiles to discern areas of different zzso However, the cerebrovascular diseases may result in a delayed and dispersed local zzso and therefore alter the zzso signal zzso Assessing the accuracy of the zzso technique under zzso circumstance is critical to accurately evaluate the severity of the vascular zzso In this study, we improved the zzso method of zzso zzso by using the results of zzso zzso on zzso zzso data as initial parameters for a mixture of zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso Carlo simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of proposed method under different levels of zzso zzso and noise of signal profiles in tissue zzso The proposed method was used to zzso brain tissue types using zzso data from five normal participants, a patient with unilateral zzso of the internal carotid artery, and a patient with zzso zzso Our results showed that the normal, delayed or dispersed zzso can be well differentiated for patients, and therefore the local zzso input function for impaired zzso can be recognized to minimize the error when zzso the cerebral blood zzso Furthermore, the tissue in the risk of zzso and the tissue with or without the complementary blood supply from the zzso arteries can be zzso
