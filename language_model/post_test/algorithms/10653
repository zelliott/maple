Finding the common zzso shared by two proteins is considered as one of the central issues in zzso biology because of its usefulness in understanding the zzso relationship and application in drug and vaccine zzso In this paper, we propose a novel zzso called zzso zzso All zzso Common zzso for the common zzso identification zzso Our method works initially at the protein secondary structural element zzso level and starts with the identification of all structurally similar zzso zzso These zzso pairs are then merged into sets using a modified zzso algorithm, which will test the similarity of various sets of zzso pairs zzso until all the zzso sets of zzso pairs that deemed to be similar are zzso The zzso common zzso of the two proteins will be formed from these zzso zzso A refinement zzso is also proposed to fine tune the alignment from the zzso level to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso with other methods on various proteins shows that zzso can address all four requirements and zzso interesting biological zzso
