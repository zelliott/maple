The use of zzso on failure of zzso maneuvers in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The aim of the present study was to identify a possible zzso index for the efficacy of zzso in zzso 

This retrospective study included 321 patients with zzso in whom zzso maneuvers failed to restore normal zzso rhythm and who received 6 zzso zzso followed by 12 zzso zzso zzso if zzso A zzso zzso zzso was used to reveal zzso zzso Various patients' characteristics were inserted into the zzso 

A straightforward index has been chosen that would aid the distinction of patients failing to respond to zzso The formula, (age zzso heart rate at zzso + number of past zzso episodes, was chosen as the one that combined the highest sensitivity zzso and specificity zzso 

This zzso index constitutes a useful and reliable bedside diagnostic tool to identify patients with zzso who were less likely to respond to zzso administration in the emergency zzso
