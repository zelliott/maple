This paper concerns the feasibility of zzso differential phase contrast zzso zzso imaging using a zzso zzso zzso experimental system, which is equipped with a commercial digital flat-panel detector and a zzso zzso zzso zzso An extensive system characterization was performed to zzso its imaging zzso 

The major components of the zzso system include a diagnostic zzso tube with a zzso zzso nominal focal spot size, a flat-panel detector with 96 zzso zzso pitch, a sample stage that zzso within a limited angular span of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso with three zzso zzso A total of 21 projection views acquired with zzso increments were used to reconstruct three sets of zzso image volumes, including the conventional zzso contrast zzso image volume zzso reconstructed using the zzso zzso zzso with the ramp zzso the phase contrast zzso image volume zzso reconstructed using zzso with a zzso zzso and the differential phase contrast zzso image volume zzso reconstructed using the zzso zzso Three zzso physical zzso containing zzso materials were used to characterize the signal zzso the signal zzso ratio zzso the three-dimensional noise power spectrum zzso zzso and the zzso artifact spread function zzso 

While zzso highlights edges and zzso in the image object, zzso removes the differential nature of the zzso projection data and its zzso values are zzso related to the zzso of the real part of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso values of zzso in water and polystyrene in oil are zzso and zzso respectively, in zzso and the values were improved to zzso and zzso respectively, in zzso zzso and zzso demonstrate equivalent zzso but their noise characteristics zzso by the zzso zzso were found to be different due to the difference in the zzso image reconstruction zzso 

It is feasible to simultaneously generate zzso differential phase contrast, phase contrast, and zzso contrast zzso images using a zzso data acquisition zzso The method shows promise in improving the visibility of several zzso materials and therefore merits further zzso
