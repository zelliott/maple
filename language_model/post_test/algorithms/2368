This paper introduces an improved technique for modeling risk and decision problems that have continuous random variables and zzso zzso zzso are modeled with zzso of zzso random zzso called zzso zzso zzso of random variables are calculated using zzso zzso in a manner called zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso And zzso zzso zzso This technique is compared with traditional zzso modeling in terms of zzso technique, zzso complexity, and zzso Nevada simulation takes advantage of the zzso independence in a decision problem while allowing for zzso dependence to achieve zzso zzso complexity for many decision zzso It improves on the accuracy of traditional decision trees by employing larger approximations than traditional decision zzso It improves on traditional decision analysis by modeling continuous variables with zzso rather than zzso zzso A zzso analysis using a mixed zzso probability distribution for cigarette smoking rate is zzso
