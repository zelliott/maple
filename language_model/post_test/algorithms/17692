zzso zzso is a major barrier for zzso stem cell and solid organ zzso To estimate the zzso potential between zzso stem cell zzso pairs, we recently proposed a matching score zzso zzso that is based on the structural data of zzso class I zzso and on the functional similarity of zzso acids zzso This first approach revealed new features about zzso zzso zzso within the zzso and zzso zzso We have now developed an zzso software tool zzso that is capable to assess the zzso zzso zzso between any pair of clinically relevant zzso class I, and also class II, zzso zzso described zzso sequences will be regularly integrated into the database according to the nomenclature for factors of the zzso system zzso The software is intended to be a first step for zzso the zzso of zzso zzso in peculiar clinical settings, as long as there are no reliable in zzso or clinical studies zzso The zzso can later be modified according to functional data, for example, zzso zzso With the extension of the sequence similarity concept to all clinically relevant zzso class I and II zzso zzso may contribute to prevent zzso zzso being a matter of zzso
