The mean inner potential of zzso zzso zzso and zzso has been measured by transmission electron zzso using the phase shift of the zzso of the first zzso zzso To provide a defined zzso geometry we used 90 degrees wedges obtained by the zzso zzso The exact zzso condition as well as the acceleration zzso of the electrons were determined from zzso beam electron zzso zzso The zzso is extracted from zzso lattice fringe images and zzso effects are taken into account by zzso zzso
