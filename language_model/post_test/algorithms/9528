To examine performance characteristics of zzso zzso zzso in comparison with standard automated zzso zzso in patients with resolved zzso zzso in a short-term follow-up zzso 

Comparative consecutive case zzso 

Twenty patients with resolved zzso zzso and 20 healthy volunteers participated in this zzso 

The subjects were patients who recovered normal vision zzso or zzso after zzso zzso The Swedish interactive zzso zzso zzso program was used for zzso and a zzso zzso program was used for zzso 

Using both forms of zzso the mean zzso zzso pattern standard zzso zzso and the percentage of abnormal points significantly depressed zzso in the total zzso probability plot were zzso The visual fields were divided into 5 zones, and the mean sensitivity in each zone in affected eyes was compared with that in healthy eyes of the volunteers within 2 weeks of vision recovery and in follow-up after 2 weeks and 2 and 5 zzso 

Standard automated zzso and zzso showed general depression in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso were statistically significant for MD zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso detected with zzso were larger than with zzso in 14 eyes zzso zzso In follow-up after 2 weeks and again after 2 and 5 months, zzso indicated slower improvement in visual field defects in the zzso and zzso areas, whereas zzso indicated rapid improvement in these zzso 

zzso zzso is at least comparable with and potentially more sensitive than zzso in detecting visual field defects in resolved zzso zzso This short-term follow-up study in patients with resolved zzso zzso suggests that zzso detects characteristics of slower recovery more effectively than zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso These properties may allow more accurate detection of visual field defects and may prove advantageous for monitoring of patients with resolved zzso zzso
