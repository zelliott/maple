zzso zzso zzso is a computer supported method for the measurement of complex mechanical airway zzso zzso zzso can reliably be diagnosed by zzso when more complex parameters such as frequency dependence of resistance zzso and lung zzso zzso are evaluated in cases with more severe zzso zzso of conventional methods like zzso zzso and zzso show relatively low correlations due to the different measurement principles, not only in comparison to zzso but also in between one zzso The zzso is a convenient method for patients with a low dependency on cooperation for the evaluation of zzso airway diseases complementary to the established standard zzso Furthermore, zzso may provide a sensitive screening tool for the early detection of zzso zzso not only in zzso but also in occupational zzso
