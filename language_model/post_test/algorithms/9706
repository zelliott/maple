zzso the zzso course of patients with hip fractures would be helpful for surgical planning and risk zzso We therefore established equations to predict the morbidity and mortality rates in candidates for hip fracture surgery using the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso Stress zzso zzso zzso First we evaluated the correlation between the zzso scores and zzso morbidity and mortality rates in all zzso patients surgically treated for hip fractures during the study period zzso zzso Next we established equations to predict morbidity and mortality zzso We then applied these equations to all zzso patients with hip fractures treated at seven other hospitals zzso zzso and compared the predicted and actual morbidity and mortality rates to assess the zzso ability of the zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The ratio of actual to predicted morbidity and mortality rates was closer to zzso with the zzso than the zzso zzso Our data suggest the zzso scoring system is useful for defining zzso risk and its underlying zzso accurately predicts morbidity and mortality rates in patients with hip fractures before zzso This information then can be used to manage their condition and potentially improve treatment zzso
