zzso neural network models are capable of tracking linear zzso of moving visual zzso This paper describes an additional neural zzso zzso that enhances the ability of a visual system to track curved zzso The added mechanism combines information about an zzso trajectory with information about changes in the zzso zzso to improve the estimates for the zzso next probable zzso zzso simulations are presented that show how the neural mechanism can learn to track the speed of objects and how the network operates to predict the zzso of accelerating and decelerating zzso
