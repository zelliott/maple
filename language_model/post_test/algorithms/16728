This study presents zzso levels of zzso zzso in zzso tissue of human breast using zzso magnetic resonance zzso at 7 zzso We used a zzso zzso zzso zzso to obtain zzso zzso MR zzso of zzso tissue of healthy females by deploying whole breast free induction zzso zzso detection with zzso zzso and outer volume zzso Using progressive zzso the estimated apparent zzso relaxation time of zzso spins of zzso and zzso was zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso measures for zzso and zzso levels in zzso tissue were established based on MR zzso We used a zzso zzso image of the breast to segment the zzso zzso this was matched to a zzso zzso image of the zzso field of the zzso zzso to correct for differences in zzso tissue volume and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso MR zzso were zzso using a phantom with known zzso Average levels of zzso and zzso in 11 volunteers were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, data of three patients with breast cancer showed higher levels of zzso and zzso compared with healthy zzso This may indicate a potential role for the use of zzso magnetic resonance zzso for zzso zzso and treatment monitoring in breast zzso
