zzso schemes such as zzso region merging or zzso zzso rely on edge weights between adjacent zzso The quality of these edge weights directly affects the quality of the resulting zzso zzso learning methods seek to minimize the zzso error on individual zzso This ignores that a few local mistakes zzso boundary zzso can cause catastrophic global zzso zzso zzso evidence learning should therefore zzso structured quality criteria such as Rand zzso or Variation of zzso We present the first structured learning scheme using a structured loss zzso and we introduce a new zzso scheme that allows to approximately solve the zzso hard prediction problem even for huge volume zzso The value of these contributions is demonstrated on two challenging neural circuit reconstruction problems in serial zzso electron microscopic images with billions of zzso Our contributions lead to a zzso quality that improves over the current state of the zzso
