Given a zzso network in terms of its zzso and zzso our goal is to efficiently zzso the minimal zzso sets of reactions required to block a given zzso We describe an zzso that improves the zzso of these zzso sets when the elementary modes zzso functional zzso of the network are zzso We also describe an zzso that zzso both the zzso sets and the elementary modes containing the blocked reactions directly from the description of the network and whose worst-case zzso complexity is better than the zzso currently in use for these zzso zzso results are zzso
