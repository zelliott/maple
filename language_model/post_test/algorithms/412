The environment provides points for control of pathogens spread by food, water, hands, air, or zzso These environmental transmission pathways require contact network zzso more realistically detailed than those based on social encounters or physical zzso As a step toward improved assessment of environmental interventions, description of contact networks, and better use of environmental specimens to analyze transmission, an environmental infection transmission system model that describes the dynamics of human interaction with pathogens in the environment is zzso Its environmental parameters include the pathogen elimination rate, zzso and the rate humans pick up zzso zzso and deposit them, zzso The ratio, zzso (N equals population zzso indicates whether transmission is density dependent zzso zzso frequency dependent zzso zzso or in zzso zzso through frequently touched zzso such as zzso generates zzso patterns, while transmission through thoroughly mixed air or infrequently touched zzso generates zzso zzso The environmental contamination ratio, zzso reflects total agent deposition per infection and outbreak zzso where gamma is defined as the recovery zzso These insights provide theoretical contexts to examine the role of the environment in pathogen transmission and a framework to interpret environmental data to inform environmental zzso
