At a population level, inflammatory markers have been shown to predict outcome and response to therapy in patients with zzso cardiovascular zzso However, current markers are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to provide clinical utility for managing individual zzso We zzso that measurement of multiple circulating zzso inflammatory factors will be more zzso allowing the early identification of vascular wall disease zzso We have investigated whether protein zzso abundance zzso of circulating proteins can predict the severity of zzso zzso Using a zzso experimental design with zzso zzso mice and control zzso and zzso zzso mice, we measured the zzso serum protein expression of 30 inflammatory markers using a protein zzso We were able to identify a subset of proteins that zzso and predict the severity of zzso disease with a high level of zzso The zzso vascular expression of these markers was verified by showing that their gene expression in the mouse zzso correlated closely to the zzso pattern of serum protein zzso In conclusion, these data suggest that zzso of multiple zzso inflammatory proteins can provide a more sensitive and specific methodology for assessing zzso disease activity in humans, and identify candidate zzso for such zzso
