To compare zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso related parameters of primary colon or zzso cancer zzso with pathological zzso 

zzso zzso patients who have undergone zzso PET zzso zzso zzso are included in this zzso zzso zzso tumor length zzso and tumor zzso zzso are determined using several zzso methods, and various thresholds of zzso tumor volume (MTV) and total zzso zzso zzso are zzso The zzso zzso and zzso are compared with maximum pathological length and zzso on the pathological zzso 

Using a zzso threshold level for maximum zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso yield results that provide an optimal match with maximum pathological length zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was an independent factor for predicting pathological zzso or T4 stages zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso characteristic zzso show MTV at a fixed threshold of zzso maximum zzso zzso and zzso achieved better correlation with the advanced pathological T zzso No associations with positive N stage were zzso 

zzso zzso is a useful tool for predicting the final pathological findings for zzso patients requiring surgical zzso
