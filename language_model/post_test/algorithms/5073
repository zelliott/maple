Gene trees that arise in the context of reconstructing the evolutionary history of zzso species are often zzso that is, the same leaf label can occur several times in a single zzso This property considerably zzso the task of forming a consensus of a collection of such trees compared to usual zzso zzso 

We present a method for computing a consensus tree of zzso zzso As with the well-known greedy consensus tree approach for zzso trees, our method first breaks the given collection of gene trees into a set of zzso It then aims to insert these clusters one at a time into a tree, starting with the clusters that are supported by most of the gene zzso As the problem to decide whether a cluster can be inserted into a zzso tree is zzso hard, we have developed a zzso method for solving this zzso 

We illustrate the zzso of our method using two collections of trees for plants of the zzso zzso that involve several zzso at different zzso
