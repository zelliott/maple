zzso simulations and experiments were used to examine the possibility of employing strong zzso fields for zzso of zzso zzso interactions between zzso zzso zzso and to compare it to the zzso zzso at weak zzso zzso It was shown that strong zzso zzso under zzso conditions can lead to zzso provided that the zzso zzso principal axes systems of the coupled zzso are aligned and that their zzso zzso zzso are approximately the zzso The phenomenon is based on the fact that strong zzso zzso induce zzso transfer of zzso between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso with equal zzso as is the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Because of the zzso variation of the state of the spin system and of the zzso interaction, the effect of the latter on the zzso zzso and on the zzso zzso is not averaged out by sample zzso The approach is, however, very sensitive to the relative orientation of the zzso zzso principal axes systems and therefore less robust than the approach based on weak zzso zzso that satisfy zzso zzso
