The oxygen zzso response to zzso exercise zzso zzso zzso threshold zzso has been zzso with a gain zzso response zzso per zzso of work zzso and time constant that do not vary appreciably at different work rates or between the zzso and zzso Above zzso the response becomes more complex with an early component that typically projects to a value that has a gain similar to that of the zzso an response, but which is supplemented by the addition of a delayed slow kinetic zzso We therefore established a constant target zzso zzso for each subject such that with different imposed work rates the contribution to zzso from the slow phase varied over a wide zzso Work rates were chosen so that zzso was attained at zzso zzso Five subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso at four to five different work zzso zzso was measured zzso at zzso the work rate was abruptly reduced and the subject recovered by cycling unloaded for 15 zzso Unlike the zzso for which the slow component shows a long zzso the zzso was best fitted as two simultaneous exponential zzso The slower zzso component had a small zzso and long time constant, but did not differ significantly among the various zzso The zzso zzso for zzso therefore was independent of the magnitude of the contribution to the slow phase from the zzso zzso
