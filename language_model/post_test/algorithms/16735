With the recent success of zzso association studies zzso a wealth of association data has been accomplished for more than 200 complex zzso proposing a strong demand for data integration and zzso A zzso analysis of multiple zzso zzso or an zzso analysis of zzso data and other zzso data, has been particularly zzso In this study, we proposed an zzso analysis framework of multiple zzso zzso by zzso association signals onto the zzso interaction network, and demonstrated it using schizophrenia zzso Building on a dense module search algorithm, we first searched for significantly enriched zzso for schizophrenia in each single zzso zzso and then implemented a zzso strategy to identify module genes with consistent association zzso We validated the module genes in an independent zzso and also examined them through zzso of the related zzso using multiple zzso zzso As a result, we identified 205 module genes with a joint effect significantly associated with zzso these module genes included a number of well-studied candidate genes such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Further functional analysis suggested these genes are involved in zzso related zzso Additionally, zzso found that 18 zzso in 9 module genes had zzso zzso zzso including the gene zzso located in the zzso region on zzso 6, which was reported in previous studies using the largest cohort of schizophrenia patients to zzso These results demonstrated our zzso network-based strategy is efficient for identifying zzso genes with modest signals in zzso zzso This approach can be applied to any other complex zzso where multiple zzso zzso are zzso
