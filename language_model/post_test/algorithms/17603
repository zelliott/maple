A new force field for zzso zzso interactions as a function of zzso to zzso distances is zzso The force field was developed through the solution of a linear programming zzso with large sets of zzso The constraints are based on the construction of zzso low-energy zzso for a set of proteins and requiring the decoy energies for each protein system to be higher than the native zzso of that particular zzso The generation of a robust force field was facilitated by the use of a novel decoy generation process, which involved the rational selection of proteins to add to the training set and included a significant energy zzso of the zzso The force field was tested on a large set of zzso for various proteins not included in the training set and shown to perform well compared with a leading force field in identifying the native zzso for these zzso
