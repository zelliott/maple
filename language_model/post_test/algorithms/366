zzso energy expenditure zzso is difficult to zzso especially under sedentary zzso Here, a model was developed using the detected type of physical activity zzso and movement intensity zzso based on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso the zzso with energy expenditure for PA as a zzso The relation between zzso zzso zzso and the type of PA was determined for standardized zzso as performed in a laboratory zzso zzso sitting, standing, and zzso zzso zzso was calculated from total energy expenditure zzso and sleeping zzso rate zzso as assessed with indirect zzso zzso zzso the model was validated over zzso intervals in a zzso zzso zzso were 15 healthy women zzso zzso years; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the chamber was significantly related to measured zzso both within zzso zzso and between zzso zzso zzso The explained variation in zzso by the model was higher than the explained variation by zzso zzso This shows that a zzso zzso zzso is a valid tool for zzso zzso under sedentary zzso
