This paper presents a control strategy, which is based on sliding mode control, zzso control, and fuzzy logic system for controlling the chaotic zzso We consider this control paradigm in chaotic systems where the equations of motion are not zzso The proposed control strategy is robust against the external noise zzso and system zzso variations and can be used to convert the chaotic orbits not only to the desired periodic ones but also to any desired chaotic zzso zzso results of controlling some typical higher order chaotic systems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control zzso
