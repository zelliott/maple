zzso zzso have been a useful tool in physical chemistry, zzso and more recently structural biology due to the polarized nature of the light they emit and that fact that energy can be transferred between zzso We present a practical scheme in which zzso of the intensity of zzso zzso can be used to determine limits on the mean and distribution of orientation of the zzso transition moment of zzso zzso We demonstrate how information about the orientation of zzso can be used to calculate the orientation factor zzso required for use in zzso zzso We illustrate the method using images of zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso zzso channel proteins in zzso zzso
