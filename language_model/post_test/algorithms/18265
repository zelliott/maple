There has been mounting evidence that many types of biological or technological networks possess a clustered zzso As many system functions depend on zzso it is important to investigate the zzso of complex clustered zzso Here we focus on one fundamental question: Under what condition can the network zzso be zzso In particular, since the two basic parameters characterizing a complex clustered network are the probabilities of zzso and zzso connections, we zzso in the corresponding two-dimensional zzso plane, regions where the network can be best zzso Our study yields a quite surprising zzso a complex clustered network is most zzso when the two probabilities match each other zzso zzso for instance caused by an overwhelming increase in the number of zzso zzso can zzso suppress or even destroy zzso even though such an increase tends to reduce the average network zzso This phenomenon provides possible principles for optimal synchronization on complex clustered zzso We provide extensive zzso evidence and an zzso theory to establish the zzso of this zzso
