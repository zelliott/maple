Even when there is agreement on what measure a protein multiple structure alignment should be zzso finding the optimal alignment is zzso zzso One approach used by many previous methods is aligned zzso pair zzso where short structural fragments from all the proteins are aligned against each other zzso and the final alignment chains these together in zzso consistent zzso zzso and zzso have recently suggested that adding geometric flexibility may help better model protein structures in a variety of zzso We introduce the program Matt zzso zzso with zzso and zzso an aligned zzso pair zzso zzso that, in intermediate steps, allows local flexibility between zzso small translations and zzso are temporarily allowed to bring sets of aligned fragments closer, even if they are physically impossible under rigid body zzso After a dynamic programming assembly guided by these zzso zzso geometric consistency is restored in the final step before the alignment is zzso Matt is tested against other recent multiple protein structure alignment programs on the popular zzso and zzso benchmark zzso zzso global performance is competitive with the other programs on zzso but zzso the other programs on zzso a benchmark of multiple structure alignments of proteins with more distant zzso On both zzso Matt demonstrates an ability to better align the ends of zzso and zzso an important characteristic of any structure alignment program intended to help construct a structural template library for zzso approaches to the inverse zzso zzso The related question of whether Matt alignments can be used to distinguish zzso zzso structure pairs from pairs of proteins that are not zzso is also zzso For this purpose, a zzso score based on the length of the common core and average root mean squared zzso zzso of Matt alignments is shown to largely separate zzso from zzso protein structures in the zzso benchmark zzso We zzso that zzso strong performance comes from its ability to model proteins in different zzso states and, perhaps even more important, its ability to model backbone zzso in more zzso related zzso
