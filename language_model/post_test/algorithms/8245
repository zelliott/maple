Noise and zzso are fundamental to biology and derive from the very nature of zzso reactions where zzso motion of molecules translates into randomness in the sequence and timing of zzso This randomness leads to zzso zzso even in zzso zzso zzso zzso networks are modeled as continuous time discrete state zzso processes whose probability density functions evolve according to a chemical master equation zzso The zzso is not zzso but for the simplest cases, and one has to resort to kinetic zzso Carlo techniques to simulate the zzso zzso of the zzso network under zzso A commonly used such zzso is the zzso simulation zzso zzso Because it tracks every zzso reaction that occurs in a given system, the zzso presents zzso difficulties especially when there is a vast disparity in the zzso of the reactions or in the number of molecules involved in these zzso This is common in cellular networks, and many approximation zzso have evolved to alleviate the zzso burdens of the zzso Here, we present a rigorously derived modified zzso framework based on the partition of a zzso reacting system into restricted and unrestricted zzso Although this modified zzso decomposition is as zzso difficult as the original zzso it can be naturally used to generate a hierarchy of approximations at different levels of zzso Most importantly, some previously derived zzso are demonstrated to be limiting cases of our zzso We apply our methods to biologically relevant test systems to demonstrate their accuracy and zzso
