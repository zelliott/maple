zzso enables to recover metals and organic zzso from waste conglomerates such zzso automotive zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as its zzso solid products, is a zzso and chemically varied mixture, containing mineral materials, including hazardous heavy zzso The aim of the work is to generate fundamental knowledge on the conversion of the organic zzso of the solid products after zzso zzso zzso treated at various temperatures and with two different types of zzso zzso pure steam or zzso zzso of zzso The research is conducted using a zzso zzso zzso with an integrated scale for zzso mass loss changes over time of experiment, serving as zzso zzso at zzso zzso and 760 zzso The reaction rate of zzso decomposition was investigated, based on carbon conversion during zzso and zzso zzso It was found in both zzso that zzso conversion rate decreases with the rise of external gas temperature, regardless of the zzso zzso No significant differences between the reaction rates undergoing with steam and oxygen for zzso decomposition has been zzso This abnormal zzso zzso might have been caused by the zzso effects of ash, especially zzso metals on zzso activity or due to deformation of zzso structure during zzso zzso
