Several methods in molecular population zzso have recently been described to estimate the amount and pattern of the DNA zzso in natural zzso and also to test the neutral theory of molecular zzso These methods are essential for understanding the molecular evolutionary zzso However, a comprehensive computer program for the analysis is not currently zzso 

Here we present zzso zzso zzso zzso version zzso a software package for Windows that performs extensive population zzso analyses on DNA sequence zzso zzso estimates several measures of DNA sequence variation within and between zzso linkage zzso zzso gene flow and gene conversion (a new zzso to detect gene conversion tracts has been zzso zzso can also carry out several tests of zzso those of zzso and zzso Hudson, zzso and zzso and zzso The results of the analyses are displayed in tabular and graphic zzso 

For academic zzso zzso is available via anonymous zzso zzso in the zzso
