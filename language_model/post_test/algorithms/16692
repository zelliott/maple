This paper presents a fully automated approach to detect the zzso and zzso borders in zzso ultrasound images based on zzso active zzso zzso To detect the zzso border, we zzso a new image feature applying a combination of short-term zzso calculated for the zzso zzso These feature values are employed to define an energy function of the active zzso called zzso cumulative short-term zzso zzso this energy function, the zzso border is separated accurately from the blood region contaminated by high zzso zzso To extract zzso boundary, we define a new form of energy function based on edge, texture and spring forces for the active zzso zzso this active zzso the zzso border is identified correctly even in presence of branch openings and zzso Experimental results indicate accuracy of the proposed zzso In addition, statistical analysis demonstrates high conformity between manual tracing and the results obtained by the proposed zzso
