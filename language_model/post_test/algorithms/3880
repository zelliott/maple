zzso zzso activity of zzso complex nerve cells has been zzso through a simplified zzso zzso of the original zzso The zzso for this zzso involves a zzso matching of the zzso zero and pole of the input zzso for each zzso This zzso can be used for both zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso The directional sensitivity of the zzso transfer in zzso zzso has been characterized by a decomposition which reveals the zzso zzso of the core geometry according to the opposite wave fronts of electronic zzso in zzso The zzso zzso can be used to estimate the goodness of the whole procedure in the frequency zzso The zzso zzso of the core geometry may serve as a basis of the compartment simulations of those excitable nerve cells where the zzso spread is modulated by irregular zzso structures, such as zzso
