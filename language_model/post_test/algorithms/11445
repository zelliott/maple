zzso approaches that combine zzso zzso and conventional imaging zzso have been shown to improve optical zzso zzso dramatically and thus represent a prevailing trend in zzso zzso These approaches typically involve applying anatomical templates from magnetic resonance zzso zzso images to guide the recovery of optical zzso However, merging these data sets using current technology requires multiple software packages, substantial expertise, significant zzso and often results in unacceptably poor mesh quality for optical image zzso a reality that represents a significant roadblock for zzso research of zzso zzso zzso This work addresses these challenges directly by introducing automated digital imaging and communications in medicine image stack zzso and a new zzso three-dimensional mesh generator zzso for zzso zzso imaging, and combining these capabilities into a single software package (available for free zzso with a streamlined zzso Image processing time and mesh quality benchmarks were examined for four common zzso zzso zzso zzso brain, zzso and small zzso and were compared to a commercial image processing zzso zzso these tools resulted in a fivefold decrease in image processing time and zzso improvement in minimum mesh quality, in the absence of extra mesh zzso These capabilities represent a significant step toward enabling zzso zzso zzso research for both expert and zzso users in an zzso zzso
