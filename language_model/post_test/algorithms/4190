In serial zzso a very incomplete partial data set is obtained from each zzso experiment (a zzso In some space groups, an indexing ambiguity exists which requires that the indexing mode of each snapshot needs to be established with respect to a reference data zzso In the absence of such zzso information, zzso have thus far resorted to a straight merging of all zzso yielding a perfectly twinned data set of higher symmetry which is poorly suited for structure solution and zzso Here, two zzso have been designed for assembling complete data sets by zzso those snapshots that are zzso in the same way, and they have been tested using zzso snapshots from zzso I zzso et zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso zzso and with noisy model zzso The results of the zzso are zzso and enabled the construction of complete data sets in the correct space group zzso instead of zzso zzso that researchers have been forced to use previously in such cases of indexing zzso The zzso thus extend the zzso and reach of serial zzso
