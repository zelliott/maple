This paper presents and analyzes a cascade direct zzso fuzzy control zzso scheme for a zzso zzso zzso Because the dynamic characteristic of the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso unstable zzso zzso system, it is difficult to design a suitable control scheme that simultaneously realizes real-time stabilization and accurate tracking control, and it is not easy to directly apply conventional zzso zzso strategies to this zzso zzso zzso the cascade zzso scheme including inner and outer control zzso is investigated for the stabilizing and tracking control of a zzso zzso zzso zzso The goal of the inner control loop is to design a zzso law so that the stick angle zzso can fit the stick angle command zzso derived from the stick angle reference zzso In the outer loop, the reference signal zzso is designed via an zzso path planner so that the cart position zzso tracks the cart position command zzso Moreover, all zzso zzso in the cascade zzso system are derived using the zzso stability analysis, so that system stability can be guaranteed in the entire zzso zzso Relying on this cascade structure, the stick angle and cart position zzso zzso will simultaneously zzso to zzso zzso simulations and experimental results are given to verify that the proposed cascade zzso system can achieve favorable stabilizing and tracking performance and is robust with regard to system zzso
