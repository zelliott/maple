In San Francisco, zzso reporting is primarily through passive zzso zzso and zzso reporting is primarily through zzso active zzso We conducted the registry linkage in 2010 using a sequential zzso 

The registry match included zzso zzso people who were reported starting in zzso zzso zzso people who were reported starting in 2001; and zzso zzso cases reported beginning in zzso Of the zzso and zzso cases, zzso and zzso were zzso with zzso zzso The majority of cases were white zzso however, black people were disproportionately zzso For more than zzso of the zzso cases, zzso sexual contact zzso who have sex with men zzso was the risk factor for zzso zzso zzso drug use was the most frequent risk factor for zzso infection among the zzso zzso however, zzso of the zzso zzso males were zzso but not injection drug zzso 

By linking the two zzso we found new ways to foster collaborative work and expand our zzso zzso This analysis identified particular populations at risk for zzso which can be used by viral zzso and zzso zzso zzso and treatment programs to zzso zzso target, and prioritize prevention services and clinical care within the community to maximize health zzso
