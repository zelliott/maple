Data from the Child Research Council zzso zzso were analyzed to model zzso growth changes in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in 31 boys and 36 girls between 3 and 10 years of zzso zzso modeling of growth changes allowed efficient estimates of bone size and bone growth variation to be obtained as well as comparisons of growth patterns within and between zzso The long bones displayed decelerating growth through time, with greater zzso for the larger lower limb zzso smaller upper zzso bones and the larger zzso zzso smaller zzso elements within zzso zzso for bone size and growth zzso is good both within and between zzso suggesting a common growth control mechanism that should make growth prediction zzso zzso for size, the zzso appears to be the most variable of these four long bones, which may be due to a combination of environmental effects and flexible growth zzso
