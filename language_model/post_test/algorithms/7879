The purpose of this study was to validate individual information zzso methods for handling missing data, using data samples of zzso We used a zzso approach to create six data zzso three physical activity outcome zzso zzso step counts, activity counts, and minutes of moderate to vigorous physical zzso for both groups zzso middle-aged adults and older zzso After analyzing each data set zzso we replaced missing values with two zzso and two group information zzso zzso Root mean square difference zzso mean signed difference, paired zzso tests, and zzso correlations were used to determine the effectiveness of the various recovery zzso Overall, the zzso methods showed smaller zzso than the zzso methods for each data set in both zzso We found no significant mean differences between the known values and the replacement values in all zzso The zzso methods produced better results than zzso zzso We determined substituting missing data points using the average of days remaining to be an accurate missing data recovery method for middle-aged adults' and older zzso and zzso zzso
