The ability to predict complete zzso response or sensitivity to radiation before treatment would have a significant impact on the selection of patients for zzso zzso or zzso therapy zzso The aim of this study was to determine the value of zzso growth factor zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso of complete zzso zzso zzso in patients undergoing zzso zzso for advanced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from predominantly zzso patients undergoing a zzso zzso zzso protocol were zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was evaluated by three zzso zzso scores for zzso marker zzso were obtained by zzso characteristic zzso curve zzso The association of marker expression with complete zzso response was zzso in zzso and multivariable zzso zzso zzso of the independent protein markers were zzso In multivariable analysis, loss of zzso zzso odds ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso and positive zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso both demonstrated independent zzso value for complete zzso zzso The odds of complete response were zzso for the zzso combination of zzso and zzso zzso Of the 34 zzso and zzso cases, 32 zzso had no complete zzso zzso The combined analysis of zzso and zzso is zzso of complete zzso response in patients undergoing zzso zzso In addition, the findings of this study have identified a zzso of simultaneous zzso and zzso patients who are highly resistant to zzso and should perhaps be considered candidates for innovative zzso combined zzso
