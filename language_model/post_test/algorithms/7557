zzso targets on grouping the samples zzso and zzso and the features zzso words and zzso zzso It employs the dual relation and the bilateral information between the samples and zzso In many real-world applications, data usually reside on a zzso of the ambient zzso space, but it is zzso to estimate the intrinsic zzso of the data space in a zzso zzso In this paper, we focus on improving the zzso performance via zzso ensemble learning, which is able to zzso approximate the intrinsic zzso of both the sample and feature zzso To achieve this, we develop a novel zzso zzso called zzso zzso zzso based on zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso data zzso into three zzso This method considers the zzso relationship revealed by the zzso data zzso and also the zzso information reflected by the affinity zzso zzso on the sample and feature data zzso Specifically, we assume that the intrinsic zzso of the sample or feature space lies in a convex zzso of some zzso candidate zzso We want to learn a convex combination of them to zzso approach the desired intrinsic zzso To zzso the objective function, the zzso rules are zzso to update the zzso zzso In addition, both the zzso mirror descent zzso and the coordinate descent zzso are exploited to learn the zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments on documents, images, and gene expression data sets have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed zzso compared with other well-established zzso
