A PRESS zzso zzso zzso sequence for the improved detection of the C2 zzso of zzso zzso and zzso at approximately zzso is presented in this zzso It is shown that for spins like the C2 zzso of zzso which are involved solely in weak zzso zzso the chemical shift displacement effect can be turned to advantage by exploiting PRESS zzso zzso with zzso less than the chemical shift difference between the target spins and the spins to which they are zzso zzso The zzso PRESS sequence allows zzso of the zzso evolution of the target zzso in the zzso of interest independently of echo time yielding signal equivalent to that which can be obtained with a zzso acquire sequence zzso ideal zzso and ignoring zzso zzso The total echo time of PRESS was set long enough for the zzso of zzso signal and the two echo times were zzso zzso so that the zzso signal at zzso suffered minimal contamination from zzso The efficacy of the method was verified on phantom solutions of zzso and on brain in zzso
