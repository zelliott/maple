Based on zzso zzso theory and zzso zzso generation of zzso double zzso by modulating thickness of the buffer layer of zzso volume holographic grating zzso is zzso Expressions of zzso field when a zzso pulse incidents on the zzso are zzso zzso results show when thickness of the buffer layer increases from zzso to 11 zzso or even larger, one incident pulse splits into double zzso zzso with the same duration and peak intensity, and pulse zzso is zzso zzso to the zzso The reason of these phenomena is due to the interference of zzso waves reconstructed from two zzso and phase shift resulting from the buffer layer zzso zzso of zzso double zzso is explained by group time delay of periodic zzso It is shown that the slope of the pulse zzso with respect to the thickness of buffer layer is 2 times of that of pulse zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate it is possible to control the output double zzso duration and pulse zzso by varying the grating zzso
