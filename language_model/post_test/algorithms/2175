Several mathematical models to predict tissue adaptation have been derived since Julius Wolff proposed a zzso relationship for zzso These can be formulated as zzso procedures zzso to predict bone adaptation around zzso The objective of this paper was to further develop the zzso algorithm, to test its zzso and to determine the relationship between it and zzso based on strain zzso This was achieved using finite element models of the zzso zzso one for the intact case and another for the case where a zzso hip zzso is zzso The finite models were generated using CT scan zzso zzso bone zzso patterns around a zzso zzso following total hip zzso were zzso for both zzso and zzso adaptation zzso It is found that the zzso zzso can successfully predict the zzso zzso zzso in response to altered mechanical loading provided that account is taken of the zzso nature of damage zzso zzso are made using a strain energy stimulus for comparison with the damage zzso and a theoretical relationship between the two is zzso It is shown that an advantage of the damage approach over the zzso approach is that the zzso required to replicate clinically observed zzso patterns can be derived zzso whereas for zzso zzso empirical relationships are zzso
