The zzso of individual ancestry from genetic data has become essential to applied population zzso and genetic zzso Software programs for calculating ancestry estimates have become essential tools in the zzso zzso zzso 

Here we describe four enhancements to zzso a zzso tool for zzso individual zzso and population zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso First, zzso can be used to estimate the number of underlying populations through zzso Second, individuals of known ancestry can be exploited in supervised learning to yield more precise ancestry zzso Third, by zzso small zzso zzso for each individual, one can encourage model zzso often yielding more zzso results for small zzso or zzso with large numbers of ancestral zzso Finally, by exploiting multiple processors, large zzso can be analyzed even more zzso 

The enhancements we have described make zzso a more accurate, efficient, and versatile tool for ancestry zzso
