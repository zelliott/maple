We use transmission and zzso optical zzso zzso zzso to distinguish and zzso dependent and multiple scattering effects in zzso zzso With transmission zzso the dependent scattering zzso for a range of zzso zzso particle suspensions are zzso An excellent agreement is observed between the measured dependent scattering zzso and calculations based on zzso calculations, the zzso zzso distribution function, and coherent light scattering zzso zzso zzso zzso are fitted using the extended zzso zzso model with the dependent scattering zzso obtained from the transmission zzso zzso as input zzso Good agreement between the zzso model and the zzso zzso zzso is zzso For large zzso the zzso scattering angle zzso obtained from the zzso fit is in fair agreement with zzso calculated from the transmission zzso zzso
