The potential of diffusion zzso imaging zzso in brain imaging in terms of the in zzso mapping of zzso is generally zzso Mostly, analyses of deep brain structures were based on complex methodical zzso In the present study, the zzso of groups of zzso zzso with similar projection characteristics was investigated in healthy human subjects using a novel differentiated zzso zzso approach of zzso data without the use of statistical zzso With the application of this directional zzso zzso of the longest zzso of every zzso zzso at least three functional groups in the zzso with different projection directions could be zzso The method displayed, zzso a high symmetry and stability in the analysis of the individual zzso In zzso substantial zzso information can be gained for deep zzso gray matter structures such as the zzso with an improved detection and directional differentiation of zzso zzso
