A diffusion model for simple reaction time zzso and zzso order judgment zzso tasks was developed to account for a commonly observed zzso between these 2 tasks: Most stimulus zzso zzso zzso have larger effects in zzso tasks than in zzso zzso The model assumes that a detection criterion determines the level of sensory evidence needed to conclude that a stimulus has been zzso Analysis of the performance that would be achieved with different possible criterion settings revealed that performance was optimal with a lower criterion setting for the zzso task than for the zzso zzso In addition, the model predicts that effects of stimulus zzso should increase with the size of the detection zzso Thus, the model suggests that commonly observed zzso between zzso and zzso tasks may simply be due to performance zzso in the face of conflicting task zzso
