The zzso zzso based zzso program has been developed for variable selection in zzso zzso The modified zzso was employed to obtain a zzso model with high internal zzso using a small number of zzso In order to show the performance of zzso for variable selection, the program was applied to the inhibitor activity of calcium channel zzso As a result, variables largely contributing to the zzso activity could be selected, and the structural requirements for the zzso activity could be estimated in an effective zzso
