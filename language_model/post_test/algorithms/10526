We discuss recent highlights from research at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, regarding the use of zzso zzso to control magnetic moments in zzso zzso zzso We highlight progress on reducing the critical currents necessary to produce zzso magnetic zzso quantitative zzso of the magnitude and direction of the spin zzso in magnetic tunnel zzso and zzso zzso of the magnetic dynamics generated during zzso assisted zzso zzso
