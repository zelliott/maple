zzso theoretical foundations for learning is a key step towards understanding zzso zzso from zzso is a paradigm in which systems zzso or zzso learn a functional relationship from a training set of zzso Within this zzso a learning zzso is a map from the space of training sets to the hypothesis space of possible functional zzso A central question for the theory is to determine conditions under which a learning zzso will zzso from its finite training set to novel zzso A milestone in learning theory was a characterization of conditions on the hypothesis space that ensure zzso for the natural class of empirical risk zzso zzso learning zzso that are based on minimizing the error on the training zzso Here we provide conditions for zzso in terms of a precise stability property of the learning process: when the training set is zzso by deleting one example, the learned hypothesis does not change zzso This stability property stipulates conditions on the learning map rather than on the hypothesis space, zzso the classical theory for zzso zzso and is zzso to more general zzso The surprising connection between stability and zzso has implications for the foundations of learning theory and for the design of novel zzso and provides insights into problems as diverse as language learning and inverse problems in physics and zzso
