zzso learning zzso are among the most advanced machine learning methods and have been successfully applied to a variety of sequence zzso tasks within the field of zzso Conventional kernels zzso so far do not provide an easy interpretation of the zzso representations in terms of zzso and compositional zzso of the underlying biological zzso 

We propose a zzso approach to zzso on biological zzso With our method it is possible to model and analyze zzso zzso of zzso of any length in a natural zzso On one hand this is achieved by mapping the sequences to an intuitive but zzso feature space, zzso for interpretation of the zzso zzso On the other hand, by means of the kernel trick we can provide a general learning zzso for that zzso representation because all required statistics can be zzso without performing an explicit feature space mapping of the zzso By introducing a kernel zzso that controls the degree of zzso our feature space representation can be tailored to the characteristics of the biological problem at zzso A zzso learning scheme enables application even to biological problems for which only small sets of example sequences are zzso Our approach includes a zzso method for transparent representation of characteristic sequence zzso Thereby importance of features can be measured in terms of zzso strength with respect to zzso of the underlying zzso To demonstrate and validate our concept on a zzso zzso case, we analyze zzso coli translation initiation sites in order to show that we can find biologically relevant zzso For that case, our results clearly show that the zzso sequence is the most important signal upstream a start zzso The zzso in position and composition we found for that signal is in accordance with previous biological zzso We also find evidence for signals downstream of the start zzso previously introduced as zzso zzso These signals are mainly characterized by zzso of zzso in a region of about 4 zzso next to the start zzso 

We showed that the zzso kernel can provide a valuable tool for the analysis of relevant signals in biological zzso In the case of translation initiation sites we could clearly deduce the most zzso motifs and their zzso variation from example zzso zzso features of our approach are its flexibility with respect to zzso length and position zzso By means of these two parameters zzso kernels can easily be adapted to different biological zzso
