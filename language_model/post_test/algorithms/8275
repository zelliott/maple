Use of an zzso reality zzso soft tissue navigation system in zzso zzso surgery is an evolving zzso 

To evaluate a novel soft tissue navigation system developed to enhance the zzso perception and to provide decision-making guidance directly before initiation of kidney zzso for zzso partial zzso zzso 

zzso navigation zzso a mobile zzso capable of zzso imaging, and a standard personal computer were zzso The feasibility and zzso of zzso tracking principles were evaluated in a zzso model with an artificially created zzso tumor in zzso The same zzso was then incorporated into clinical practice during zzso 

zzso of a fully automated zzso tracking system was repeated in exactly the same way for 10 different zzso zzso zzso Additionally, 10 patients underwent zzso zzso under manual zzso guidance by one zzso 

The navigation errors and zzso times were determined in zzso The mean operative time, time to locate the zzso and positive surgical margin were assessed in zzso 

The system was able to navigate and zzso the virtually created images and real-time images with an error margin of only zzso zzso and fully automated initial image acquisition took 40 zzso The mean operative time was 165 zzso zzso zzso zzso and mean time to locate the tumor was 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso None of the cases required conversion to open zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso margins in all 10 zzso 

This novel zzso tracking system proved to be functional with a reasonable margin of error and zzso registration zzso zzso the zzso or zzso imaging properties on real-time zzso images in a real-time manner will simplify and increase the precision of zzso zzso
