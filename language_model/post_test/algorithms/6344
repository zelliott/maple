Information about the zzso zzso in a zzso network will enable understanding of the function of the network and quantitative prediction of the network responses to genetic and environmental zzso Despite recent advances in experimental techniques, such information is limited and existing experimental data show extensive variation and they are based on in zzso zzso In this article, we present a zzso framework based on the well-established zzso zzso of zzso control zzso The framework employs a zzso Carlo sampling procedure to simulate the uncertainty in the kinetic data and applies statistical tools for the identification of the zzso steps in zzso zzso We applied the proposed framework to a zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the results allowed us to interpret and predict the responses of zzso networks to genetic and environmental changes, and to gain insights on how uncertainty in the kinetic mechanisms and kinetic parameters zzso into the uncertainty in predicting network zzso Some of the practical applications of the proposed approach include the identification of drug targets for zzso diseases and the guidance for design strategies in zzso engineering for the purposeful manipulation of the metabolism of industrial zzso
