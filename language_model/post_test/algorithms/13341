The zzso of prostate in CT images is of essential importance to external beam zzso which is one of the major treatments for prostate cancer zzso During the zzso the prostate is radiated by zzso zzso rays from different zzso In order to maximize the dose to the cancer and minimize the dose to the surrounding healthy zzso zzso zzso and zzso the prostate in the new treatment image needs to be accurately zzso zzso the effectiveness and efficiency of external beam zzso highly depend on the accurate zzso of the zzso However, due to the low contrast of the prostate with its surrounding zzso zzso zzso the zzso prostate motion, and the large appearance variations across different treatment days, it is challenging to segment the prostate in CT zzso In this paper, the authors present a novel zzso based zzso method to address these zzso 

To segment the zzso the proposed method first uses sparse representation based zzso zzso to enhance the prostate in CT images by zzso zzso in order to overcome the limitation of poor contrast of the prostate zzso Then, based on the zzso results, previous segmented zzso of the same patient are used as zzso zzso to align onto the current treatment image and the majority voting strategy is finally adopted to segment the zzso In order to address the limitations of the traditional zzso in zzso zzso especially for the purpose of zzso the authors extend zzso from the following four aspects: zzso A zzso zzso learning method is proposed to learn a zzso and compact representation of training samples for each class so that the zzso power of zzso can be increased and also zzso can be applied to the large-scale zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso sparse coding is replaced by the elastic net in order to obtain a smooth and clear prostate boundary in the zzso zzso zzso zzso linear zzso is incorporated to improve the zzso performance and to extend zzso from hard zzso to soft zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed by using context information to zzso refine the zzso zzso 

The proposed method has been zzso evaluated on a zzso consisting of 330 CT images from 24 zzso The effectiveness of the extended zzso has been validated by comparing it with the traditional zzso based on the proposed four zzso The experimental results show that our extended zzso can obtain not only more accurate zzso results but also zzso and clearer prostate boundary than the traditional zzso Besides, the comparison with other five state-of-the-art prostate zzso methods indicates that our method can achieve better performance than other methods under zzso 

The authors have proposed a novel prostate zzso method based on the sparse representation based zzso which can achieve considerably accurate zzso results in CT prostate zzso
