An efficient zzso is presented for the zzso of zzso zzso operations with arbitrary zzso flat structuring elements zzso The required computing time is independent of the image content and of the number of gray levels zzso It always zzso the only existing comparable method, which was proposed in the work by Van zzso and zzso by a factor between zzso and zzso depending on the image type and shape of zzso So far, filtering using multiple zzso is always done by performing the operator for each size and shape of the zzso zzso With our method, filtering with multiple zzso can be performed by a single operator for a slightly reduced zzso cost per size or shape, which makes this method more suitable for use in zzso zzso scale spaces, and template matching using the hit-or-miss zzso The discussion focuses on zzso and zzso from which other transformations can be zzso
