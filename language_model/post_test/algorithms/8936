In most ecological studies, zzso variation is a nuisance that obscures patterns of interest and reduces statistical zzso However, patterns of zzso zzso often contain information about ecological zzso In particular, such patterns can be used to detect positive growth zzso zzso variation in growth rates among individuals in a cohort across time), even in samples of unmarked zzso Previous methods for detecting zzso growth required data from marked zzso We propose a method that requires only estimates of zzso zzso through time, using maximum likelihood methods to obtain point estimates and confidence intervals of the correlation zzso We test our method on simulated data sets and determine the loss in statistical power due to the inability to identify zzso We show how to accommodate zzso growth zzso and test the effects of zzso mortality on our zzso zzso The method can detect significant growth zzso at moderate levels of zzso with zzso zzso (for example, statistical power of zzso to detect growth zzso zzso zzso in a cohort of 100 individuals measured on 16 zzso We present a case study of growth in the zzso tree zzso Better zzso of the processes driving size variation will help ecologists improve predictions of population zzso This work will help researchers to detect growth zzso in cases where marking is zzso zzso or causes unacceptable decreases in the fitness of marked zzso
