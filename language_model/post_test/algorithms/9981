The zzso approximation zzso and the zzso approximation zzso are commonly applied to include the electron properties like transport and rate zzso into a zzso description of gas discharge zzso Both the approaches base on the solution of the stationary zzso homogeneous zzso equation for the electron zzso but the consequences of these approaches differ zzso These consequences of using both the approaches are studied and discussed on a kinetic level and by comparison of results of zzso investigations of zzso glow discharge zzso It is found that the zzso is to be strongly recommended for the application to a zzso description of zzso as well as zzso discharge zzso while the zzso is zzso suitable to describe zzso glow zzso with rough reaction zzso only and its application to zzso discharge zzso is zzso
