Three different powder preparations of the drug zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sodium zzso name zzso have been fully dehydrated in a vacuum and their water vapor zzso characteristics zzso assessed at different water vapor pressures over a temperature range 20 to 40 degrees zzso At saturated vapor pressures, zzso zzso rates of zzso are around zzso zzso zzso of square root of time against reduced mass during zzso of water vapor at vapor pressures in the range 20 to 47 zzso of zzso all equivalent to zzso zzso indicate control by a diffusion mechanism with zzso energies in the range 8 to 24 zzso zzso dependent on the powder preparation zzso In two of the zzso zzso zzso plots are interpreted as showing that control of the process is dependent on the zzso ability to hold water molecules at the experimental zzso The variation in zzso energies and the calculated values for zzso around 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso are used to explore structural involvement in the overall water zzso zzso The measured values of water vapor zzso into the structure have been used to predict the water zzso of zzso sodium zzso and the results show good agreement to reported zzso This approach to zzso prediction is an alternative to the zzso and Whitney method where zzso leaving the surface are zzso
