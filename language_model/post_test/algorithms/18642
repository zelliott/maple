zzso zzso zzso experiments using the accordion principle for measuring zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in proteins are zzso The resolution of the resulting zzso is identical to that of the zzso zzso zzso and the sensitivity of the corresponding zzso acquisitions are only slightly lower than those obtained with zzso zzso and zzso zzso pulse sequences due to an additional delay zzso For cases of limited resolution in the zzso zzso zzso spectrum the current pulse sequences can easily be modified into zzso versions by introducing a poorly digitized third dimension, if so zzso The experiments described here are a valuable addition to the suites available for determination of residual zzso zzso in biological zzso
