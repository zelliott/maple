We have developed a new method for predicting zzso positions in zzso proteins that is intended primarily for comparative modeling and other applications where high precision is zzso Unlike zzso packing zzso designed for zzso zzso zzso we assume that knowledge is available about the qualitative placement of all zzso However, even among zzso zzso the corresponding zzso can demonstrate substantial differences in positions and zzso and for this reason, improperly positioned zzso can contribute significantly to the overall backbone zzso zzso zzso of comparative zzso A zzso packing zzso for use in comparative modeling must obtain high precision to be useful, and for this reason we zzso an zzso protein force field zzso and a zzso Born zzso zzso zzso To reduce the zzso expense associated with using a detailed, zzso energy function, we have developed new zzso and zzso zzso for sampling the zzso and zzso zzso We validate the method using a test suite of 33 cases, which are drawn from a diverse set of high-resolution crystal zzso The zzso positions are reproduced with an average backbone zzso of zzso A, while the average backbone zzso of the complete zzso region zzso the zzso with the surrounding zzso which are also zzso is zzso zzso
