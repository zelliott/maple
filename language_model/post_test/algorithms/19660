The zzso of BK channels by zzso is highly zzso with small changes in zzso zzso concentration having large effects on open probability zzso Here we examine the mechanism of cooperative zzso of BK channels by zzso Each of the four zzso of BK channels has a large zzso zzso zzso with two different zzso zzso zzso an zzso sensor zzso located on the zzso zzso of zzso of zzso domain and a zzso sensor located on or after the zzso zzso To determine interactions among these zzso sensors, we examine channels with eight different zzso of functional zzso zzso sensors on the four zzso We find that the zzso sensor and zzso bowl contribute about equally to zzso zzso of the channel when there is only one zzso zzso sensor per zzso We also find that an zzso sensor and a zzso bowl on the same zzso are much more effective in increasing zzso than when they are on different zzso indicating positive zzso zzso If it is assumed that BK channels have a gating ring similar to zzso channels with alternating zzso and zzso zzso and that the zzso sensors act at the flexible (rather than zzso zzso between zzso zzso then a comparison of the distribution of zzso sensors with the observed responses suggest that the interface between zzso and zzso zzso on the same zzso is zzso On this basis, zzso zzso arises because two zzso zzso sensors acting across a flexible interface are more effective in opening the channel than when acting at separate zzso An zzso model incorporating zzso zzso zzso within zzso zzso could approximate the zzso zzso zzso response for eight possible zzso zzso of the zzso zzso sensors as well as for three additional zzso from a previous zzso
