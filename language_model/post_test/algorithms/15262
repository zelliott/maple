zzso a protein into one of its folds is a transitional step for discovering three zzso protein structure, which is a challenging task in zzso zzso zzso The present research focuses on: 1) the development of zzso and 2) the development of feature extraction techniques based on zzso and/or zzso zzso 

Apart from the above two main categories of research, we have shown that the selection of zzso attributes of the zzso acids is an important step in protein fold recognition and has not been explored zzso We have presented a zzso successive feature selection zzso approach to systematically select zzso The proposed method is applied on protein sequence data and an improvement of around zzso in fold recognition has been noted when selecting attributes zzso 

The zzso has been applied successfully in selecting zzso attributes of the zzso zzso The selected attributes show improved protein fold recognition zzso
