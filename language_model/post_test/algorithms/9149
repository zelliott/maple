This paper proposes a new method for removing noise and blurring from zzso zzso zzso The main contribution is the definition of a zzso generating model of a 3-D zzso which is capable to zzso describe a wide class of 3-D zzso Unlike other approaches, the zzso structure allows the model to consider the information on edge locations, if zzso A suitable description of the image acquisition process, including blurring and noise, is then associated to the zzso A zzso realization is finally zzso which is amenable to the application of standard Kalman filter as an image restoration zzso The so obtained method is able to remove, at each spatial step, both blur and noise, via a linear minimum zzso zzso zzso zzso which does not require the simultaneous processing of the whole zzso zzso results on synthetic and real zzso images confirm the merit of the zzso
