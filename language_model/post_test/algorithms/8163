zzso zzso zzso determine the rates of protein folding reactions and can serve as molecular switches and zzso In the zzso of zzso zzso zzso trans zzso zzso zzso in a hinge region controls the assembly of the 2 zzso zzso and zzso and, in reverse, the zzso of the zzso for zzso We zzso the structural and energetic basis of this zzso domain assembly at the level of individual zzso by real-time zzso zzso A local cluster of zzso hydrogen bonds, remote from zzso is stabilized up to zzso by trans zzso zzso zzso This network of hydrogen bonds mediates domain assembly and is connected with zzso by rigid backbone zzso Thus, zzso zzso switching is zzso in a specific and directional fashion to change the protein structure and stability at a distant zzso
