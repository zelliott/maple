zzso procedures for identifying zzso zzso on proteins have been developed, including experimental as well as zzso zzso However, most of these techniques focus on continuous zzso whereas fast and reliable identification and zzso of zzso zzso remains barely zzso In this paper, we describe a zzso zzso for the detection of zzso zzso on zzso The zzso uses a given protein zzso structure as zzso and combines a per zzso zzso accessibility constraint with zzso to zzso shape zzso measures and binding energies for assigning zzso zzso in the zzso zzso We have developed the procedure on a given set of 26 zzso complexes with a known structure, and have further expanded the available zzso shapes by generating a virtual zzso library in order to improve the screening for candidate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso on the 26 given zzso with known zzso zzso resulted in the correct identification of the spatial proximity of 12 zzso interaction zzso Combining zzso accessibility, shape zzso and binding energies towards the identification of zzso zzso clearly zzso approaches solely considering accessibility and zzso distance zzso
