zzso sequences are the result of long and complex pathways of zzso Many of the features zzso in them are the result of a series of evolutionary zzso including selection, genetic zzso zzso Following this, protein families have a great amount of unexplored information that can be useful for many purposes beyond simple evolutionary zzso An index is presented here which permits the zzso of regions showing an unexpected degree of zzso or zzso This index uses the information contained in sequence alignments and compares the observed over expected level of zzso using tables for the relative likelihood of zzso acid zzso
