The currently accepted zzso zzso tuberculosis zzso detection method for veterinary applications is that of zzso from a tissue sample post zzso The test is accurate, but growing zzso zzso is difficult and the process can take up to 12 weeks to return a zzso In this paper we evaluate a much faster screening approach based on serum zzso analysis using selected zzso flow tube mass zzso zzso zzso is a zzso quantitative gas analysis technique, with sample analysis times of as little as a few zzso zzso from above serum samples from wild zzso captured as part of a zzso trial, was zzso zzso zzso zzso were then employed to extract a simple zzso diagnosis from the complex zzso response provided by the zzso zzso This is the first time that such zzso analysis has been applied to zzso zzso An accuracy of zzso discrimination of approximately zzso true positive was achieved which shows promise, but the corresponding false positive rate of 38% indicates that there is more work to do before this approach could replace the culture zzso zzso for future work that could increase the performance are therefore zzso
