Recently, it has been shown with large data sets of extinct zzso that zzso lineages experienced higher zzso and extinction zzso with extant zzso it has been shown that body size evolution is accelerated during zzso zzso it is interesting to investigate whether zzso body size evolution is faster in zzso zzso zzso analysis assuming zzso zzso rates suggested that the rate of body size evolution increases with body size, whereas size differences in recent sister species zzso are little affected by species zzso appear to be independent of zzso This supports the hypothesis that high rates of species turnover increase the rate at which zzso differences accumulate in zzso zzso whereas rates of evolution in single lineages are approximately size zzso Similarly, these findings support the notion that zzso body size evolution is indeed concentrated in zzso zzso
