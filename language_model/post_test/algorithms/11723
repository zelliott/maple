In our previous work, we developed a novel approach to dynamic image data zzso and demonstrated that very high zzso ratios can be achieved while preserving relevant kinetic zzso However, the technique has not yet been assessed with clinical zzso Many issues need to be addressed to tailor the method for clinical zzso In this paper, we apply the zzso technique to dynamic zzso zzso zzso brain zzso zzso zzso zzso data, using a zzso model to include cerebral blood volume zzso and partial volume zzso zzso zzso images generated from the compressed data are compared with those from the original zzso zzso We show that the storage requirements for a typical clinical dynamic PET image data set can be reduced by more than zzso without degradation of image zzso Furthermore, the technique greatly reduces the zzso complexity of further clinical image zzso such as smoothing and generation of functional zzso It is expected that the zzso technique will be of benefit in image data management and zzso
