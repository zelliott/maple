zzso on zzso Reality zzso have recently received zzso With these, the zzso zzso market has started to be active and there are numerous efforts to apply this to real life in all sectors of zzso To date, the zzso market has applied the existing zzso zzso technology in entertainment, business and other zzso With the existing zzso zzso technology, a designated object can only be loaded on the screen from one marker and a marker has to be added to load on the screen the same object zzso This situation creates a problem where the relevant zzso be extracted and printed in screen so that loading of the multiple objects is zzso However, since the distance between markers will not be measured in the process of detecting and copying zzso the markers can be overlapped and thus the objects would not be zzso To solve this problem, a circle having the longest radius needs to be created from a focal point of a marker to be copied, so that no object is copied within the confines of the zzso In this paper, software-based sensing technology for multiple object detection and loading using zzso has been developed and overlapping marker control according to multiple object control has been studied using the zzso and Mean Shift zzso
