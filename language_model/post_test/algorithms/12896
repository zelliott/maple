We thoroughly analyze the linear propagation effects that affect zzso Second zzso Generation imaging of thick zzso zzso such as zzso zzso We develop a theoretical model that fully accounts for zzso and zzso along the zzso zzso and polarization scrambling upon scattering of the harmonic zzso We obtain an excellent agreement with zzso zzso images at increasing depth within a zzso zzso for both zzso of the forward zzso zzso Most notably, we observe interference fringes due to zzso in the zzso depth profile when excited at zzso angle from the zzso zzso We also measure zzso decrease of zzso zzso zzso with depth due to zzso of the zzso We therefore derive a method that proves reliable to determine both zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso
