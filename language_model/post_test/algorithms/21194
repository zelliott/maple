Making sound zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso requires both an accurate prediction of protein concentration and a credible estimate of its zzso We present a method using zzso zzso statistical models zzso penalized constrained least squares fitting zzso and zzso Carlo simulation zzso to predict zzso zzso protein zzso and estimate their prediction zzso We contrast the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso method with a zzso zzso zzso least zzso method using simulated and real zzso zzso data zzso rendered good fits in almost all tests, including those with left and/or right clipped standard zzso zzso predictions were zzso more zzso especially at the extremes of the prediction zzso zzso provided credible zzso prediction intervals for both zzso and zzso fits that were superior to zzso zzso intervals in achieving the target statistical zzso zzso was more reliable when automated prediction across simultaneous zzso was applied routinely with minimal user zzso
