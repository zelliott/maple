The zzso of rod responses to flashes and steps of light was studied as a function of background intensity zzso at the zzso and zzso cell levels in the zzso zzso zzso of the rod zzso were recorded zzso in the zzso and as zzso mass zzso across the isolated, zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso transmitted signal was derived from the zzso of zzso cell spike zzso recorded zzso in the zzso In all states of adaptation the zzso rod response to dim flashes could be zzso as the impulse response of a chain of zzso filters with the same number of zzso 4 zzso or 4-6 zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso at 12 degrees C was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Under background light, the time scale shortened as a power function of background intensity, zzso with b zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso time scale of the zzso signal at the zzso cell agreed well with that of the zzso zzso The apparent underlying impulse response had zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in darkness and accelerated as zzso with b zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso transmission delay shortened by zzso between darkness and a background delivering ca zzso zzso per rod per zzso Data from the literature suggest that all zzso zzso may accelerate according to similar power functions of adapting intensity, with zzso in the range zzso It is noteworthy that the time scale of human zzso vision in experiments on flicker sensitivity and zzso zzso shortens as a power function of mean zzso with b approximately zzso
