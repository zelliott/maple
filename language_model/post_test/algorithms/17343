zzso of large zzso zzso zzso channels is controlled by both zzso zzso and membrane zzso To study the mechanism of zzso zzso we examined zzso zzso zzso currents in excised zzso from zzso zzso in the virtual absence of zzso zzso zzso In response to a zzso step, zzso activates with an exponential time course, following a brief zzso The delay suggests that rapid transitions zzso channel zzso The later exponential time course suggests that zzso also involves a slower zzso zzso However, the time constant of zzso relaxation zzso exhibits a complex zzso dependence that is inconsistent with models that contain a single rate limiting zzso zzso increases zzso with zzso from zzso to zzso zzso with an equivalent charge zzso of only zzso zzso and displays a stronger zzso dependence from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which then decreases from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Similarly, the steady state zzso relationship exhibits a maximum zzso dependence zzso zzso 2 zzso from 0 to zzso zzso and is zzso zzso dependent zzso zzso with zzso zzso at more negative zzso where zzso zzso zzso These results can be understood in terms of a gating scheme where a central transition between a closed and an open zzso is zzso regulated by the state of four independent and identical zzso zzso In the absence of zzso this zzso mechanism results in a gating scheme with five closed zzso and five open zzso states, where the majority of the channel's zzso dependence results from rapid zzso and zzso zzso whereas the zzso transitions are rate limiting and zzso zzso zzso These conclusions not only provide a framework for interpreting studies of large zzso zzso zzso channel zzso zzso but also have important implications for understanding the mechanism of zzso zzso
