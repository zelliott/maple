In this paper, an zzso online zzso decision fusion zzso framework is developed for image analysis and computer vision zzso In this zzso it is assumed that the compound zzso consists of several zzso each of which yields its own decision as a real number centered around zero, representing the confidence level of that particular zzso zzso values are zzso combined with weights that are updated online according to an active fusion method based on performing zzso projections onto convex sets describing zzso It is assumed that there is an zzso who is usually a human operator, providing feedback to the decision fusion zzso A zzso wildfire detection system was developed to evaluate the performance of the decision fusion zzso In this case, image data arrive zzso and the zzso is the security guard of the forest lookout tower, zzso the decision of the combined zzso The simulation results are zzso
