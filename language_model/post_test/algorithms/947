A combined analysis of zzso accessibility and flexibility parameters of the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso virus zzso zzso zzso was used to select 10 regions for synthesis of zzso or zzso zzso zzso Nine of these sites are probably exposed on the surface of the zzso as zzso zzso against either zzso zzso or zzso H bound to these peptides as tested by zzso zzso zzso Nevertheless, human zzso from acute or chronic zzso infection did not bind significantly to any zzso indicating that the selected sites do not function as natural complete zzso All zzso raised in rabbits against zzso zzso zzso peptides had a high zzso to the zzso zzso and nine of them bound to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso H as tested in zzso None of the zzso had zzso zzso and only one zzso (against zzso zzso had a zzso zzso zzso of zzso Only a minority of the zzso were positive in Western zzso (four of 10), zzso zzso of 10) or zzso (three of zzso The results indicate that the computer program used in this analysis can predict zzso areas of zzso H but that the small peptides zzso have little resemblance to natural zzso zzso
