The zzso projection is used widely in imaging of the lower vascular zzso Much of the evidence zzso the zzso projection is zzso This study compares the sensitivity of the zzso (AP) projection alone in lower limb vascular zzso zzso to that combined with the zzso zzso 110 digitally zzso zzso were zzso initially on zzso and subsequently on zzso zzso Oblique imaging increases confidence, demonstrates zzso not seen on zzso and changes the zzso This supports the use of the zzso projection in lower limb vascular zzso zzso
