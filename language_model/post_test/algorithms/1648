zzso in zzso the gene zzso the zzso zzso of cardiac zzso channels, cause a spectrum of zzso zzso Of these, zzso zzso zzso dysfunction occurs in patients with both zzso and zzso zzso zzso We explored for corresponding zzso in SAN function and zzso zzso and clarified possible mechanisms underlying these in an established mouse long zzso syndrome type 3 model carrying a zzso equivalent to human zzso zzso zzso of SAN function in living animals and in zzso zzso preparations were compared with cellular SAN and two-dimensional tissue models exploring the consequences of zzso zzso zzso mice showed prolonged zzso zzso and corrected zzso intervals confirming long zzso zzso They showed frequent episodes of zzso zzso zzso zzso and significantly longer zzso zzso recovery times, suggesting compromised zzso activity compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested depressed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso preparations similarly showed lower mean intrinsic heart rates and overall slower zzso through the SAN to the surrounding atrium than did zzso zzso Computer simulations of both single SAN cells as well as two-dimensional zzso models could reproduce the experimental observations of impaired zzso and zzso zzso in terms of changes produced by both zzso tail and reduced total zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso long zzso syndrome type 3 zzso zzso cardiac system, in overlap with corresponding features reported in zzso zzso channel zzso shows compromised SAN zzso and zzso function zzso in modeling studies through a combination of zzso tail and reduced peak zzso zzso
