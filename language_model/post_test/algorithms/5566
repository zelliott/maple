Traditionally, zzso zzso Design zzso uses zzso search and mathematical programming to tackle the molecular design zzso But these techniques do not handle large and zzso search space very zzso To overcome these zzso zzso evolutionary zzso zzso have been proposed to evolve molecular design by mimicking chemical reactions on the exchange of chemical bonds and components between zzso For these zzso to perform their tasks, known molecular zzso which can serve as building blocks for the molecules to be zzso and known chemical rules, which govern chemical combination between different zzso have to be introduced before the evolutionary process can take zzso To automate molecular design without these constraints, this paper proposes an zzso called zzso Algorithm for zzso Design zzso zzso encodes molecular designs in zzso It uses a novel crossover operator which does not require known chemistry rules known in advanced and it uses a set of novel zzso zzso zzso uses zzso and zzso approaches to handle different size of zzso and the value of the fitness function it uses is made to depend on the property zzso of the design zzso in a molecular zzso It has been tested with different data sets and has been shown to be very zzso
