Pixel zzso in which the incident light at a zzso causes one of the color channels of the camera sensor to respond at its maximum value, can produce zzso artifacts in digital color zzso We present a zzso zzso that estimates what the saturated channel's value would have been in the absence of zzso The zzso uses the zzso responses from the other color channels, together with a zzso normal prior that captures the correlation in response across color zzso The prior may be estimated directly from the image data, since most image zzso are not zzso Given the prior and the responses of the zzso channels, the zzso returns the optimal expected mean square estimate for the true zzso zzso of the zzso to the case in which more than one channel is saturated are also zzso Both simulations and examples with real images are presented to show that the zzso is zzso
