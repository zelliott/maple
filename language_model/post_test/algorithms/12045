A zzso model of an zzso zzso zzso has been developed to determine the absorbed dose delivered to soft tissue during systemic zzso of zzso zzso zzso to soft tissue from zzso distributed in bone were calculated using zzso general cavity zzso A correction term was used to account for the absence of charged particle equilibrium within the zzso zzso zzso doses for zzso zzso zzso and zzso were calculated for several zzso realistic zzso zzso zzso cavity weighting factor was greatest for higher energy zzso and it decreased as the soft tissue cavity size zzso The correction for the absence of charged particle equilibrium also decreased with soft tissue zzso but increased with average bone zzso zzso to soft tissue cavities ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso to zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso Using the factors calculated in this work, the dose to soft tissue cavities within bone zzso can be calculated when the dose to adjacent bone has been determined, perhaps by zzso or electron zzso resonance zzso The doses calculated with this more accurate model of bone zzso demonstrate errors of zzso to 50% in previous calculations of the average dose to homogeneous zzso zzso
