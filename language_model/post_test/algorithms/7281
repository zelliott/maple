zzso zzso zzso is a common disease among zzso infants with an occurrence of zzso in those born at less than 35 weeks zzso zzso zzso at risk of zzso are monitored by conventional zzso ultrasound zzso for zzso and potential zzso zzso Compared to zzso US relying on linear zzso from a single slice and visually estimates to determine zzso zzso zzso US can provide zzso zzso zzso more sensitive to zzso changes in zzso zzso In this work, we propose a global zzso surface evolution approach to the zzso of the lateral zzso in zzso zzso with zzso The proposed zzso approach makes use of convex zzso technique in combination with a zzso shape zzso We show that the introduced challenging zzso zzso problem can be solved globally by means of convex zzso In this regard, we propose a coupled continuous zzso model, which derives a new and efficient dual based algorithm, that can be implemented on zzso to achieve a zzso in zzso zzso demonstrate the advantages of our approach in both accuracy and zzso To the best of our knowledge, this paper reports the first study on zzso zzso of lateral zzso in zzso with zzso from zzso US zzso
