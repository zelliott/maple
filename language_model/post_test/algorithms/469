Numerous biological zzso such as interactions between T cell receptors or zzso with zzso interactions between zzso and zzso or interactions between predators and prey are often not strictly zzso In such less specific, or zzso systems, referred to here as zzso systems, a given unit of a diverse resource zzso zzso zzso zzso is at risk of being recognized and consumed by multiple consumers zzso zzso zzso In this study, we model generalized zzso zzso systems of zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso systems of zzso there is a zzso of types of consumer and resource based on variation of a single trait zzso or zzso The consumers experience competition for a zzso of resource zzso This zzso interaction system is modeled with partial zzso equations and shows spontaneous zzso of the consumer population that depends on the degree of interaction zzso between resource and consumer, but does not mirror the distribution of zzso We also show that the classical zzso zzso zzso single population model can be generalized to a zzso model, which shows qualitative behavior similar to that in the zzso zzso zzso These results provide better insight into the dynamics of selective systems in biology, suggesting that adaptation of zzso zzso is not a simple zzso of the environment by the zzso elements of zzso
