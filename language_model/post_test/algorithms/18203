In the present contribution we propose two recently developed zzso zzso for the analysis of zzso zzso supervised neural gas and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso are inherently zzso which is recommended, for these spectral data because of its high zzso and the zzso for specific zzso The zzso are both zzso such that the principle of characteristic zzso is zzso This leads to an easy interpretation of the generated zzso zzso Further, the zzso zzso map is able to process uncertainty in data, and zzso results can be obtained as fuzzy zzso Moreover, this fuzzy zzso together with the property of zzso mapping offers the possibility of class similarity zzso which can be used for class zzso We demonstrate the power of both methods for two exemplary examples: the zzso of bacteria zzso zzso and zzso and zzso cell populations in breast cancer tissue zzso
