We present a novel zzso technique using zzso and zzso zzso This zzso method has been demonstrated using a tissue phantom to have high zzso resolution and temperature zzso Because both zzso and zzso signal zzso depend on the temperature of the source object, the signal zzso can be used to monitor the zzso A temperature sensitivity of zzso degrees C was obtained at a zzso resolution as short as 2 zzso taking the average of 20 zzso The zzso imaging capability of this technique can potentially lead us to in zzso temperature monitoring in zzso or zzso zzso
