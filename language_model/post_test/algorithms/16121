zzso zzso zzso zzso monitors estimate the zzso pressure using zzso signal processing and zzso Hence each zzso accuracy must be clinically zzso zzso may assist the zzso but their ability to do so has not been zzso 

To investigate whether zzso can detect systematic differences between zzso zzso 

We tested whether a simulator can distinguish between the two different zzso available in a particular zzso detect zzso errors and detect systematic differences between monitors that are observed zzso 

Simulator evaluation correctly detected zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso differences between the two zzso zzso zzso (with specified 2 and 5 zzso zzso but found no difference between their mean zzso pressures (as expected from the zzso Simulator evaluations detected zzso adjustments at zzso zzso and zzso zzso Simulator and clinical comparisons of two devices of the same type recording slightly different blood pressures were in close agreement, but simulator and clinical comparisons of three different models zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not consistently in zzso The zzso generated zzso pulse shapes different from zzso zzso 

The results suggest that, although zzso can reveal systematic differences between devices of the same model, they cannot be used to detect systematic differences between different zzso zzso This could be at least partly because the zzso zzso generated by the zzso are dissimilar to zzso recorded zzso
