Since a milestone work on zzso zzso B, zzso zzso has strongly enhanced the identification of vaccine candidates by replacing several experimental tasks using in zzso prediction zzso These steps have allowed scientists to face the selection of zzso from the predicted zzso of zzso for which cell culture is difficult or impossible, saving time and zzso However, this good example of zzso zzso can be further developed by improving in zzso steps and implementing zzso zzso 

We introduce zzso (New zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso software environment for the in zzso identification of the best vaccine candidates from whole zzso of bacterial zzso The software zzso multiple robust and well-known zzso for protein analysis and zzso zzso candidates are ranked and presented in a html table showing relevant information and links to corresponding primary zzso Information concerning all proteins of the analyzed zzso is not deleted along selection steps but rather flows into an zzso database for further mining and zzso 

After learning from recent years' works in this field and zzso a large zzso zzso has been implemented and tuned as the first available tool able to rank a restricted pool zzso zzso of the whole zzso of vaccine candidates and to show high recall zzso zzso of known protective zzso These vaccine candidates are required to be zzso zzso into account zzso zzso and zzso for further zzso zzso screening (avoiding possibly not soluble zzso zzso is expected to help save time and money in vaccine design and is available as an additional file with this zzso updated versions will be available at zzso
