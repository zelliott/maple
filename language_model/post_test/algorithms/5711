The energy loss in zzso solar cells calculated from the energy difference between the lowest electronic transition of the dye and the obtained zzso zzso is often 1 zzso or even zzso To minimize this loss, it is important to accurately determine the energy alignment at the zzso zzso In this study, we compared the results from zzso and zzso zzso for determining the energy alignment of three zzso zzso two of which absorb relatively far in the zzso The trends observed with the methods were different, as in the former, the energy alignment is measured relative to an external reference and includes contributions from zzso reorganization zzso while in the latter, it is measured relative to the zzso of the zzso and is lacking such zzso The influence of the zzso zzso moments on the zzso of the zzso was also measured and explained some of the differences in zzso Finally, we compared the injection efficiencies of the two zzso zzso and found that the differences in injection efficiencies can be better explained using the energy alignment determined from zzso zzso This shows that the method for measuring the zzso of a zzso should be chosen according to what process one intends to zzso
