Dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso is a valuable imaging zzso to assess zzso properties, particularly in zzso by zzso zzso parameters from the evolution of zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, this requires a registration of the whole sequence of volumes, which is challenging especially when the patient zzso zzso In this paper, we propose a zzso fast and automatic method to address this zzso As standard iconic registration methods are not robust to contrast zzso we rather rely on the zzso of the organ of zzso This zzso is performed jointly with the registration of the sequence within a novel zzso zzso Our approach is based on implicit template zzso that we extend to a zzso zzso which provides as zzso both a zzso of the organ of interest in every image and zzso transformations for the whole zzso The proposed method is validated on 15 zzso acquired from patients with zzso zzso and shows improvement in terms of registration and zzso of zzso parameters over the state-of-the-art zzso
