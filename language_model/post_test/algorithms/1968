Total body zzso zzso with zzso zzso beams has been accepted as an important component of management for a number of zzso zzso generally as part of bone zzso conditioning zzso The purpose of this paper is to present and discuss the zzso zzso technique, which both zzso the treatment process and improves the treatment zzso 

An zzso zzso treatment technique to produce uniform dose zzso using sequential zzso reductions during each fraction was zzso and a sample calculation zzso is zzso Using this methodology, the zzso characteristics of both 6 and 18 zzso zzso beams, including lung dose under zzso blocks was zzso A method of zzso zzso lung doses based on measured entrance and exit doses was proposed, and the estimated results were compared with zzso 

Whole body zzso dose uniformity of zzso was achieved with no more than two zzso beam zzso The proposed model predicted zzso lung doses zzso to zzso higher than the measured doses for 6 and 18 zzso zzso The estimated total zzso doses were within zzso of the prescribed zzso dose on average except for the lungs where the doses were zzso to zzso lower than the prescribed dose on zzso 

The proposed zzso technique can achieve dose uniformity within zzso This technique is easy to implement and does not require complicated zzso and/or zzso
