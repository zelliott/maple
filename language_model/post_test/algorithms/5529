The first zzso of the total energy with respect to nuclear coordinates (the energy zzso in the zzso molecular zzso zzso method is applied to second order zzso zzso theory zzso resulting in the zzso zzso of the correlation energy in the external zzso zzso zzso The completely zzso energy zzso equations are formulated at the zzso zzso Both for molecular clusters zzso and a system with fragmentation across zzso bonds, a capped zzso zzso the zzso zzso energy zzso with the zzso zzso approximation are shown to be complete and accurate by comparing them with the corresponding zzso zzso The developed zzso is zzso with the parallel efficiency of about zzso on 32 zzso zzso connected by zzso zzso
