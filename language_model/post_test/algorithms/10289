Complex zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso more uniform in persistent longstanding as compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso It was hypothesized that this may result from a greater degree of zzso in zzso patterns at disparate left zzso zzso sites in longstanding zzso 

zzso were obtained from recording sites outside the 4 pulmonary vein zzso zzso and at a zzso and an anterior LA site during zzso and longstanding persistent zzso (10 patients each, 120 sequences zzso To zzso zzso in zzso the dominant frequency was measured from ensemble zzso using zzso zzso and zzso was calculated by 2 novel zzso linear prediction and zzso reconstruction zzso Lower prediction and reconstruction errors were considered indicative of increasing zzso and decreasing zzso In patients with zzso zzso zzso pattern zzso was significantly lower zzso zzso at zzso sites outside zzso zzso as compared with LA free wall sites zzso zzso zzso In longstanding zzso zzso increased outside the zzso zzso especially outside the left superior zzso zzso and diminished at the LA free wall zzso The result was that in persistent zzso there were no significant zzso differences in zzso zzso at the selected LA locations used in this zzso Average dominant frequency magnitude was zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and higher in longstanding zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the frequency of local zzso approaching a common upper bound for all zzso 

In zzso zzso zzso zzso is low and randomness high outside the zzso particularly the left superior zzso As evolution to persistent longstanding zzso occurs, zzso zzso becomes more zzso distributed at disparate sites, possibly signifying an increasing number of drivers from remote zzso
