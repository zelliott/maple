To evaluate the effects of zzso zzso response errors on mean zzso zzso pattern standard zzso zzso glaucoma zzso test zzso and test duration in the zzso Field zzso zzso zzso Swedish zzso zzso Algorithm zzso Carl zzso zzso zzso Dublin, zzso 

Five individuals with glaucoma zzso 52, 63, 69, 77, and 78 zzso and five individuals with normal, healthy eyes zzso 25, 34, 43, 45, and 52 zzso participated in the zzso Each subject was experienced in automated zzso and performed zzso zzso baseline zzso zzso zzso visual field zzso In addition, normal subjects completed zzso zzso field examinations in which known zzso of zzso error were introduced zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Likewise, the subjects with glaucoma completed visual field examinations with zzso zzso and zzso error introduced during the zzso 

zzso zzso errors were significantly lower than the introduced frequency of zzso The zzso zzso more accurately identified zzso errors when the MD and zzso zzso from zzso Test duration increased as introduced error zzso zzso The zzso zzso analyses indicated that two thirds of the tests with introduced errors produced a zzso zzso 

zzso II zzso zzso patients' zzso zzso particularly among normal zzso High zzso error zzso can have adverse effects on MD and zzso leading clinicians and researchers to an inaccurate determination of the amount and severity of visual field zzso
