In conventional research, zzso particles grafted with zzso DNA are allowed to zzso and then the resulting crystal structures are zzso Although this zzso approach is useful for a zzso understanding of the factors governing zzso it does not allow one to a zzso design zzso zzso that will assemble into desired zzso Here we address precisely this design issue, and present an zzso validated evolutionary zzso methodology that is not only able to reproduce the original phase zzso detailing regions of known zzso but is also able to zzso several previously zzso zzso Although experimental validation of these structures requires further work, our early success encourages us to propose that this genetic zzso methodology is a promising and rational zzso paradigm with broad potential zzso
