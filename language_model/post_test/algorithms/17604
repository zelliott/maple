zzso of zzso proteins with zzso identity to a given target zzso zzso is routinely performed with alignment zzso that take advantage of sequence zzso In this article, we investigate the efficacy of different alignment procedures for the task at hand on a set of 185 protein pairs with similar structures but zzso zzso zzso based on the zzso label detection and zzso scores are adopted to score the zzso We investigate the efficacy of alignments based on zzso zzso and zzso zzso We confirm that with zzso alignments the results are better than with other zzso In addition, we report, and this is novel, that the selection of the results of the zzso alignments can be improved by using Shannon zzso indicating that this zzso is important to recognize good zzso alignments among a plethora of meaningless zzso By this, we enhance the global search accuracy without losing sensitivity and filter out most of the erroneous zzso We also show that when the zzso filtering is adopted, the quality of the resulting alignments is comparable to that zzso for the target and template structures with zzso a structural alignment zzso
