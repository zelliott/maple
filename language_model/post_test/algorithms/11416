In recent years, Random Network zzso zzso has emerged as a promising solution for efficient zzso zzso video zzso over the zzso This probably refers to this fact that zzso noticeably increases the error resiliency and zzso of the zzso However, high transmission overhead arising from sending large zzso zzso as zzso has been the most important challenge of the zzso Moreover, due to employing the zzso elimination method, considerable zzso complexity can be imposed on peers in decoding the zzso blocks and checking linear dependency among the zzso zzso In order to address these challenges, this study introduces zzso which is a random network coding based framework for efficient zzso video zzso The zzso includes a novel zzso zzso generation method so that there is no linear dependency in the generated zzso zzso Using the proposed zzso each peer encapsulates one instead of zzso zzso entries into the generated zzso packet which results in very low transmission zzso It is also possible to obtain the zzso zzso zzso using a bit number of simple zzso zzso In this regard, peers sustain very low zzso zzso As a result, the zzso permits random network coding to be more efficient in zzso video streaming zzso The results obtained from simulation using zzso show that it substantially zzso the zzso which uses the zzso elimination method by providing better video quality on peers in terms of the four important performance metrics including video zzso dependency zzso zzso delay and zzso zzso zzso
