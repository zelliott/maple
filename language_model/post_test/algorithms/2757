The Yellowstone National Park zzso zzso is 1 of only 2 populations known to have continually persisted on their current landscape since pre-Columbian zzso Over the last century, the census size of this zzso has zzso from around 100 individuals to over zzso zzso Previous studies involving zzso tooth wear, and zzso timing provide evidence of at least 2 distinct groups of zzso within Yellowstone National zzso To better understand the biology of Yellowstone zzso we investigated the potential for limited gene flow across this population using zzso zzso zzso zzso Two genetically distinct and clearly defined zzso were identified based on both zzso diversity and zzso zzso zzso cluster assignments were highly correlated with sampling locations for a zzso of live capture zzso Furthermore, a comparison of the cluster assignments to the 2 principle winter cull sites revealed critical differences in migration patterns across zzso The 2 Yellowstone zzso display levels of differentiation that are only slightly less than that between populations which have been geographically and reproductively isolated for over 40 zzso The identification of cryptic population subdivision and genetic differentiation of this magnitude highlights the importance of this biological phenomenon in the management of wildlife zzso
