zzso significant zzso expressed genes of a disease can help understand the disease at the zzso zzso A zzso statistical model named zzso zzso zzso process zzso is developed under a zzso framework for a zzso zzso problem using zzso gene expression zzso Specifically, based on a zzso zzso zzso setting, an zzso zzso zzso with a zzso structure is designed to find appropriate featuring zzso to discover potentially significant zzso and to make optimal zzso class zzso A Gibbs zzso is adopted as the core of the zzso to perform zzso zzso A zzso procedure is implemented to alleviate the zzso zzso The simulated examples show that zzso performed very close to the zzso bound and outperformed the referred state-of-the-art methods in a linear case, a zzso case, and a case with a zzso training zzso Its zzso has great promises to problems that zzso methods become zzso The zzso was also applied to four published real zzso data sets and it was very effective for identifying significant zzso expressed genes and predicting classes in all of these data zzso
