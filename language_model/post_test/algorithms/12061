zzso per monitor unit in zzso fields generated by clinical linear zzso can be affected by the zzso radiation into the monitor chamber from zzso zzso Thus, it is necessary to account for the zzso radiation in computing monitor unit setting for a treatment zzso In this work, we investigated effects of the zzso from zzso jaws based on zzso Carlo simulations of a clinical linear zzso The zzso radiation scored within the monitor chamber was identified as originating either from the upper jaws zzso zzso or from the lower jaws zzso zzso From the results of zzso Carlo simulations, ratios of the zzso dose caused by the zzso to the dose caused by the forward radiation, zzso were modeled as functions of the individual X and Y jaw zzso The amount of the zzso radiation for any field setting was then zzso as a compound contribution from both the X and Y zzso The dose ratios of zzso were then used to calculate the change in zzso output caused by the zzso zzso zzso of these calculations were compared with available measured data based on counting the electron zzso or charge from the electron target of an zzso Data from this study showed that the zzso radiation contributes approximately zzso to the zzso zzso A majority of the zzso radiation comes from the upper zzso which are located closer to the monitor zzso The amount of the zzso decreases approximately in a linear fashion with the jaw zzso This results in about a zzso increase of zzso output from a 10 zzso zzso 10 zzso field to a 40 zzso zzso 40 zzso zzso The zzso location of the jaw opening does not have a significant effect on the magnitude of the zzso The zzso effect is significant for monitor chambers using zzso windows, particularly for treatment fields using moving zzso zzso the zzso correction improves the accuracy of zzso calculation using a zzso dose calculation zzso such as the zzso zzso
