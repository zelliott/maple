zzso mapping is an important step in the study of any zzso An accurate genetic map is extremely valuable for locating genes or more generally either qualitative or quantitative trait zzso zzso This paper presents a new approach to two important problems in genetic zzso automatically ordering markers to obtain a zzso maximum likelihood map and building a zzso maximum likelihood map using pooled data from several zzso The approach is embodied in an hybrid zzso that mixes the statistical zzso zzso zzso with local search techniques which have been developed in the artificial intelligence and operations research zzso An efficient zzso of the zzso zzso provides maximum likelihood zzso zzso while the local search techniques look for orders that maximize this maximum zzso The specificity of the approach lies in the neighborhood structure used in the local search zzso which has been inspired by an zzso between the marker ordering problem and the famous traveling salesman zzso The approach has been used to build joined maps for the zzso zzso zzso and on random pooled data zzso In both cases, it compares quite favorably with existing zzso as far as maximum likelihood is considered as a significant zzso
