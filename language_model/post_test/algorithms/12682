An zzso for zzso and thickness measurement of the zzso basement zzso zzso in electron zzso kidney images is zzso zzso in zzso and variations between zzso and other components in the image are zzso zzso of extreme zzso such as the black area of blood cells and white areas of urinary spaces are zzso Areas of sharp edges are either at the zzso borders or unrelated to zzso zzso These zzso sharp edges, along with the zzso regions, are used as barriers limiting the size of the fitting circles centered at a location in the image domain to form a two-dimensional function, zzso to the radius of the largest fitting circle, at the zzso A local peak in the radius function zzso to the largest circle in the local zzso The set of the combined zzso in two perpendicular directions is calculated before a thinning procedure is zzso After removing the unwanted zzso a zzso of the zzso is zzso The zzso of the zzso is then straightforward from expanding each point in the zzso to a circle of radius defined by the radius zzso The average of the diameters of the circles gives the average zzso zzso zzso of the real zzso images are zzso Visual comparisons from the superimposed zzso boundaries show that the zzso provides accurate zzso zzso The evaluations of the average zzso thicknesses are also compared to those from the manual tracing zzso
