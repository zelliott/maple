Previous studies done by our group suggest that partially zzso coronary arteries may generate sounds due to turbulent blood zzso To support these previous findings the frequency zzso of zzso heart sounds are compared before and after zzso zzso Since the low-level sounds associated with partially zzso coronary arteries are contaminated with considerable background noise, traditional zzso analysis may not produce accurate frequency zzso Indeed, in a previous study using the same data, no significant differences were found in the zzso heart sounds before and after zzso zzso In this study, three zzso methods zzso zzso and zzso have been selected to generate the frequency zzso because of their higher resolution, particularly in the presence of zzso Although the zzso method produced zzso zeros and could not be used, the other two methods produced zzso showing, in most cases, a marked decrease in zzso spectral components following zzso
