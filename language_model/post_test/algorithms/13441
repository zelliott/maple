The analysis of biological networks has become essential to study functional zzso zzso zzso is a tool to estimate zzso sets activity indexes using zzso zzso for biological networks zzso The zzso pipeline also includes one of the direct uses of activity indexes to detect altered gene zzso For this, the gene expression zzso of a gene set is zzso into zzso which are used to test differences between groups of zzso This procedure is performed with and without zzso expressed genes to decrease false zzso During this process, zzso also performs an zzso zzso zzso already zzso four decomposition methods zzso component analysis zzso zzso independent component analysis zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso six statistical tests zzso and zzso zzso zzso Welch and zzso several gene sets zzso zzso zzso GO and zzso and can be easily zzso Our simulation results shown in zzso Information suggest that zzso detects more pathways than zzso tools like David, zzso and zzso and less false zzso than zzso The output is composed of results from decomposition and zzso analyses providing a more complete biological zzso Examples provided in zzso Information show the utility, versatility and simplicity of zzso for analyses of biological zzso 

zzso is freely available at zzso The R package is also available at zzso
