zzso are present throughout adult life in zzso zzso and can zzso and differentiate into mature zzso according to the energy zzso An increasing number of reports demonstrate that cells from zzso lineages zzso and zzso and zzso share numerous functional or zzso zzso No large scale comparison reflecting the zzso complexity has been performed between these different cell types until zzso We used profiling analysis to define the common features shared by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our analysis showed that the zzso profile is surprisingly closer to the zzso than to the zzso zzso From these data, we hypothesized that in a zzso environment zzso could effectively be converted into zzso We injected labeled zzso cells isolated from mouse white zzso tissue or zzso zzso cell line into the zzso cavity of nude mice and investigated changes in their zzso zzso rapidly and zzso acquired high zzso activity and zzso zzso of zzso also expressed five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These values were similar to those observed for zzso zzso In zzso experiments showed that zzso contact between zzso and zzso zzso partially induced this zzso zzso zzso Overall, these results suggest that zzso and zzso zzso are very similar and that zzso have the potential to be very efficiently and rapidly converted into zzso This work emphasizes the great cellular plasticity of zzso precursors and reinforces the link between zzso tissue and innate immunity zzso
