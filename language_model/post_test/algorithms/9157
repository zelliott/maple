zzso are sensory zzso that, upon light zzso can be transformed between an inactive and an active zzso The conversion is initiated by the zzso of the zzso a linear zzso zzso followed by zzso relaxations of the zzso and the protein zzso that finally leads to the formation of the signaling zzso To zzso the underlying molecular zzso resonance zzso zzso combined with quantum chemical calculations constitutes a powerful approach since it allows determination of the zzso structure in the various states of zzso On the basis of these studies, a molecular model for the zzso reaction cycle is zzso
