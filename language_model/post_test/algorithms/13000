Typically, tuning zzso in motor zzso are constructed by fitting the firing rate of a zzso as a function of some observed action, such as arm direction or movement zzso These tuning zzso are then often interpreted zzso as representing the firing rate as a function of the desired movement, or zzso This interpretation implicitly assumes that the motor command and the motor act are zzso However, any kind of zzso be it zzso such as a zzso zzso or zzso such as muscle fatigue, can create a difference between the motor intent and the zzso How do we estimate the tuning curve under these zzso Furthermore, it is well known that, during learning or adaptation, the relationship between neural firing and the observed movement can zzso Does this change indicate a change in the zzso to the population, or a change in the way those zzso are zzso In this work, we present a method to zzso the zzso zzso zzso into the population of recorded zzso Using data from nonhuman primates performing zzso interface experiments, we show that tuning zzso based on these zzso directions fit better than tuning zzso based on actual zzso Finally, using data from a zzso interface learning experiment in which half of the units were zzso incorrectly, we demonstrate how this method might differentiate various aspects of motor zzso
