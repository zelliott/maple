The paper describes the zzso of choice of the threshold level of fluorescence, which identifies the positive and negative results of zzso zzso zzso when zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso agents of zzso zzso zzso are detected in the zzso of zzso The diagnostic specificity index of the method in detecting zzso of both types was zzso for the chosen zzso According to the time of zzso the diagnostic sensitivity zzso for zzso and zzso zzso were zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso
