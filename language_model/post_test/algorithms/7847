This paper explains the zzso principles which, according to us, govern the zzso zzso swarm zzso Then, this explanation is translated into a mathematical model, essentially based on partial differential zzso This model is then implemented using zzso methods of the finite volume type in order to make zzso The simulations show most of the characteristics which are observed in zzso and in particular the terrace zzso
