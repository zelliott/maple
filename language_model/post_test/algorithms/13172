zzso rotating turbulent flow is characterized by the emergence of zzso structures that are representative of zzso behavior of the zzso It is known that when energy is injected into the fluid at an intermediate scale zzso it zzso towards smaller as well as larger zzso In this paper we analyze the flow in the inverse cascade range at a small but fixed zzso number, zzso Several zzso simulations with zzso and zzso forcing functions are considered in periodic boxes with unit aspect zzso In order to resolve the inverse cascade range with reasonably large Reynolds number, the analysis is based on large zzso simulations which include the effect of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, we model the small scales and resolve explicitly the large zzso We show that the large-scale energy spectrum has at least two zzso one that is consistent with zzso zzso for the inverse cascade of energy in two-dimensional zzso turbulence with a zzso zzso and the other that zzso to a steeper zzso spectrum in which the three-dimensional zzso modes release a substantial fraction of their energy per unit time to the zzso zzso The spectrum that emerges depends on the zzso of the forcing function, the former solution prevailing for zzso in which more energy is injected into the zzso modes while the latter prevails for zzso zzso In the case of zzso zzso zzso the energy goes from the zzso to the zzso modes at low wave numbers, large-scale zzso is created, resulting in a time scale zzso associated with zzso thereby producing a zzso spectrum for the total energy with the horizontal energy of the zzso modes still following a zzso zzso
