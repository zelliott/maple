This paper presents a test strategy to detect interactive effects between several zzso using a DNA synthesis zzso zzso in zzso zzso The joint action of the zzso zzso zzso toxin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was studied in a tiered zzso In the first stage, the zzso were tested either jointly in a zzso mixture, or zzso At the highest dose level, the mixture showed a clear less than additive action of the zzso as compared to the effects of the five individual compounds, whereas at lower dose levels the zzso behaved zzso In the second stage, the zzso as established in the first experiment was further analyzed with a central composite design to detect interactions between specific zzso in the zzso This experiment confirmed less than zzso for five of the mixes zzso However, it also revealed four significant synergistic interactions between zzso Finally, two interactions that were established in stage 2 were further studied in full zzso designs involving two zzso One of the interactions observed in the central composite design was retrieved whereas the other zzso interaction was zzso It was concluded that several classes of zzso when present simultaneously in a mixture might show zzso The effect of the mixture cannot be predicted solely on the basis of the effect of the individual zzso
