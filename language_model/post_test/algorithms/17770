We have recently proposed and demonstrated an approach that enables the acquisition of zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso within a single zzso The approach is based on zzso zzso the zzso evolution along the indirect domain with the aid of a magnetic field zzso and subsequently decoding this information numerous times over the course of the signal acquisition while spins are subject to a train of zzso zzso The present paper discusses further considerations pertaining the zzso line shapes arising from this new way of collecting zzso zzso zzso issues that are hereby addressed include zzso the effects introduced by fast relaxation onto the spatial zzso process, particularly the line zzso and line shapes that will then arise in the frequency zzso zzso approaches capable of correcting for the zzso kernels resulting in these zzso cases, corresponding in essence to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso acquisition zzso zzso the enveloping characteristics imposed by the use of discrete zzso zzso on the zzso spectral zzso along the indirect zzso and zzso an analysis of the zzso characteristics of the methodology, with experimental zzso of theoretical predictions and an illustration of the zzso capabilities to analyze protein solutions in the zzso zzso
