Point process modeling of neural spike recordings has the potential to capture with high specificity the information contained in spike time zzso In zzso zzso zzso the neural tuning characteristic assessed from neural spike recordings can distinguish zzso importance in terms of its zzso with the movement zzso zzso it improves zzso and reduces significantly zzso in previous decoding zzso where models reconstruct the zzso from recorded activities of hundreds of zzso We propose to apply information theoretical analysis based on an instantaneous tuning model to extract the important zzso zzso for point process decoding on zzso The cortical distribution of extracted zzso zzso is analyzed and the statistical decoding performance using subset selection is studied with respect to different number of zzso and compared to the one by the full zzso zzso With much less computation, the extracted importance zzso provide comparable zzso reconstructions compared to the full zzso zzso The performance of the extracted subset is compared to the random selected subset with same number of zzso to further validate the effectiveness of the zzso zzso
